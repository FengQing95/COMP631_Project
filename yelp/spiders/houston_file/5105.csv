JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The server was a very jovial older woman (unfortunately I can't recall her name, but hopefully will see her again on my next visit) who laughed and joked around with both of us and answered any questions we had patiently with a smile. The wait for the food was not long at all, which is wonderful if you have a limited lunch break for work.
