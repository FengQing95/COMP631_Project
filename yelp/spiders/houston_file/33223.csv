Local Foods////So I was initially not a big fan of local foods despite all my friends loving it, but then something changed and now I crave it whenever I want a quick healthy meal. I'm a tried and true fan of the crunchy chicken sandwich combo and haven't veered off course yet. The sandwich comes on a delicious pretzel bread (which elevates the sandwich and is the best kind of sandwich bread in my opinion) and generous serving of meat- I often split the sandwich to yield 2 meals. My favorite sides are the kale (which is lightly seasoned with golden raisins and shredded parmesan) and the chips. You can get double of the same side if you'd prefer. The seasonal fruit I've had is typically oranges or watermelon- personally the watermelon has not been very good/flavorful and once I received bad oranges. I tried the quinoa once and was not a fan- found the dressing/onions too overpowering. I know many people enjoy turning the sandwiches into salads to get extra greens in.
