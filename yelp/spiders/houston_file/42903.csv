Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////A case in point is their Christmas Panettone. I waited months to purchase one after the lengthy articles I read on how Chef Sharvartzapel "learned from the masters" on how to bake this tricky confection.  I then sent this $40 Panettone (yes...$40 dollars) to my 88 year-old italian mother... who was weaned on Panettone.  She told me it was bland, fairly odorless,  tasted almost sugarless, and had the density of a brick.  Panettone should be light and airy, with a wonderful, vanilla-yeasty bouquet.  This thing was an atrocity.
