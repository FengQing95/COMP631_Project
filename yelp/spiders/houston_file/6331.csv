JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I came here around 7:00 on a weekday and was seated right when I walked in (table for two). Beautiful decor and friendly waiters. I ordered the spicy miso soup and it was delicious 5/5 along with an order of fries. I can't decide whether I like this place or Tiger Den (Chinatown) better but I am glad I found a Ramen place closer to where I live (only a 15 minute drive) vs driving to Chinatown (35-40 minute drive). It looks like this place gets busy around 7:30 and there is not much seating for a large group of people. I would recommend coming early before 7.
