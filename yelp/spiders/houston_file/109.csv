Uchi////Uchi is definitely not overrated and has some of the most delectable dishes we've ever tasted. Luckily, we had reservations, which I'd highly suggest making because there is a wait for a reason at this place. I had only been to Uchiko in Austin but never Uchi so when it opened in Houston, it was on my hit list.  The staff here is very attentive, knowledgable and you can tell they are really passionate about the food the chef creates. Our waiter allowed us to tell him what we usually order and what we don't like and then we left our order up to him...he brought us an assortment of both hot and cool tastings to start then we made our way through the menu with his guidance. Everything we tasted was amazing and since the menu is ever changing, you can't go wrong with what you try. I highly recommend the Hama Chili - it was so fresh, with a burst of zest  and hint of spice with every bite. The Walu Walu and Madai were both some of my favorites as well. To try something outside of the box, my husband tried the foie nigiri and to my surprise, he absolutely loved it.
