Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Tried it for the first time this last week. It is crazy busy on the weekends, so tried a Monday at 11:00 AM. It was still packed, but a much more manageable 15 minute wait. I had one of their benedicts, and it was awesome. The other guests had the huesvos rancheros and they even had a great quinoa dish for my vegetarian friend. Looking at the menu, though, it seems like the sweet pancakes are where the hype is for this place. Good vibe, and good service as well.
