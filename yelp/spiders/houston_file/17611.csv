Uchi////-Nasu nigiri - Sadly, probably my favorite thing on the menu. It's the most simple but delicious dish if you love eggplant. Imagine a perfectly charred, smoky, soft piece of eggplant brushed with lemon miso on sushi rice. It's perfection in one bite. And you get 2 for $3! I was guilty of getting multiple orders of this. It's that good.
