Baby Barnaby's////Fare: Affordable, cozy/comfortable, hearty, and rich. I thought the green eggs were scrumptious but too creamy for my taste, but the migas I ordered the next time were scrambles chock full of tortilla strips, tomatoes, and cheese. Note--Barnaby's also doesn't skimp on the taters. These are seasoned with a hint of cajun spice. Mmm.
