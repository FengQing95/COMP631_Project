Baby Barnaby's////My friend and i both got the green eggs plate and it was delicious!! I subbed my potatoes for fresh fruit and all of the fruit was sweet and fresh. The eggs were buttery and creamy. Perfect with the toast. The chicken applewood sausage had the perfect char and grilled taste to it! I'm not a sausage person, but this sausage was delicious! I tried the potatoes, and those were seasoned perfectly and were crunchy.
