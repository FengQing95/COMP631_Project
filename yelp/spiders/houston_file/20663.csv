Uchi////I had Uchi and Uchiko from Austin, TX and was so excited when I heard Uchi was finally open in Houston! I've been here twice so far and both experiences were great! They have complimentary valet parking which is behind Uchi. We were greeted by the hostess. They didn't seat us until our whole party was present. I have never had their "sushi rolls" but the entrees and appetizers are delish!!
