Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Great place to sit and chat with friends, but finding a place to sit can be hard on the weekends. Their caramel latte is one of the best I've ever had. The original croissant is pretty flaky but really soft and tasty on the inside, i'd definitely get it again.
