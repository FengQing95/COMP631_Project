The Pit Room////I'm a houston native that moved to LA and nothing compares to Texas bbq at the pitt room!! I came back home to visit and heard so many good things about this place! The BBQ was amazing and sides are good with lots of options! The indoor seating was spaced out but not much room inside. Highly recommend!!
