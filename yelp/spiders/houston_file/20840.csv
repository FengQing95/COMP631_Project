Uchi////Our 11 courses were: Hama chili, Hirame Usuzukuri, Salmon sake edamame (from Patrick), Whole fish, Madai Nigiri, Machi Cure, Uchivinche, Walu walu, Saki toro Nigiri. Basil Okashi and Peanut butter semifreddo (from patrick as well) for dessert. The peanut butter dessert was so so so good that both of us agreed that's our new favourite.
