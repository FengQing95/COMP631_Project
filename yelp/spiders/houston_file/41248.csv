Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We are lucky to have them everything I tried was great. The staff is adorable and very nice.Here are the couple of things that made me give them four stars...went there one day after they officially opened and they were closed at three.Went there twice two days in a row and they were out of croissants early in the day. It seems like they should have that down.Also,please do post hours and not be there.Other than that it is all good!!!!
