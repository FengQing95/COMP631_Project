Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Brunch perfection. There is not one single dish that we didn't like. With been to this restaurant is more than 20 times, and we always make it a point to try a new dish every time we go. I just wish they were lying is not always so long. But when it's just the 2 of us, we can usually snag 2 seats at the bar in less than 15 minutes.
