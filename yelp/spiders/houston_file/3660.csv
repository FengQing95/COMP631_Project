JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Service was fantastic for a full house! Our waitress was sugar sweet and on top of her game. She was beautiful too, to boot. Decor has dimmed lights here as well. Seems to be a recurring theme for late night restaurants in H-town. I like it. Very modern and city feel to it. The long tables for large parties are decked out with a river of medium sized glittery white rocks. They're so mesmerizing, I couldn't stop admiring them. I also like the small booths lined up along the sides of the walls. Looks cozy for two. Will definitely return fasho to this hot date spot!
