Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This past year, I've been traveling through France and the US tasting various bakery items.  And I was shocked out of my gourd how truly delightful the croissants are at Common Bond.  The basic, plain croissant was exquisitely layered, not over browned, and almost made me jealous not to live in Houston.  Do you all know how lucky you are to have this asset in your city?
