JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food has good flavor and excellent choices, although it wasn't my favorite. I prefer a good bowl of pho! The texture of the broth was terrible. I think there was corn starch or something of that nature to add some body to the broth. I'm a texture guy so it turned me off.
