Uchi////What a magnificent sushi tasting experience. I recommend sitting at the bar. There are sushi Connoisseurs that will provide feedback of the best sushi that is in season! Mackerel was the winter best at the time. Let me tell you something.. these guys know what they are doing. They will not steer you in a wrong direction. With a nice glass of wine and sushi from Uchi, there isn't anything better!
