Uchi////We had a birthday party for my sister-in-law with 14 people. I like sushi but only particular fish such as salmon, shrimp, spicy crab, and mostly cooked things. I was very excited to be adventurous and try new things. Everything we ordered, I tried and with the exception of one item, I enjoyed all of it. It was fun to trust a high quality restaurant to try new things.
