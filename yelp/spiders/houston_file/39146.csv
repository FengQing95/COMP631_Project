Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The place has several bars TVs and the crowd was pretty mixed. Very clean, nice restrooms and a dope patio area for days when it's sunny. I also noticed a small room to the right that appeared to be for private parties which contained a table, chairs and shelves of liquor. The customer service was great the bartenders were very attentive so I would definitely consider coming back when in need of a drink or to try their brunch menu.
