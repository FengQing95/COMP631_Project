Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I tried snooze for the first time today and was SO impressed. The WAIT sucked but the drinks delivered and the staff was cool. They also give out free coffee which doesn't hurt when your wait is over an hour. My friend got an omelet and I got the dish with the heaping pile of hash browns (can't remember the name but "heaping" was listed in the title). And we split a blueberry pancake. The pancake was delicious. Actually, ALL of the food was delicious. And I was really pumped about all of the vegan options. I had soyrizo and a tofu scramble! Our waitress, Spoons was DOPE. Super cool, super knowledgeable and made awesome suggestions. It's a couple of blocks from my place so I'll be back there until the staff knows me by name!
