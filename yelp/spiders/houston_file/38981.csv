Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Probably one of the best meals we have eaten in a long time. The atmosphere here is wonderful, they have a huge whiskey selection (no seriously, bigger than you're thinking of). I got the 12 hour short ribs and they were so fork tender is was beautiful, and the sides were great. She got the Sugar Barrel Steak and it was cooked to perfection. We split a side of the chefs french onion Mac and cheese which was a rich and satisfying savory side. The staff treated us quite well and we were able to meet the chef and the owner during our tour of the whiskey room. Would happily go back
