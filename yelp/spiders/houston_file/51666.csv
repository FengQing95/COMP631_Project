Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Walked in and was seated immediately. My server came right over and she was good- I could tell by her promptness, smell and swagger.; however, she still had to replace my silverware because my spoon was definitely not clean. The resturant is very clean and lively. The colors and lighting used gives the place life at all times. I ordered the Cortoda coffee espresso and it came in a shot glass -too hot for me to handle (I have delicate hands)My server got me a coffee mug and poured it into it. I was surprised that the it didn't reach halfway. It was strong-good and strong. I needed it for this morning.
