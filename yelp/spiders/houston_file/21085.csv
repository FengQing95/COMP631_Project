Uchi////My wife made a reservation for our Anniversary this year.  She booked through OpenTable, and of course received a confirmation email.  We arrived 30 minuted before our reservation time and were greeted at the front desk.  The young lady looked and looked but could not find our reservation.  Being an iPhone user, my wife promptly looked up her confirmation email from OpenTable.  In the process she also discovered an email that had been sent from Uchi confirming her reservation for another date, 3 weeks from that day.  Confused, she showed both emails to the girls at the reception desk and tried to explain that this was a special occasion.  Their response was, well you could wait, we should be able to seat you in 2-3 hours.  They made ABSOLUTELY ZERO effort to accommodate in light of what appeared to be a technical issue that originated with Uchi.
