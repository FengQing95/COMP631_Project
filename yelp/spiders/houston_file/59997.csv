Baby Barnaby's////Great place for breakfast or brunch. This may be my new favorite breakfast place in Houston. I had the eggs and ham and my wife had the green eggs and chicken apple sausage.  Both were delicious.  They have coffee in the waiting area so you can get your java fix while waiting.  Which is good because the wait can be quite substantial.  Sign in, grab a cup of Joe and get ready for a great meal.  Made with fresh ingredient including fresh cilantro in the green eggs which my wife just loved!
