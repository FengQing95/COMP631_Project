JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This was my first time at JINYA and I was very impressed. I have been craving ramen noodles since NYC and I absolutely loved this place. I sat at the bar and Kristine and Ruben attended us. It was the Best service we've ever had! They were so kinda and attentive, they made our first time experience spectacular, thanks guys!!!! Hands down.. If your craving authentic ramen noodle soup, this is the place to go.
