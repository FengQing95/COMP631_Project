Uchi////This was our first time at Uchi after living in Houston for eight years. So glad we tried it before moving away because the entire dining experience was certainly worth it. The staff were very friendly and generous to celebrate our graduation and even gave us a complimentary item. Make sure to cross this one off the bucket list!!!
