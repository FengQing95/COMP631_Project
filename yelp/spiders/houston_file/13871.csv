JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////But let's move on to the food. My ramen came with thick noodles, pork (forget the Japanese word), mushrooms (a special Japanese kind, forgot the name again), green onions, egg, and the broth of course. Everything was superb and really reminded me of my time in Japan. I didn't try any of their appetizers but they have a good selection if you're looking for something to supplement your ramen. Service was so bad however that it left a bad taste in my mouth, no matter how good the food was.
