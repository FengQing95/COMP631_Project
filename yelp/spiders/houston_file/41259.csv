Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I came to this cafe bakery shop and the service was horrible. Â I came all the way from Sugarland to try the croissant and the lady told me they ran out. However when I saw that they had stacks of croissant through the glass kitchen I was told that is for tomorrow. So clearly they don't make their croissant fresh and had plenty to serve.
