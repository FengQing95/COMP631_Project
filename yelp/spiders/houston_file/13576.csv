JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The wait wasn't long on a Saturday afternoon. My sister and I got a table immediately as we walked in. The seating arrangement is interesting. There are booths and tables on the side of the restaurant and 2 really long tables in the center. Our server greeted us, he was friendly, but it didn't seem genuine. The table wasn't properly clean and you could see residue of food left behind from the previous occupant. It was gross.
