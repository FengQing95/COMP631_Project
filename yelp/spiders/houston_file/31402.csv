Local Foods////I was originally super skeptical of Local Foods. It seemed a little too shiny and trendy to be good and I assumed it would go away pretty quickly... I was completely wrong. Local Foods makes amazing sandwiches and salads! I have yet to have something at Local Foods that was not amazing. It's definitely one of the best sandwich places in Houston!
