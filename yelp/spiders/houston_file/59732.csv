Baby Barnaby's////I love sitting inside and staring longingly at the fresh orange juice squeezer, the scent just fills the room and I love it. While they offer a solid breakfast plate... really how can you go wrong? The green eggs are phenom! My hubby seems to always get Annie's Burrito... perfect meal for a runner, he claims. We always take out of town guests here, and it never disappoints. You can tell the staff cares and they work hard.
