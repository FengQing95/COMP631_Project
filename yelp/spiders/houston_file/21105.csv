Uchi////I have been eagerly anticipating a time when a good commission check came through and I could give Uchi a try!  I mean, most of the reviews have been excellent and after watching Top Chef this past season, I was totally jazzed to have an incredible dining experience.  Maybe I don't have a sophisticated enough pallet, but I was not impressed - particularly for the price.
