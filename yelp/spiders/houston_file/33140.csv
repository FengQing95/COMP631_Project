Local Foods////I truly enjoyed this lunch spot. A friend and I came here and ordered 2 different sandwiches and shared halves so we could get a good idea of what this place had to offer. The chicken sandwich was my favorite. The pecan crusted chicken was light and flavorful, not deep fried as I had imagined it would be. The bahn mi was similar to others I've had, but this French bread was especially hard and tough to bite into.
