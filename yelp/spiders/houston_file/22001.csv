Uchi////We enjoyed the fusion of flavors and surprises that teased the palette. Starting with the 'Uchiviche' (salmon, striped bass sashimi with tomato, bell pepper and even slices of the green bird eye chili) this 'cold tasting' dish was refreshing to open one's appetite. Do try the 'nasu nigiri' (grilled jap eggplant with lemon miso, goma shio) on sushi rice. We loved the 'ham and eggs' maki which is the sushi roll with katsu pork belly and amazing yolk custard!
