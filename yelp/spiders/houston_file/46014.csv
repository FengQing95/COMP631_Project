Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Great desserts and has a very unique look to them. I tried the strawberry shortcake, which by the way, the look will fool you if you dont ask what is it exactly. It's really good though, but I wish there was more strawberries and shortcake to it. Kinda pricy for their pastries as well... The interior is very small and hard to get through... Tables and chairs are super close to each other. Wish they would expand to make it a more relaxed cafe. I haven't tried their lunch options, though I plan to someday.
