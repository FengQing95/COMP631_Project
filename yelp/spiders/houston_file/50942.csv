Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The menu variety gets a 5 from both of us. There's a lot of interesting items that you can't find elsewhere. The execution of the Chile Verde Benny was a 4. It was very tasty and unique, although a bit heavy. The waitress suggested the barbacoa, and my fianc√© liked the dish.
