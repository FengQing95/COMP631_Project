Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I honestly don't know what the craze is about Snooze. I'm be been here several times and the service is sub-par at best and the food is really nothing special.  I've had the egg and potato burrito which was A LOT more potato than egg, the corn beef hash which lacked flavor and the pancakes which were decent but then again if you can't make good pancakes, then you should def not be open for breakfast.  The only thing I'm really impressed with are the hash browns b/c they taste awesome w/a little bit of ketchup.
