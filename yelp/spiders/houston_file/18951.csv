Uchi////3. Bacon Tataki: HEEEEEAVEN. These fatty slices LITERALLY melt in your mouth. They're juicy and oily and all sorts of sinfully-scrumptious. Make sure you mop up some of that espresso fish caramel sauce! If there is anything you take out of my ridiculously long review, take this! This dish is a definite *MUST TRY*!
