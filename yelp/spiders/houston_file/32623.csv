Local Foods////The crunchy chicken, the shrimp and crab, the banh mi, the duck confit...I can't just pick one. They're all uniquely delicious. All of the sides are also very good. I'm a big fan of veggies and they treat them right. The chips are hit or miss, though. Special attention must also be paid to the desserts. I tried the butterscotch brownie months ago and still think about it to this day.
