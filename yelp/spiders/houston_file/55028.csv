Kata Robata////Lobster Mac and Cheese - little amount of lobster for what you pay. I thought it would have more but the dish was mostly just pasta. I'm pretty sure there were only 5 small pieces of lobster. However, it had a nice cheesy flavor with a mix of miso and seafood flavoring, which I enjoyed.
