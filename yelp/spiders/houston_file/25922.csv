The Pit Room////It was nice to find another BBQ spot in Houston. I was excited to see what it was about. I was in line getting ready to order some brisket but they ran out  and my heart sank but then he pulled one out of the back and I felt the excitement build up again. At first glance you could see a nice bark on the brisket. Once he cut it I saw a really nice smoke ring. I asked for moist as always and ordered a beer sausage and pork sausage which has jalapeño and cheese. Also got some macaroni and cheese with some potato salad. I finally got to the table and went to get pickles but these weren't your normal jar pickles which kind of disappointed me but they were still good. I finally got to admire my brisket up close and when I took my first bite it was kind of tough. I didn't expect that but the flavor was good. Usually the moist brisket I have just melts in your mouth so I'm wondering if I got lean. Both of the sausages were good with a nice crack in the casing once you bite in. The mac and cheese was really good and the potato salad better than other places. My gf got the brisket sandwich and the bun was nice and buttery. Service was great but I would still want to give the brisket another try just to make sure.
