Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Parking is pretty bad so be careful!! It's a one way small parking lot where the entrance is, but the exit is pretty steep, as well the entrance; very bad road. Scraped my BMW. We ended up driving out the entrance side instead of following to the exit. Aside from the horrible parking, there's street parking and other few limited options, so that's nice..
