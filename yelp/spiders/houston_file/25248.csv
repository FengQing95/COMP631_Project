Uchi////Is there a 6star option? I come to Houston every so often to visit family, and coming to Uchi is a must do every time. It's hands down the best sushi I've ever had. Every dish they serve is amazing. This is not a restaurant where you get big portions and it is upscale. But my greatest tip is HAPPY HOUR. It's more reasonably priced, you can try so much more with your table (everything is about one bite/ sharable). You won't regret anything you order (especially if you order the Brussel sprouts). I can't say enough good things about this place. It's an experience that everyone should do at least once.
