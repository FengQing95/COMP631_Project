JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Edwin - Wow, thank you very much. We are beyond grateful for such high praise. We receive a wide spectrum of opinions when it comes to the authenticity of our ramen, but occasionally we get positive feedback from folks who have lived in the island nation for some time. And these are the reviews that make all of our hard work and effort worthwhile. So on behalf of my entire crew, arigato gozaimasu, and we hope to serve you again soon.
