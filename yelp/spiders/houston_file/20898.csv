Uchi////The best sushi in town. Small portions and very pricey but worth it all! The fish is so fresh and everything is prepared so beautifully. It's quiet and has a nice feel to it no matter what day you go! The service is exceptional. I recommend the milk dessert it will melt in your mouth! And the ham and eggs roll.
