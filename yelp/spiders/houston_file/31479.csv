Local Foods////Ordered to go. Be forewarned the parking is a nightmare especially because of local construction. Ordered posole, crunchy chicken as a salad, Asian chicken salad and pastrami sandwich with slaw and chips. With the exception of the slaw all was fresh, tasty and devoured quickly. Don't know why the slaw was off putting-too much sauce and odd flavor. Pastrami had a kick my husband was't expecting but he liked it. Will be back but next time I'll walk
