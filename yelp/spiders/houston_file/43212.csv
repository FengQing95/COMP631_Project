Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Wow... I'm sorry, who are you all trying to serve? Yourselves or actual customers?? Your front of house really wanted to have the right answer, but whomever is running the show over there doesn't seem to get it. The counter staff were actually afraid of asking anyone with a sharp object to help them! Yeah, your croissants may be fabulous, but thank you, I'll go to the nicer people at Brasil across the street. And they're baked items are also very good. And who the heck designed your kitchen so you can't transition from breakfast to lunch??
