The Pit Room////Wow, can't believe it took me so long to come here considering how much closer this place is, and this whole time I would travel to Killens BBQ for my Texas BBQ fix. Don't get me wrong, I think Killens is still my favorite, but this place is a close second, and since the drive time is less than half, I will definitely be coming back here more.
