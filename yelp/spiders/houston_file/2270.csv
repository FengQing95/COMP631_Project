JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We have conducted our own field tests by preparing a bowl of ramen and taking the temperature of the broth after 3 minutes of sitting on the service deck. According to our data, after 3 minutes, the broth will cool to approximately 165 degrees Fahrenheit, which could hardly be described as "lukewarm." Therefore, as you can glean, it is imperative to me to determine how and why any of these mistakes occurred.
