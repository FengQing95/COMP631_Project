The Pit Room////The Pit Room lives up to its stellar reputation! The bbq is amazing (my favorite is the brisket and green beans)! The staff is always so nice and accommodating! Sometimes the line is long but it moves pretty fast, especially if you are with good friends. The Patio offers extra seating and a bar, which is nice because the inside of The Pit Room is pretty small. This is my favorite place to get bbq and I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone!
