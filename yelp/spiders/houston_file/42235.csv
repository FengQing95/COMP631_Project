Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////What they excel at is their croissants, breads and pastries.  Croissants are flaky, crisp and messy on the outside, tasty and tender on the inside.  Breads have a satisfying crisp, chewy, crunchy crust.  Although more expensive than the mediocre stuff you get at the grocery store this is well worth it.  If you have been to Europe and tried the local bakeries you know what I mean.
