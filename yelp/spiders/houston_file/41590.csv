Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////What a fantastic addition to the Montrose scene. I was really impressed with the his new place. The food was absolutely delicious and the staff was great. The only drawback was the line - because it is so popular. However, believe me, it i well worth the wait in line.
