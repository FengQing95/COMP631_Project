Uchi////Elegant, Superb! The Uchi empire always delights and impresses. The Porchini garganelli, beef cheek, uni bottarga and egg by chef Rob was SO good, we ate it so fast, I forgot to take a pic! Everything was perfect, such an experience. Â And Chef Rob and Kenji are the best! See you next time we are in Houston I hope!
