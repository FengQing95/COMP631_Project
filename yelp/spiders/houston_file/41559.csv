Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I am giving into the hype just yet. I came here on a Sunday afternoon (2ish) and waited about 15 minutes until I got my food. The owner, Roy Shvartzapel, is very friendly! Fiance and I didn't realize we were talking to him until after we got home and the fiance wanted to know what the big deal was about the pastry chef, and I Googled it. He gave us some advice on how to freeze our bread to keep it for future use. Please note that this is not a cheap bakery! It will set you back a bit. Lucky for us, our cashier messed up on our order so we paid $14 for the items below. =)
