Baby Barnaby's////Nice breakfast place, must get the green eggs... delicious. The wait is long but worth it. This isn't your classic southern breakfast but it is a nice classy breakfast place, a lot like a breakfast place you'd find in Los Angeles. Service was great, fresh ingredients and coffee. Friendly servers, nice atmosphere.
