Uchi////And then the finale was the dessert of fried milk, the much-hyped (here on Yelp) and absolutely dazzling dessert. What we liked most about it was that it was just sweet enough (but not too sweet), and the blend of the slightly warm chocolate milk cookie, the mound of corn flakes and the cold milk ice cream just about covered every flavor note. I am not exaggerating when I say that I licked that particular plate clean, literally at the end! I can hardly think of any dessert that I have eaten in the recent past that is as good as this one.
