Local Foods////The meal was so good and the atmosphere so enjoyable that I was plotting ways to get back to that area for more!  I highly recommend it, especially if you value local foods (some of which we saw being delivered in a huge cooler) and supporting the local economy.  And good food.  Definitely go if you love good food!
