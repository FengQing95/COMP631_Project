Local Foods////Truffled Egg Salad sandwich is probably one of the top 3 sandwiches I've ever had in my life.  If you want a blinding white atomic explosion of flavor in your mouth ;) HEYOOO, Local Foods has the bomb of a sandwich to execute that mission.  Like Oppenheimer and the Manhattan project, the chefs at this modern shop have created products that will change the Houston sandwich scene.  I've also tried the Duck Confit,  whose sweet cranberry preserves the succulent flavor of the fowl.
