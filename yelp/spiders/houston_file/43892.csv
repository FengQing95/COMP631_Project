Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The last item we had was the chocolate brioche. What this is, is a small brioche bun filled with what seems like just a dollop of chocolate ganache, and then glazed with some of the same chocolate. The brioche is everything you want it to be: eggy, buttery, and with some give. I think why this one is so effective though is because they resist the temptation to overwhelm you with chocolate. It's the perfect amount to make sure that the main star here is the brioche, which is certainly worthy of it, as are all their desserts.
