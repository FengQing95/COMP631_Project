Yes, they made it 'haute' and refined by just adding truffle oil. And that's the secret. I LOVE ME SOME TRUFFLE OIL. Be prepared for post-lunch truffle breath burps though (the most delicious kind). But it's not the usual egg salad that's heavy, no no, this is light and delicious... and melts in your mouth.
