JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm not a huge fan of the tonkotsu broth so I always get the chicken ramen. I'm not supposed to eat spicy food because my esophagus is a big wimp so I add just a little bit of the the hot sauce and seasoning to add more flavor. It's super good, I also add the ground pork and fresh garlic. This past time I went I got the shrimp balls which are also very tasty with the cheese in the middle
