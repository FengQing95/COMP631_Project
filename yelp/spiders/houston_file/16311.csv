JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been here a few times and honestly...I don't think it lives up to its hype, there are better ramen places to go to. That being said, it's in a busy neighborhood with a rowdy atmosphere especially on weekends, so you'll like it more if you appreciate that kind of surrounding.
