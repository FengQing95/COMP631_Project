Baby Barnaby's////Yes, yes, yes.  I love me Barnaby's.   Come early since they get busy.  Small outdoor patio space.  Free coffee while you wait.  Friendly staff.  I personally love the small dining space - retains the hole-in-the-wall feel even when their restaurant brand has gained full local notoriety.
