Baby Barnaby's////I came here with a couple of other first-timers, and we all went straight for the Green Eggs (thanks to Yelp for the recommendation), and it delivered big time. We agreed, though, that the eggs were a bit buttery and overloaded with cheese--making it runnier than the average scrambled egg--but it complemented everything else on the plate perfectly and was more than a well-crafted entree, in terms of flavor and balance. Â The eggs came with a perfectly-toasted slice of bread, lots of tasty roasted potatoes, and a couple of AMAZING chicken apple sausages (never knew sweet and salty could taste THIS good!).
