Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////@commonbondcafeandbakery THANK YOU!!! I had an oddly long wait for my DELICIOUS lavender latte.  I was engrossed in listening to "Caliphate" podcast (which I HIGHLY recommend) and enjoying my #kugelhopf so wasn't too miffed about the delay.  The on staff manager (I believe) noticed it was taking a long time for my #lavenderlatte to come.  I didn't have to say a word!  After confirming with me that I had not received my drink, she was able to get it straight away and gave me an additional box of treats AND comped my charge for the visit. Super amazing customer service that is really hard to find these days! I absolutely appreciate it! Thank you!       #coffee #cafe #commonbondbakery #htx #pastry #bakery
