Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It's very surprising in city the size of Houston, Common Bond is a rarity in great breads AND pastries.  There are very few bakeries in Houston that can boast as many different baked goods and do it well.  Perhaps this is why the bakery is packed to the gills on the weekends and consistently sells out on the more popular items.  Don't let the crowds deter you, turnover on tables is quick and the food is worth the wait!
