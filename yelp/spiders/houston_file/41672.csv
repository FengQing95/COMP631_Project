Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been wanting to try this place for months & I'm so glad I got the chance to! Beware, the line for Sunday brunch is ridiculous, but it is so worth it. The line went out to the street, but the employees worked quickly to make sure the wait wasn't too long. We ordered a chicken sausage roll & a chorizo torta for brunch. Everything was perfect and jam packed with flavor. I wasn't aware that the chorizo was going to be spicy, but it was a pleasant surprise. We also ordered several pastries. The almond croissant was perfection. Light, fluffy and the filling was very good. We also got the chocolate chip cookie which also had walnuts in it. I would come again for that over priced cookie any day. I am not even a fan of chocolate, but that cookie was one of the best I've ever had. The staff is very friendly and were constantly circling our table, making sure that our dining experience was pleasant. Definitely one of the best bakeries I have been to yet!
