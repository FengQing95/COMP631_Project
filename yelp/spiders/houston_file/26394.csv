The Pit Room////The place is small and the place gets crowded. The BBQ is flavorful and the portions are large. I had a brisket plate with mac-n-cheese and baked beans. I think they should cook the beans longer but they were full of flavor. The pasta was almost a soup. I usually like a thicker cheese sauce but without a doubt I ate every piece.  I was served two pieces of the brisket, a fatty slice and a lean slice (when I say slice I mean chunk!)  I would go back but it won't be a staple because the prices are quiet on the high side. Worth a trip here and there.
