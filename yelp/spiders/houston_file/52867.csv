Kata Robata////The restaurant had a modern, contemporary feel to it. I felt like this would be a good place to take a date. My order was ready in about 15 minutes. I enjoyed everything that I tried but nothing was the bomb. I'd really like to give them 3.5 stars cause it was better than just okay but not quite enough to make me a fan.
