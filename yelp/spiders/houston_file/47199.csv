Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So much hype about this place, but we couldn't get in on the weekend due to the 2 hour wait so I went by myself on a Thursday morning when it was less crowded. Valet parking only so I parked in the street next to the Walgreen's. The decor reminded me of a Mad Men episode which was kinda cool. It was pretty noisy even on a weekday.  My waitress was nice. I ordered 2 half orders of different Benedicts: the Chilaquiles and the Bella Bella. The Chilaquiles had barbacoa on  masa like cake topped off with a poached egg and the Bella had prosciutto slices on toasted ciabatta topped with a poached egg. There was a thin whitish Hollandaise sauce covering both of them. As soon as I took my first bite, I was met with the unpleasant feel of cold runny egg yolk. Huh? Was this cooked properly? Am I going to get food poisoning? The flavor was fine but that was disturbing. I think they just poach a bunch of eggs and dunk them in ice water so they don't get overcooked to save time.  I assume these eggs are not made to order.  The hash browns which came with it was in a tower which looked nice except that it made the majority of the potatoes undercooked and not crispy. Ho-hum. I had also ordered the flight of 3 pancakes. Those were a big disappointment. I got the pineapple upside down, blueberry Danish and peach cobbler. I know sounds delicious right? The actual batter of the pancake was bland, dry and crumbly, not moist and springy. Having had amazing pancakes from Kerbey Lane in Austin I know what good pancakes taste like and this was not it.  For these prices, $12 for the Benediict and $10 for the pancakes, this was so not worth it. I'm so glad I did not waste 2 hours of my weekend finding this out. I gave my waitress the standard tip but I won't be coming back. Go for the atmosphere but not the food.
