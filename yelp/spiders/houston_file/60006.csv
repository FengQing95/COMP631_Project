Baby Barnaby's////Such a surprising treat! We were in town to take care of business and had a 6 hour wait so searched yelp for a breakfast spot. On foot, we looked for something close but were willing to go a mile and a half for the right place. Barnaby's looked promising for two vegetarians so we braved the chilly morning weather and used our yelp directions to get there. It was a pleasant walk and warm welcome when we entered the door. Food was served hot, fast and delicious! I had the Green Eggs with veggie sausage and my husband had the Huevos Rancheros. All appetite pleasing!! Will definitely come back when we are in town again!!
