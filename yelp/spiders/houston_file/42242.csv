Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'm not that much of a coffee person, but my bff thought the cappuccino was awesome. I had the almond croissant, which was absolutely delicious (and huge). It was warm, buttery, and flaky with sliced almonds and sugar on the top, as well as a almond filling on the inside! My bff tried the chocolate brioche, (I think that's how you spell it?) which was like a pastry filled with Nutella and topped with chocolate. It looked super cute and tasted yummy!
