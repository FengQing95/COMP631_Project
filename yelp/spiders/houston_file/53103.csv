Kata Robata////5) Drinks- A standout drink is the cucumber high (cucumber and kafir lime leaf infused gin, rothman and winters creme de violette, a droplet of terra spice morello cherry extract, garnished with an edible orchid). Refreshing. Their other drinks are good, pretty strong, but the Cucumber High was my favorite.
