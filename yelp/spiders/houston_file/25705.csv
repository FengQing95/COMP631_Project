Uchi////Excellent meal from start to finish! We had a reservation for 2 at 4:30 and were promptly seated at a comfortable booth. The interior is contemporary with lots of warm wood accents. Our server, Sohan, was prompt and friendly. We each started with a Kara Kyuri cocktail, which happened to be on the happy hour menu. It was very light and refreshing, though the Thai chili gave it a very spicy kick. It is not for the faint of heart, so if you would prefer something less spicy, the Satsuma and Lychee Natsu are also great. The lychee cocktail was actually our favorite and is dangerously easy to drink. They also have an excellent and extensive list of sake.
