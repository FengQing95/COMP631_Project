JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For appetizers we got the spicy park tacos, sweet potato sticks and the Brussels sprouts tempura. The spicy pork tacos were very tiny, but according to my friends, very tasty. It comes with two in a plate and. The sweet potato sticks weren't worth the price and weren't very unique. The Brussels sprouts tempura was AWESOME! If you dip it in hot sauce, it's magnificent. It wasn't bitter, it was yum!
