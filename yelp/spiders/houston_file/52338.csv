Kata Robata////This place has some quality sushi rolls.  I love their rising sun roll with truffle oil and the tropical spicy tuna roll because of the mango!  My friend got the lobster mac and cheese with truffle oil and that was also very good.  There hh is decent also and they even have hh on Sundays for most of the day.
