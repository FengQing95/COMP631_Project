Uchi////I tried to book a reservation for my birthday when uchi first opened in houston. They did not have any availability for the party size I had. Since then , I've always wanted to try it but never could get a reservation on the day and time I was free. YEARS later I finally decided to walk in and wait since I had some free time today.
