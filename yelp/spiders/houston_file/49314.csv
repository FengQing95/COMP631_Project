Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is my first time in Houston. We stopped by here for a late brunch and the food was just SPECTACULAR. We had the OMG! French Toast along with The Snooze breakfast bowl. Everything with the food was great but the service was terrible. Carlos, our server was very inattentive and didn't check on us very much. Beside that I think the food was great. The environment and atmosphere is very welcoming and friendly.
