JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had high expectations for this place, because there was a whole hour and a half wait for dinner. But that's probably why I felt kinda let down. The ramen is good but the broth tasted oily. Service was good and quick during lunch time. This place gets super crowded on the weekends and around dinner time. So be prepared for an hour+ wait. Definitely try this place if you never tried before. But don't set high expectations like I did.
