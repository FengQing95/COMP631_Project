JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Me and my boyfriend first saw this place as we drove by one day. We decided to come eat here and fell in love! They have the best ramen! My favorite is the Tonkotsu black with an egg! The spicy chicken is also delicious!! Now we try and go at least once a month! I never new ramen can be so delicious. The service was awesome! Our waiter Hamzeh always takes very good care of us every time we go. They have a great atmosphere and we also have a good time when we go! I give this place 5+ stars!!
