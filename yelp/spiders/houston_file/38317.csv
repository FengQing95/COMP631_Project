Bosscat Kitchen & Libations//// were missing. Management graciously offered to comp the meal due to the lateness that it was "taking longer than usual". Just be honest, it was missed or forgotten lol. They're tacos made of flour, scrambled eggs, and pre-made bacon and sauce. The tacos were okay honestly. I may have expected like thick, caramelized pork belly, but it was just esssentially stewed bacon in this green tomato salsa type sauce.
