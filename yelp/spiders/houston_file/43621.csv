Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Given the headache that is trying to park in Montrose, wait in line, then try to scrounge up seats together for your party during peak times, I would only brave this again with an ample amount of time and a full belly save for the dessert compartment. Taking something to-go would also be totally reasonable.
