Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came here at 12 and hoping to get a table but they told us it is an hour and half wait. So, we decided to wait because my husband has been wanting to eat here. When I came back from my Starbucks run, I came back and asked how long is the wait. The person said that my name isn't on the list. Like wtf when I spelled out my name to her. J-A-N-A and gave her my number. So she told me text her and I did. Then she was like oh, someone put your name incorrectly. It was spelled Shiena. Wtf! She was the one that put my name in the system. So, she had to put my name in correctly. We are still waiting and I'm writing this review as we speak. It is now 2:28 pm and my husband asked them how much longer and they told him 30 minutes. Since we've been waiting this long what does 30 extra minutes do? Since supposedly they are closing they are closing in 1 minute at 2:30.
