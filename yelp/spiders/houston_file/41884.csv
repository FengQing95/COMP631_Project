Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We also ordered some pastries to go, which were commonly recommended by the other reviewers (I forgot the names) and they also were just okay when we tried them at home the same day. Overall the bread was not anything special at all and the brunch items were much too overwhelming to enjoy. I've had better bread from other restaurants and even from Asian grocery stores here in Houston such as the bakery located inside of 99 Ranch in Houston (which I DO highly recommend).
