Local Foods////Ambience: I like the style. It's a nice blend of big tables for groups or smaller options for grabbing a meal with a friend. Lots of nice natural light. I usually don't have a problem finding a place to sit, but it can be a little crowded during peak meal times... but nothing too crazy.
