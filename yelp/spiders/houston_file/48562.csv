Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I personally think this restaurant is overrated. I ordered pancakes - a simple breakfast item - and they have to l try to make it all difference and standout. Just wanted pancakes. Plain and simple. Customer service was subpar and prices are high. I could recommend a dozen other breakfast places to try. Go elsewhere.
