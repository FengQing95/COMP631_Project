Baby Barnaby's////now i gave this place 4 stars bc. i'm been here other times and everything was great. this particular time our waiter was not so perfect. he must have been in the weeds or something bc. he brought my water out with ice only and no water. and then just when i thought we would be getting our food he came out to tell my husband that they ran out of waffles and pancakes. so that's why my husband ended up getting the breakfast plate.
