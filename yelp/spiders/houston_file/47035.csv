Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I want to start off by saying I love the food. However the way they manage the wait is the worst out of any snooze I have been too. Every time I am there is at least 3-4 tables empty out side and up to 7 tables empty inside with an hour and half wait. When I asked why, they explained that they text the person their table is ready and give them six minutes to arrive. Then if they don't show they text the next person and give them six minutes. This cycle could go on forever but just two people don't show in a row that is 12 minutes of an empty table. Every time I go there the wait is around hour to an hour and half. To fix this is super simple text when someone is paying the bill and if you don't show since most people are waiting crowded inside and outside then if they don't show instantly text the next person. You would probably be able to see almost double amount people in the same time. I am hoping the managment in Colorado see this fixes this and then I switch to five stars cause everything else rocks. When I went to Austin it was 10 times more busy and no tables were ever empty.
