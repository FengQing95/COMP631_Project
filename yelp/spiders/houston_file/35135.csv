Local Foods////My bf and I went here on a slightly rainy Thursday evening and had a wonderful time. I got the Garden Sammie (a slightly different version of the Market Veggie they used to have) on a pretzel bun, and the bf got the Gulf shrimp and crab sandwich. Both the sandwiches were very yummy and the fillings came through in every bite :) :)!! As for the sides we got the watermelon, Tuscan kale, pumpkin seeds, and acorn squash. The acorn squash was something new and tasted delicious!
