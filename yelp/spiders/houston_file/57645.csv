Kata Robata////Enjoyed dinner here during a weeknight. The dining room was crowded but that's expected when the sushi is so great! Parking is in a shared lot, which fills up quickly. Highly recommend trying the dessert if you can... banana crème brûlée was my choice but I avoided the chocolate and berry cream topping because it didn't really mesh well with the banana and brûlée base...
