Kata Robata////I love this place so much that I am a regular even though I've moved out west and have no reason to venture into the loop. Lunch can be very busy, so be patient with the hard working staff. Of you want great service and a parking appt come after 1. Otherwise be prepared to wait around for both a spot and the best sushi and sashimi in town.
