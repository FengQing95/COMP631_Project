Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Despite than vastness of the restaurant and the mostly empty early Sunday evening, we were sit at a table right next to the entrance. Normally this fact wouldnt be a negative...but add in a super humid Houston day, and you get a gentle but uncomfortable slap of heat hit you every time someone opens the door. Which, btw, is more often since servers use the door to run food, etc to patio dinners.
