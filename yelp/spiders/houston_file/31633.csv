Local Foods////The best sandwich place that you can go to in Houston. It blows all the chain sub places out of the water. The ingredients they use are fresh and high quality from our local farmers. Even though the menu selection is very limited, all their dishes are superb! My favorite sandwich is the Crispy Chicken. Their portion is very big so you will get your money's worth. I have been here like 20 times. Love it every time.
