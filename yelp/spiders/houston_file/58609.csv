Baby Barnaby's////This place is beyond good. The service is wonderful and the food is extraordinary. It's a home cooked meal away from home. The server,Scott, is unmatched. He is friendly, fast, and informative...and pretty funny :). The wait seems hella long but it's worth every minute..and goes by pretty fast in my opinion. They also offer free coffee while you wait! Everything on the menu is worth getting. My personal go to is the breakfast plate(with sausage, potatoes,and biscuits). The potatoes are amazing and addicting...so be careful lol. Once you've ordered, the food is out in no time... Like, it's questionably fast..(did they know what I was gonna order?) nonetheless, everything comes out hot and fresh. And if you like orange juice you definitely have to get it. It's fresh squeezed right before your eyes...mm mm mm. My favorite breakfast place. Do it!
