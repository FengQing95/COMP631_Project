Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////After I discovered the name common bond BAKERY.. I was so excited. I love pastries! That's my weakness for sure. I'm always on the hunt for a good place to work from. This place is not that. It's more of a social cafe... which is great if you're meeting up with friends!
