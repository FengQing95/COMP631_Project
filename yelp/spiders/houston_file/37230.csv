Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////One little hiccup was that I ordered the Japanese Flight, but one of the three whiskeys was completely out, and another one couldn't even get a full pour out of it. So, I really only had bout 1 1/3 out of 3 whiskeys on the flight. Thankfully, that was comped on our bill.
