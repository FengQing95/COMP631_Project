Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Cute place but overpriced.  Lovely pastries. I previously gave good review on Croque Madame but am retracting it.  We were there this week, and the Croque Madame was terrible- jalapeño sauce poured all over it so you could not taste the delicate flavors in it like the gruyere.  Jalapeños are for Mexican restaurants- fine, but authentic Croque Madame never has jalapeños.  We were terribly disappointed and will not be back.
