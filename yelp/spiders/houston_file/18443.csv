Uchi////I went here for the first time couple of weeks ago with some friends for happy hour. I usually don't branch out of the normal places I like to eat at but I figured it would be a fun experience. Let me tell you, it was! My friends and I decided to order almost everything off the happy hour menu and our eyes were bigger than our stomachs because we weren't able to finish it all. My favorites were the Brussels sprouts and the ham and eggs. It was a little pricier than the places we usually go out to eat at but we had such a great experience that I'm sure we will try to make time to go again. The service was great, although I did think it was a little weird that almost all of the dishes were our server's favorite.
