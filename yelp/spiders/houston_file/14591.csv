JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////On to the ramen.  JINYA is known for their Ramen Tonkotsu Black.  The delicious pork broth consisted of: pork chashu, kikurage, green onion,nori dried seaweed, seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion, with thin noodles.   We also got it with extra noodles, so we can have more than enough when the kids asked for seconds (and they did!)   This was excellent!  The broth took me back to LA, the depth of the broth was quite good, intensely flavorful.  The garlic chips and garlic oil were not overpowering, but they really melded well with the soup broth.  The pork chashu was very tender and also contributed to the depth of taste.  The thin noodles were ok, we've had better. We also had their crispy chicken (chicken karaage) and salad combination added on.  This only comes with three pieces, so if you don't feel you will be satisfied get the  5 or 10 piece order.
