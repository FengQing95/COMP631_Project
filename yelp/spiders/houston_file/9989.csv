JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It's called "white" because the broth was half pork broth and half chicken broth. It came with the usual pork belly, shredded mushrooms, half boiled egg, chives topped with shreds of deep fried onions and thin noodles (some ramen choices come with thick noodles!) I also asked for fresh garlic (no extra fee) and a garlic press to add some extra flavor to the broth. In addition, I added some red flakes and some ramen seasoning that they had available already at the table. It was great! They give a lot of noodles compared to other ramen places I've been to, so it was almost difficult for me to finish the entire bowl lol.
