Kata Robata////We ordered: 72 hour Kobe Beef Skewers (MUST), scallop and foie gras nigiri, lobster Mac and cheese, chef's sashimi for two, and coconut tres leches cake. This may not seem like a lot but, by the end, we were struggling to eat the dessert! Everything here is always super fresh and tastes amazing. Definitely a place I'm willing to return to, just not too often since it does take a toll on your wallet!
