JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////If you want something lighter than their sprouting up ramen is a good choice. Plenty of brussels sprouts in your ramen. Some appetizers that good are the tempura brussel sprouts, taiyaki, and their mini salmon poke taco. However, I would skip the salmon sashimi. It had a mushy taste.
