JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////To end this rather depressing review: maybe I'll be back? Maybe I won't. I can't really say. Probably not, though, because midtown is not "in the neighborhood" for us. Tiger Den is much closer, and has a lovely Garlic Black Bean Ramen. Heck, Samurai is more convenient and just as new, but they've captured my attention more than JINYA has so you can probably catch us there.
