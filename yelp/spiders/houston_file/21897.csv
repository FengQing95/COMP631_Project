Uchi////The only soup they serve here is Miso, however it's not listed on the menu, so you have to specifically request it. I order the Shag roll, which is an 8 piece fried sushi plate with white aeole chili sauce and as squid ink drizzle. I was like WTF when I first saw it, but it's actually really good and filling. The iced tea brew was a little strong, but some water and lemon fixed that. The water served was unfiltered tap and not very cold, though. The menu is also quite narrow when compared to other Asian cuisine places; it's mainly sushi and booze.
