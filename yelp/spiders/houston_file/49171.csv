Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Loved this place. Walked here from our Montrose Airbnb after making an extended weekend after a conference. Y'all Houston people do not walk anywhere. The pancake flight were awesome. Your choice of any three. I almost tried the breakfast pot pie but went for an omelet instead. Food, service and decor were fantastic. Visiting from Atlanta and discovered this is NOT a foodie city. All the great places were breakfast or brunch. Even in Montrose and don't get me started on Galleria area.
