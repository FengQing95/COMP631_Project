JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I normally really enjoy this place, but it's gotten so busy that the food and service have suffered greatly, especially for to-go orders. I called an order ahead and was told I could pick it up in 20-30 minutes. I arrived at the 35 minute mark, thinking it would be ready, only to wait another 15 minutes. Then when I got home, I realized the "spicy" dish I had ordered had no spice at all. The broth was yellow as opposed to the red it usually is. The food is fine but don't come unless you've got a lot of patience and are willing to wait.
