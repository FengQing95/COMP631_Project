Uchi////Another tip is to make a reservation. However there have been a couple times we made an impulse decision to go to uchi, as long as you can get in the door by 9:59, they will seat and serve you. While waiting, there's a cool coffee and wine bar right next door you can wait at (both restaurants share a bathroom).
