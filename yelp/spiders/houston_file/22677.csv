Uchi////I have been to this place for so many times already and I absolutely love it here. I celebrated my birthday and also anniversary here. Make sure you get an appointment because it is always so packed here. The waiters and waitresses are always so amazing here and they always check on you. I usually order from their happy hour menu because that is a great deal. I love the avocado maki, the walu walu, both of the cure dishes are amazing, the egg plant (2 pieces) and so many other things. I have never had anything that tasted bad here, everything is just so delicious and that is why their reviews are great. Take advantage of their happy hour menu! You can get so full off of $50 for 2 people.
