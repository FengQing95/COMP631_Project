Kata Robata////Oddly enough this was my third restaurant of choice when friends and I wanted to eat out on a rainy Saturday evening. Our top two choices had a 45 min wait and Kata didn't have one when we called in advance. So I'm thankful for that. Our server was attentive and extremely helpful with food suggestions.
