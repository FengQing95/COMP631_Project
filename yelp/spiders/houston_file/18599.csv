Uchi////So why four stars? We enjoyed the vibe at Uchiko a lot better. Uchi is a smaller space and with the amount of people there it felt slightly claustrophobic. The service was polite and friendly. However, the clientele at Uchi Houston just felt very snobbish. In particular the lady sitting next to my fiancee and I took it upon herself to mock me for praying before dinner (but my fiancee caught her doing so). I guess it's unfair to judge a place by the patrons but it is part of the experience. It won't stop us from going back to Uchi though.
