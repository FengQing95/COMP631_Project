JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The Sprouted ramen was the dish I ordered. Really enjoyed the flavors and the broth. The brussel sprouts made for an interesting addition to the dish. I enjoyed the Bao as an appetizer. The seating arrangements are a bit crowded but I can appreciate that we are downtown. Waiting for over 30 minutes might be a stretch for this spot. We were given a timeline of 40 min but we got our table within 30 min.
