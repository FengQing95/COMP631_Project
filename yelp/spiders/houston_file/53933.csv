Kata Robata////Anywho, we ordered a wide variety of things for 3 girls including the kobe tacos (delish) as well as the shitake mushrooms (one of my favorites!), the pork belly (great, but too much bread for me) the rodeo roll (excellent) and the ceviche (which had a beautiful presentation, and fresh clean flavor!)  For drinks I had the martini with jalapeno which was really really good.  It had a perfect amount of kick, without blowing your taste buds out of the water.  The service was really, really good and very attentive, without being annoying.  I would have liked to see a couple of more creative rolls on the hh menu, but other than that it was great!  The best part of the entire meal, for ALLLLL of the food we had and 4 drinks, the total was $47+tip!  FANTASTIC DEAL!
