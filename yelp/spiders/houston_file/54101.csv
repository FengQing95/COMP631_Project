Kata Robata////I've been to Kata for happy hour, restaurant week and just a normal dinner and have always had a great experience.  My favorite drink is the crafted pimms with habenero - definitely spicy, savory and surprisingly cool/refreshing.  Although our waitress recommended I shouldnt eat the drink garnish, i went ahead... wasnt too bad.
