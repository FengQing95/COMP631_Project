Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This review is a lil late- we visited on 3/16/18 during Rodeo. Great spot for dinner & drinks! As a "new" Whiskey drinker, I asked for recommendations and our AWESOME, FUNNY, HELPFUL server- "ChOcOLatte" was THE !  He gave a great brand & drink recommendation- the BOSS CAT (with Basil Hayden). Perfect! I'm hooked. He made our night so enjoyable!  I, personally just shared some apps with a friend- the meat balls, and then an order of the fries. Another friend ordered the burger which he said was amazing.. Id love to go back next time I'm in Houston!
