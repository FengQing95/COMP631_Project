Uchi////Only hours after we made our reservation, we received an extremely rude voicemail threatening to cancel our reservation if we didn't call back.  There's a very reasonable way to ask for a confirmation (especially on a voicemail!), without being condescending to your guests -- every other restaurant is able to do it.  We loved Uchi and have dined there almost monthly since it first opened in Houston, but being a successful business doesn't mean you can treat your guests so poorly.
