Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////A wonderful place for breakfast with a friendly staff. I had the breakfast pot pie.  Flaky puff pastry with an awesome country gravy. Also came with house made hash browns.  Soo good. Sister in law had the shrimp & grits. Sausage had some bite but all and all good. The grits was very tasty and made me forget I don't like grits. The omg French toast was done well. And the pancake flight was all good. My favorite from the trio was the pineapple upside down pancake.
