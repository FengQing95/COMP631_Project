Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Service: Once you snake your way through the line, you're greeted by someone to take your order. After perusing the menu, I decided on a few macarons (most of the flavors were already sold out by late afternoon when I got there) and a raspberry pistachio tart, and a lemonade to quench my thirst. Lemonade was tart, just like I like. The macarons were a decent size for I think $2.25? I tried the vanilla, passion fruit and the raspberry pistachio macarons. They were all decent, the passion fruit was confusing, I couldn't decide if I hated it or loved it. The tart was good but overpriced at $7 but ehh I guess I expected it to be on the pricier end.
