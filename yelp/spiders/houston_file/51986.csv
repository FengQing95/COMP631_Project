Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Service was TERRIBLE. Took forever to get our drinks AND our food. We were hopeful that the food would be amazing and that all of the waiting and hunger would be worth it. WRONG. I have seen all of the reviews and was almost sure that this place's food would be Top Notch and was SO disappointed. Food came out cold and everything was so bland. We were so hungry we ate the food anyways and after.. waited over 20 minutes for our check and I had to go to work. Forgot to mention my family and I had the bubble guts from the food we were served after. Not a good way to go back to work!
