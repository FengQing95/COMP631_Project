Local Foods////Decor is fairly nice, sort of a pseudo-repurposed DIY aesthetic. Seating is roomy and the dining room is nice and open. The folks working behind the counter are nice enough and my food was delivered to me pretty fast. I didn't try any of their drinks, but I saw that their soda fountain uses craft brands rather than either of the Big Boys (Coke or Pepsi), which I always like to see.
