Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////As restauranteurs we're always looking for opportunities to improve. I appreciate all of the nice things you mentioned about our atmosphere/interior, drinks and service. Our staff is very friendly and caring of course. Thank you for highlighting that. When they asked you how the food was, I wish we would have known that you weren't enjoying it. We would have taken every step necessary to make sure we either fix it or find something else on our menu for you.
