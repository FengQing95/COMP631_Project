Kata Robata////I ended the meal with one of many delicious-sounding dessert options. My green tea tiramisu came with a small side of yuzu sherbet. The waitress told us that yuzu is a Japanese grapefruit - a very unique taste. The tiramisu was very good - topped with fresh blueberries and a Pocky stick! I hope this place makes it, but in this economy, the rest of the shopping center is pretty barren.
