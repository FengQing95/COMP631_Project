Kata Robata////This is my favorite sushi restaurant is Houston! The quality of their sushi is excellent and tastes very fresh, and there are many entrees that combine unique flavors to create outstanding dishes. The drink menu is up to par with their food menu, and their happy hour is one that is a must-try! This is an upscale restaurant, but so worth the splurge if you afford it.
