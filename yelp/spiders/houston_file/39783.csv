Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We went on to eat the Gold Medal Chicken sandwich and the Shaved Pork Chop Sandwich. I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken sandwich, however the pork sandwich was lackluster. It was soggy and wasn't all that flavorful, disappointing for how expensive the place is. Definitely going to try something else next time.
