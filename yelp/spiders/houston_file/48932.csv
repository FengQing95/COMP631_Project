Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Breakfast items are some of the simplest things to make, which is why IHOP and Denny's can afford to offer a lot of cheap, decent-tasting foods for a very good price. Yet, true high-quality breakfast and brunch items take more than simply throwing together nutella on toast or trying a nut butter other than peanut butter. This is why excellent brunch places are rare and few in between and also a reason why Snooze is continuously packed throughout the day. Customers of Snooze understand that the food is simply worth the wait.
