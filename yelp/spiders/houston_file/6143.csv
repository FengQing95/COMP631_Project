JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love ramen. I don't love JINYA. Although the service was prompt and kind, the food was lacking. I got the spicy tonkotsu and the broth was the wrong kind of spicy (I'm a spicy person)... the kind that gives you heartburns and regret. The soup was fatty and greasy- not creamy and spicy like it should be. The noodles were pretty good, kind of had bite. The combination of toppings that come with the soup didn't round out the soup like they should. Expensive too. Don't waste your time at this place- there are better ramen restaurants to try in Houston
