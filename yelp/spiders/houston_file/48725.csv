Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Love breakfast at Snooze - their pancakes are light and fluffy - plus the favor combinations are amazing. my son always has the bendicts - so many to choose from he always gets two types. i had the breakfast taco and fruit. so we covered every style of food and enjoyed every bite. service was very attentive.
