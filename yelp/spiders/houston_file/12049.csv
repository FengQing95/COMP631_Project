JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The only problem is the staff - there's obviously way too many waiters and waitresses because every time I go there, there's about five or six of them always milling at the hostess' stand in the front. I've gone on Saturday so the place is definitely not the least bit empty at all. I've seen the same maybe two to three waiters and waitresses running around serving the customers. I don't have a problem with the fact they're on break, but maybe cut down on the waitstaff at hand or have them congregate in the back. It's just awkward to walk past the hostess stand when leaving because of the loudness of the myriad conversations, and also awkward when arriving and they don't notice you until a minute or two later. I'm not knocking off any stars because the food is good and the service I had received was good as well - just an observation I had made to be mindful of.
