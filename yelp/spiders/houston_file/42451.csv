Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I had lunch here one day - got the chicken torta sandwich, it was good, but not worth what I paid for. Since I last came, they added new lunch items in their menu so I'm looking forward to trying those! Yes, I know this cafe is pricy, however, I don't mind paying $$$ for their pastries because it's definitely worth it.
