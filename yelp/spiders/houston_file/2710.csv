JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////There are almost no words to describe this place. Its that good. The food is amazing and I've never had a long wait between ordering and receiving my food. I've been here probably 20+ times and its always been great. There is a long wait sometimes but that's because the place is on the small side.
