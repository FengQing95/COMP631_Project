Uchi////If there was a Asian place to recommend in Houston would be Uchi. The combination of flavors is amazing. My favorite was the Walu Walu and the desserts are excellent especially the fried milk. If you are from Houston you already know all the different options you have in restaurants, but this one is in my opinion in my top 3. The food is fresh, the servers were super friendly and an exclusive environment
