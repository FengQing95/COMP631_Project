Uchi////Uchi is the real deal.  I highly recommend forgetting about the fixed menus, and just ordering a wide range of cooked dishes followed by the exceptionally good sushi.  I frankly didn't even find it that expensive for the quality.  I drank much, ate much, and tipped much, and still escaped for less than $200 for two.  At this level of execution, with these kinds of ingredients (I have already dreamt about the madai)  that's a bargain.
