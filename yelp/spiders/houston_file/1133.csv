JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Had an EXPERIENCE last night while dining here. Jinya took Ramen to a whole other level!!! I know I'm spelling this wrong, and I apologize... I ordered the tontastu (sp) spicy and it did not disappoint! I've never really been a huge fan of pork, but can appreciate a house dish and will always give it a go, and I am so glad I did! The seasonings were perfect, the noodles were thick- I could not get enough!!! We ordered the tempura Brussels and they were mouth watering. We also had two of the steamed bun "tacos" that literally tasted like biting into a cloud. I said this to my husband while licking my fingers!!! The hubs ordered a lychee mojito that was amazing, while I opted for the lychee martini, again, amazing. I fell in love with the community seating (separate dining is available), which forces you to put down your devices and enjoy ones company!!! Absolutely will be returning or grabbing a to-go order VERY soon!
