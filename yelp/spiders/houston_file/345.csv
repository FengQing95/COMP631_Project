JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had heard good things about this restaurant; however, I could not have been more disappointed. The service was awful. I called the order in for pick up, but still had to wait 30 min for it. The bartender was nice, but the manager could not even come out in person to meet with me when I had a concern. Food was mediocre at best. Will not be returning when there are so many other better options in Houston.
