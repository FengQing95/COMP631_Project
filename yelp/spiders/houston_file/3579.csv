JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Fantastic food and service!! Came here with a friend after pulling an all-nighter bar crawl around town. We figured we could use something to nurse our hangovers... Ramen hit the spot! Our server was great - She answered all of our weird questions about the menu. I told her we were hungover as hell and she got us extra ice waters and then totally understood why we were asking for anything spicy on the side, lol. Thank you!! I will definitely be recommending this to my friends looking for great ramen in Houston.
