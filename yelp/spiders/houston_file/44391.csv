Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I went in to check out their bread and cookies. All of their bread has some sourdough mix into it as I was told. I got the country loaf to get something plain for everyday use. The outside is crunchy and the inside is soft and moist. I could taste a little of the sourdough, but overall it was good. I've been missing german bread for a while and this bread comes pretty close to home in flavor and craft.
