Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We came here on Friday night. It's a cool bar tucked away in trendy part of town. If you are a whiskey connoisseur this place is for you! However, if you're like me and do not care for whiskey, they have some cool cocktails as well. Overall, drinks are probably a little on the expensive side. For dinner, I got the pancake and it was like eating yellow cake! amazing!
