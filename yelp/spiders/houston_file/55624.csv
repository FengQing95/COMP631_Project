Kata Robata////Kata Robata is probably my favorite Japanese Restaurant in Houston! I love it far more than Uchi! Â Their dishes are unique, flavorful and modern. More importantly, the ingredients and seafood they use are fresh. My husband and I absolutely LOVED their Uni Chawanmushi, Rising Sun roll (Yellowtail, avocado, peppercorn tuna, truffle vinaigrette), the Miso Crusted Bone Marrow, and Foie Gras & Duck Cold Soba (Duck breast, buckwheat noodle, green onions, Asian vinaigrette). Service is impeccable, great ambiance and all around delicious dishes. I highly, highly recommend booking a reservation in advance! This restaurant is packed and the wait can be long.
