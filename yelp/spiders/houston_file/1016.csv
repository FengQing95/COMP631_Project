JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We got the pork and spicy chicken ramen (can't remember exactly what they were called on the menu). Both were delicious. The restaurant was fairly busy on a Monday evening, but service was reasonably quick. I did wish my water was refilled a bit more often, but no big deal.
