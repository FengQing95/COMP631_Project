Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We got here around 1:30pm and weren't seated until 2:15pm. While we were waiting, we hung out at the bar and I got a Mayan mocha. It had chocolate (obvs), espresso, and some sorta liquor that I wasn't familiar with, but it was phenomenal. My best friend's mom got a Bloody Mary, which also must have been good because she ordered another glass (or she was recovering from the long drive to Houston).
