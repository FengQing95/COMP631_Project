Kata Robata////I've been here 3 times with reservations. And every time there were still a wait. This could be a good thing or bad. In my opinion this establishment is so popular and creatively good it deserves a little wait. We enjoy it every time though. The staffs are friendly, knowledgeable, and professional. I never had gripes of the food that is prepared Japanese style. The environment fun and although it is not such a small place there seems as though there's a lot of moving parts from the bar & sushi bar always occupied with customers to sushi chef's getting together artistic dishes as quickly as possible.
