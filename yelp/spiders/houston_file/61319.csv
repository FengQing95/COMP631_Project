Baby Barnaby's////This was my first time trying breakfast here and I've decided to stick to lunch and dinner. These guys make one of the best burgers in town, great meatloaf and the desserts are to die for, but not so much for breakfast. I had corned beef hash & eggs. Was not very well seasoned, I probably should have gone with my original choice if pancakes. My friend ordered w breakfast plate, also needed more seasoning and the grits were very soupy. Grits are supposed to be thick, like stick to your bones thick. I love, love, love this location and Barnaby's is one of my fav spots in town for lunch or dinner.
