Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////After requesting the check, the guy who kept our water glasses full (another star earner) brought out a clean fork and two small plates. We were confused. Then Breanne brought out their red velvet churros to make up for my disappointment in entree. This was in no way necessary. We'd already said we would come back. The atmosphere and drinks alone would get me back. Then, a very tall man approached the table and introduced himself as the owner. He asked about the shrimp and grits, and I agreed that it's probably not really fair for me to judge anything from outside of LA like that. He was super friendly and clearly concerned with the happiness of his guests. They went above and beyond to make up for something that really just came down to personal taste.
