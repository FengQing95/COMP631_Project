Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Go here for the drinks. . . . not the food.  We went here for dinner for the first time the other night and was not impressed with the food or the service.  We started off with drinks . . . The Panama Prescription and The Boss lady.  Drinks were good.  For an appetizer we got the Pork Belly Poutine which was French Fries, Pork Belly, Cheese Curds and Andouille Gravy. . . It just didn't work for us.  Not sure why they put Cheese Curds in this concoction.  Entrees we got the Carolina BBQ Salmon which was Salmon with BBQ Sauce on top of a butterbean Succotash.  I ate the Salmon which was ok and completely laid off of the Succotash . . . . here again it just did not work for me.  The Wife got the 12 Hour beef short ribs. Dessert - I got the Blueberry Buttermilk Pie.  The crust was hard and dry. . . . we just got the feeling the food was not the focal point of this establishment.  Service was subpar . . . we were always looking for the waitress who for the most part was nowhere to be seen.  What might have been the problem is that they had a huge party going on in the back.  Could be they were just overwhelmed?  I would go back to the bar to have a few drinks after work but would order a hamburger instead of there entree's.
