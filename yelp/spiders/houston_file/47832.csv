Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I don't know why this place is so highly rated. The host was barely friendly, and hardly even looked at us when he spoke. Told us we'd have a 20 minute wait, and then we waited 40 before we got sat. It took a long time for our server to come to our table so we ordered immediately once he arrived. We ordered waters and one coffee to drink and after waiting just over 20 minutes we decided to leave since we hadn't even received our glasses of water yet. The food sounded good, but it wasn't worth it the stay and find out. Very disappointing experience. And it was a Monday. Can't imagine a weekend. If anyone asks me, I'll tell them to avoid this place for sure.
