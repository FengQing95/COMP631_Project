Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This chain is surviving mostly off of hype to be honest. Yes, the food is GOOD! BUT it is nothing that will leave a lasting impact. They do traditional breakfast well... but it is not worth hours of waiting in my opinion. It is nice that they give your coffee while waiting, and the service is amazing. The decor is cute and the quality of food is great as well. Just NOT worth the wait. I would go to Breakfast club over here in a heartbeat.
