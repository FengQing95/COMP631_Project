JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////HI Star - Thank you for the great review. I'm glad you enjoyed our vegetarian options at JINYA. In the near future, we plan to open two more locations in Houston, which hopefully will alleviate some of the crowds. And I agree that loud music isn't for everyone, and I'm the type that enjoys dinner over soft music; however, JINYA's concept is geared more towards the trendy and exuberant atmosphere.
