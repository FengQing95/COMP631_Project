Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My boyfriend ordered the pancake Trio. I'm not big on the flavored pancakes I like mine Plain Jane but these pancakes are phenomenal. Even if you're not a blueberry person get the blueberry. You won't regret it. I got the snooze regular. The bacon and hashbrowns were delicious. The eggs and toast were pretty typical. The coffee was just ok. I was excited to try the snooze blend, it was okay pretty typical. Service was amazing. I will definitely be back again.
