Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I go there  twice a  week...Its  the best in Houston  the croissants are anyway.Since the pandemic  the  line is out the door and  way down the block.The need to find a  way to get coffee  drinkers  inside to order.  Their  desserts  and breads  are simply the best..I like the new   director not a manager, hes  a very hard worker and moves the line...They shouldhave had him a long time  ago...I encourage everyone to drop by there
