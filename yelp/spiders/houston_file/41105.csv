Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Love Love Love this place! Everything I have tried here has been really amazing. Their menu items change weekly. So far I have had their boudain eggs benedict, beef tongue sandwich, and a fish and dumplings dish. All were creative dishes packed with flavor. From the bakery I have had their cheesecake (a must!), sticky bun, p&j macaron, a raspberry and pistachio tart, and their mixed berry fruit tart. Their vanilla lattes are really good too.. They use actual vanilla bean in it. One of my fav little places to eat.
