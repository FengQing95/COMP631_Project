Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I walked in thinking this place is so cute- the bakery items looked amazing! Customer service was bad! Not only did we not get greeted, but when I asked about milk and sugar free options the cashier seemed annoyed. I dealt with three employees- maybe they all woke up too early! I wasn't thanked- but instead only thanked them for letting me spend my money there. The latte I ordered was pretty good though. They do not have stevia- it's so rare to find a nice coffee shop without it. I am thankful they were rude here because it forced me to walk across the street to Brasil!
