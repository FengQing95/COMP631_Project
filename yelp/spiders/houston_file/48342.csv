Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Overall, great! The coffee, food, and service were all spectacular. However, hearing people say they waited 2+ hours? I am skeptical. I would personally not wait that long for here-- I think the hype will die down in a few months. You'd be better off starting your day with a great breakfast early (i.e. before 7 AM) rather than waiting for hours.
