Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We stopped by for dinner on a Saturday evening.  We didn't have a reservation and instead happily sat at the bar which happens to be full service.   We enjoyed visiting over drinks. Ordered dinner. The food was very good.  The only negative I have to say is the sound level is very high.  It's just loud in this restaurant. Not sure if it's the configuration of the bar in the middle or just a need for some sound reduction ceiling tiles. I'm no expert so who knows.  But it is not for the hard of hearing nor quiet romantic dinner.
