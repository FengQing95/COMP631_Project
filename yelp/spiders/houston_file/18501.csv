Uchi////Dessert: The fried milk is a creation I didn't think existed or would have been thought to be created.  Basically its 4 fried pillows of puff pastry filled with custard, chocolate mouse, vanilla ice cream, and thin chocolate wafers was a sight for sore eyes!  You would think this combination would be over the top sweet, but it wasn't.  It was a great amalgam of warm + cold, sweet + pinch of salty, smooth + textured on a plate.
