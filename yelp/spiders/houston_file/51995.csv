Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I got Snooze takeout and had a wonderful experience with Habanero Pork Belly Benny (Egg Benedict) and Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes. The Egg Benedict was super delicious and not overly salty compared the egg benedict I had in some other brunch places. Although it didn't look like a large amount of food but it turned out to be surprisingly filling. The pineapple pancakes is also quite a lovely experience. It was not overly sweet but definitely still satisfied my sweet tooth for the day. Also, if you are planning to do a long hike later in theday like I did, the calorie per dollar ratio for these pancakes is definitely the way to go!
