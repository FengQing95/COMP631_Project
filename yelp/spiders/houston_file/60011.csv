Baby Barnaby's////A search through Yelp for breakfast spots unearthed this little gem -- Baby Barnaby's. It takes a lot to get me out of bed before noon on the weekends, but the promise of Barnaby's incredible "green eggs" is usually enough to get me moving. This little eatery serves up great breakfast plates. Or at least, that's what I assume judging from what I see everyone else noshing on. I myself only rarely stray from the heavenly green eggs plate, which is a scramble with artichoke hearts, spinach, and cheese. It's light and decadent, a perfect accompaniment to the slice of wheat toast that comes with it. The chicken sausages I can do without, but my boyfriend never seems to mind wolfing them down when I push them off to the side.
