The Pit Room////This spot does not need my review however, it absolutely deserves it. Being a Texan I have tried BBQ all over Texas. It was even what we had at our wedding. I have also traveled all over the country tasting BBQ. This place was easily in the top 3 for me. The pickles and jalape√±os are homemade and have so much flavor. The tortilla for the taco was very then yet held together perfectly. Oh the meats, boy those meats! This place is a must try if you are in Houston.!
