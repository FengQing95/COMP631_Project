Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Came in on a Tuesday and had no problems getting a table within 5-10 minutes before we went to the zoo. We sat in a giant booth and I honestly had to lean forward to eat but that Bravocado toast was worth it. Our waitress was super friendly and always made sure we had everything we needed. She didn't even complain when the baby we had with us made a huge watery mess.
