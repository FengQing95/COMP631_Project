Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Amazing quality of freshly baked goodies. Only recommendation would be to maybe add another cashier to keep the line moving, especially during busy hours? Some customers just want a cup of coffee to go..but the wait can be too long so they turn around. Can argue..it is worth it.
