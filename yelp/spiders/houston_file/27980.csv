The Pit Room////For sides, we had the corn (elote), beans and potato salad: the corn was corn on the cob topped with cheese and Mexican spices; the beans were surprisingly spicy; and the potato salad was good, and I liked how they included hard boiled egg. Generally, the sides were good but not as great as the meat.
