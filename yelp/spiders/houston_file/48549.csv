Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Now the service... Not without its share of blunders for a place that was on its opening weekend. We were brought someone else's dishes at least twice and they messed up my friends coffee order (ordered iced and they brought hot). My friend also asked for a side of ranch which our server had to find out for himself they didn't have. No biggie on any of those. Still learning the ins and outs, table numbers, and juggling a full house that probably started at opening until close. Our server approached all the problems with a good attitude, quick resolution and a great sense of humor.
