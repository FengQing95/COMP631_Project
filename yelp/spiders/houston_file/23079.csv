Uchi////Honestly the only reason it gets two stars is the food was decent. It is so wildly overpriced and our server was the biggest B. Her name is Victoria and she ruined our entire experience. She was argumentative about the menu about what WE wanted to order, never so much as smiled, and was just straight up rude as hell. Then we had to pay her a giant gratuity of $140 when she barely deserved $2. Horrible experience, never going back.
