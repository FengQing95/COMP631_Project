Kata Robata////Some other things I have tried is their seafood mac and cheese, it's just meh. The ramen is pretty good too.Their rolls are yummy too, I'm not a sushi roll person because it's very filling unless you go with a group of people, so that you can try a little bit of everything. My favorite roll there is the sexy scallop roll, filled with deliciousness.
