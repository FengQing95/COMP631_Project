The Pit Room////Brisket was good, not great. Pork ribs were a bit lean and chewy. Bbq sauce is vinegar base. Service was excellent, really fast considering it was a packed house on a Saturday. Veggie bar had an assortment of fresh selection, loved the pickle green onions. Price is a couple of dollars  more when considering the location.  Pics of sides looked great, will have to try next time.
