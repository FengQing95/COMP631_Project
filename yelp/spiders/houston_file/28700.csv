The Pit Room////The brisket was DRY and flavorless. My pork rib was BURNT on the sides. The sausage was DRY. I drenched everything with the hot sauce for some taste and moisture. The only perks to the meats were the tender joints on the pork rib and the crispy skin on the sausage. I was very disappointed. Maybe the beef rib would've tasted better. Not sure. The ONLY tasty food was the taco so I only recommend the taco.
