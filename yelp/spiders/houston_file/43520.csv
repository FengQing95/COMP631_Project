Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////With over 700 Yelp reviews and averaging a high 4 star rating, i can attest to the hype and say that i really like this cafe. I don't know what they do best, their desserts, their frappes and mocha, their delicious breads, breakfast and lunch menu, or their helpful service.
