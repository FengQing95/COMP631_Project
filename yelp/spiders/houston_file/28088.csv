The Pit Room////Was in the Houston area from Cali. A friend told me I had to try Texas barbecue. I stumbled across this place. BEST barbecue I've ever had!!!  The brisket and Mac n cheese were amazing!  The Patio next door was super fun, too. Great atmosphere with large groups and dogs hanging out with live music. Highly recommend both places :)
