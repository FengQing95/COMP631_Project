JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I would give this place 3.5 stars if I could. This is not my favorite ramen place in Houston, but it is closer to me than other ramen spots. So if I'm craving ramen and don't want to drive too far out, this is a good option. I've been here multiple times in the past before all the new ramen joints opened in Houston. I went back recently and they had vamped up their menu. I liked the old and simple menu better when it was just one page. Now the menu is bigger and it has way too many options. It seemed like they just added some toppings and renamed their ramen. I ordered Sprouting Up Ramen and I liked that it had lots of veggies such as brussels sprouts and bean sprouts. However, I still don't love their broth. I feel like the broth is the most important part of a ramen bowl, but Jinya's broth doesn't amaze my taste buds as much.
