JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Rita - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry if your to-go order took longer than you expected. We try our hardest to keep the line moving, but myriad factors can delay our production, though we do our best to find solutions to problems as they arise. As far as pricing goes, I strongly feel that we offer a quality product at a fair price, especially given the higher-across-the-board prices for goods and services in Midtown. A quick Google search will reveal that the cost of living in this neighborhood is much higher than other parts of Houston.
