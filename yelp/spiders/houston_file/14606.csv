JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Rachel - Thank you for your great review. I'm very pleased to know our ramen stacks up to what you enjoyed in Japan. That's always an encouraging litmus test for us. Otherwise, we appreciate your feedback regarding the other aspects of our restaurant, most of which are outside of our control (we are required to design and build our franchise according to corporate standards). Thank you again, and we appreciate your business.
