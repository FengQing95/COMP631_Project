Kata Robata////If you ever go here (and you need to go here) order the 10 piece nigiri sampler. With it, you get 10 pieces of very high quality fish, AND a choice between two rolls. ALWAYS PICK THE TROPICAL ROLL. It's twice the size of the other roll and includes a lot of fish as toppings. There is no reason to ever order the not-Tropical roll regardless of your taste. The other roll is so inferior that I can't even remember its name. In fact, every time I try, my brain starts to shut down while loudly screaming nope until I order a tropical roll from the person nearest to me.
