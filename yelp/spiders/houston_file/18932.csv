Uchi////- Machi Cure - like everyone has already mentioned, this dish is a play on nachos.  Meant to be eaten by hand, it was a fun an engaging eating experience.  Although daunting at first, the trick is to balance all the ingredients on one yucca chip and eat it in one bite.  The saltiness of the yucca chip and smoked baby yellowtail marries well with the sweetness of the marcona almond and asian pear.  The asian pear gives it a great finish.
