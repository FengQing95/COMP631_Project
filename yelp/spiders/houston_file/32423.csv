Local Foods////Local Foods...what a great place! I walked in and felt like I was transported to Austin. The place was young and fresh. I felt at ease there. The food is delicious and is so reasonably priced. My Truffled Egg Salad with a side of Tuscan Kale and Quinoa (both very yummy) was only $9.50. I tried the "Mintade," I didn't really taste the mint but the drink was citrusy and crisp, nice. By the time I left I was so full, I could barely walk.
