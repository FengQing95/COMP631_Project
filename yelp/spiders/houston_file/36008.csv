Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I honestly wouldn't recommend this spot because the food is that disappointing. Maybe the brunch is better but if you're looking for a good dinner, this isn't the place. I considered giving them 2 stars but I'll add an extra star because the staff is very friendly and caring. When they asked how the food was, I didn't have the heart to tell them what I really thought.
