JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been here a few times but apparently never reviewed it. There's always a long wait, mainly because the place is somewhat small but also because there aren't a lot of separate tables. There's this huge community table in the center of the restaurant, so if you come with kids, wait for a booth.
