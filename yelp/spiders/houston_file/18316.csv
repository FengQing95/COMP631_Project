Uchi////You have never had sushi until you've gone to Uchi. The perfect combinations of taste overwhelms you with emotions you've never felt before. With that being said, if you still haven't gone to Uchi, YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF YOUR CHAIR AND BOOK A RESERVATION TODAY (Or book it online. They do that too! :D)
