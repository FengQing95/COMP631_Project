JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Oh my gosh, I love this place. It is very yummy and the customer service at first seem a little wacky just because the waitress and waiters are shouting random nonsense into the air and it just confuses me, but I absolutely love their creamy veggie pho it is soooo good I also like to add cabbage to it and a whole lot of hot sauce. Anyways I think it is great place to go on date and you might even make some new friends since the environment is almost like a cafeteria that it is a very open space, so its like your bound to talk to someone especially if you look good.
