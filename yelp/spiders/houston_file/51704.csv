Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've tried something from every section of the menu but I really like to order their versions of eggs Benedict. My favorite has to be the Chile Verde Benny with barbacoa beef. I've had the cinnamon roll pancake (it's on the a la Carte portion of the menu) and it's good but a sugary overload. The hot chocolate is also delicious.
