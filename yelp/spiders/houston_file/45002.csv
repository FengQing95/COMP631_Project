Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First time here this past weekend and I'll definitely be back. You kinda just sit at whatever is available and stand in line to order your food and drinks, the somebody will bring it to you. I went on a Saturday morning so it was a little packed and parking btw is a nightmare. Only reason it's getting 4 stars and not 5 is the whole parking situation. I had to drive around for 25 mins before something became a available. Backstreets/side streets/ the miniature lot they have.. everything was full.
