Local Foods////For the sides, I chose a quinoa salad and the homemade potato chips seasoned with Old Bay seasoning.  I was trying to balance being healthy (quinoa) with wanting to be bad (potato chips).  Needless to say, this was an excellent pairing and both were scrumptious.  The quinoa had chunks of squash and zucchini mixed in; it was zippy, cool, and crunchy.  The potato chips were gorgeously uneven in degrees of fried:  some were perfectly caramel while others were just shy of burnt.  Liberally seasoned, this made for different and interesting flavor profiles.
