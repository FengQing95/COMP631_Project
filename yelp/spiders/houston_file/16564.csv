JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Super delicious, attentive staff. I love the tonkotsu black and its my go to. Their takoyaki is delicious, so is their cauliflower. I wish their sides were a little bigger for the cost, but still good. Their Brussel sprouts are delicious and I always get a side for my ramen.
