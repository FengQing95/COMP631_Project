JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Oscar - Thank you for your update. We appreciate your kind words. It is true: Our corporate headquarters made the executive decision to prohibit franchisees from offering "off-menu" items. Perhaps the logic is that some items can only be offered as "specials," much in the same way McDonalds only offers the McRib and Shamrock Shakes during certain months of the year. Unfortunately, we are beholden to these standards, but we appreciate your understanding.
