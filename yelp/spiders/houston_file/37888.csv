Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Food, atmosphere and service were all good. We got the pulled pork hush puppies, which sounded amazing but disappointed. Cornbread was kinda dry with no real flavor of its own. Difficult to eat without looking like a barbarian. Wouldn't recommend those. We also got the Kentucky hot brown and short rib. Both were excellent. Finished with the red velvet churros and chocolate pudding. Also both excellent. The service was good, but halfway through our meal an important table was seated next to us. They received a LOT more attention and special treatment, so after that we had to wait longer between service. Just a little off putting,
