Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I had the Smashing Pumpkin pancakes with a side of sausage links and hash browns. My husband had the peanut butter cup pancake, I Am Sandwich, and hash browns. Every single bite was amazing! We've been spoiled now. IHOP and those other breakfast places will never enough! Do yourself a favor. Hold your tongue during the ridiculous wait time, and you'll be rewarded.
