Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So anyway, awesome place for baguettes and pastries. Macarons were good. I'm guessing coffee is great. We had lunch there which was too buttery and fatty for my taste. Lunch is basically limited to choice of 3 sandwiches or a couple salads. I like a limited but killer menu, but my family got all 3 sandwiches to share and each was pretty heavy on fat. Bread was buttered on inside and outside on all sandwiches so your hands get a sheen of butter on them. Crab sandwich had a lot of mayo. Veal sandwich had a lot of fat included. Grilled cheese bread seemed about an inch thick. So I felt kind of like I just had Thanksgiving dinner after I left.
