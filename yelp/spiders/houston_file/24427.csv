Uchi////I made a reservation for a Monday at 5PM. Monday evening 4:50PM and there was already a line outside of about 10. There was a sample of their temaki roll with tomato jam on top for the wait. The girl passing it out seemed surprised I asked what it was... Hitting up that happy hour the restaurant had plenty of tables to spare even by 7PM.
