Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Went here with Fiancé for brunch a few weekends ago, and we enjoyed it a lot. It was quite busy, predictably, and parking was hard to find. However, the food was lovely, and the coffee was better than a lot of places I've tried in Houston. I had the (pretentious?) avocado toast, which started with great, seedy toast and was piled with tasty delights: avocado, sprouts, bacon, poached egg. Fiancé had biscuits and gravy, which had a mild jalapeño kick that added a little extra something to the dish. We finished it off with a black cherry cheesecake, which was absolutely divine. Definitely want to go back.
