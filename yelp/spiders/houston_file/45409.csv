Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Finally got to try this great breakfast place out and we were not disappointed. I had the fried green tomatoes with a poached egg on top and it was good but looked better than it tasted. The fried okra was nice and crisp and surprisingly didn't get soggy even with a soaked poached egg on top of it.
