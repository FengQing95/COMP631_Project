Kata Robata////Some of the items that came with the tasting menu were: bone marrow with uni, roe, and fish on top (so decadent and rich and amazing), hand roll with tuna, uni, and roe, sashimi pieces of scallop, yellowtail, eel, salmon caught only once every 4 years, wagyu that melts in your mouth, the best fatty tuna, and so much more. Everything was prepared so well and I just loved it all.
