Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The baked goods are really good and to die for. I wouldn't mind eating a croissant, pain au chocolat or almond croissants. they are huge, crispy but fluffy/buttery inside. something i try to mimic at home but just cant. Really the best i've had in the States and reminds me of France (sans their size),
