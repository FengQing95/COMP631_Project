Uchi////This is my favorite Japanese joint in Houston. I ordered some nigiri and different rolls. Every piece of nigiri was fresh and distinctive in flavor. Flavors are deceptively complex but are true to form of the original ingredient.  I personally adore the service here, and trust the staff completely to pick out the best menu options for the night. Worth the time to visit. Be sure to have a reservation.
