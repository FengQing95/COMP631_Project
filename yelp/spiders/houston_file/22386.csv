Uchi////Now given that this was a couple of months ago (I know, fail Ellen fail, get to Yelping!) and we had a healthy amount of wine and sake, I'm not quite sure of what we all had, but the other two in my party had the Signature Tasting. Â Our super awesome waiter was more than accommodating and Uchi is more than willing to cater a perfectly competent vegan meal without severely altering the ingredients of its default offerings.
