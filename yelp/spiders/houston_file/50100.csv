Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I had the Pancake Flight (three of any of the specialty pancakes) the chicken sausage and coffee. I went with a Cinnamon Roll, Pineapple Upside Down Pancake, and a Bacon Me Crazy (the pancake of the day). All three were excellent as was the sausage. The coffee wasn't the best, but easily overlooked by all the other positives!
