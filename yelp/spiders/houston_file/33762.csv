Local Foods////Local Foods has made me feel things in places I never knew. This cute little Rice Village restaurant is one of my favorites that is unrivaled in quality and quantity. Serving up sandwiches, salads, soups, and sides, Local Foods doesn't sound like anything special, but its supreme quality and innovative creations earns it 5 solid stars.
