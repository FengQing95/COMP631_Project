Kata Robata////Went in for lunch with a friend, we had one of the pork ramens, which was one of the best ramens I had in Houston; a sushi combo that had crunchy rolls, cali rolls, and another roll.  The crunchy roll was very especially tasty with this black roe on the top.  We also had de-constructed strawberry shortbread for dessert.  Very interesting taste and presentation.  The staff was nice and tentative.  Very good experience.
