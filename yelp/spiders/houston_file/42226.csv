Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I am forever bonded to Common Bond Cafe!  I've been trying to think of unique adjectives to describe the food here but can only come up with the tried and true amazing, fabulous, delicious, fantastic, for describing it.  It's a great spot for breakfast or lunch.  I went with a girlfriend today for lunch and had a latte (you can see all the beautiful pics of them on other reviews) and a roast beef sandwich on rustic bread....YUM!  I could not pass up one of the chocolate chip cookies for dessert.  It was a mound of gooey choclately deliciousness that melted in your mouth.  Breads are my weakness so I couldn't leave without bringing some croissants home for the family. These croissants are at least double the size of any I have ever seen! The staff was friendly and very efficient and the decor rocks.
