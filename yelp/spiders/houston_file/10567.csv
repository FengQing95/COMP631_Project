JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Houston's ramen game is basically over now that Jinya is in town. At first I was disappointed at how far down south their first location was. Clear Lake was an insane drive from any part of Houston. But when they opened a second shop in Midtown, the location was perfect. Not too much traffic on the corner of Louisiana and Elgin, but pretty busy with pedestrians with all the trendy looking restaurants and shops next door. They even have a convenient parking garage attached to the building.
