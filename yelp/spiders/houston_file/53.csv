Local Foods////im digging this place.  i believe everything is all natural, which is good.  the sandwiches and side are very delicious. you can see what makes it gourmet from the ingredient in the sandwich and sides (not very typical) to the beer selections.  i had a cupcake which the cashier told me was made by the mother of the guy that owns benjy's; soo good.  the prices are what you'd expect for a gourmet sandwich spot owned by benjy's.  local foods has a clean appeal from the atmosphere to the decor.  its a lil on the hipster side; esp the staff, but that just adds to it.
