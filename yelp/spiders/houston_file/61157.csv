Baby Barnaby's////Yummy, yummy, yummy! EXCELLENT food and service.  A neighboring business recommended I have lunch here. So glad they did! Small place but full of character and good feels. Friendly staff, heft portions and reasonably priced.  You cannot go wrong eating here! I ordered a burger but the salads looked delicious as well! The next time I am in Houston I will go out of my way to eat here. It's worth the effort.
