Uchi////This place is sushi foodie heaven.  It has some unique flavor combinations.  I went for the social happy hour, and I was so impressed.    The waiter will tell you that it's common to order from everything on the menu especially if you have a group.  What he doesn't tell you is you will get charged for the extra pieces if you are dining with more than two people.  Our server gave us an order of a microsalad that was off the menu.  He said it was "on the house," but I still got charged for it.  I didn't dispute the extra charges.  The service was excellent.  It was my friend's bday and multiple staff members wished her Happy b-day.  We were disappointed that there wasn't a complimentary dessert to go with the meal. I will return to try out other entrees.  The Happy hour is the best way to get a tasting of the menu without hurting your wallet.
