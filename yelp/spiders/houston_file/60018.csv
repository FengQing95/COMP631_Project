Baby Barnaby's////I brought a friend from New York to Baby Barnaby's for brunch. In spite of his dismay at the size of the "suicide" pancake (just ask for it), he finished 80% of it. I finished the other 20% after we almost scuffled for it. It was a monster of a pancake, with blueberries, bananas, walnuts, blackberries and all of the other toppings on the menu. Best part is that they don't charge extra for your ordering it. If 'suicide' is wrong, I don't wanna be right.
