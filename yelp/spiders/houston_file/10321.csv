JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Like most ramen places, they charge if you want to add anything extra to your ramen (soup, noodles, egg, corn, etc). I think this place will stick around for a long time. I had to look up their website to also find out that they have many other locations including California, Las Vegas, and in Canada. As a chain, you can't really go wrong because these people know what they are doing. I certainly will come back again!
