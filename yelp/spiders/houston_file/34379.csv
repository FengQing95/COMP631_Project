Local Foods////I haven't tried everything on their menu but I can say with confidence I was satisfied with everything new I've tried so far. My favorite I would have to say is their smoked salmon and banh mi. Smoked salmon was fresh/light/filling and Banh mi was super savory to me (it is a bit spicy with their jalape√±os so be careful if you're weak with spicy food)! You also get two sides with or one soup with a sandwich (love). I always get cabbage slaw- it's the best. They use miso vinaigrette for the cabbage slaw and it tastes a bit like sesame oil to me (which I'm a big fan of).
