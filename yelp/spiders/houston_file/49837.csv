Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////On to the food, the eggs Benedict (one with salmon) was seriously SUPEE delicious. We also ordered this hash brown concoction with eggs and other toppings of our choice. Main reason I took off another star? Because the potatoes in the hash brown were undercooked. Now I'm not picky with my potatoes where I need them to be super crisp...but come on, they could've been cooked at the very least. I'll def be back here to try some other dishes.
