Kata Robata////Uni pasta was my last adventure, and it was really nice. I'd never tried uni (sea urchin) before, and I have to say it was a good first encounter. It was really creamy and delicious, although it would have been nice to have bigger pieces of uni in the pasta rather than just the flavor in the sauce. Came with shrimp on top, which were nice, but unnecessary. This is another one that will leave you feeling full.
