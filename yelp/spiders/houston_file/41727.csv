Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The good: Fabulous for brunch, the provisions here are really nice - I'm a fan of the lavender latte, and the desserts always look fantastic. Sitting outside underneath the umbrellas to see the foot traffic and interesting people is also a plus, it's a really nice area to see and be seen.
