JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Sorry to hear you were disappointed with your experience at Jinya Ramen Bar.  We appreciate your visit but pls know that we are always willing to replace or remake any item you are not satisfied with at any time during your meal.  We aim to pls.  Our goal isn’t to be the “most authentic” ramen shop because authenticity of food is different amongst each guest.  Our goal is to be the best ramen shop we can be compared to our competition.  Although we will never be all things to all people, we do appreciate your visit and should you ever decide to pay us another visit, pls ask for myself or any of my managers (Sara, Long, Wynne or Keith). We will love to help you pick out something more suited to your palate.
