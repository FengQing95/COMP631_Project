JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Lindsey - Thanks for your review. Please be sure to request bamboo shoots when you next visit us. Some items are not listed on the menu due to space constraints, but I can assure you we do offer fresh (not canned) bamboo shoots as a side topping. Thank you again, and we look forward to serving you again soon.
