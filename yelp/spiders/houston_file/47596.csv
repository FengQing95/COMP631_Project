Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've had a secret love affair with Snooze ever since my sister introduced me in Ft. Collins, CO. When they announced that they were coming to Houston, I was elated! Their quality of food and service are both outstanding. I highly recommend it to those who truly love a good breakfast.
