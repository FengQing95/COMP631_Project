Local Foods////I went shortly after LF opened it's doors up on a Saturday morning, which apparently was great timing, because not long after did the joint get busy. The atmosphere was cozy farm chic: Recycled wooden tables, metal posts as vases and well thought out lighting. Lots of young professionals, health conscious families, and the usually Rice crowd poured in during my hour visit.
