The Pit Room////My go-to is brisket and this place does it very well - lean but not chewy, and with great flavor. I'd recommend a brisket sandwich with some Mac and cheese on the side if your looking for a respectable "cheat meal" after a hard days work. The elote is solid too from what my friends tell me. I wasn't a huge fan of the sausage, but that's always been hit or miss for me with bar-b-que. Great spot for a weekend meal, but if can get very busy during lunch time. Also, there's cold brew coffee on tap at this bbq joint? Never seen that before but I like it!
