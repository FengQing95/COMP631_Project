Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Um ignore my previous review (besides the cocktail part)! Came here with a group of friends, about 8 of us. As soon as we were seated, our orders were taken quickly. Then came the wait. It took 30 minutes to get the starters out, which is fine if they tasted good. The cornbread came out ice cold with the saltiest jam I've ever had.
