JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is our favorite ramen joint in Houston. I've hit most of the ramen joints in Houston. To name a couple others, I love the traditional style of ninja ramen and I enjoy tiger den in Chinatown, but we return preferentially to JINYA to get our fix. I typically order the Tonkotsu Black with extra garlic, nori, pork soboro, corn, and kikurage. The vegetable ramen soup is also delicious. I feel like the cha cha cha should have more garlic punch.
