Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////simply damp vibe..... not sure if the building has bad spirits seeping from its cinderblock Or if the staff just don't seem to get the art of proper & prompt service....third visit and sadly consistently disappointed. The FOOD is excellent, however. Thusly the 3 stars... step up to the plate , Snooze Houston.
