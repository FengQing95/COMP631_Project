Kata Robata////Great service, food and ambience! This is another neighborhood gem for me. I went with a friend of mine. She suggested the pork belly appetizer which was DIVINE!! It comes with julienne pieces of pork belly, purple cabbage, papaya and a light, citrus soy vinaigrette. And the waitress suggested the Kobe beef skewers....I had a moment with those beef skewers!! They were sooo good! They are souvied and take 72 hours to make! The meat melts in your mouth and then it has this char on the outside that is just wonderful. The best appetizer I've had in a long time. Definitely order both the beef skewers if you go! For dinner we had the pork ramen bowl. The broth was interesting. It needed a little more seasoning, but it was good. The ramen noodles were perfectly cooked and delicious. They give you a huge bowl filled with broth, noodles, pork, bean sprouts, boiled egg, etc. I'm glad I tried it. Next time I'm trying the sushi which I hear is amazing!
