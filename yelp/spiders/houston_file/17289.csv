Uchi////Our friends recommended and took us to Uchi while we were visiting them in Houston. And This was the best food experience I have ever had, by far. We tried several dishes and all of them were delicious. The flavors and textures are out of this world! Â We had early reservations on a Sunday at 5:30 so we could take advantage of their awesome happy hour specials. The servers are incredibly knowledgeable and friendly. This was our first time and he gave us two complimentary dishes! Can't wait to visit Houston again and make our way back to Uchi!
