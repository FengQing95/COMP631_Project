Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Returning to bosscat after an initial visit when it first opened up, the brunch scene is definitely very busy! The menu is short but well put together and the service is prompt regardless of the crowds. We ordered the burger and the French toast along with cocktails and everything came out perfect. The only minus point would be the pound music, which for a brunch is not out of the ordinary but the absolutely inability to have a conversation at all is one star down from the rating.
