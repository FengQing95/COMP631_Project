Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The parking was horrible, but bear with it and drive around the block to get some street parking. The wait will be really long, we got here an hour before closing and our wait was still about 45mins-1hour. Â But as long as you get your name down before closing time, they'll still sit and serve you.
