Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'm not gonna say it's cheap for sure but it's not expensive either. It's pretty smack dab in the middle. I say that because when you order and the food comes out, you will be satisfied. It's delicious, very well presented and the service is awesome. We paid 30$ for 2 lattes, 2 sandwiches, a soup and a croissant. That's fair to me.
