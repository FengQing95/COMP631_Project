Uchi////       - the staff raves about this dish.  as well they should.  it's a great new twist on brussel sprouts.  if you're filipino (like myself) you can definitely tell it tastes like a filipino dish (tocino - bbq pork).  it was a tad on the rich side so we ordered a bowl of steamed rice to eat with it.  it cut it quite nicely.  i will definitely have to order it that way again.  this dish is big and heavy too.  i probably would prefer more than 2 ppl eating it...
