Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The food - The menu is fairly limited - it's a sandwich shop with pastries, folks, so don't expect a steak - but we both quickly found yummy-sounding things. I had a turkey mole sandwich (even though I loathe mole . . . weird, right?) and he had a beef cheek sandwich, food-weirdo that he is. He reports that his beef cheek sandwich actually had TWO kinds of beef cheek, a traditional barbacoa and a more English-style presentation of simple fried beef cheek. He loved it, though the ciabatta seemed a bit dry (maybe a little old?) and a little hard and unwieldy. He ended up eating it like two open-face sammies. Pronounced it "delicious," though I could tell it wasn't to that 5-star level. You know what I mean?
