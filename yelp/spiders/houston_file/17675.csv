Uchi////After reading all the raving reviews, we decided to try Uchi. We went there on a Thursday night. We called and the girl said the earliest available reservation would be 2 hours from when we would like. She did mention that we did not have to wait as long if we just walked in. It was crowded and they tried to sit us as soon as they could.
