JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Where Jinya earned the five stars was the service. Our waitperson Xtina (Christina) was FABULOUS! My daughter has a fish allergy - deadly one - as in "will-go-into-anaphylaxis" allergy. So Christina made sure to clearly communicate that, and the kitchen was wonderful in accommodating. They even expressed concern the ramen would be too bland without the additional fish-based ingredients and recommended other dishes. We stuck with the ramen, and glad we did.  Further, when I did something stupid, they fixed it.  While eating my egg, it fell back into my bowl and splashed some of my (fish-ingredient) broth into my daughter's bowl. So she pushed it away from her, disappointed she couldn't eat it.  From across the room, Christina saw her do that, and immediately came over to ask if something was wrong. I was so embarrassed I nearly declined to tell her. When I did, she immediately took the bowl away, checked with the manager and replaced it with a fresh one.  She said that my daughter's safety was of utmost concern to Jinya.  I was so touched.
