JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm sorry to hear about your experience at Jinya.  It is not my intention to "hype" up my restaurant.  Just trying to bring something new and enjoyable to Houston since there are not many dedicated ramen shops in this city.  I'm glad you liked the Tonkotsu Assari, but I'm not sure what ramen  your boyfriend had being that we don't carry a Black Bean Ramen on our menu.  I believe Tiger Den is the only establishment that carries a Black Bean Ramen.  I have to agree with you that the Green Tea Mochi isn't as good as the Chocolate Mochi, but since this is a franchise, we are obligated to carry the items supplied by our distributor.  I will discuss your feedback with corporate and perhaps locate a better tasting Green Tea Mochi in the near future.  We will be opening a location in Carrollton, TX late this year so I hope you will give Jinya a shot when it comes to Dallas.
