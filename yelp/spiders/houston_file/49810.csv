Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Enjoyable spot, but not one that's worth a lengthy wait.  I liked they had a lot of fun stuff on the menu, like samoa cookie pancakes, but a few things were off.  The fun-looking hash brown "disks" could have been a lot more crispy.  My eggs came out over easy, not over medium as ordered.  A side of pulled pork came swimming in cooking juices, and while hot sauce was available, I was told there was no bbq sauce.  Iced coffee was good, but no refills were provided, unlike hot coffee which is bottomless.  Service was really good, but in the end, I was expecting something a bit better-executed than what we got.
