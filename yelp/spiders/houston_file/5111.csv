JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For a late Veteran's Day lunch, my boyfriend, little sister, and I went to Jinya. We usually do not venture out to eat as Houston's traffic does not leave much to be desired, but the boyfriend likes ramen and decided to give this place a try. Tiger Den is closer and more convenient, but it does not meet expectations.
