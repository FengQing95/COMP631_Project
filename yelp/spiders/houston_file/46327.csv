Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I eat out 4x per week,  yet never give reviews.  However, today I am. I  went here for the 1st  time and my experience was terrible. I ordered the brunch special which was crawfish Benedict highlighted the screen as the brunch special. Strangely, the staff scrambled around and finally said they were out of crawfish. They said they had the tamales Benedict so I ordered that as it was something I had never tried. They brought the food to me after about a ten minute wait and the eggs and hollandaise sauce  were at best lukewarm...the  tamales were cold. I told the staff of my disappointment and they just looked at me with a bizarre look and said I'm sorry...My alternative?  A taquito from Whataburger. Just a horrible first time/last time experience.
