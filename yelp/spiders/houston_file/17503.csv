Uchi////SO SO GOOD! Service is exceptional and unpretentious. Only draw back is no mixed drinks, but for this food I can overlook it! I have been 4 times in 3 months, make a reservation NOW, because its next to impossible to get in without 3 weeks notice. The service last visit was a little spotty. but Ill chalk it up to a fluke.
