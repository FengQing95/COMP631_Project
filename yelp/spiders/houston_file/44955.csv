Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Delicious all around! I love coming in and checking out their extensive display of treats! Their lavender creme brûlée had me in a tizzy of joy! So much to choose from so it's a great excuse to keep coming for more. They have a full menu of lunch items and coffee as well. Everyone is incredibly helpful and nice and the atmosphere is bright and comfortable.
