The Pit Room////This place defiantly lives up to the high rating! Super friendly staff and they are quick! I got 1 brisket taco, 1 chicken taco and my favorite , Mac n cheese. Mac n cheese defiantly 5/5 . The tacos were quite amazing . They do not skimp on portions here. Only thing that could habe been better were the tortillas. But you don't come to a bbq spot for the tortillas. Highly recommended
