Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Hubby and I were in Denver a couple of years ago, and we stopped by Snooze there. There was a two hour wait so we ended up going elsewhere. Today, we decided to finally visit this newish location in my hometown. We waited 45 minutes. Was it tedious? Of course. But the food was sooo worth it. We now regret not having waited for two hours in Denver!
