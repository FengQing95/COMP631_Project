JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////FOOD: The broth is rich and meaty, I would recommend the pork tonkotsu for the most authentic ramen experience! Their food is extremely consistent in taste and appearance, and I've loved every dish I've tried. Their chashu is not too fatty but super tender, and soft-boiled eggs are to die for. If you're not feeling Ramen, definitely try the chashu pork bowl, and I've heard great things about their vegetarian options.
