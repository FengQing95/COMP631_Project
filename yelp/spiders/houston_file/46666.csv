Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////my absolute favorite spot for breakfast. the staff are absolutely phenomenal and the food is amazing. the sinful pancake that is off the menu is to die for. and all of the benedicts can be half ordered! the wait is long on the weekend but more than worth it!! if you have had a bad experience here, i would recommend giving it a second try!
