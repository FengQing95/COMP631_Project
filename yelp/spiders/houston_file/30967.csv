The Pit Room////Can't leave out the pulled pork and the sausages. I've never ordered pulled pork at a bbq place before, but this I'd actually order as a sandwich. Among the sausages, the jalape√±o cheddar was my favorite but I enjoyed all of them. Little more tightly packed than Killen's, but that's more a preference thing and not a bad thing.
