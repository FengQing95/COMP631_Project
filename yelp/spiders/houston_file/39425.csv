Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat burger didn't come with fries? Thought that was a little weird but whatever. Great blend of meat, very good taste and texture. Asked for rare and got it. Nice and juicy. Big fluffy bun but it stays together so you can take a bite. The fixings were very fresh and delicious. Awesome pickles. The sauce was just kind of there. I would have preferred a garlic aioli or something that made its presence known a bit more. Some parmigiana on top that seemed a little superfluous. Every burger does not need cheese and it tasted like a fine little cheese, but just got lost in the mix on this burger.
