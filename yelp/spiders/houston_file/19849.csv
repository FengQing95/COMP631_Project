Uchi////Wonderful food and customer service! I've been to Uchi a few times and it never disappoints! I love that the menu is set up as more of a family style/tapas approach. It allows you to try more things off the menu! Their quality in seafood is impeccable and the flavors you experience here are one of a kind! I know a lot of people are turned off by how expensive things are but I think you should definitely try it once. If the price is whats stopping you I've heard the happy hour is awesome and features food and drink options for a lot cheaper. I'll definitely be checking out Uchi for happy hour soon!
