Local Foods////I eat here often, I'm a regular and live in the area. The food is awesome. The egg salad sandwich is best. Service is great except for a waitress named Gina. She is rude and lazy. Today I asked for ketchup and she told me they don't offer ketchup. I knew she told me that so she didn't have to go get it, so I went and asked someone else for ketchup. I've been eating here for 2 years, the service has Â been very good except for her.
