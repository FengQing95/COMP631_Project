Uchi////My wife and I arrived for dinner right at the tail end of the happy hour (6:30), and we were able to sneak in a couple items from this menu. The portions for the happy hour items tend to be a lot smaller, but a good deal cheaper than on the regular menu, which makes this a good option for trying more dishes. We started with the uchiviche (salmon ceviche) and walu walu (oak-grilled escolar), but neither of these were particularly memorable dishes. We then had the machi cure, which consisted of smoked yellowtail and served on yucca crisps (as if to resemble nachos)--flavorwise, this was an amazing dish, as the yellowtail had such a satisfying, complex, smokey essence.
