JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This was BY FAR the best ramen I've had in Houston. I ordered the tonkotsu black, my husband had the spicy miso. The spicy miso was indeed spicy. I preferred my order which was rich and flavorful. It's a big bowl but I was able to finish it off along with some tempura brussels sprouts (which I would skip next time).
