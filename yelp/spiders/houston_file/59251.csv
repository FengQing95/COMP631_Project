Baby Barnaby's////2. For their hash browns, they use the standard cube shape potato...HOWEVER, they fry it. And that my friend was pretty gangsta. I don't like most hash browns outside of the McDonald-Burger-king-fried type. And when I heard that they had the cube shaped-seasoned ones, I was a bit skeptical b/c they are just chopped up and sauteed. But yeah, these were good b/c it's fried. Who doesn't love fried food?
