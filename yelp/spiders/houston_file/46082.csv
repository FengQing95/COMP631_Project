Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My favoriteee place to get pastries in Houston. As soon as you walk into the shop, you'll find a glass full of pastries, bread and cake. If you ever have trouble deciding what to get... I HIGHLY recommend the kouign-amann. Out of all their croissants, the almond croissant is my go-to choice. It's fluffy on the inside while the outside has a crispy/flakey shell that's dusted with powdered sugar.
