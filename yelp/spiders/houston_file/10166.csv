JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was concerned when we first walked up that there was going to be a long wait.  There were people standing around in front.  Luckily, I think they were just ordering take out, because we were seated right away.  This was at 12:30 p.m. on a Sunday.  Surprisingly, at 1:15 p.m. when we left, there was a wait.  Guess people eat a later lunch on Sunday.
