JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Jued, Thanks for your review. I'm very sorry for your bad experience at JINYA. Please know that this is unacceptable and not at all how we operate our business. I have spoken to my managers and from what they can gather, this sounds like the front of house failing to communicate efficiently. And you are right -- any other server should have approached your table to doublecheck on you. For that I apologize. I hope you change your mind and revisit us, and if you do, please ask for any of our managers (Keith, Wynne, Raul or Sara), and they will make sure your experience is vastly superior to what you experienced due to our shortcomings.
