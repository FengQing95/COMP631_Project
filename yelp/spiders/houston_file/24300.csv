Uchi////Wow. I remember coming to the soft opening and liking this place, but not loving it because the vegetarian options were scant, but still so tasty - the brussel sprouts and eggplant nigiri. But my oh my, I looooooove the new vegetarian menu. This is now hands down my favorite sushi place in Houston. The items I tried and loved on the vegetarian menu were the uchi salad, shag roll, and kinoko nabe. I can't wait to go back and try their vegetarian tasting menu! Besides the food, the ambiance and service are great - definitely a nice place for a date or special occasion!
