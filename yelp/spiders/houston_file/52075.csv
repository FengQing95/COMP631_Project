Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I can't comment on how the food is when you dine in here as it's been a while, but I can safely say that the quality of the take-out is shit. Nearly a year ago I ordered some pancakes and a latte; the pancakes were literally burnt and the latte was genuinely the most burnt and disgusting one I've ever had. Then today I thought I'd try again and pretty much the same result--extremely overcooked, tough, inedible pancakes. Such a waste of money. Honestly I wonder if because they know it's an online order they just don't bother to try at all.
