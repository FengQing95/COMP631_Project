JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is always packed so expect really long wait times unless you are willing to hover by the bar to find a seat. My husband and I come here only for their vegan ramen. It is hands-down addicting and so delicious. We've eaten at the Midtown location many times but also order to-go to avoid waiting for a seat. Great service, great atmosphere.
