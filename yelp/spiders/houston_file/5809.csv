JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////In terms of food, I ordered the Tonkatsu Assari. The broth itself was smooth and not too salty, but everything else about the dish was average. The beef could've been seasoned better, and I felt the noodles weren't as chewy as I would expect. Needless to say, I was disappointed.
