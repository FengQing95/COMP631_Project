JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm sure we'll be back, I'll probably try the spicy chicken ramen, as it looked and was told by my friend it was really good. No real issues from beginning to end and they can do split checks. This newcomer definitely has an upper hand on not only the ramen, but ambiance when compared to all the other ramen places in town so far. Glad they opened this second location in town!
