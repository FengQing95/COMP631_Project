Local Foods////We stopped at Local Foods last weekend on our way to the Houston Zoo. My wife had the smoked salmon sandwich, I have the crunchy chicken sandwich and the vegan chili (no meat chili available, I'm not a vegan), and my daughter had a kid's grilled cheese. Everything was delicious... especially that smoked salmon sandwich. Even the vegan chili was very good, and I didn't really miss the meat.
