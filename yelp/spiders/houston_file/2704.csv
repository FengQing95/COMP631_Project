JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The decor and ambience of the place is pretty trendy, and the lighting was kinda dim for a good portion of the meal. The pricing of the food is slightly high, but nothing exorbitant. The wait staff was helpful in providing good suggestions, and the service was fine. I think one of the best attributes outside of the food is the location - since I live near the Med Center, there aren't many ramen places as accessible as Jinya. Jinya is a place I would love to come back to several times to explore the menu - the quality of the food seems to be quite high, which I have great appreciation for. It also appears to be a national chain, so that could be a positive reinforcement of the reputability for some. You should definitely try it, and I think it would be a great place to set your standard for Japanese ramen.
