Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was great and our waiter was super nice and asked us if we had any questions and gave great recommendations. I ended up getting the pancake flight with the Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup, Sweet Potato, and Peach Pie pancakes. All were great, but I think my favorite was the sweet potato pancake because it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet.
