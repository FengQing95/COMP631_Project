JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great ambience and feel when you walk in, we were asked to wait for a table and decided to have a drink at the bar. The bar tender was the most unpleasant and down right rude staff I've been served by in years. REALLY disappointing as this left a bad taste for the remainder of the night. Her attitude was foul, didn't smile or asked us to repeat our drink order several times. She then went on to roll her eyes and ask for a tip when we requested a split bill.
