JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Now onto the ramen! Since this was our first time here, we definitely tried to order their most popular items, such as the Tonkatsu black, Cha Cha Cha, and chicken ramens. Everyone in our party loved the ramen, from the rich broth to the al dente noodles to the perfectly cooked 62 degree egg. My friends loved the chicken ramen so much that they ordered some more to go for their kids to try. Â I also ordered the gyoza appetizer for our party as well, which was standard gyoza. Nothing too special or over the top about them.
