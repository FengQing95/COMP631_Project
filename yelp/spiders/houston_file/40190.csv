Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came here for brunch with three friends. I loved the vibe they had here --it was very chill and rustic. Our waiter was attentive and kind. We ordered a Mimosa Carafe for 4 people which was a solid 2 or so drinks per person. When I saw the donut burger on the menu, my first thought was "don't do it" but I'm glad I did. It was amazing! The concept of sugar/sweets with meat threw me off, but the sweet and salty flavor is perfect so if you're coming here just for that, you won't be disappointed.
