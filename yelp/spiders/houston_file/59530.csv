Baby Barnaby's////Arrived there and they was a little busy around lunch time, however when i got seat i could see what the wait was for lol. I order the french toast, two scrabble eggs with cheese, with the slice chicken. I must say i was taken back by the sliced chicken it taste as if i just came off the bbq grill. Overall i enjoy the food.
