Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////EDIT: A quick update. I recently bought a buche de noel from Common Bond. It was *perfect* - better than any cake I've bought from any US bakery in my memory. And I've gotten used to the seating, but with a kid, it still stinks. So now I come here alone when I have business meetings in Montrose.
