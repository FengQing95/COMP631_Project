Uchi////-Bacon Otoshi ($6): I probably wouldn't get this again but it was interesting!  If you like pork belly, def. get it though because the slices were very thick, fatty, juicy, drippy, all that good stuff.  The kimchi on top was almost like pork rind consistency, very strange, didn't taste like kimchi at all.  Textures were more interesting than the actual taste of the dish.
