Uchi////Best dishes were hama chili and of course fried milk dessert. This is a tapas-style place so we had 4 dishes and dessert to make for a meal for two people. Waiter shared that it is much easier to get in on a rainy day particularly before 7 p.m. We got there at 6:00 and were promptly seated. After that, I saw people standing through our whole meal nursing their drinks from the bar.
