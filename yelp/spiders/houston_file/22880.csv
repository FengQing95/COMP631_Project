Uchi////I took my boyfriend here for his birthday earlier this month and we enjoyed everything we ordered except two items. One being a roll called Yaki Niku Maki that I ordered because it had wagyu, dressed with beef fat powder on top that i did not like at all along with the tangy taste followed by the powdery texture with it. The sushi pieces here are so small and even tasted a bit bland to me. I know their concept is to achieve that perfect bite, but it just didn't happen for me.
