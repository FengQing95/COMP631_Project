Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////In town for a graduation, Bosscat's was suggested by a friend.  From walk-up to walk out, everything was on point.  The music selection played throughout kept us all grooving.  Hands down one of my top runners on shrimp and grits.  I cleaned my plate.  Folks, if your looking for a place that gives an upscale but relaxed environment, Bosskat's Kitchen is the place.  I only wish we had one in Dallas, TX but I will be back.  Good food, good drinks, good service.  Can't beat!!!
