JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Regarding the chashu, all of our ramens come with two slices of pork or chicken chashu. In fact, the Tonkotsu Assari originally came with only one slice of chashu, but after numerous customer concerns, we informed our corporate offices and ultimately changed our policy to provide two slices of pork chashu with the Assari (without changing its $9.95 base price). I'm also sorry your seasoned egg tasted "sour." Since that is not a concern we often hear regarding our eggs, I'd like to know if you received a replacement, which should have been provided immediately. It is no exaggeration to say that we prepare and serve upwards of 500 seasoned eggs per day, so by the law of probability, a certain percentage may not come out perfectly, in spite of our best efforts. But when we fail in this regard, we always try to remedy it as quickly as possible.
