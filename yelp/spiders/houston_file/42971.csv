Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is amazing, no matter what you get! I highly recommend the lavender lattes, they are so delicious! I've tried just about everything here from cookies and pastries to biscuits and gravy and I haven't been disappointed once. There is limited seating and don't be surprised if you have to stand in a line that goes out the door. Recommend you get there early on the weekends!
