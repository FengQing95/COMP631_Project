Kata Robata////This used to be my favorite neighborhood Japanese gourmet dining spot. Unfortunately, I think they've become too big for their britches. The food is still good and creative but the service has been truly lacking the last couple of visits. The hostesses tend to be curt, the waiters don't know their food and this last time we asked for an item apparently only available now at happy hour so they were unwilling to accommodate us. When compared to Uchi, this place now falls way short. So sad.
