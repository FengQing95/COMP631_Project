Baby Barnaby's////This place is perfect for breakfast/brunch. I went on a Sunday and it was busy but you get seated quickly. While waiting you can enjoy a cup of hot coffee. Their menu is not very extensive but the basics are there. They have this one dish called Green Eggs which I strongly recommend. Their potatoes are realllly good too and the biscuits were warm and had a touch of honey. Portions are just right. The service was great. One server running the show but she managed! Price is reasonable.
