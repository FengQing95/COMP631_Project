Local Foods////The restaurant is typically very crowded and there are several large community tables that I've sat at in the past. Atmosphere is hipster and healthy. Parking can be a nightmare but isn't it always in Rice Village? To-go orders are allowed. One of my go-to places when people come to Houston and ask for a lunch spot.
