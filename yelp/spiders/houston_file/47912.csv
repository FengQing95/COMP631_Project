Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The reason I gave 3 stars is for slow service and having to ask multiple times for water and hot sauce. A long wait for brunch is simply part of the brunch experience, so I don't even hold that against places like Snooze but the service WHILE you're waiting and once you sit down is still important. Last time I went on a weekday around 8am with my sister-in-law and nieces and the wait was only about 15-20 minutes which was great. There is a coffee-while-you-wait area but there was no coffee there so my SIL asked if they were going to bring some out. The server she asked didn't really respond and walked to the back and silently brought out one mug of coffee for her and walked away (didn't ask if anyone else wanted any or if she wanted cream or sugar, in fact didn't even stand there long enough for US to ask for cream or sugar). We had to wait another few minutes to get her attention again to ask for cream and sugar and she seemed PAINED by the request. I could totally understand her attitude if it was super busy and we were just asking for stuff out of the blue but to advertise coffee and then to act the way she acted when we just inquired about it didn't really make sense. Maybe she was just having a bad day. Our waiter that day was very friendly but very slow and seemed to forget about things we requested repeatedly (maybe he was new?).
