Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This restaurant was very busy and the wait time was long. I came with high hopes but was not impressed! The set up of the restaurant is very cute and modern. All of the staff was casual and friendly. Â The food was not as good as I had hoped. My pancakes were very crispy. :((((
