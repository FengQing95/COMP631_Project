Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Stopped in here after an event just to get a drink and nosh - found it due to the 1500+ reviews and 4.5 star rating here on Yelp.  I have to say, this is definitely one time when Yelpers nailed it!  Trying to find it was a slight challenge but the valet was easy to find and very polite.  Coming up to the door, we were really blown away with the setup.  It was a cool night so they had doors open to create an indoor/outdoor flow which was really nice.  The interior is super nice - industrial chic concept.  Happily, there was a DJ on Friday nights and so there was great music to go along with the great ambiance.  We got in and were seated right away.  The menu is pretty straightforward and isn't extensive, but you get the sense that they focus on what they can do well.  We ordered the meatloaf appetizer since it described deep frying meatloaf - and if you dip anything in grease, I'm likely going to try it - LOL.  It came with basically fancy ketchup and was ok but I felt the meatloaf should have been seasoned better.  We also tried the portobello mushroom fries and they were FIRE!  As for drinks  - we both tried The Good Life and it was delish!!! All in all, it was a great time, I definitely want to go back.
