Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Everything in this place feels sterile and market research driven, from the faux retro decor to the menu to the food. None of the coffee items were very good, a far step behind many of our local establishments. The food itself was underwhelming, with the pancakes (cinnamon, peaches, and chocolate chip) all tasting rather bland. Everything looked like it was prepackaged and heated up for. I basically had a glorified Big Breakfast from McDonalds.
