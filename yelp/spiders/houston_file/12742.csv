JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Came here for dinner, love this place! The layout of the restaurant is nice and casual. The drinks and food are awesome! The broth has so much flavor!!! There was an hour wait around 6pm on Friday night, and they don't take reservations. So don't show up starving because you wont be seated soon. Although, you can grab a delicious cocktail at the bar while you wait.
