Local Foods////Absolutely love local foods! Their pretzel bun makes me want to drool at the thought of it. I ordered the chicken sandwich and side of chicken soup. The soup tasted fresh and well made. My friend ordered the Asian salad which was also very good. The one thing I didn't really care for was the side of kale salad, only because they add cheese into the salad and it just doesn't go well together in my opinion. Other than that, food is great here! Get the fresh chips too!
