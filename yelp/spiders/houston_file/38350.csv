Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I'm a whiskey girl. Let me say that first. The drinks are amazing. Great bartenders willing to take the time for suggestions. And the short rib was melt in your mouth, take me to heaven level. Was in town for a conference, traveling by myself and sitting at the bar was the most fun experience. Felt comfortable and taken care of! Will def come again!!
