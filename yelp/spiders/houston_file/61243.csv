Baby Barnaby's////One of my favorite brunch places in Houston! I LOVE their green eggs which include eggs scrambled with cheese, spinach and artichoke hearts. It comes with chicken sausage, home fries, and toast! SO DELICIOUS! Their French toast is also great! It's mostly street parking in the neighborhood and it gets crowded on the weekends but it's worth the wait. The space inside is small, but the food and service make it worth your time.
