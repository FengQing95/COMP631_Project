JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great Ramen! I've been here many times and the food have been consistently great. Service is always good. But last time I went there, I was very disappointed with the hostesses. We got there at 11:30am on Sunday, 3 adults, 3 kids. They said there will be 20 mins wait and gave us a beeper. People came after us have been seated but we thought because their group is smaller. But the group of 8 came in and they got seated right away. We went to ask them why are they seated before us?, their response was "well, I was about to beep you. Your seat is ready". When we walk in, there were still bunch of seats available. They never explained to us why we had to wait.
