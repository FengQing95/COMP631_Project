JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////After hearing so many good things about Jinya, I was finally able to try it out, but I'm sad to report that it did not live up to the hype. When we first arrived, there was a lengthy line ahead of us, and it took us 45 minutes to get seated. I will admit that the ambiance is very cool, and the modern decorations put the room together nicely.
