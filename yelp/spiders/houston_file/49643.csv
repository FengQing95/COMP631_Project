Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We waited a full hour before checking in. When I went to the desk to check ETA I was told our reservation was canceled and we would be seated immediately. Great. Except that means we should've been seated earlier. After being seated we ordered water and our food. It's now been over 30 minutes and nothings come out.
