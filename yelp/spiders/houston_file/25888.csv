The Pit Room////Don't go here if you have babies/infants. It's the most kid unfriendly place I've been. It's packed with hipsters and there's no room to sit and eat a decent meal with your children. Be prepared to take your kids outside in 100+ degrees to eat BBQ on crammed, single file decking, that people keep walking past. Oh, and the black flies buzzing around constantly. The food is ok, but nothing to write home about. It's not worth the trouble. And it's expensive. Meat portions are small.
