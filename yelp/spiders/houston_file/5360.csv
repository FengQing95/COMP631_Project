JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ten more people are seated. I repeat, 10 more people. Over the course of the next 50 minutes, we watched everyone else at the table get served before us, while our server came by to see if we had even received our gyoza - cause no one told him it had been dropped off a few minutes after 9. Ramen came out at 9:45. I informed the manager of the situation as we left.
