Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food finally came and we had fries, chilaquiles, and the chorizo potato benedict. I liked the flavor of the Benedict but the two dishes were pretty similar in texture (covered in sauce) and became mushy and overwhelming. But while I'm not a huge fan of fat fries, the fries ended up being our favorite item. However, it came with a chowchow catsup and my friend wanted ketchup instead so he asked the waiter who again said sure but brought us another tin....of the same sauce it came with. We later found that we were actually even charged for this tin of chowchow catsup we had never even wanted!
