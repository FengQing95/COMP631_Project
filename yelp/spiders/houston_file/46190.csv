Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////LOVE the cookies!! By far their best dessert even though it seems to be their simplest. I've tried both their Triple Chocolate Brown Butter Cookie and Chocolate Chip Walnut Cookie and omg they're so delicious. It's the right amount of chewy center and slightly crunchy on the edges. It's not diabetes-inducing sweet but it definitely hits that sweet tooth. I'd venture to say that this is the best cookie I've had in Houston so far.
