Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Me and my friend came from out of town and decided to try this place out. Let me just say that the food was amazing. Everything tastes exquisite! What made the experience phenomenal was the customer service that we received from Tommy our waiter! He remained attentive throughout our visit. He made sure we had everything we needed. Never in my 23 years of living have I ever received such amazing customer service. Overall, I was really impressed with the experience I had at this restaurant! Keep up the good work (:
