Local Foods////Not much more to say than, brilliant. But to add a little more context, I'll explain. Great atmosphere, healthy and tasty food, very reasonable prices, and awesome customer service. For you few and far between healthy eaters in Houston this is a great option. Neatly nestled in Rice Village, this hidden gem may soon become unless I'm late, the talk of the town. The kale side was outstanding in my opinion. The falafel sandwich was just....amazingly breathtakingly awesomeness in your mouth :) and if you want to throw caution to the wind with your diet, grab a mug of the homemade potato chips! Two words... NOT OK. :-)!!!
