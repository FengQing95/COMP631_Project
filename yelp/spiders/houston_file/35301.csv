Local Foods////I was looking for food around Rice Village and this place was on my bookmarked list so there's that. I asked around what the best sellers and such and so I ended up with a shredded steak and gouda sandwich for my friend and a smoked salmon sandwich for myself. There were so many sides to choose from. I picked a beet salad, potato salad (hard pass) and the butternut squash soup. The guy at the register three in a free cookie for us first timers. Drool.
