JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Always have a fun and great experience here. The staff is always friendly. The pork buns are really good and better than others I've had before. The dumplings are also very good and usually I have to order more! I get the sprouting up spicy ramen, I love the spice and the crispy Brussel sprouts! I also change my noodles to the spinach ones which I also love! Their drinks are fun and in my opinion strong but I did really enjoy the lychee martini.
