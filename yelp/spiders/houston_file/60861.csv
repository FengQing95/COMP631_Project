Baby Barnaby's////There's no hostess to seat you, but you'll see a clipboard hanging from a post on the porch- that's the wait list, so be sure to put your name and party size on there as soon as possible to get in line. Then sit back, relax, and wait for your group to be called. Be careful, though, because if you miss your call, then you will be crossed off the list and have to wait even longer for a table!
