JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had the No.1 tonkatsu black and my friend had cha cha cha which I had a taste of. I actually like the broth and the thick noodle of cha cha cha better. The egg is well seasoned. I wish they could cut it in half for me rather than giving me the whole one. The pork chashu is so good, it melts in my mouth.
