Uchi////The place totally lives up to the hype around it! Food is beyond fantastic. The servers are extremely hospitable and help you with the menu. I have been to the restaurant quite a few times now and it Â NEVER disappoints. Staff is excellent , from the person who receives you at the door to the servers. If you enjoy Japanese food, it's a MUST VISIT!
