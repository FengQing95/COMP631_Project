Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////After reading such great reviews, I had high hopes for this place. Unfortunately, I was left wanting more. The ambiance is fun and the service is pretty good, but the food was mediocre at best. The portobello mushroom fries appetizer was pretty good, as were the cornbread madeleines and the seasonal lemonade (prickly pear when I went). However, the mushroom quinoa burger was salty and, at $14 for just the burger, way too overpriced. Probably won't return here.
