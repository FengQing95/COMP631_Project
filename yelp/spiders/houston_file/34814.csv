Local Foods////FOOD: Healthy, consistent, amazing, affordable, filling, never a disappointment, just SO good. My go-tos are either the egg salad, crunchy chicken, and garden sandwich with a side of chips and kale salad (always get kale salad) and blood orange lemonade. You can't ever go wrong. Plus, you can get a very good and filling meal for under $10!
