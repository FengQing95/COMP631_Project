JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Since I'm a big fan of brussels sprouts, we ordered the tempura Brussels sprouts for appetizer. They were just ok to me. The tempera was good, but it just felt like the actual Brussels sprout was missing seasoning or something that could've made it a while lot better. We dipped it in the ramen seasoning and gyoza sauce that's provided on the table and that made it better. I'd probably not order it again and try another starter next time.
