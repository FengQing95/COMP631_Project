The Pit Room////I won't waste time with a bunch of unnecessary explaining. Let's jus run down the definition of 'fuego'; the beef rib, all variations of the sausage, chicken, BRISKET, ELOTE, mac & cheese, okra, homemade bbq sauce Â .. the tacos obviously. And the damn service. No matter where this journey in life takes me .. as long as this joint is open I won't be hard to find when that bbq craving hits.
