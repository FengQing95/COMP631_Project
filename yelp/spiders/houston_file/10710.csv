JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We got here on a Saturday evening for dinner around 7.30pm. We didn't want to sit at the community table and preferred waiting. We were told the wait time would be 35-40 minutes and it was actually only 5 minutes. We got the pork dumping appetizer, leeche martini (I loved it), creamy vegan ramen and sprouting up pork ramen. The food was delicious!!! I like my ramen warm and not hot, but my husband prefers it hot so he had to send his back for more time on the stove. Other than that it was great, highly recommend!
