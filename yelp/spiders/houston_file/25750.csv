The Pit Room////Wow. It takes a lot for me to give a BBQ place 5 stars but this place is great. Meats were delicious. Pork ribs were huge. When I ordered they were out of turkey so I ordered pulled pork. It was succulent and lean. No fatty chewy pieces. They brought out turkey when we sat down. Just a little " on the house". It was tender and juicy. Beer was cold and Karbach. Sausage was flavorful and sauce on the side was perfect with a little Texas kick.
