Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////One the worse experiences I have had in a long time regrading breakfast. I order an omelette with veggies and bacon . Well it came  tis the table with mushrooms and onions ( where is my bacon)?  I went there because I smelled the bacon down the street and was very disappointed. The service was really terrible! My server came to the table one time out of the hour I sent my waiting on my so-called breakfast. In my opinion this place should closed immediately!!! If there were zero starts..... !!!
