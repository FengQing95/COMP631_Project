Kata Robata////The service at Kata is minimalist but effective. Perhaps owing to our larger group, I did notice that some of the dishes were lukewarm by the time they arrived at our table, which was unfortunate. But no real complaints otherwise. I would give the experience a 4.5/5 overall. Without doubt one of the finest spots in Houston, but neither meal necessarily left me dying to return as soon as humanly possible.
