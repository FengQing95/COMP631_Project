Kata Robata////I've been here many times because I work nearby. Lunch and dinner is great.  The service could be slow because of the high capacity diners at peak times.  I enjoy the sashimi bento for lunch.  The quality and portion is better than any other near by Japanese restaurants. Other than that, I recommend the hot dishes, especially the miso cod or kakuni.  They both melt in your mouth.  To me the sashimi and the rolls are okay.  They can improve on that part.  I feel like Kata Robata is more of a modernized Japanese cuisine.
