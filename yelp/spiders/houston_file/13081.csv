JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For my entree, I ordered the JINYA Tonkotsu Black. The base is a pork broth with pork Chashu, kikurage, green onion, nori dried seaweed, a seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, and fried onions. It's served with thin noodles. I was a big fan of the broth. I thought the broth I had from Tiger Den a few weeks ago was bland compared to JINYA's broth. The egg was cooked perfectly and was still runny on the inside. Other ramen bowls ordered at the table were the spicy miso and premium Tonkotsu White. The spicy miso was extremely spicy I heard, so I didn't bother tasting it. The premium Tonkotsu White has a pork and chicken broth base, and lacks the seaweed, garlic chips, and garlic oil in the Tonkotsu Black. I would recommend the Tonkotsu Black over the white.
