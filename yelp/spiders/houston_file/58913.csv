Baby Barnaby's////This was my first time trying baby barnabys. The wait at 11am on a Sunday was about 20 minutes. We sat inside and our waitress was very nice and helpful. I even noticed that the Scott, the manager was very attentive and smiley with other customers. We ordered migas, pancakes to share, and green eggs. The food came out in about 10 minutes. No big deal. We started eating and the food was really really good. But then my boyfriend saw hair in his eggs and all we wanted was to tell the manager so we can get a new plate of migas. For five minutes we tried getting Scott's attention. We even made eye contact with him about 4 times while screaming "excuse me sir!" He would look at us and look away and start talking to, literally everyone around us- People behind me, next to me, In front of me, and walking by me. The last time we screamed excuse me, he walked away with his back toward us and mumbled " give me a second". When he came back to our table my boyfriend said "sorry to trouble you but..." Scott walks away and starts to put menus away. He comes back and my boyfriend is able to finish his sentence "there's a hair in my food." Scott takes the plate and walks away. (No apology, didn't ask if we needed anything, etc) he comes back with the plate and says with his hand on his hip "can u show me where the hair is so I can show the cook? And did you have it with chorizo or no chorizo"
