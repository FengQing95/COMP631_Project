Uchi////Their waitstaff is amazing. Always tentative and very knowledgeable about their sushi/plates. Please don't ruin your sushi with soy sauce. lol Trust me. It's THAT fresh and amazing. Although this place is kind of pricy, I would say it's worth it. Probably $150 per price with drinks depending on what you want to try.
