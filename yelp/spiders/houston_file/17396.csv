Uchi////Uchi has ruined all other sushi restaurants for my boyfriend and I!!! We loved everything about it and we tried nearly everything! The bill was a bit crazy but for that kind of quality, creativity, service and execution it was worth every penny! The grilled edmame was to die for! It sounds so simple and uneventful but it was very delicious and unexpected. So Good!! Â We've had sushi all over the US and nothing tops Uchi.
