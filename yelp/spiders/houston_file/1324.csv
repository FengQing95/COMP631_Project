JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I heard rave reviews of this place from several friends and was incredibly disappointed by the mediocre ramen here. I went twice just to make sure it wasn't a fluke, but was equally unimpressed with my second visit. Over-salted chicken soup does not equal ramen broth. And add ins are overpriced. I really do not recommend Jinya ramen.
