JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Overall, the small plates and appetizers don't compare to Tiger Den. This is where the two differ the most. However, the discrepancy between the ramen isn't as far apart, especially if you're in the mood for a chicken based broth. Even though the Tokyo Yatai was my third favorite, it was still alright. There's no doubt in my mind that they can improve and I hope they do. Their quick success highlights the demand Houstonians have for an inner loop ramen restaurant, which will hopefully push for more openings in the future
