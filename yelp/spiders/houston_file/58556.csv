Baby Barnaby's////When we don't feel like waiting a million hours in line for the Breakfast Klub, this is our go to spot. The location is so quaint and the food is wonderful (especially the green eggs). I wish the booths were a tad more spacious/comfortable, but the intimacy of the restaurant is a part of the restaurant's character. P.S. Make sure you like the company you're brunching with because you'll definitely be sitting extremely close during the dining experience lol
