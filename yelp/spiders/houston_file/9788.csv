JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////And pardon with my ignorance of Ramen noodles (noodles itself)because it was recent that I've had this 40 different kind of ramen noodles of urs....the noodles in Chiba, Tokyo and Yokohama are the same as most of the restaurants in the west and southwest of Houston. Only the new ramen places in downtown and your place got that much varities of ramen (and it is US). I've never been in far south of Japan and didn't get the chance to try the ramen at the north.
