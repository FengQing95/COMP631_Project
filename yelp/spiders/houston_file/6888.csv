JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Both were very tasty, I only wish that had put more bean sprouts in the Ramen, I counted 6 bean sprouts total.  I got mine mild, because I learned from the last ramen spot I needed the control over the spice they use.  The condiments are on the table here so it was easy to do.
