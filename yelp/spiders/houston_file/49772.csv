Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////First; I loved the way it works and I will break it down for y'all. You get there and if there is a wait time they get your number and text you when your table is ready. So we had some time to run some errands before we got to order and there is plenty street parking. Our server, Travis was super nice and explained the menu really well.
