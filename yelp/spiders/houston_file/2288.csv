JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went there on a rainy Sunday night and lo there was still a 30 minutes wait... Not plenty of spaces to wait for seat since the place itself isn't that huge. Tried the tantanmen based on my friend recommendation and boy, I sure didn't get disappointed. It was off the menu, but the waitstaffs should know about it. Definitely the 1st place in Houston that serve this kind of dish. It's like a Taiwanese dry egg noodle with minced pork, but it also has a bit of hot sauce to give a little kick. There's a parking garage in the back of the shop if it still has spaces - this area has few popular restaurant, so parking is gonna be a hassle during meal times or weekends.
