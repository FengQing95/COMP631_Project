Kata Robata////I would say this is a solid 4.0 stars for me - the reason being is it's just a small step below MF sushi and Uchi IMO. Compared to the other two I just mentioned it comes second in terms of wow factor. However, this place still has a lot to offer. The seaweed (dinner) salad is very unique because it has 5 different varieties of seaweed which is really cool - presentation and taste are on point. The lobster Mac and cheese and the black cod are both very tasty. The sushi is all great quality and the drinks are good. Pretty much everything on the menu is a great choice. Â It is always very busy so make sure you make a reservation. Happy hour is also great here if you are trying to save a few bucks. All in all a great place when you're craving sushi.
