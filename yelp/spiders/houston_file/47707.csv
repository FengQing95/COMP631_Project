Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I saw "Hot and New" on Yelp! Then I started hearing about it from others. I was hearing things like, you should get there early because its a wait due to everyone being so interested. With all of that being said, my wife and I decided to try it out during our anniversary weekend. We arrived around 10ish and had an hour + wait. That's fine if you're in the mode of exploring and experimenting. Of course if I'm starving, that's not going to work.. LOL!  Upon arrival you will stand in line to advise how many are in your party. At that point, they will let you know if there is a wait and how long the wait will be. If there is a wait they will take your  name and phone number so that they can send you a text when a table is ready. With this type of set up, I would suggest going with someone that you enjoy spending time with such as a significant other or a cool group of friends. I personally would use this time to chill, talk and have a good time while waiting. Well this will work only if going out to eat is for social reasons and not solely to eat. If you're the nice couple that's in the corner of the restaurant eating and not talking, I guess this arrangement is NOT appealing to you. ha! Ok - let me move forward. One main thing that I look for, outside of outstanding food, in my dinning experience is atmosphere and great service. I will drive across town, as you can see, to have this experience. Snooze provides a great atmosphere with a diverse group of people, reflected in employees and customers. Since I'm not much of a breakfast foods person, I lean towards restaurants that offer a brunch type menu with creative choices. Snooze does a lot of creative things with pancakes. So, if you want to take pancakes to a new level, please give them a try. Another great thing is they use quality ingredients, such as cage free eggs in their food dishes. They also offer different milk choices, other than whole milk. I had the breakfast pot pie (sausage gravy, flaky puff pastry type breading) with a side of hash browns. You see? That's my kind of stuff. I look forward to returning and experiencing a few more items from the menu. Snooze also gives back to the local community by donating 1% of their earnings and pancakes!!! They're open daily from 6:30am - 2:30pm so get there as early as possible to avoid the long wait.
