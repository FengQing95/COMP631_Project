The Pit Room////We came in here on a trip to the area. We wanted to try some good BBQ and heard this was a popular spot that can often have a line, so we got there at 11am to beat the rush. They offer a range of meats from pulled pork, beef brisket, ribs, sausage, turkey and chicken as well as some good sides. I opted for the one meat dinner and had brisket as it's my favourite meat and it was tender and full of flavor. I had Mac and cheese which was creamy and charro beans which had a spice but we're also good. My hubby had the 2 meat dinner with spicy jalapeno sausage and the brisket (same sides) which he enjoyed. We ordered some pulled pork to go so looking forward to trying that. Service was fast, you choose your food at a counter and they have someone coming to collect trash and wipe tables promptly. Definately worth a try!
