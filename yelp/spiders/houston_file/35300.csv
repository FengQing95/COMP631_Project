Local Foods////I absolutely adore Local Foods. I've been to several locations around Houston throughout the years and have enjoyed each one. Check the specific menu for the location you plan on visiting, as they may vary some. I promise though, you'll love any one and anything you try. My personal favorite is the Truffled Egg Salad Sandwich. If you hear "egg salad" and think, "boring", I challenge you to try this one from Local Foods! It comes on a pretzel bun and is to die for. The next time you go back, try the "Crunchy" Chicken Sandwich. Also a great one!
