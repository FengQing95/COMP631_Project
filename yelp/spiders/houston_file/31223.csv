Local Foods////Are you a foodie who loves fresh, delicious flavors, local food, and lots of veggies? Then stop reading and get yourself to Local Foods! It's perfectly executed with a nice industrial/modern vibe, amazing sandwiches (pretzel bun win!) and fresh, deliciously seasoned veggies. All wine/spirits/beer are Texas local! My egg salad sandwich was $9.50 with two sides, which I feel is totally reasonable for the amount and quality of food. Their specialty drink, mint-ade, was an awesome, fruity surprise. I added a splash of iced tea to cut the sourness. I'll definitely be back!
