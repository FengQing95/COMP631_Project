Uchi////I'll start with the food.  In one word: divine. We ordered 6 or 7 dishes and each one was delicious, creative, thoughtful, and intelligently put together.  We ordered a few items off the daily specials menu and a few off the everyday menu.  I don't recall all the names but here are a few:  madai carpaccio, hamachi nabe, ham&eggs, foie nigiri.  All amazing.  I was very impressed.
