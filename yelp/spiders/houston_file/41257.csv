Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Brunch was excellent. We had fresh squeezed orange juice,  hot mocha,  beef & cheese grits, breakfast sandwich and a chocolate chip walnut cookie.   The eggs were cooked runny,  but we asked for well done,  however they quickly fixed it.  We had no complaints.   The food was tasty. Parking was easy. The WiFi was fast and the place had good vibes.
