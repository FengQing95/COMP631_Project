Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////came at 1 and got a snack, asked is they will have the eclairs(and other deserts) at around 5 pm she said no????!!!! wtf this place is suppose to be serving desertssss.... I'm sick of places that do you a favor that they're making what they proud for... you are a bakery so provide the same quality bakery until close time!!
