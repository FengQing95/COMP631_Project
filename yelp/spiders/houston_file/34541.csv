Local Foods////I consider myself a true sandwich enthusiast, so when I noticed that Houston Press awarded Local Foods "Best Sandwich" in 2012 and then gave them another award in 2013, I was mighty disappointed in myself for never dining at this place. After drooling over the menu online and living vicariously through others' Yelp reviews for the past few days, I finally made the trip to Local Foods for an early dinner with my family and ate a sandwich that exceeded my highest expectations.
