JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Not sure if I can just pleasantly surprised, really hungry, or it was that amazing but I really enjoyed the ramen here. Houston is not the first place that comes to mind when I think ramen but it was delicious. I forget which bowl I ordered but I also got extra seaweed on the side and did not regret it. The broth was very flavorful without being overly salty though I knew to still drink plenty of water later that night. Everything tasted fresh and the noodles were good too. If you're in Houston and looking for something hot and delicious, I'd recommend this place.
