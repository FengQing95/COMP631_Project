Kata Robata////If you're not too experience in sushi and what you know is the california roll then I definitely recommend the King Crab California. It is everything the California roll is, but leveled up. The King Crab sweet and freshness penetrates through the whole roll and you get a whole mouth full of fresh and sweetness every time.
