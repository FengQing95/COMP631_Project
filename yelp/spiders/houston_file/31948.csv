Local Foods////The dining area is nowhere near as inviting as Ruggles Green, but as I mentioned from the outset, Local Foods really feels more like a take to-go place anyway. If you want a fantastic sit-down ambiance, I recommend heading next door to benjy's during happy hour. Your bill will likely come out cheaper, to boot. But if you're digging the whole locally sourced craze, Local Foods will tickle your fancy.
