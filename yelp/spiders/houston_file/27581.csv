The Pit Room////The best brisket I've had in Houston so far. Make sure you order "moist" brisket! The lean brisket looks like it's on the drier side but the moist version is juicy with the perfect amount of fattiness without being too overwhelming. The beef sausages were a little on the drier side but the flavor was amazing. I just couldn't get enough. We also got mac and cheese for a side which was tasty as well. As for the BBQ sauce, it complimented each meat well. Will be back for my BBQ cravings!
