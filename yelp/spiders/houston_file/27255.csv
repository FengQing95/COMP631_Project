The Pit Room////It honestly kinda ruined the whole experience as I sat there eating thinking about how they had to take some of the meat away in order to add another meat we were paying for. To put it simply, I won't be coming back. Overall, the value this place offers doesn't justify the price for me and I really don't understand why so many people swear by this place in reviews and say it's the best BBQ they've had. There's much better barbecue places in Houston.
