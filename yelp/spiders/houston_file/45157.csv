Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My friends and I came here for brunch on a Sunday in hopes of some good food and drinks. The restaurant has a small parking lot attached which seems to have enough spots for the capacity of the place. There are menus available while you wait in line to order. You start off ordering drinks and then walk by pastries and pick what you like. At the end if you want an entree you can order it there. We ended up getting expresso drinks and the beef with cheesy grits and egg. The beef was tender and tasty, certainly the highlight of the meal. The grits were a little watery, and when combined with the egg (which inevitably breaks) can get even more watery. The Expresso beverages were delicious! I got the Americano with a splash of milk, and loved the hint of creaminess amidst the light flavor of the expresso.
