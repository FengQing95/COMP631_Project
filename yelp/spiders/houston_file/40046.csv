Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Libations is in the name of the place and it means drink, so I took that as my cue to steer away from my usual beer and try one of their libations.  I love some rum, and My Only Vice stood out to me.  Now that was a well crafted drink.  I sipped and savored every last drop of it.  It had a nice tropical feel to it on this hot summer night.  I am far from a whiskey drinker, but everyone in the group got some sort of whiskey drink and they were all tasty.
