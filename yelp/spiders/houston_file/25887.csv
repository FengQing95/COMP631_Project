The Pit Room////Unfortunately the best parts of our recent visit (Jan 1) were the green beans and the busser guy (seriously so polite and friendly). The brisket was extremely dry, pork ribs lacked flavor, Mac and cheese was bland and boring. Was very disappointed as we had read such great reviews about it.
