Baby Barnaby's////It is pretty much the smallest restaurant ever but it reminds me of Austin and that makes me happy. I had been going to the Barnaby's Caf√© next to it for years. I always laughed at the super ridiculously long line at Baby Barnaby's everytime I drove by. I eventually tried it and now know why the line is always long!
