Uchi////BUT -- the best part of that meal was the vegetable nabe. If you are a vegetarian, vegan, or just a darn human being, order the vegetable nabe! If you don't know how to pronounce it, then ask for a hot bowl that has veggies and rice in it. Ask and you shall receive! The contents of what lies in that bowl, my friend, are the jubilant tears of a nobel archangel. Those tears were most likely reserved the day they feasted their eyes on the creation of all things good by the hands of God. If that's not it, then darnit, that stuff was GEWD!! It was an intimate experience where inaudible sounds of eternal bliss is welcomed. Talking is unnecessary and rude.
