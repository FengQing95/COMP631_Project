JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We came here on a Thursday night, sometime around 9pm. I just moved to Texas a little over two weeks ago and this place has been bookmarked since the day I got here. It's just not in the area I'm staying at so I didnt get the chance to make it there right away. We happened to be in the area Thursday so we HAD to go have dinner there. The place was pretty full and we had to wait about 40 minutes for 5 of us to be seated. I expected this considering the high reviews! We waited outside so our kids can run around until our little buzzer started vibrating.
