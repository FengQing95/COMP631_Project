JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We came in a Cold Tuesday night. There was a wait, but we find some stools at the bar and ordered us a round while we wait. The bartenders were busy, yet polite. I had three olive cherry with water on the rocks. I can't really judge the drinks by that now huh!? Pretty hard to mess it up. However, my girlfriend I was with ordered the lychee martini and I tried a sip. It as pretty tasty. Prices of drinks weren't bad. I'd say your average $5 domestic and about $8-$10 mix drinks.
