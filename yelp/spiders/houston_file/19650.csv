Uchi////I'm so used to the super attentive service I get at Uchi/Ko that I had high expectations for my first visit in Houston. Usually it's "Sit down, hot towels. Any sign of trash or dirty dish, picked up immediately." But our waiter didn't come to the table for a good 5-10 minutes. We sat around waiting for him to come back to order, he passed our table a few times, had to flag him for the check, then waited some more for him to pick up the card.
