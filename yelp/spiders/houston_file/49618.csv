Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food had great taste! The Steak Benny was great a bit pricey $15. Over all experience great! The only downside the wait time was between 1 hour to 1 hour and a half. They did provide water and coffee while you waited. Parking was limited. Family friendly. Great drink selection from spiked coffee to teas.
