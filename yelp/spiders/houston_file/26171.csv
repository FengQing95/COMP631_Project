The Pit Room////I was in Houston for the week and was lucky enough to enjoy a Texas BBQ experience at the Pit Room! Recommended from one of the local Houston Mgrs, my colleagues and I enjoyed our first night out at the Pitt. Without any doubts I am rating the Pit a 5/5 as this is a Top3 BBQ joint on my leaderboard. I walked in with basically no wait, but as I was eating I definitely saw a flood of hungry Texans jump into line. Word in the neighborhood is that the Pitt is a newer restaurant so it is a clearly a popular choice! For my meal, I went for the 3-meat combo which unfortunately did not include a beef rib. I definitely went into a food coma after I dominated this meal, but if I went with one of the massive beef ribs too then I could have ended up in the a seriously deep food coma and in the BBQ emergency room. I went for the brisket, beef sausage, chicken meat combo, a side of coleslaw, and an ice cold beer. The brisket and beef sausage were some of the best that I have ever had! I definitely want to go back soon to try those massive beef ribs too which I believe weigh in at 1.5lbs or more per rib! The Pitt master told me they ran out of beef ribs which is always a sign of the food being a fan favorite. Other than the delicious meat options, the Pitt offers a local selection of draught beers and sauces. After the meal on this 65 degree evening, my colleagues and I walked right next door to the bar which is basically connected to the Pit. Many people in the bar had BBQ treys and enjoyed the best of the worlds. Thank you for a delicious Texan BBQ experience!
