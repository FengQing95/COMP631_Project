JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had the chicken ramen, it had a very flavorful and deep broth but I wasn't a big fan of the thin noodles. It wasn't authentic enough and I had better ramen before. Â But the appetizers were amazing. They were all soo good and was literally gone in few minutes. I would come back just to order appetizers.
