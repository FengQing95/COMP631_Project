The Pit Room////The coffee bourbon sauce is MONEY!!! I could drink that sauce all day. Came by the pit room because it's on the new Top 50 BBQ List, and I got the three meat plate. I got the brisket, pork ribs, and the venison sausage for the meats and mac & cheese and mustard potato salad for the sides.
