Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is definitely one of the hottest brunch spots in Houston right now. I don't think I've ever passed by it without seeing a swarm of people outside waiting for a table. I've went a couple times now and tried a variety of things on the menu. All of the pancakes and french toast options are to die for! They change their a menu a bit from season to season so there's always new flavors to check out as well. I'd recommend getting the pancake flight for the table as an appetizer so everyone can have a couple bites of each and try a variety. I've also had their egg white frittata which is great as well. I appreciate that they have a couple menu items for those that are more health conscience (see "light as a feather"). Lots of brunch places fail to do this and I think its a thoughtful addition. My only reason to give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the wait. I'm a huge planner and love making reservations to places so that we don't have to play the waiting game. Unfortunately Snooze doesn't allow reservations and is on a first come first serve basis. If you want to beat the crowd I'd say check it out on week day if possible. If not then just plan ahead and allocate at least 45 mins of waiting time. If you're in this situation go check out Crossroads which is right around the corner. It's a hidden gem of a consignment shop that I stumbled upon. Good way to make time pass quickly!
