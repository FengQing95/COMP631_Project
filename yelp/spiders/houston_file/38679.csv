Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////have the right amount of kick! The menu is unique yet not so eclectic that you're not sure of what you are ordering and the food Â is wonderfully flavored. The ambience is incredible for a girl's night out, first date, happy hour or dinner alfresco. The food, drinks, and people are wonderful (ask for Jose;-)!
