The Pit Room////At around 8pm on a Friday, there was a line actually leaving the door, so I figured this place would be bomb. (By the time I'd left, the line was going across the parking lot!) However, the line moved quickly, as the service is pretty fast. I think I waited 30 minutes or less. You seat yourself (it's wouldn't seem like it, but there are plenty of places to seat yourself even though this place gets *packed*) after going through the lines for food/pickled veggies.
