Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came to Bosscat for brunch and will definitely have to come back for dinner. Cocktails were delicious. Tried the pineapple sage elixir and 'so fresh and so clean', which was very refreshing. The shrimp and grits was fantastic! Comfort food at its finest. The sauce really made the dish.
