The Pit Room////I can't tell you how excited I was to try the Q from this restaurant because I've seen many people comparing it to Killen's BBQ and I'm a big fan of Killen's BBQ. So when I had that first bite of the brisket, OH MY GAWhhdroooooooollllllssss.... it was pretty damn good. And then I tried the potato salad; solid! And the mac n cheese. Oh em gee, the mackincheez was probably one of the better ones I've had in a long while. Â
