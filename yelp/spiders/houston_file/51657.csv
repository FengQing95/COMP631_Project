Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Whew y'all it should be a sin how good their breakfast is!! My mom, friend and I were literally in a food coma because we could not stop eating. The Spuds Deluxe and Funky Monkey French Toast are MUSTS!! You can do half order or the french toast in case you want to try both! Super flavorful and fresh! Drink of choice -- Mountain Mule with Vodka. I don't like grapefruit juice but it's amazing in the mule. They play great music as well and the staff always seem friendly and happy to serve each customer. Highly recommend!
