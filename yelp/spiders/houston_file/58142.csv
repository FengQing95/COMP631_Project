Kata Robata////Andy and Vicki served us at this delicious restaurant... they were very helpful and kind!! Definitely ask for them when you're there. The fish here are all high quality which I love Â I loved all the dishes you see here in my pictures.... especially the otoro sashimi, oyster, Kobe beef skewer (we ate too fast to get a pic), and wagyu shumai!! The only item I was not a fan of was the foie gras- too rich for me at that moment. Overall, I would go there again when I'm in town.
