Uchi////I came here with my family to celebrate both my and my mother's birthdays. We went on a Sunday evening for their happy hour, and we basically ordered everything on their menu. The portions are really tiny but that allows you to sample more of their dishes, and if you come for happy hour, food is much more reasonably priced. (Unless you order their specialty foods like the miso cured duck). The atmosphere is of course lovely and a nice mixture between intimate, lively, modern, and traditional. (I know what a dichotomy right?) Also, the money you pay definitely goes towards the service too! We had a very attentive and professional waiter that definitely knew what he was talking about in terms of what foods to order.
