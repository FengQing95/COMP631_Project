Local Foods////After 1 visit, I am in love with Local Foods! The food tastes amazingly fresh, and the menu options feel like old favorites but with a new, healthier twist. To me, their menu items make eating vegetables fun. I had the truffled egg salad on the pretzel bun, tabouli, and quinoa, and I thought they tasted great. Quick and friendly service when I went, although it was very busy.
