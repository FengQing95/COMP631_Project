Local Foods////I am obsessed with this salad - crispy Brussels, sprouts, hummus, avocado, curried cauliflower, tomatoes, and pickled onions all orchestrate to produce a symphony of flavors and textures for your mouth...all whilst being healthy and good for you.  I love the way their chicken tastes too - always so soft, tender, and tastes like chicken from chicken noodle soup.  The dressing is light and lemony.  I love it!
