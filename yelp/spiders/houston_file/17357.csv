Uchi////Went here for the first time to celebrate mothers day.  We were seated promptly and waiter was quick to get us our drinks and go over the menu. Everything went downhill after that. Food came out extremely slow even though the crowd was dwindling and plenty of open tables around us.  Had to ask for everything or we did not get it, like napkins, chopsticks, soy sauce, small plates, etc.  We were served a couple things we did not order, as well as had items missing from our order.  When I asked about our missing items, the waiter informed us that they were all out of it for the night, even though the table next to us just had the same dish served to them even though they were seated and placed their orders well after we did. Needless to say, the service was bad.  The food itself was hit and miss for us.  We really didn't care for the non traditional fusion fare, and some of the Maki we ordered wasn't very good. The sashimi was excellent though.  Had really high hopes for this place since we heard so many rave reviews from friends and since it was rated so well on yelp, but we left with nothing but disappointment and a much lighter wallet.  Overrated and overhyped, and a little overpriced. Not going back.
