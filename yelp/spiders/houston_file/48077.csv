Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We had a late morning Tuesday breakfast here.  We were lucky and found a parking spot right in front of the main door.  It's obviously a favorite spot of locals as well as tourists and that's always a good sign.  Our server, Amberghini, was friendly, courteous and helpful.  Their menu is extensive and it takes a while to digest it.  The decor is early Ikea and the place is clean and well maintained.  My wife went for the French Toast Neat and I had the Snooze Classic. Her French toast came with blue berries and strawberries.  My Snooze Classic came with three over easy eggs, a nice slice of ham, hash browns and sourdough toast.  Presentation was fine and everything was prepared precisely as requested and tasted great.  We thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast at Snooze's.
