Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Brunchin for the 1st time in about a year, and this was a great way to break my dry spell...although there was a 55 min wait...i snagged a seat at the bar when a couple got up to leave...yes no wait! ordered cinnamon roll pancake...yes 1 bc its huge! The pancake was amazing and taseted like a real cinnamon roll. My entre was corned beef hash and eggs....yummm on my tounge. Service was great. Bartender was groendly and reccomended a great wisky based drink with ginger beer that was pretty amazing. Will definately be back again!
