Uchi////After raving over the food, I have to come to the one complaint that I have with the place. The waitstaff is uniformly knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. They serve as your guides to the meal and are willing to provide suggestions and order to your meal. However, we have found during both visits that the waitstaff was perhaps too attentive. It was difficult to carry on a conversation as they were constantly checking in on us. Additionally, despite the mission to provide a meal where sushi and Japanese cuisine can be enjoyed as luxuries, the speed of delivery of food was far too rushed at times. We felt that we had to fight to have a relaxed meal and slow down the service. Perhaps this is simply the result of overeager new staff or simply personnel who truly are excited and enthused about the food they are serving, but this is the one area that could use some major improvement.
