JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love ordering the tonkotsu spicy. The spicy chicken and vegan ramen are quite good as well. This place gets pretty busy for dinner, and the wait area gets packed. The central seating situation is interesting. One big table where different parties sit next to each other in very close proximity. The tight eating quarters are the only downside for me.
