Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I thought this place was great! Pork candy is outrageous! I didn't dig the kimchi that came with it my dining companion did. The drinks were great! And most importantly the SERVICE WAS TOP NOTCH! My only critique is that the red velvet churros were a little heavy in the cinnamon & sugar which took away from the cake flavor. Â Other than that everything was on point! I'll definitely be back!!
