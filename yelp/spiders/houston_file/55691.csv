Kata Robata////This trip I got to experience a lot of their menu besides the ramen and appetizers I mainly enjoyed in the past. We started off with two hot plates, the first being the Pan Seared U-10 Scallop with Mentaiko Sauce, arugula, spicy cod roe sauce, mushroom. There scallops were so tender and combined with the rich roe sauce, it was like eating fishy butter. The serving is rather small for $16 but you aren't paying for volume here and its all about the quality and execution which also shows in my second hot dish, the Grilled Octopus with Yuzukosho Vinaigrette, oyster mushroom, arugula. This had similarities as the first dish because of the mushroom and arugula pairing. Â The sauce here is different though as it is a dairy-based cream sauce. The octopus was grilled to the perfect tenderness. Both of these were delicious, but I prefer the scallops just slightly because of their sizing which was balanced with each of the bites with the mushrooms, while with the octopus bites, they were smaller cuts.
