Baby Barnaby's////I've happen to eat here twice each time when I had my window repaired near by. Good fresh food, I've had the corn hash I believe and the eggs with spinach if I remember correctly. Better than going to La Peep or House of pies but it is tiny and gets crowded. When it's was really crowded I waited 15-30mins for a table for two
