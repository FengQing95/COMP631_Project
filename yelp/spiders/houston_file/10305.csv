JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////HI Nathan - Thank you for the great review. We greatly appreciate your kind words. I regret that our service and ambience don't quite meet your satisfaction. Was there anything in particular about the service you received that was subpar? We are always looking to improve our station, so any constructive feedback from your end is vitally important to us.
