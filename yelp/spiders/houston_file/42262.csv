Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////When you enter you have to go through a zig zag line to get to the counter where they have the menus out somewhere. Then you're supposed to tell the person behind the counter what you want, which is kind of difficult because the pastries are way at the end of the counter where you pay and they're not listed on the menu. I also came in too early once and they hadn't put the pastries out yet. From my experience the pastries came out around 10:30am-11am. I heard that the pastries were gone by 2pm because of how popular this place is, but I don't know if that's true. I think the latest I ever got pastry was around 1pm and the selection was still good.
