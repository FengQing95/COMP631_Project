Kata Robata////So should you rush to the place? Yes and No. This menu is not available all the time because preparing a Tonkotsu broth take more than a day. So I would recommend calling Kata Robata so that the Tonkotsu Ramen is available. Other owners and chefs in Houston who purse Ramen as a menu need to study this one.
