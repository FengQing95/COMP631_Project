Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The food here is hit-or-miss, in my opinion. I've had some really good sandwiches (the chicken torta, eggplant parmesan, fried chicken) and some not so good ones (some kind of fish sandwich). The entrees are also hit-or-miss; you just have to get lucky! The menu changes pretty regularly so you always have another chance to come back, cross your fingers, and hope for the best.
