Local Foods////Finally got a chance to try this place and had an amazing lunch.  The truffled egg salad on pretzel bread was wonderful. The beer salad and lentil salads were also very yummy. And the staff was so friendly and helpful.  My food came quickly and the sandwich seemed enormous, but so good that there was not much left on the plate. I went alone and was glad to see the sunny counter by the window.  A definite do over. Can't wait to try other menu items.
