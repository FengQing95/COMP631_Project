Kata Robata////But that's not that point, this review is for our server, Thai Van. Upon ordering, he reassured us that what we ordered was pretty solid. When the food came out, he again, reassured us that our food was being portioned out so we didn't get all our sushi and cooked food all at once.. which I thought was pretty well thought out because we didn't get sushied out and our taste pallete was cleansed. (: he also recommended a really nice and smooth, easy to drink sake called seikyo-takehara. Towards the end , he told me that I made a really good choices in my sushi hehe. We ended the night with the green tea souffl√©, which he also mentioned was his favorite. Overall, his recommendation was absolutely top notch and our service was outstanding! He made a quick conversation with us about his favorite sushi restaurants in houston and gave us a card with his name and number at the end for more recommendations. By far one of the best experiences we had on a random Friday night date. Thank you Thai Van!
