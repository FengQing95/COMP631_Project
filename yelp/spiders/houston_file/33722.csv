Local Foods////I told the company I was with that I had wanted to try this establishment for a while. Now that I have finally eaten here I can say "Yes. I have eaten there" but cannot see myself in a group going "I know, let us adjourn to Local Foods". After spending $15 for a sandwich, this is about all I can say. Nothing was terrible. Nothing was excellent either...it was just...there.
