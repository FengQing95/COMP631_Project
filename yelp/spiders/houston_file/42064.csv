Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////When we arrived at 6:30pm on a Saturday, there were no croissants, no cookies, and no breads, except for a few slices of pumpkin bread. What they had was an assortment of beautiful, pastry-chef worthy desserts that, given their dainty size, were priced beyond what I was willing to pay. Is there irony in their "Common Bond: Only for All" appellation? They probably bake everything fresh and run out by the end of the day, but it was hard not to feel disappointed. The pumpkin bread was okay. The modern, "rustic-chic" aesthetic, as Google says, is great. It's open and glassy and modern.
