Local Foods////However, no matter the location, Local Foods is a top-notch concept. The food is crazy good, well priced, and beautifully designed. Its brand is high quality, while not uppity or superfluous. In all sites, the staff is really friendly and the place remains clean. Would highly recommend visiting if you're looking for a casual meal to take friends and family
