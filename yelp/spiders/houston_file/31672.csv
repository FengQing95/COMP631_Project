Local Foods////Once inside, it has the same atmosphere as benjy's, but yet has a much more relaxed feel with the counter style ordering process and the large community tables. There are smaller tables available, but I found on my second visit during a busy lunch rush, my only option was to eat at the community table with other diners. The great news is that if you like to meet new people and make new friends, this is how you do it. Be prepared for noise levels that are high because of the amount of people flocking to this great dining spot and due to the concrete floors.
