Local Foods////Banh Mi Sandwich was awesome.  It had a good amount of spice and the pork was tender and moist.  It also had the perfect amount of sauce and very fresh veggie toppings.  The cool veggies mixed with the warm pork was a great combo.  The bread was also awesome and I am not a huge bread guy.
