Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My first time at such a quaint bakery. There's so many fantastic and delightful options if you like your desserts to be tiny but mighty. I started my meal in reverse with blackberry lemon macaroons. The creme has this bright but brambly flavor to it and leaves a lovely finish. Then my Torta arrived with parmesan fries. The torta had a touch of kick from a pepper(maybe jalapeño) sauce but was mellowed out with avocado slices. The parmesan fries were so well seasoned, they almost had a bacon-like, smoky flavor. I enjoyed rosé with this meal but you don't need to limit yourself to wine. There's a collection of Saint Arnold beers as well as cool options for coffee and teas. If you're into New American ideals mixed with French finesse, this is that place and more.
