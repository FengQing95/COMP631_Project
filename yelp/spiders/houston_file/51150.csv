Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Be prepared to WAIT a minimum of 45 minutes most times and that is during the week. Weekends are even longer. If you can wait I guarantee it's worth it. I haven't been disappointed and I've been to this location a few times. FYI it's called snooze for a reason. Make sure you don't have anything to do after but relax
