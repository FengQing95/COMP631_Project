Kata Robata////Ramen - So many flavors. Like fireworks were going off in my mouth. I ate every last drop. Toward the end, the spoon wasn't scooping enough up, so I looked left.....looked right....then proceeded to pick up the bowl and drink the rest.  Not the proudest moment of my life, but it was so.  good.  I will mos def be back.  Like, tomorrow.
