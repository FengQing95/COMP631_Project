Local Foods////We got the vegan meatball sub which was like a quinoa falafel bruger, the garden sammie Â and the truffled egg salad - which we made into a sandwich. The sides to go with them were chips, kale salad, pumpkin seed salad, red potato salad, and a couple of strawberries for dessert . Phew! Got the whole list I hope. So glad that the food was exactly the way I remembered it to be- fresh, tasty, not too hot or dry- just right.
