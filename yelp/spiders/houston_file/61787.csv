Baby Barnaby's////If only I took a photo but the food was too amazing by the time I realized I should have! Barnaby's has amazing service and delicious food! I loved the high energy of our server. We ordered the greens eggs, huevos rancheros and a side of French toast. The food was so good I decided to make my own green eggs. The orange juice was freshly squeezed and the best I've had.
