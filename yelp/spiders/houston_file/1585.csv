JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your valuable feedback.  I'm sorry you felt rushed the evening you were at Jinya.  It's never our intention to make customers feel "rushed".  I have held a staff meeting regarding this to ensure that our guests feel welcome the whole time they are at Jinya.
