Kata Robata////Especially during happy hour, Kata is packed and often requires reservations to secure seating. Like the food that the restaurant serves, Kata's atmosphere is trendy and eccentric, and can be classy without being imposing to the patrons. The decor is a modern inspiration of a traditional Japanese sushi house as a homage to its roots and creates a setting that is perfect for a date, a birthday meal, or a family dinner. Unfortunately, Kata's price range is relatively high. The happy hour item is priced between $6 to $10 each, and almost everything on the main menu is priced in double-digits. As a reference, a meal for a party of three was $96 including tax and tip. Thus, the restaurant's price tag is a major hindrance for regular visits.
