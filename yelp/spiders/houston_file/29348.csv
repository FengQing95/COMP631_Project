The Pit Room////I liked the atmosphere here. I liked being able to look at all the food options at the counter while you're ordering. I imagine it can get difficult to find seating when it's busy, but we didn't have an issue with that. It was also nice that they had some sides and sauces out that you could take as much as you want. I would love to go back here to try some different options, it all looked good!
