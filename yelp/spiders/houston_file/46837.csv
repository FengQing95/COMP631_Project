Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The service was good once we got seated. I don't mind long waits for good food but they were not organized. We checked in, received a message confirming our table set up and checked in, was told two people were in front of us but 6 parties were called. Suddenly we we were not on the wait list. We lost our inside table and got seated outside. The food is delicious.
