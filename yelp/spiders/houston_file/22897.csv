Uchi////To get the most bang for your buck (especially if you've never been before), go during Sake Social - Uchi's happy hour (5pm - 6:30pm). Most plates are $6, up to ~$12, and they're the exact same dishes as the normal menu, but at a discounted price. I generally order 4 plates and am very content.
