JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////There was a 15 minute wait on a Saturday afternoon- not bad. I ordered the pork belly bun which was tasty, and the Cha Cha Cha ramen which had a lot of garlic in it, but was very flavorful. My boyfriend ordered the Sprouting Up ramen but didn't like the Brussels sprouts in it and thought it was a strange combination, but that wasn't my dish :)
