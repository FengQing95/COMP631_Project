Kata Robata////Wow! Customer service was phenomenal! Delicious food, romantic ambiance, did not need a reservation.  The menu offered a lot of variation. Our server was hands down the best sushi server we have ever had.  He knew the menu well,  made spot on suggestions and seemed to really love his job - wish I knew his name,  but he was a tall, built Asian guy.  I'm so glad we tried a new spot! Even my picky husband loved everything. Definitely try the kobe robata! It was divine!
