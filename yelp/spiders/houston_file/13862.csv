JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Vlad - Thank you for visiting us again! I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen, but I'm even more happy you had a positive experience with us. We work hard to improve every day and in every way. And while we still slip up occasionally, we never lose sight of that goal. Thanks again and we look forward to seeing you soon! Here's wishing you more happy workouts!
