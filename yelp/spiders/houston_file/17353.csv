Uchi////I'm finally getting around to writing my Uchi review! I came here with my boyfriend a few months back on a busy weekend. He called a couple days in advance to make a reservation and surprise surprise they were already fully booked for that Friday night, so we would just have to be walk ins, no biggie , right? I'm fairly easy going so we get there early on a Friday night (6:30ish) and are told it would be a 2 hour wait (although there were open tables I could see inside, but whatever I guess they were reserved for later) , so we wait outside on the cute lil patio and split a bottle of some yummy sake! We sipped and waited and were pleasantly pleased when a server came out and gave complimentary lil one bite appetizers to all the guests waiting for tables. After about an hour the hostess came to us and told us there were 2 seats available at the bar and if we wanted a table it would be at least another hour, so both of us are starving at this point so we obviously take the bar seats!  The bar was comfy and welcoming , right away the sushi chef asked if this was our first time , and being that it was gave us an appetizer on the house, big plus! Ok, I must make a point that I am a ROLL girl and my bf is a sashimi mister. There weren't a whole lot of rolls to my disappoint , but we ordered a few and I liked all of them, I enjoyed the ham and egg roll the most. We ordered a ceviche type appetizer that was yum, some sashimi and some rolls, everything was really good.  But, surprisingly my favorite thing here was......... The Brussels Sprouts!? Yes, the Brussels sprouts were out of this world yummy, who knew this girl would enjoy her veggies so much!  I never finish a meal without a dessert so we ordered the infamous fried milk and it did not disappoint, yum-o! Overall, Uchi was great, but I can't really say I left with a full stomach. It's one of those places you spend a ton of money and leave hungry and crave a burger afterwards. I think my bf enjoyed it more than me, but then again he is more of the sushi guru, like I said, I'm a roll girl and am satisfied with anything involving spicy mayo and tempura, which is a big no no here. The sushi chef asked that I try all the food on its own before dipping into my soy sauce/wasabi concoction, out of respect I refrained from all my dipping and tried to truly enjoy the fish, and in the end I did enjoy it and didn't even need my go-to sauce! I would give this place 4.5 stars ,but I can't, the only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is bc I didn't leave full and we spent $150 on our meal, yikes!
