Local Foods////I ordered the crunchy chicken sandwich, which the menu describes as "nut crusted, provolone, buttermilk ranch, pickles, pretzel bun," and I got their house-made chips and tuscan kale as sides. For my drink, I got the "mintade" mixed with the strawberry basil drink they had that day. Both the sides were really yummy--Old Bay on the super crunchy chips and golden raisins and pine nuts in the kale made me want more of both.
