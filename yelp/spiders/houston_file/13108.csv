JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////There's finally a great ramen restaurant in the Inner Loop of Houston!!!!! I'm originally from NYC so there were MANY ramen places to choose from. This is the 1st only Ramen Restaurant that I know of to pop up in the Inner Loop area so that already was a plus for me! I love Ramen 10 million times more than Pho so I've been waiting for an establishment like this for the past 2 years I've lived in Houston.
