JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As far as the Spicy Umami Miso Ramen is concerned, we agree that the naming convention is confusing. However, as a franchise concept we are not allowed to change the names of our dishes that have been decided upon by our corporate headquarters. Also, regarding the up charge to make it spicy, this has been a longstanding policy for all of our ramen bowls, except for the Spicy Chicken Ramen and the Tonkotsu Spicy. These are the only two ramen bowls that require guests to choose Mild, Spicy or Hot, before submitting their order.
