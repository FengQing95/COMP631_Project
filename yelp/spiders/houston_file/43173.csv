Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The girl that helped us at the counter showed lack of patience when taking the orders. She made me feel like she was doing me a favor by taking my order.... Really? The food wasn't even that good. The only thing I really liked was the Caramel Latte, the decor and the additional parking a block away and that's why I give 3 stars.
