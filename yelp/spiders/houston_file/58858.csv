Baby Barnaby's////We got there around 11 and the place was packed. We had to wait outside about 30 minutes for a table...thankfully it wasnt TOO hot yet though. We got a table outside which was nice except for kind of crowded with people waiting for tables, and the staff running around all over the place...but it wasnt a big deal. Â The weather was nice and the fans were going so it was all good.
