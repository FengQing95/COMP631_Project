Baby Barnaby's////Me and my family very often eat at barnaby's on the weekends... but this Friday morning since summer is here now we decided to take our kids this morning. The normal location that we go to in West Gray is closed this early so we decided to come to baby barnaby's... not that review makes a difference in the star rating because obviously the food is good hence we come to eat it very often but the location is horrible. They have a very small seating area... they seat 1 person at a 4 top multiple times which leaves only the two tops available and which makes families that come in have to sit outside. We signed in on the waiting list and because we weren't instructed to do anything else we just stood there. I guess they automatically assume everyone's been to their establishment. we stood there and noticed 3 people sitting at 4 tops and several 2 tops open. Now I get sometimes people ask for a bigger table for no reason but if you're an establishment that caters to families I would suggest trying to sit a single customer to a 2 top. They kept insisting that we sat outside and after waiting inside for about 10 minutes the door was opened for us by a worker and told us to wait outside. That's fine. We left. Won't be back at this specific location. All the other locations have amazing staff and friendly faces. This location had NOTHING friendly about it.
