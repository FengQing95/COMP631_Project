Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I was in bakery heaven!   We went for brunch on Sunday morning and enjoy all of our entrees (pain perdu, breakfast flatbread and croque madam).    It was packed and crowded, but the staff was very attentive and the food was quick and hot.  The pastries were amazing, as well.   I will definitely be returning here on our next trip to Houston.
