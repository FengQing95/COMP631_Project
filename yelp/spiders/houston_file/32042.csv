Local Foods////Walking in everything is sleek and contemporary but also "green". You def get a clean feeling so you're assured you won't be grossed out. Their concept is Organic local ingredients. Â So food is prepared fresh with fresh ingredients and you won't have to worry about added steroids. Featured items are dishes with things like kale, couscous, and pine nuts. They have great choices of veggies like fresh carrots, beets, and pickled peppers. They also have pretty good wines for you to dive in with. We looked around and everyone had a glass of their featured white wine so we both decided to get a glass.
