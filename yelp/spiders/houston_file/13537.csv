JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Our server was also really friendly and talkative. On an side note, I had brought roses inside a vase because I was planning to give them to someone later, but the host accidentally knocked it over and shattered the vase. About twenty minutes later, the host came back with a brand new vase, which was really nice of her. I really appreciated the great customer service here.
