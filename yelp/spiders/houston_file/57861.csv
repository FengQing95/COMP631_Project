Kata Robata////Went here for a nice Saturday evening dinner, I called ahead and asked for a table for two and the host told me that she would hold me a table as I was only 10 minutes away. When I arrived i was told there are no tables left and it would be a 30-45 min wait. I asked if we can sit at the sushi bar and we got sat immediately. Our server was incredible, probably some of the best service I have received in some time now. The sushi chef was also very nice and helped with our selection. We ordered the wagyu sticks, some king crab, pork belly and other various pieces including the scallop and foie gras .
