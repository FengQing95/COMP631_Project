Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If you want to dine in with real food, they serve that too. I had the salmon tartine which is basically raw smoked salmon on a slice of bread with capers. It made me feel a little bit healthier after the sweets I indulged in. The breakfast sandwich was good too which I like the buns a lot. If you haven't been here yet, definitely come check it out!
