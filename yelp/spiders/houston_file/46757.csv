Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////A friend and I tried this place out when it first opened. We enjoyed the food, but the place was packed. If you are someone who doesn't enjoy a wait, I'd say to get there early early or research the less busy times. Pros: free coffee while you wait and outdoor seating. Cons: long wait, difficult to find parking if it's busy.
