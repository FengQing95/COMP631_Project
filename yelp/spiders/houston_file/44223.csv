Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The only reason for the 4 stars is because picking up the cake was a nightmare. There was no communication about where my cakes were left or even what my name was. There was no record of the cake even being ordered. They found the cakes eventually, were not as apologetic as I would like, but all is well.
