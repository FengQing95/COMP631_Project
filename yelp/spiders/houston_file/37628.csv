Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Gets one star because I like the area and the ambiance of the restaurant itself. Maybe two stars because the waiters weren't terrible. I had the BBQ Porchetta Sandwich and the Bosscat fries. Didn't know the sandwich came with mustard and it was a little overbearing. The potato bun was a bit too toasty, and the Bosscat fries were a good idea and great and chunky, but they were really burnt and had a bad taste to them. Not a big fan of what I ordered
