Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Had a random brunch Saturday with my bffs and ended up stopping here. Bosscat has been on my list for quite some time, but finally had the chance to try it. Our server was amazing, he was attentive and funny. His name was Terry or "Chocolatte." Lol. He had a great sense of humor and some great dance moves! We were expecting the fruitty pebbles waffles but that was only on Sunday brunch. So we decided to get the Donut burger & tatchos & the ros√© Bellini. Everything was delicious and tasteful! Will be coming back soon! Also, request Terry "Chocolatte" as your server, you won't be disappointed!
