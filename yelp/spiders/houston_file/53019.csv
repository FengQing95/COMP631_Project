Kata Robata////I've had a wide range of dishes here and I must say, most of them are pretty damn good! Though It's hard for me to say they have the best sushi here (Just because I've had sushi on the east and west coast, which completely spoils most sushi restaurants in Houston because they don't have the same fresh suppliers), I would say it's pretty good! They have a wide variety of rolls that have different ingredients that make the rolls pretty good. But for me in particular.... I would just order the hot dishes because you would not be disappointed at all!
