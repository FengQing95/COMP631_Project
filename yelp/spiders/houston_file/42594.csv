Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Place is run by Roy Shvartzapel who used to work at El Bulli in Spain.  There's other star chefs here as part of the team from Bouchon, Per Se, and Cyrus.  If you look up the names of those restaurants, you will under stand this is a big f'n deal as VP Joe Biden would say.  Located at the corner of Westheimer and Dunlavy, upon entering, this is no ordinary bakery.  There's a flurry of activity in the back where the magic happens with the breads and desserts.  Everything is made in-house.  In the front, waiters in fedoras are busy running around serving food.  They have brunch here on the weekends and a long line of course (just opened this week to much fanfare and hype).  As you wait your turn to order, you are faced with a long row of temptation filled with croissants, Cronuts, cookies, baguettes, brioches, and rows of rainbow macarons.  The pastries look awesome, too awesome, looks almost like perfectly shaped toys.  The pricing is fairly reasonable for the brunch items varying between $8-13.
