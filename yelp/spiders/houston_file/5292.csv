JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Very nice interior, the lighting is pretty low and there are booths as well as a communal table. The wait can be kind of long especially at dinner time. Parking is alright, there is a free parking garage near the restaurant but sometimes it can be full because a lot of other businesses use it (there is also another parking garage close by but you have to pay). I always get the Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen (they only have two options for vegetarians) and it's always very good! It's not very spicy and all of the toppings are great (except I usually get it without tofu because I don't like soft tofu)! Their mochi ice cream is pretty good as well. They also have a plethora of extra toppings to add as well.
