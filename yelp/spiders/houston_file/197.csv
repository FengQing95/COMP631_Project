JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We ventured over on a weekend afternoon, and found the spot pleasantly uncrowded, but by no means empty.  It can be difficult to find a restaurant with a good vibe in the Midtown area, but Jinya was trendy and hip without being pretentious, or overrun by bros and frat dudes.  I already has my heart set on the black ramen with thick noodles, and I was not disappointed when I finally got it.  The broth is thick and rich... you could make a meal out of that alone.  The pork belly is tender and not as fatty as I've had elsewhere.  Onions and garlic compliment each other in the dish, and the crispy scallions really add a nice texture.  Ramen noodles oftentimes seem an afterthought, but not at Jinya!  Chewy, plump, and somewhat al dente noodles made this ramen stand above the rest.  My boyfriend had the spicy chicken ramen, and has since asked to return to Jinya for more.  We can't wait to come back.
