JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is sooooo good! The atmosphere is very elegant and fancy, without the painful prices. The food was delicious and our waiter was funny. I ordered the Tonkatsu Black, which was so delicious. The egg was the best I've had in ramen, and I like how they put 2 sheets of seaweed along the edge of the bowl.
