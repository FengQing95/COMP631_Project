JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Truly did not expect this type of experience in Houston of all places, but I was really impressed. I came with a party of 6, and we all ordered something different. We each tried each other's ramen, and I can honestly say I would've loved every single one. I'm someone who is more of a fan of a lighter/less fatty ramen broth. I get full very easily, so if the broth is too fatty, I can never finish. The White Tonkatsu broth was super flavorful, but yet very light and definitely hit the spot. Other orders at our table included the brussels sprout ramen (which I had never heard of putting brussels in ramen but was AMAZING), spicy tonkatsu, and cha cha cha. All were very delicious and I would order any of them again. And again. And again and again and again. There is definitely a wait to eat at this place, but in my opinion it's totally worth the wait.
