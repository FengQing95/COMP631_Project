Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Now the pastries. On Mother's Day my husband and sons bought me the Unicorn Cake. The cake itself is tender and the sweetness is perfect. The frosting on the other hand. You remember the movie with Wreck it Ralph and the game Sugar Rush? The frosting was all that Â Venelope or Penelope Von Sweets could wish for. So, if you to feel the sugar crystals in your buttercream then is particular cake is for you.
