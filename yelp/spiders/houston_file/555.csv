JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Kayleigh - Thank you so much for the great review. If I might be so bold, can you expound a bit more on what you think we're lacking in terms of "flavor profile"? Perhaps there are some topping combinations or adjustments the chef can make to better suit your palate. Regardless, we appreciate your patronage.
