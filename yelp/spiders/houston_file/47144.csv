Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Breakfast is my favorite meal. When I want my favorite meal, I come to Snooze! It is worth the wait every time. It's always delicious and consistent. You can pretty much find me here every weekend. My favorite is the Snooze classic breakfast with scrambled eggs, sausage patty, hash browns (best I've ever had) and substitute toast for a chocolate chip pancake or pancake of the day. It's so good with a coffee too. Anything from Snooze will have you feeling full and ready to start your day. Love, love, love this place! I'm heading there now!
