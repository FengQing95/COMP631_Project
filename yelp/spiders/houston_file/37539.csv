Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Everything was just okay. Â Can't even remember which cocktail I chose but I ordered the slider (pretty good) the wings (okay) and mac n cheese (bland and disappointing) Service was good enough, valet was a real plus, decor and ambience also nice. I won't go back but am glad I tried it.
