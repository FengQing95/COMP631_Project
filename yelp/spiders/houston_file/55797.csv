Kata Robata////The decor is very stylist with dim lighting to set the mood for any occasion. The soft lights embraces you while the music in the background is just sound filter. Loud enough where you don't hear the other patron's conversations but quiet enough to enjoy your party's company. The Bar is busy and a great area to socialize while waiting to be seated.
