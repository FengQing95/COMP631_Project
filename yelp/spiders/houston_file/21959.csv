Uchi////Uchi is one of those restaurants that leaves you satisfied, curious and yet always wanting more. Each time I have been, it has been an amazing experience. The waiters are always so helpful; whether it is explaining the dish to you or surprising you with something they think you'll like. They are always great when I give them a long list of dishes I'd like to try and bringing them to you in an order that flows so perfectly from one dish to the next. It may be a tad on the pricey side, but it is so worth it. You've never had sushi like this before.
