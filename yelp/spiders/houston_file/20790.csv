Uchi////+ *Walu Walu - "oak-grilled escolar, yuzupon (a lemony vinegar sauce), candied citrus, and myoga (ginger)" - escolar was a neat little portion infused with the citrus sauce that permeated throughout the fish. There were also little crispy bits of what tasted like tempura, which added another great texture to my tongue. Indescribably tasty!
