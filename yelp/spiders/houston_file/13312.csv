JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////In regards to the volume, I agree that loud music isn't for everyone. In fact, I prefer dinner over soft music; however, JINYA's concept is geared towards a trendy, loud atmosphere. And this, for better or worse, is one of the many guidelines we are legally bound to follow as a franchisee.
