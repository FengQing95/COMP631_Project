JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the spicy miso to-go and I was not disappointed! They gave two containers- one with well seasoned miso broth, and the other with all the toppings (I guess so they don't get soggy). The pork was tender and all the veggies were very fresh. I will be getting this again next time I'm in Houston!
