Uchi////We ordered the Wagyu beef roll (PitchFork). It was topped with shavings of fried leeks. I don't personally like rolls with beef in them but this roll made an exception for me. The salmon, Norwegian mackerel and escolar sushi were all fresh. We had the tofu yaki that I thought was a nice palette cleanser (ordered from the daily specials menu). Lastly, we waited a little longer than I'd liked for our Jar Jar Duck. Our server said it usually takes a while for this one. It's served in a glass jar. It's a combo of duck confit, duck cracklings and applewood smoked duck. Also, it's mixed with citrus shavings and a few greens that may have been kale. She opened the jar in front of us and all the smoke poured out like a cauldron. Nice. Probably the best tasting duck I've ever had.
