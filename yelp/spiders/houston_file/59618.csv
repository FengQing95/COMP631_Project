Baby Barnaby's////Never had been to this pace before. So happy they serve breakfast till noon! Walked into a quaint little restaurant with a very friendly staff. Menu wasn't extensive, by had just the right amount of choices. The food was amazing. They give you more than what you pay for. Had a great experience!
