Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We then ordered food. I got the short rib chilaquiles. I've never had it before, so can't compare it to anything. Flavor was good, but the amount of short rib was lacking. My husband got the chicken fried steak; it was a HUGE portion, fried nicely and topped with dark gravy. Â We also split the loaded tater tots. These were fried to a nice golden crisp and topped with deliciousness.
