JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Once I entered Jinya, I was sat almost immediately at a two top booth. The table was still sticky with a few spots of liquid and a splash of water by the sauce containers. The area behind the panels on the wall to my left seemed to be skipped during cleaning; there was a good layer of dust along with bits of trash left behind from other patrons as well as some dead gnats. Above my table, there were light fixtures that were a bit dusty.
