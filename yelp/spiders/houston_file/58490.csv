Baby Barnaby's////Great breakfast food.  The bacon is thick cut, pancakes are fluffly and fruit is fresh. The orange juicer they have is awesome(seriously, it's fun just to watch) and the product is delicious.  I can't really knock a place for having a long wait - that's sort of blaming them for being so good everyone wants to be there. My only complaint is they could recognize the wait is consistently very long and make it a little bit more comfortable - e.g. self serve coffee/water, a few more benches, an estimated wait time.
