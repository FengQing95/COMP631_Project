Baby Barnaby's////The coffee was good, and it and the water came with a little carafe on your table.  This is nice because I drink a lot of each.  The green eggs were delicious. They were very flavorful and I would totally get them again.  My toast was only half toasted, and the potatoes were super fried.  The apple wood smoked chicken sausage (or something like that) was really good and not at all heavy.
