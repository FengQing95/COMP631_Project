Baby Barnaby's////We went here for the first time yesterday. I won't lie, the parking is tricky to find a place and we waited at least 40 minutes. The inside seats a max of 35 people. After the first bite, I knew it was worth it! The service was excellent, and the food was top notch. I had the green eggs, potatoes, chicken Apple sausage with freshly squeezed orange juice. When I say freshly squeezed, I mean that I watched a juicing machine squish the oranges right before our glasses were poured. I would not recommend being in a hurry, or coming with a large group. But worth the wait and I will be dreaming about our next visit!
