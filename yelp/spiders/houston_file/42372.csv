Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Nothing compares to the patisseries in Paris but Common Bond does come closer than many other local spots. The presentation and overall decor is open and pleasing but limited in dining area availability so you may find yourself stuck holding your lattes in hand waiting for a spot. As for the pastries and entrees ... They look and TASTE phenomenal which gives this place 4 stars in my book automatically. We had the Boudain Benedict and hazelnut brioche mmmm....What's disappointing is the warm fresh pressed oj and lack of seating space; otherwise mark down common bond as another culinary staple in the montrose area :)
