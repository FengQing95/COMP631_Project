JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We've been here multiple times with friends or on dates, and haven't been disappointed yet! Everything we've gotten has been delicious, and Jinya has won friends who've never had or liked ramen over. The noodles are tasty and extremely well cooked. My favorite is the Spicy Chicken Ramen, and the Tonkotsu Black and Cha Cha Cha (among others) are good options as well. I also enjoy the Takopachi, which is hard to come by in Houston as far as I know. The "combinations" are just okay - the Tokyo Curry Rice tasted average.
