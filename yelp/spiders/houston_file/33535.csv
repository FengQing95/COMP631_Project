Local Foods////Local Foods is yummy and (I think) reasonably priced for what it is. A sandwich and two medium-ish sides goes for $10. I ordered a truffled egg sandwich (on a pretzel roll-more on this in a bit), the white bean salad and the kale with golden raisins, which probably had something the "deliciousness" fairy sprinkled on it when the workers weren't looking. How does kale taste so gooood otherwise?
