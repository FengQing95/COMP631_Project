I was visiting Houston for a few days and have been dreaming about this dish ever since. The eggs are scrambled with cheese, artichoke, and spinach (hence "green" eggs) and the combination of these ingredients makes for a perfectly seasoned and flavor egg dish. The eggs are served with chicken apple sausages, toast, and half a plate full of breakfast potatoes! The potatoes are well seasoned and crispy but there were so many that I couldn't finish them.
