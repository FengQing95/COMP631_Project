JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I recently came back here. Its been a few years. I had the vegan spicy creamy ramen this time. Im not sure if they changed the recipe from the first time I came or I chose the other vegan item on the menu last time. In any case, the spicy creamy ramen is delicious and filling! And not too spicy. I added some hot sauce to my ramen, and I have a pretty low spice tolerance. Our waiter was great too!
