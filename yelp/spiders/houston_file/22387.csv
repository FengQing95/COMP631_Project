Uchi////Nonetheless, I distinctly recall all of us ooo-ing and awww-ing throughout the dinner, occasionally pleasantly surprised at how delectable something was.  We were all in agreement that the cuisine was exceptional and warranted the hefty price tag (tee hee, thanks boyfriend for paying).  I mean, I thought that my taste buds would've been a little dulled after imbibing in my wine and sake, but the fresh veggies and perfectly grilled and prepared nuggets of vegan goodness left me very confused.  It all looked quite simply prepared, but the rich flavors were complex, yet clean . . . I just don't even know.
