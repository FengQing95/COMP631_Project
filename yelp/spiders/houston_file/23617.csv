Uchi////Walu walu-(4/5) The cooked fish was delicious! The only part that my boyfriend and I did not enjoy as much was the sauce on the bottom which we were given spoons to scoop up to enjoy all the flavors. This dish was really good but we just felt the sauce overwhelmed our taste buds a little bit.
