The Pit Room////Good meats.  Good potato salad.  Not a fan of the bbq sauce.   I like the atmosphere.   Guys are friendly.   My main complaint is there are two guys who hover over people in the dining room pressuring people to hurry up and leave.  The man at the table beside me was drinking his last sip of sprite and these two guys ran over, one wiped the table clean while the other took the cup out of the guys hand.   The guy kinda chuckled at the service, got the hint and left.   I thought that was bizarre.   A few minutes later one of the guys came over and tried to take my daughter's tray.   She had eaten less than half her food.   I had to stop him.  This happened 4 more times - the guy comes over, smiles, grabs the tray, I say no we're still eating.   The whole time he's standing near the bathrooms watching us (we were at the 4-top closest to the bathrooms).  So he knew we were eating.  We were not done and lingering around to chit chat.  But the place was crowded and too hot for people to eat outside.  There was a family of four waiting for a table.  Ah but I'm still eating.   The 5th time the guy came over trying to take our tray I said okay, you win, we'll leave.  Not even halfway finished with the food but clearly these guys were told to force flip the tables so I blame the owner, not these guys.
