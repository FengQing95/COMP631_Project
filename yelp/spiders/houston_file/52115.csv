Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Sorry for the photos. Food was too good to not eat before snapping a photo. The food was amazing and so fulfilling! The mimosas were great and did its job. My fianc√© and I really enjoyed ourselves. This location is practicing social distancing. I thought it was really cool when you pay your bill you're given this digital tablet like thing and you take care of it without waiting for your waitress to pick up your card and return your receipt to sign.
