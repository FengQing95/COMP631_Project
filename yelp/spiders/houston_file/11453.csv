JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Parisa - Thank you for your great review. It's true -- during peak dining hours, our wait times can stretch upwards of an hour to 1-1/2 hours, depending on your party size. In the coming months, we are opening more JINYA locations in Houston, which might alleviate some of the crowds, but we'll have to wait and see.
