JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I found this place on Yelp and it came up as the highest rating for ramen! We lived in downtown and it took about 20 minutes for us to get there by tram (including 7-8 minutes walk). We got there after the busy lunch hour so we got a table right the way but it still looked pretty busy. I ordered the creamy vegan ramen and my husband got the "cha cha cha" aka char-Siu ramen and they were so yummy!! Super nice broth and chewy noodles. We also ordered the Brussels sprout tempura which is their signature dish. Only downfall is my tofu is kinda cold but I am not sure if it's supposed to serve it this way. Highly recommend if you are in town and craving for some jap food!!
