JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Teddy - Thank you very much for your feedback. I've been in the restaurant industry for more than 25 years, and I can tell you with impunity that there is no perfect method of seating guests. Perhaps there were some factors that came into play that you might not have been aware of. Sometimes, and for a variety of reasons, we must "hold the front," which basically means due to some mitigating factors, we tell the host to halt seating until the kitchen is prepared to take more orders.
