Kata Robata////Service has always been good on previous visits, but Katie did a really fantastic job for my date and I last night.  Knowing when to step in and offer suggestions and when to give space is a skill, and she's got it.  Every time I looked up she appeared like magic, and every time I needed a minute to decide on something I got it without asking.  Combine that with great suggestions and quick answers to every question, and you've got a winner.  I'll be asking for Katie on every visit in the future.
