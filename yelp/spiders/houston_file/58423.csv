Baby Barnaby's////The Green Eggs are a MUST.  I have never had eggs cooked so perfectly and for the next few days, I could not stop thinking about the artichokes and sausage that came with it.  Also an added plus for having San Francisco landmarks as artwork.  Trust me, it's worth the long wait.  If I'm ever back in Houston, I'm back at Barnaby's.
