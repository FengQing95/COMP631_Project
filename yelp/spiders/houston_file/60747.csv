Baby Barnaby's////It's awkward to walk into the tiny place and not know the routine of writing your name on the clipboard and then waiting outside to be called. I noticed when regulars walked in they were greeted by the staff nicely but everyone else was harshly asked "did you write your name down" followed by an annoyed/ rushed explanation of what to do. (Even saw a couple seat themselves then told to get up and go wait outside).
