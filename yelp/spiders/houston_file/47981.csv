Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Went to check this place out with my little brother and the experience was regrettable. It was packed so we waited about 40 minutes (which was expected). We were then seated in a small booth area where you are practically breathing down your neighbors neck. Service was ridiculously slow, even after it cleared out. We waited over 20 minutes for a latte and about 40 to be able to order food.
