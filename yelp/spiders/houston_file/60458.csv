Baby Barnaby's////This is an excellent place to eat breakfast or brunch hidden off in the middle of Montrose. Â The service was absolutely outstanding. The clientele is diverse with a very casual environment as you can either eat inside or out on the patio. I would definitely recommend this establishment to anyone looking to eat or just to stop by for a cup of coffee.
