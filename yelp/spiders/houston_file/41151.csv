Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Sitting here on a Tuesday morning at 9:30. Line was about 10 people long. The people behind the counter were very nice but not as knowledgeable about the pastries as I'd expect of a place that prides itself on its bakery. Only one person ringing up the orders made the line go slooooow. Place is loud, impersonal, and cold but a cool design nonetheless - it's like eating in a Pottery Barn with Restoration Hardware accents. I don't feel comfortable here, nor does my wife. Espresso is typical of Houston: bitter and sour but that's everywhere here but Fellini in Rice Village. Biscuits and gravy are too sweet and wish the menu had indicated Canadian bacon not bacon. They are pretty good but not what I'd expect of a southern dish. Pastries are good. We'll try again in a few months when maybe the noise issue will be resolved, the line service is not so slow, and if we're up for a colder atmosphere than is typical of Houston. Or for takeout. A lot of effort went into this place and the service is kind so I wish them well. (The RO crowd and transplanted yuppies will like it here, I think. Seems very San Fran meets Dallas.) Until then I'll continue to visit the Houston institution across the street.
