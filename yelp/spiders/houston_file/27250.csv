The Pit Room////OMG! This was the best barbecue I have ever had. We were only going to get a three meat plate which was excellent but then there was a beef rib sitting there calling out my name. It weighed over a pound and was smoked perfectly crispy on the outside tender on the inside, I will never forget that rib!
