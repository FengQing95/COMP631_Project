Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We went here for lunch on Saturday and shared the Croque Madame with an added side salad and fries. The sandwich was delicious, but they even manage to make a side salad (almost always an afterthought at other restaurants) utterly magnificent. We also got some of our favorite sweet treats to take back to ATX.
