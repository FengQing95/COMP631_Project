Uchi////Food: Food is excellent, I would recommend trying out their entrees and whatever special they have on the day you go. The tasting menu (omakase) usually has a mix of their most popular dishes and whatever dishes are in season, you can always request for any of the entrees that you wish to try to be included as well as changing the dessert.
