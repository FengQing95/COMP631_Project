Local Foods////Local Foods has never disappointed me. Always great service, food is quick to come out, and a wonderful menu with lots of options. Crunchy chicken sandwich is the best! A great place to catch up with friends for a glass of wine and big salad. Pro tip - ask for double Tuscan kale as your sides (you won't regret it).
