JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Solid ramen spot! It's definitely one of the more well-known favorites in town, so go early to avoid the wait. The interior is dimly lit and has a cool, modern aesthetic, and the staff always yells something (tbh can never tell what they're saying lol) when a new party gets seated. Random but fun!
