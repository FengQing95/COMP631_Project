Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Been to Snooze several times and always a long wait. Food is usually amazing but have had a few issues. One time the pancake was not cooked in the middle. One time the bacon was perfect and another it was rock hard. These times were especially disappointing after waiting so long to get a table and food.
