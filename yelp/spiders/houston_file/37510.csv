Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Updating my review, particularly for brunch. I recently wrote a dinner review and was contacted by the owner. He asked for a second chance and for me to try their new brunch. I had a friend in town so we went on Sunday. She had unlimited mimosas. I had a boss lady. We split the pork belly tacos and chilaquiles. It was awesome. Everything tasted great. Pork belly tacos were tender and perfect. Chilaquiles were rich and wonderful. So I'm updating. 4.5 stars for brunch. 3 for dinner. Brings my review up to a 4. I'll definitely be back for brunch and drinks. And I've already recommended it to friends. Thanks John and bosscat!
