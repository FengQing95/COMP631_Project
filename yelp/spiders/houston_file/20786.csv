Uchi////Another Austin import, Uchi is the complete package of what you'd imagine the ultimate dining experience would be. Uchi serves up contemporary Japanese cuisine that the bf and I had the opportunity to check at a soft opening over the weekend. The official opening is February 2nd, but these few weeks prior served as training days for the entire staff, which we were alerted to as soon as we were let into the restaurant.
