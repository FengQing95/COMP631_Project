Baby Barnaby's////I almost always order omelets for breakfast, so I was surprised when I didn't see a single one on the menu.  I went for something different and ordered the corned beef hash with eggs over easy.  It came with potatoes, red and green peppers, and obviously, corned beef and eggs.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, the corned beef was delicious, and the potatoes were hot and crispy.  I could have done with about half the amount of potatoes, but overall the meal was wonderful.  The service was a little slow and inattentive, but for a lazy Sunday morning, who cares?
