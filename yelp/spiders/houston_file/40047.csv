Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////For apps, we went a little crazy and got three items.  From what I read, we had to get the Pork Belly Poutine.   That was some good eatin'.  Thick cut fries that were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, topped with cheese curds, pork belly, and sausage gravy.  It was a big hit and plenty to share.  The Portobello Mushroom Fries were good as well.  For my entree I went with the Cajun Brick Chicken.  I usually do not order chicken at these kind of restaurants, but this recommended to me, and it was delicious.  The chicken was cooked to perfection and seasoned just right.  It was served with a heaping mound of dirty rice and crisp green beans.  Get this!  We all shared the mac and cheese, which everyone loved.  A little birdie whispered to our waiter that we were celebrating a birthday and they provided an awesome mini birthday cake with a candle.  We also shared the Red Velvet Churros which were amazing, especially with the cream cheese dipping sauce.
