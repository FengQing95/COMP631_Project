The Pit Room////Today was my second visit for lunch.  I took a diffrent employee and I ordered the same meal to check for consistency. The food was spot on again.  One of the owners or managers remembered me from the week before and threw a pork rib on my plate as I told him I had recommended his place to over a dozen people as the potential best BBQ in Houston but had to give it a second try to make sure it was just as good to officially proclaim it as such.
