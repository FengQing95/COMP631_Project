Local Foods////Went back here again for lunch, busy as usual. Parking wasn't too bad this time, as we got a spot in the lot. I tried the Banh mi sandwich, probably one of the biggest ones I've had! Classic ingredients and flavors spot on. More fixings than your typical Banh mi, which made it even more delicious. No complaints here! Will be back to try more menu items.
