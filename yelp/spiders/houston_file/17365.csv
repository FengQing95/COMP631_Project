Uchi////We heard a lot of hype about this restaurant from friends so we decided to have a birthday celebration there. We had a private room and the waitress said to trust her to recommend our entire menu - we shouldn't have. The dishes came out fast but were taken away just as fast, almost like they were rushing us out of there. Our party enjoyed most of the food and wine but as hosts, we were not impressed; definitely not worth the $1,500 tab, esp unhappy with the service.
