Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've heard a lot of great things about Snooze and was so excited to try it! Surprisingly there was no wait (1230pm on a Monday). I ordered a dirty chai latte and peanut butter pancake. The dirty chai latte was pretty watery and not to flavorful. The peanut butter pancake was delicious buttttt not cooked all the way in certain areas. I ordered a water and there was a decent sized bug in it which was gross but it happens. I'm not ready to give up on snooze just yet so I'll be back to try something else at some point.
