Kata Robata////I really like Kata Robata, they have really good quality sushi, and I ordered a variety of menu items for curbside pick up, and all of it was pretty much as good as you can get for taking it to go. The experience is obviously not comparable to dining in, but for those who are still staying away from eating inside restaurants, this is not a bad choice.
