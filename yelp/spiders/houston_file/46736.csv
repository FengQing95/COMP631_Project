Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is by far the best breakfast/brunch I've ever had in my 26 years of life. As soon as we stepped foot in the door, we were greeted with light. The atmosphere is fantastic, the food was out of this world. Fresh, delicious, every single item had its own flavor. The service was absolutely incredible. Raj was our waitress and she was very informative and even gave us a hot sauce to try out. So awesome! She left a list of recommendations on the back of our ticket to try next time. That was rad. Â I can't say enough good things about Snooze. Good job guys. And to anyone who has wrote a bad review on a long wait? Live a little. Quality takes time.
