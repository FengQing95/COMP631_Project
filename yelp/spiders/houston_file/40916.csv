Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The red velvet chorizo were softer than expected, but overall decent. The dip was good too. My family and friends across the board didn't like the rest of the dishes ordered: the roasted chilaquiles, the pancake breakfast, the chicken fried steak. They found the pancake dish too watery from the eggs and didn't like the dryness of meat and the way the breading slid off.
