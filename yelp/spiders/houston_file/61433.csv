Baby Barnaby's////The place is packed, they aren't putting distance between tables. The wait staff was pretty rude so we decided to order to go food and eat in our car. The meal I ordered was supposed to have grilled chicken and egg whites and all I could taste (and see) was egg whites and a few beans.
