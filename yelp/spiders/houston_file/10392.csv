JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As far as ramen goes, JINYA hits every note - the noodles, the savory broth, the succulent meat and toppings. I opted to try the Tonkotsu Black with Pork Soboro. Frankly, ground pork is a top I've never particularly enjoyed. But JINYA's is definitely the best I've had - it's seasoned really well, becoming a topping I enjoyed on the same level as chashu. Their seasoning is on point with their chicken soboro as well.
