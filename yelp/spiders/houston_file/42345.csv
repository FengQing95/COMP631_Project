Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Although the bakery and pastries are awesome, I was shocked when I got there at 6:30 trying to do some work while drinking a nice cup of coffee with a muffin to find out that they shit down their wifi. When I asked for a wifi password after I sat down, I was told that they shut it down so people wouldn't stay around and hold tables... really? It's a cafe. And I'm paying an arm and a leg. I won't going there any more, that's for sure. Oh and there's a nice coffee shop around the corner that's called agora. They let you use all the wifi you want
