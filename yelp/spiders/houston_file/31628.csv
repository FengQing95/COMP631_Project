Local Foods////I've been here several times and have yet to be disappointed.  I've had several different sandwiches and salads and they were all fantastic.  I've also heard wonderful things about their banh mi from people that I usually accuse of being banh mi/pho snobs.  You order at a counter, but they bring your food to your table and bus your table for you.
