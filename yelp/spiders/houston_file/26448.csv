The Pit Room////This is a great place to get some really good Texas barbecue. We split a 3-meat platter with brisket, chicken and jalape√±o & cheddar smoked sausage. It was all wonderful and true. Our sides were Elote (corn mixture with some cheese and cilantro on top) and grilled okra--both were really good. We sat out on the deck next to the attached bar, which was relaxing and such a real Texas atmosphere. The sauces were good. We really liked the mustard based sauce and coffee inspired sauce. Our least favorite was the sauce given with the meal. Topped off with a Lone Star beer and this made our vacation meal top-notch! Thanks Pit Room and shout out to the very friendly and helpful staff to these first time visitors to Houston.
