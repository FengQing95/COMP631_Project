JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The service however was phenomenal, our server Ruben, was great! Really down to earth and quick with refilling our drinks and whatever our needs were. With his positive attitude it really did radiate throughout the restaurant. The whole restaurant atmosphere is great, very relaxing and comfortable! If I was staying here much longer I would possibly return and maybe try the spicy miso since that's what I usually order!
