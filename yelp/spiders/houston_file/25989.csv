The Pit Room////OK,,, Bar B que is a strange thing since there are so many flavors and ways to do it.. but  The Pit Room has my attention....  Great flavor and juicy meat ... It may not be the cheapest place to get meat but you get allot for the $..Small place but worth it... Now Beef rids were out last night so I was disappointed but ate pork ribs..  Very good... No French fries or fried okra but an okra stew mix that is good and mustard potato  salad good ( not spicy enough.).. Now the  jalapeno cheese sausage makes up for spicy.. Great.. Now don't pack the place so I have a place to sit.
