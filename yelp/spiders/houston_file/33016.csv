Local Foods////This is the kind of place where you could just close your eyes and point at something on the menu.  Everything is SO GOOD.  My personal favorite, though, is the aforementioned egg salad sandwich.  It comes on this unbelievable pretzel bun (seriously, if you're going to order any other type of sandwich, you should still ask for it on the pretzel bun), and is chock full of food. It runs a little more expensive than your average sandwich, but it is well worth it!  Especially because every sandwich comes with two sides or a soup. My go-to is always the cabbage slaw and house chips.  I used to get the beets, but they stopped offering it =( I heard super good things about the kale, as well, but I hate kale.  Nobody, not even Local Foods, is going to be able to get me to like kale.  Even so, their kale was the kale that I've hated the least, if that's saying anything.
