JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Appreciate your feedback and I'm sorry to hear of your experience tonight.  Unfortunately, Jinya Midtown does have a very strict seating policy as it is the only location that averages between 45 min to 2 hours wait each night of the week.  Customers are quoted seat times to the best of our ability and in order to provide timely seating for all of our guests, the #1 requirement is for all guests to be present before being seated.  Restaurants that consistently have a long wait list like Taste of Texas, Steak 48, etc. all follow this policy.  Do I like enforcing this policy?  Of course not.  As a customer to other establishments, I hate waiting for my party to be complete just like anyone else.  However, too often we have large parties that tell us their remaining guests are "parking their cars or walking in or outside on their cell phone or closing out their tab at the bar, etc."  We sit the party incomplete only to find out their remaining guests do not show up for another 30 minutes.  When things like that happen, it pushes back all the wait times for other guests waiting in the front.
