The Pit Room////Ordered a beef rib and link of jalapeno, cheddar, pork sausage along with charro beans. Couldn't justify additional $10 /lb for Wagyu beef rib for my self. Beef rib is perfect balance of peppery and salty all by itself. I tasted the sauce that came with it and it is good, but why bother? So delicious by itself. The sausage is also incredibly delicious and the charro beans are a solid side.
