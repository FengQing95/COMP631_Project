Uchi////Birthday dinner was pretty pleasant. But first off I didn't like my waiter telling me to eat my gyutoro (wagyu short rib) nigiri all in one bite. I also didn't like when I asked another waiter for soy sauce and he brings it saying that if I was thinking of dipping my nigiri in the sauce, "don't. It will change your life". You're going to tell ME how to eat sushi? Just don't!!
