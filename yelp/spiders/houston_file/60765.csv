Baby Barnaby's////The reason for my star rating would be the chicken fried steak and eggs. For a Texas restaurant this isn't a stretch yet BB's actually makes their CFS in house instead of pulling the entree out of a bag gravy included. BB's version of breakfast potatoes in an a home fries category also wowed too. Crispy and well seasons cubed taters were miles ahead of my local Kerbey Lane outlets in the Austin area.
