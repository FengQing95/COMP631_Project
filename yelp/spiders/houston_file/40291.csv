Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The service in the beginning was fast but then it slowed down very quick. We got the tots very fast but then waited about 25 minutes just for the burger to come out. But then they brought the wrong burger out and we had to wait an additional 10 minutes to get our food. This itself ruined the whole experience. Not sure if I would want to come back, but perhaps some of the other food options and drinks are worthwhile.
