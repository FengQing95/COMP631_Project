JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! Even though this is a national chain, the food quality and taste are incredible. I personally recommend the tonkatsu black with thick noodles, and the spicy miso ramen. My friend that I go with always gets the rice bowls and loves them. The tempura shrimp appetizer is also to die for. If you're a garlic freak like me, keep in mind that they'll give you a free garlic press to add to you ramen. Yum. Now I want some Jinya!
