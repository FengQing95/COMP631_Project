Kata Robata////It never let me down. Every kind of sushi/roll is fresh and yummy in its own way, just as how they should be. Ramen is very good, too. I highly recommend their grilled fish. Basically, you will never go wrong with anything you order. (The only thing I think is so-so is a creamy grilled octopus with oyster mushrooms). It is one of the best Japanese restaurants in Houston.
