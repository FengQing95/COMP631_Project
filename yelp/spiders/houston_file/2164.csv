JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Also, I apologize for our servers' asking you for your drink order several times. I spoke to my staff and they said there was confusion regarding the assignment of sections, which was coupled with poor organizational skills. Furthermore, did you order any tapas dishes? If so, that might have been the reason your ramen dishes came out after other customers' dishes. We have separate chefs preparing these items, and we try our best to time them accordingly.
