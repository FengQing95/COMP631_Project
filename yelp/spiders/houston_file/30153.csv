The Pit Room////Praise the BBQ gods, I've found the Texas BBQ I've been searching high and low for! The Pit Room really knows how to do it. We arrived on the earlier side when a line was just beginning to form. Ordered at the counter and was immediately salivating. Got the 2 meat entree that came with 2 sides. Went with burnt ends and pork ribs. While the burnt ends weren't the best I've ever had, the brisket in itself was fantastic. Full of smokey, fatty goodness. The ribs were out of this world! For the sides I opted for cole slaw and elote corn. The corn had a nice kick to it. We ate outside and accompanied our meal with a beer. BBQ perfection!!
