Local Foods////My husband has been raving about this restaurant since last trying it a few months ago. I was happy to have an opportunity to finally try it and it didn't disappoint! My plan was to try the shrimp and crab sandwich, but was talked into trying the crunchy chicken by the guy at the register as it had recently won national recognition. I'm not a huge fan of pretzel buns, but wow - this pretzel bun was outstanding. Fresh fresh fresh and tasty. There was a generous portion of sliced chicken and great toppings.  I selected to kale salad and vegetarian potato salad. The kale salad was pretty good, but I wouldn't get the veggie potato salad again, which was just okay.  I did enjoy the mintade drink from the fountain. Overall, very good. I will definitely be back to try the shrimp and crab sandwich.
