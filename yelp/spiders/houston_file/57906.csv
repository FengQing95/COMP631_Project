Kata Robata////Everything was made to perfection! For about $60 a person, we got the full experience. From the skewers to the cheesecake, everything was amazing! The sashimi was fatty, fresh and prepared well. The sushi did not have too much rice, the fish was super fresh and the other toppings in the roll complimented each other so well! Everyone in my group left extremely satisfied! Service was quick and super friendly! We had to wait 2 hours to be seated (put our name down at 6:30pm for 6 people) but other than that, I would say it was a perfect experience!
