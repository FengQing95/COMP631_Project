Uchi////Everything we ordered was on the salty side, except for the beef tongue, which was DIVINE! The portions are tinyyyy. They said the concept is tapas, but it was literally 1 bite per person. Our total bill was more than $250, before tip and tax, but we were still hungry afterwards and had to go get pizza and beer at Axelrod. The bar is limited to their mixed drink menu and beer/wine/sake. We ordered several sake mixed drinks and they were very weak, so you should probably stick to beer/wine.
