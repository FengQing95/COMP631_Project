Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I went Saturday night fir my first time and absolutely loved it! I never want to go to another boring place again, after visiting Bosscat nothing else compares. They have the dream team behind the bar (Crisia and David) the drinks were awesome and their knowledge of whiskeys was amazing. Not to mention the tour of the whiskey room was pretty cool. Definitely Â recommend this place very cozy and good ambiance.
