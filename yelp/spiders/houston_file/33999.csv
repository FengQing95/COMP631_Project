Local Foods////I ordered the Market Veggie Sandwich. (Gluten Free bread option, yes!). This sandwich was huge. I can't fully estimate, but Im guessing 4 inches high. Impossible to pick up and eat with my hands. Therefore, I decided to eat this with a fork and knife. It is served in a basket, which is not the best for cutting food in....Well maybe i should have asked for a plate, which I didn't, so that is my bad. The sandwich bread was toasted, but the filling inside was cold. Maybe some people like it this way, but I prefer my sandwiches to be hot throughout. The taste was good, overall, I just felt the proportions/setup/heat could be improved on the sandwich.
