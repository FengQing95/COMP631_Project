JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Only down side of this place is the 85% consistency when it comes to taste. At least better than others. The service is wonderful. I've grown to recognize most servers and try to avoid one but whatevs (: The wait can be a bit crazy. I've once waited 1.5 hour to get a table... but once you're seated.. the service is quick and so is the food.
