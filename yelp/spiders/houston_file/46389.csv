Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The pastries and desserts are top tier, so in comparison, brunch here is decent. I'd say most of the entrees are pretty good (my go-to is the chef's scramble while the boyfriend's is the nashville hot chicken sandwich), but I'd pass on the tamales benedict -- lukewarm, tiny, the tamales tasted like they were just microwaved, and just very underwhelming especially considering it's like one of the most expensive items on the menu.
