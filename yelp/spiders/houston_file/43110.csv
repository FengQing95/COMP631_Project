Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love the food if it was only based on that I'd give it 5 stars, but unfortunately the management is poor. After placing a Togo order on the phone, and arriving the pick it up to find out it had not been placed (not that big of a deal) but the lack of business skills was the problem, no apology putting blame on us Saying "you ordered from a different location" until we showed the Â correct number we In fact called. They saw it was their mistake...no apology...no compensation...maybe offer to take off the purchase of the side or something?! But nothing. After waiting another 10-15 minutes for our order, just handed us our food no thank you for waiting...nothing. Really disappointing since I love this place and go often. So, I then called to ask to speak to the manager, only to find out it was the manager who we were dealing with the whole time. No sorry, she said "okay..?" When I told her that I just thought it could have been handled better considering we are frequent customers.
