Local Foods////I came to Rice Village to meet with a friend and was looking for places to eat around the area. I'm still relatively new to Houston and even though I live in the village, I haven't explored it that much. He suggested we go to Local Foods for a nice, quick lunch. It's a pretty standard sandwich shop, and what they do they do very well. For a comparison, the closest thing would be a Panera bread. However, if I had to choose between the two places, I would go to Local Foods without hesitation. I had the pastrami sandwich which was kind of a variation of a reuben with some beets and it was very tasty, albeit a small portion for what I paid.
