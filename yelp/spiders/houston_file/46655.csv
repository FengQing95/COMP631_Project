Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Their pastries is where it's at (get the pistachio croissant!). Their coffee is awful and inedible. I'm not sure who's been making their drinks, but it's been consistently terrible and I've wasted my money by giving them another chance. I also order way ahead of time online and my orders have never been fulfilled on time. This place used to be amazing but lately the quality is subpar. They need to do some changes in management and training then hire qualified baristas to make the drinks.
