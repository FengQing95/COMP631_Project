JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was surprised by how long it took to get our food.  Maybe it was an anomaly, but it was definitely a wait.  We started with the crunchy shrimp balls, and I thought that maybe they were going to bring all our food together it took so long. Luckily after we finished the shrimp balls it wasn't too much of a wait for our ramen.
