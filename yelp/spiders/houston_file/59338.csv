Baby Barnaby's////Just a heads up - you do have to wait outside, and the waits can be long if you don't get there at the "right" time, so if it is a warm day you're going to sweat a bit, and parking is really tricky in this area as well - BUT don't let those sway you from giving this place a shot. (The reason for the long wait btw is that it is incredibly tiny inside - probably why it was called "Baby" Barnaby's!)
