Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Food wise, the experience was mixed. I ordered the short rib chilaquiles at first. However the dish I received looked very different from the pictures on Yelp. The meat looked more like ground beef than short rib. And the dish as a whole looked like nachos. Since I was expecting brisket and a better presentation, I opted to go with the shrimp and grits instead. It was very unique and came with a tomato-based sauce. Shrimp was flavorful, and the grits were well-cooked. I enjoyed it! I'm glad I spoke up and ended up with an entree I was happy with.
