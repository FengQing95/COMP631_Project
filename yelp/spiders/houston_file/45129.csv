Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My favorite place to go in all of Houston. Not only do they have amazing pastries and delicious coffee, they have a phenomenal dinner menu too. By far the BEST shrimp and grits I have ever had in my life. From the atmosphere of the cafe to the flavors of their dishes, I could not recommend this place more!!
