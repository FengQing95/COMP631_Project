Baby Barnaby's////Okay the food was awesome, the service was awesome but why a 2 star you ask....WEEELLLLLLL. I saw the hugest roach of my life in that establishment, I understand its an old building but this was not a normal roach, it not your typical almond shape roach, it was a special specie of roach. It was triangular shape, fat at the tail, wedge shape roach just lingering all over the beverage station. I nearly threw up...and also waiting took forever. I do know if i would come back....if i do they better up their health standard.
