Kata Robata////Sushi Platter: I was originally going to order the Chirashi, but ended up going to the Sushi Platter since it came with the Tropical Spicy Tuna Roll that I was eyeing over the Rising Sun roll. So, instead of having decided between the two rolls, I got this. Who says you can't have it all? It was quite beautiful when it arrived. The presentation reminded me of a Hawaiian platter. The fish seems extremely fresh. And, I must say again...extremely disappointed in the rice.
