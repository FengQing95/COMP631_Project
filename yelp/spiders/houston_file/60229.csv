Baby Barnaby's////The lox and bagels, which I consider a starter, are served ala New York City sryle and as the Broadway Deli is closing in NYC, I am seriously considering giving Barnabys my personal seal of approval on this traditional morning dish. Â I follow that with anything fro green eggs and ham to the breakfast plate with nice thick bacon.
