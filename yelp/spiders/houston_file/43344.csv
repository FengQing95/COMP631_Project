Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This love affair with baked goods is only really a big love if it is scratch made and fresh. Common Bond is on point with this. The macaroons and croissants kill me with what I imagine will be a weight problem as I get older. Just run a couple more miles a day right? Keep that doctor away. The real strength is that just big enough lunch or late breakfast. It is very doable.
