Kata Robata////Overall, we were a little disappointed with the lack of innovation and memorable flavors here.  This is the third Azuma Group restaurant we have visited, and each time we leave thinking "meh."  They seem to be able to combine excellent ingredients with excellent chefs and avoid many excellent results.  That may be their most impressive feat.
