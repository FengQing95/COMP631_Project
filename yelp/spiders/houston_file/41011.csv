Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Tried to come here for brunch on one of the weekdays we were here but due to the storm, they were closed so we got lucky and tried again before our flight on Wednesday. Was hoping they had their brunch menu but they only serve brunch on the weekends (Saturday and Sunday). Cute upscale decor. Theres cute elegant decor with florals, wooden barrels and a large glass room with all of their whiskey.
