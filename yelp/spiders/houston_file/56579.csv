Kata Robata////Fish is good but over priced. I cannot abide a sushi place that does everything possible to coerce the customer into ordering elaborate entrees, combo rolls etc and doesn't even offer basic maki and nigiri listed on the menu. Btw the combo rolls we had were all disappointing. The sashimi was excellent quality but tiny pieces and very expensive for the portion. Where is the sushi place in Houston for those that want f cking decent Japanese food without foi gras, gold flakes, hickory smoke and other Bourgeois fat slob nonsense. It's enough to make me reach for the Xanax jar.
