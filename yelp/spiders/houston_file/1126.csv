JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Cynthia, Thank you for your review, though I'm sorry you disliked your ramen. Can you tell me which bowl you ordered, and could you help me understand what you mean by "smelly noodles"? I would hope that you might give us another chance, and if you do, please ask for me or any of my managers (Keith, Wynne or Sara) to assist you in ordering something that might better suit your palate.
