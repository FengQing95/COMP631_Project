Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great breakfast spot. I think it is a little pricy even for a gourmet breakfast. The food is good, don't get me wrong but I do think it's a little overpriced for breakfast that is a little above mediocre. I also wouldn't wait over an hour to eat here. I love their French toast and actually prefer this over their pancakes. I also love their beef hash and I like to add yellowbird sauce to add a spicy kick to it.
