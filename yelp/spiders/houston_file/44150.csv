Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Strawberry passion cake - Perfect for the person that doesn't have a sweet tooth. I thought this dessert was good to share with one other person since it's not too sweet but can be overwhelming in flavor. The inside layers consisted of a sort of passion fruit jell-o, a strawberry preserve, and some kind of green cake (?). These layers were then surrounded in a delicate chocolate mousse. It was so good, the flavors sent me on a tropical destination to the Caribbean. Â
