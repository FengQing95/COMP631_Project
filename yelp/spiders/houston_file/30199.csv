The Pit Room////It's really hard to find nice and juicy brisket and this location definitely hits the spot. The sides were phenomenal as well. The potato salad was flavorful and I've had my share of bad potato salads. The coleslaw was good as well much better than any other location I've been to. Overall the dish was delicious and I definitely recommend this location to anyone that's skeptical and wants good bbq.
