The Pit Room////Some of the best tasting bbq I've ever had but the presentation is interesting and the portions are smaller than I'd like at those prices. Really good flavor, super tender, literally everything you could want except there is never enough! And it's interesting to see ribs and rib sides presented as something more artisanal. I'm not knocking it! Just gonna take some getting used to. Nothing bad to say, just wish there were more ribs.
