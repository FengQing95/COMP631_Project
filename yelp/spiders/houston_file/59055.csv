Baby Barnaby's////Awesome breakfast! My boyfriend and I originally wanted to go to the breakfast klub but it was super packed, so I went to my handy dandy yelp app. I searched for breakfast spots around the area and I came across this place, and I'm so glad I did! The breakfast was so good the people working there were very friendly and the best part we walked right in and sat down. Another thing my boyfriend and I both loved was the fact that we both got extremely full and paid less money then the breakfast klub. We will for sure be going back.
