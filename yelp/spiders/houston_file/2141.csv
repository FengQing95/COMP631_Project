JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////5 stars only because it's the best ramen you can get inside the loop. Ambiance is like any other trendy ramen place you've been to. They have fresh garlic you can press into your soup which is awesome. I had the Tonkatsu Black and it was really good. The noodles are a little on the firm side, so if you don't like that then you may want to try a different bowl.
