Local Foods////I came to Houston on my business trip and it was a great finding to get in such a cool place. This spot is great for tourists, who love buying unique souvenirs for a present or just to have nice memories about the trip. Not only great handmade jewelry I found there, but also greeting cards, spa and beauty products, candles and clothes. And I must say that this list isn't ending. As for the prices, they are medium, seem like reasonable.
