Uchi////The MUST HAVE since it was my 2nd trip here: fried foie gras, the uni, and the jar jar duck.  The fried foie gras with a little bit of the sweet sauce was just a great play of sweet/savory/fat, the trifecta of making your brain chemistry go into an awesome foodie high. The sweetness of the uni, the roasted seaweed, and that taste of the sea you get with that bite is probably the definition of true sushi at it's best. The jar jar duck done 4 ways, again, hits that trifecta with a note of Texas BBQ smokiness.  I dared my friend to drink the juice/sauce left from the jar, and I took a little sip afterwards and even that sauce was worth a little sip (I was not a bit embarrassed to do this at a fine dinning restaurant, hah. If anything, our sipping of the sauce should be a compliment!).
