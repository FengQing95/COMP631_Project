JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your much appreciated review of Jinya Ramen Bar.  Jinya offers new menu items each month and live on the motto of "Always Be Improving".  However, any item that was served before can be made per the request of the customer.  Since opening, we have had 3 special ramens that is "off menu".  The first is the Spicy Miso Tonkotsu.  It's the one with loads of toppings on top.  We are still offering that currently.  Next is the Spicy Umami Ramen.  It's now discontinued, but you can order it at anytime and we will be happy to make it for you.  It has a pork based/miso broth, ground pork and bok choy.  I believe this may be the ramen you are searching for.  Our newest ramen is called the Cha Cha Cha.  It is by far the thickest pork based ramen we carry.  We are still offering it until the end of May.
