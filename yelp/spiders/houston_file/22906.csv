Uchi////Their menu changes so my advice is to ask your server. Ours was extremely knowledgable and didn't steer us wrong at all. Do order the Brussels sprouts if it is on the menu and do end the night with their fried milk. I love peanut butter but I definitely enjoyed their fried milk more than their peanut butter semifreddo.
