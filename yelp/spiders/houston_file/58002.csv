Kata Robata////The kakuni pork belly was amazing and maybe one of my favorites!! Barely had to chew and the sauce was perfect. The texas kobe beef skewer was also amazing, my mom said it was the best piece of beef she's ever had. The miso lobster mac n cheese was sooooooo good. It was creamy, slightly sweet, and had a good amount of lobster pieces! The rising sun roll was one of my favorites of the night. We also ordered the texas hamachi roll and the longhorn roll. Both were great, but the truffle vinaigrette in the rising sun roll won me over.
