Kata Robata////Since moving to Houston almost ten years ago Kata has been my favorite restaurant. Every time I get to go it's a treat! Chef Manabu Horiuchi is brilliant when it comes to mixing flavors and textures. His omakase which I've had the pleasure of enjoying twice, is an incredibly special experience. More than just sushi - the hot dishes and everything else are done right as well! If you go with a friend who happens to love sashimi - the sashimi for two is actually a very good deal for top quality fish.
