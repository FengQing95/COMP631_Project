JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I am a certified Jinya fan! I will never pass the chance of having Jinya for lunch or dinner. I always order the chicken ramen but this time I ordered the White tonkatsu...fabulous! So tasty and just the perfect broth not to heavy not too light. The chicken and the pork perfect! Will definitely go back.
