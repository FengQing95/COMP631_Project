Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place just recently opened a week ago, and it did not disappoint. The place is absolutely gorgeous, brick wall throughout inside and has a rustic feel to it. The bar staff is awesome, super friendly and welcoming. Plus, if you like whiskey they have a large selection to choose from. Little pricey, but they mentioned they're adding a happy hour menu. Great vibes at this place and great people working there.
