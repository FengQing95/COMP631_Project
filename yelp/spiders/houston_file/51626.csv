Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I am always late, so I didn't arrive until 11:30 and guess what, my entire party was still outside waiting on a table. We didn't get seated until 12pm. That's a little ridiculous. It's hotter than jalepenos outside and they have you waiting, no water, no misty fans, nothing.
