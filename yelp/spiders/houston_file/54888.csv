Kata Robata////Maybe I am just alittle bit in a sushi rut but when you find a place that has the freshest selections and choices of fish you don't look any further. Man the happy hour selections are filling with a superb wine selection for pairing. The dinner options won't steer you astray. So many choices that it will please the most finicky eater. I love love love their staff which is why its hard for me to explore so many Houston options. We inquired about real wasabi which the chef allowed us to sample! Talk about life changing. I thought it would be so pungent and strong. To my surprise it was mild and aromatic. Kata Robata you have my heart!
