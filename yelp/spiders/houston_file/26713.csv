The Pit Room////I don't even like bbq and I think this place is awesome!  Everyone from out of town always asks "where should I go for BBQ?" And the answer is this place!  Note the multi-meat dinner is enough for two... we even had left overs.   Only thing missing is more green options, but this is a bbq place after all so I can forgive the lack of a salad option.
