Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The environment of the place isn't especially notable, based on my experience, particularly when it's overly crowded. Many of the chairs are different sizes/heights/shapes too, which makes it awkward when sitting with/talking to friends. The shop itself is pretty boxy and sterile in terms of decor. There is a small patio, which might be nice to enjoy on sunny days, but it's also on a busy road, so would probably not be my top choice among patio options in Houston.
