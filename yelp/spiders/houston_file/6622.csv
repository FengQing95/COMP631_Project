JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Amy - Thank you for your great review. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay with us today. As the weather in Houston has turned colder, then hotter, then colder again, we have definitely experienced sudden spikes in attendance. Please know that you can always request that the chef cut your egg in half prior during preparation.
