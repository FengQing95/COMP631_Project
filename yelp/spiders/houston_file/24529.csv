Uchi////Man! This place is so tasty, and the ambience was so vibrant. Our waiter was very nice, and accommodated for everything we needed. Not to mention the food was also very delicious, despite the small portions and food decorations, By the end of the meal we were completely full. I have to recommend the fried milk and the coconut dessert as those two were my favorites. They even aged us small Personal desserts at the end of our stay. I also recommend the hot rock with wag you beef as I found that to be very creative and fun to cook. Not to mention the pork belly was also very well done as the outside layer was very crispy and the inside was fatty and juicy. I hope you give this restaurant a try and tell me what you think!
