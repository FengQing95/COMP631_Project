Uchi////I just love this restaurant and this will continue to be one of my favorites in town. I think that it is just such a lively and trendy spot. It is such a good date spot. I think that the food is also just incredibly amazing. I love the raw cold dishes. And I can even get stuffed on the their Tempura dishes including the sweet potato and shrimp. I am also a big fan of their brussels sprouts which my girlfriend absolutely loves. My all-time favorite dishes include The ham and eggs, Gyotoro, and the foie gras. Their desserts are also on point and I cannot finish a meal without getting them. They are Japanese beer selection is pretty amazing and their sake is so refreshing. I love to come here during happy hour because the prices are just so good. I have been here about 10 times and I will keep on coming.
