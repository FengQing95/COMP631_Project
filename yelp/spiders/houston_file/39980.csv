Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The next visit I had to try was for dinner because I knew if the breakfast was that good I'd have to try more. Â Dinner did not disappoint. To start off I ordered the pineapple sage elixir and it was a very good drink. The mule I ordered was also a great drink, especially because of the ginger beer on draft here. The pulled pork hush puppies were delicious and gone in a minute. I ordered the cornmeal crusted catfish for my entree and it was phenomenal. I will certainly be back to try more!
