Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My first time there since I had heard so many good things about the pastries. Bought the chocolate eclair, pretty presentation but found the crust was dried out, there was almost no custard filling & the whole thing tasted like it had been sitting in the cooler too long. I have had similar products at other bakeries & they melted in your mouth. Price too high for something I threw away after a couple of bites.
