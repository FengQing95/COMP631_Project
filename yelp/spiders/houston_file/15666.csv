JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We only had about a 20 minute wait at peak dinner time, a few days before Christmas. The only bummer was that I couldn't put my name on the list until my friend arrived, even though he was only a few minutes away. I get it, but wish they could be more flexible with this rule. If they call me and my friend isn't there yet, why not just move onto the next person? Either way, this was an awesome experience!
