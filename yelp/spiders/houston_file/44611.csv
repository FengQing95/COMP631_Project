Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is only worth it for the coffee or the desserts. We did not enjoy the food we ordered. The tomato basil was immensely salty, my friend couldn't finish it. It did not taste fresh at all. I ordered the ham and cheese baguette. They asked if I wanted it toasted I said yes. Big mistake. The actual taste of the sandwich was good but the bread was SO toasted. It was nearly impossible to eat, every bite was uncomfortable and painful. I wish I could say I was exaggerating but it was hard as a rock, difficult to enjoy a sandwich that way. I would say to be safe stick to ordering a drink and a pastry but maybe stay away from the food menu.
