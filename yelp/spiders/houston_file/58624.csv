Baby Barnaby's////Does this place need yet another great review ? The verdict is already in. Everything here tastes so fresh & of the highest quality. The quantity of food for the price is great too. I loved the green eggs & the turkey sausage was really good. The biscuits with that honey butter baked right in were just phenomenal for a "bread head" like me. I want to come back & try so many of the things that I saw on the tables around me LOL. The orange juice though very good, is a little pricey for the amount, but occasionally I will splurge. I appreciate the cool water & coffee while you wait in the inevitable line that forms daily it seems.
