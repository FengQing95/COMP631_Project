Kata Robata////My favorite sushi restaurant in Houston! My bf took me here on our first date about a yr. and a half ago and it never disappoints each time I go. About a couple of months ago we had our very first experience eating fugu (blowfish) left over from an umami dinner the night before and we definitely enjoyed it. After that we made reservations to try our first umami dinner and it was absolutely amazing! The cocktail, wine and sake pairing were delicious and went well with each dish. Also this is best place to get ramen as well. The ox tail ramen is super delicious. Sashimi here is awesome especially the toro and sweet shrimp. Love love love!
