Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My Birthday couldn't have started any better, than at snooze!! After hearing so much about Snooze, I was so excited to dig into all of this deliciousness! The Dr. Pepper Syrup on the Pancake of the Day was bursting with flavors! My Peter Paul Ruben had mounds of artisan corned beef, sauerkraut, and Swiss cheese with house 1,000 isles dressing bursting out of a plump pretzel roll. Of course I couldn't finish it all but I did wash it down with a few morning cocktails. This is breakfast done the right way!!!
