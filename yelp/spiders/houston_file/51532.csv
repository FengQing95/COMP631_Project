Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My gf and I went here for our anniversary breakfast before COVID hit. It was packed, and the line is long, but if you're looking for fantastic food for a special occasion, look no further. We stuffed ourselves silly and still took home more. The eggs benedict and the cinnamon roll pancakes I remember were particularly good (if they still have them!).
