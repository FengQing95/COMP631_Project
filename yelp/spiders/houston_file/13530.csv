JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Since we are a franchise, we are required to make all of our food products in the exact manner that we have been taught.

That said, we do have lots of anecdotal evidence that many Japanese-Americans have visited us and have said our curry rice has an authentic flavor to what can be found in Japan.
