Local Foods////Yum! Went here with two friends and we all ordered something different but reached the same conclusion: Â best sandwiches we've had! Everything is a little bit healthy without having a weird health food vibe. Relaxed atmosphere with lots of Texas cider and beers available. Plenty of seating and a parking lot but this place fills up! It's easy to see why it's so popular, and the crowd ranges across all ages and demographics. You'll find families, med students, young professionals, you name...reasonably priced, too, as each sandwich comes with two sides.
