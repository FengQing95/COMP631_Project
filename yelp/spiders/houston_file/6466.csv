JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Brent, Thanks for your review and your high praise. We truly appreciate it. Slowly but surely. we hope to introduce new wines and spirits to our menu, but having been open less than a year, you can probably understand how important it was for us to focus on the food! Regardless, we thank you for your patronage and hope to see you again soon.
