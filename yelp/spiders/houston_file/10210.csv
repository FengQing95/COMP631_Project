JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Brittany - Thank you for the outstanding review. We greatly appreciate the stars! I also appreciate your constructive feedback. As far as the shouting by the host is concerned, you can probably imagine that we have received complaints about the unified "Irrashai!" as each party is seated.
