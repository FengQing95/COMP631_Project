The Pit Room////First off, the food is spectacular. I've had several friends come in from out of town and i always bring them here to give them a true Texas bbq experience. The two star review is a result of having a large tip added to my bill. My meal was nearly doubled Â in price due to the cashier adding a ridiculously large tip. I called several times trying to reach management and emailed them as well but no response. It's a shame, I'm a huge fan and so is my family but this really turned me off.
