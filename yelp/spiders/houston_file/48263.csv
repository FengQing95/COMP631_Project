Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was a first timer yesterday and I am hooked. This is sure to become my favorite breakfast/brunch spot, and I cannot wait to go back a few more times to try more items on their extensive menu, sure to please all tastes and palates.  I recommend their pancake flight, and the pancake of the day was a cinnamon roll pancake, the best of the three.  The corned beef hash was amazing, and I just had to have two of the AM Manhattans; the warm espresso and brandy was the perfect accompaniment to my breakfast on that rainy, Fourth of July morning.  The service was top notch, and Alexis did a great job accommodating us on that busy morning.  Thanks guys. I can't wait for my next visit to Snooze.
