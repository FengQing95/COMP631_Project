Local Foods////I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS RESTAURANT. There really is so much to choose from, and everything is incredibly fresh and delicious. The bread (especially the pretzel bun) is heavenly. I also really appreciate that there are ample vegetarian options, so you don't get tired of eating the same thing again and again.
