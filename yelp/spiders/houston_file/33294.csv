Local Foods////Stopped by this gem of a place for a late lunch and it was great. Â Ordered the "Crunchy" chicken with homemade chips and Tuscan kale... The chicken was juicy and flavorful, the bread was delicious and the lemony flavor of the kale made the dish zing! We also ordered the Bacon Steak & Egg with a side of chicken posole...the steak was very tender and sooo good! We were iffy about green posole but so glad we gave it a try. It was phenomenal. You must try this place, you'll be glad you did!!
