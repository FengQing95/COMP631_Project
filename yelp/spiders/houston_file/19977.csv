Uchi////Everything, and I mean everything was expertly prepared and wonderfully delicious. The things we can't stop thinking about now are the walu walu, fried rice dish, sake salmon and foi gras. To be fair, there was only one thing we felt so-so about and that was the dessert. It was peanut butter with some kind of apple ice cream. It was good, but not amazing. But honestly, who cares when you just had your mind blown 9 times in a row?
