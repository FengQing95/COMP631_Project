Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Reviewing for a visit today--having tried the pancakes last visit, I decided to try a savory item and settled on the sweet potato hash. Wow was I surprised, and not in a good way. Looking at others' reviews, a common issue was undercooked sweet potatoes. That wasn't the case this time, but instead the cubes of sweet potato were uniformly soft. And while nothing on the menu description suggested vinegar (the sauce listed is honey Cholula), there was an overwhelming vinegar flavor permeating the entire dish. The two poached eggs had runny yolks but oddly rubbery whites. Overall, this dish left me missing a solid crispy texture with salt rather than vinegar as the main seasoning. Perhaps this dish would do well to have an updated description so expectations better match reality. From these two visits, I would recommend that visitors stick with what Snooze is most popular for; their pancakes. They are fun and innovative flavors and descriptions are generally accurate. Snooze has potential!
