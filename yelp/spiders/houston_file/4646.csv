JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have been there multiple time and the food is great 5 star! Unfortunately the server Hamza w/ blue shirt ruined the dinner night due to him screaming too loud (Japanese greeting when customers walk in).He literally hurt my ear when he walked by me! When I asked him to take it easy he gave me an attitude and ignored me "he took off" a few moments later he was screaming even louder on purpose. Our server confirmed with us that this particular guy does that very often (not sure why he is doing it other than he likes to piss customers off).I am a very patient and low maintenance customer and I go out to enjoy dinner and the atmosphere not to go back on the internet to post reviews. Unfortunately today I have to give a 1 star because there is no 0 star available for this young and unprofessional man!
