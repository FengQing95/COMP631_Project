Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This cool breakfast place in HTX was easily a top highlight on my trip! There was a long wait (over an hour), but I'd say it was worth it. I thought out food was going to take long, but it came out fairly quick. The food was delicious and the coffee was good. If I ever go back to Houston, I'll go back to this place! Just make sure that you know when the busy times are in case you're hungry and in a hurry.
