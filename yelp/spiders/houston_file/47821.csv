Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place is okay, but for as long as the wait is. It's not worth the two hour wait that it always is. I've been here twice, the first time we left because it was a two hour wait. We tried again the second time and they said it would be about 2 hours to 2 and a half hours of a wait. Ain't nobody got time for that! We just got it to go instead. The best thing about this place is their French toast but everything else is pretty basic. It's not a bad place at all but it's not all that is what I'm saying.
