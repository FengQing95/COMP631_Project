Uchi////We arrived ten minutes early for a 7:30 reservation and made ourselves comfy on the patio because they indicated it would be a short wait. By 7:50, I was getting sweaty, hungry and cranky and still no table in sight. Finally, a complaint to one of the waitresses (it was my birthday!) and the hostess stand got us a table and some comped drinks (yay!) From that point on, the night was stellar. We ordered the six course tasting menu and swapped the goat cheese tuna dish for the macchi cure. I personally don't like the taste of raw fish much, but I never felt at any point like any of the raw food tasted the least bit "fishy". We also received a dish that i cannot recall the name of (some kind of lettuce leaf that you dip into an amazing sauce) and the biendo (tempura shrimp roll) for free due to the wait and the fact that it was my birthday and added the bacon tataki to our order (delicious crispy pork belly). The night ended with the fried milk. It may have been way more food that two people needed, but we cleaned EVERY plate- and I do mean completely wiped clean. Despite the hiccup early in the night, they more than made up for the entire fiasco.
