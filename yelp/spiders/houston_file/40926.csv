Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I had read great reviews for this place so I was excited to try it. I arrived and they told me I could sit and eat at the bar or wait 45min for a table. I decided to go to the bar but there was no space available, so I went and added my name to the wait list. 45 minutes go by and I am still waiting for a table, I went in to ask for an update and they told me they had said 45min to 1 hour. They said I needed to wait from 15-30 minutes and my table would be ready. 30 more minutes went by, I go in again, and they say I'm up next. Finally after 1 hour and 15 min. of waiting, it's my turn!!
