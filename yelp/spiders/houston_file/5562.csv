JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Very very close to perfect. I only tried the Jinya Chicken Ramen so I can't say for sure but the environment is spectacular! Very nice. Seems like they have a full bar and they have a free personal parking garage behind the building. Very nice addition considering it's downtown in Houston. Parking is always a problem, but not with Jinya.
