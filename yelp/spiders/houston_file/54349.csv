Kata Robata////This is far the best Japanese restaurant in the town. Considering the amount of selections (with many new ones), they are still the best! The reason I am writing another review is the new waiter we were most happy to have his service. Mr. Thai Van was someone among that I know only a few fine waiters -we had the pleasure to meet him. His suggestions, his care, his friendship, his professionalism was certainly at the top. We left the restaurant with nothing but most satisfaction... Congrats to entire team.
