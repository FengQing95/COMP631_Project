JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is SO. GOOD. I went there with some friends and we were really impressed by the food and service (our waitress, Anna, was the best). We had the Brussels sprouts tempura and some pork buns for an appetizer and they were both amazing, and I had the special Cha Cha Cha garlic ramen with some fresh (and free) garlic on the side. I don't know if the kitchen got confused by my love for garlic, but the ramen didn't taste garlicky at first until I squeezed in a few bulbs, but that was fine because it was so delicious afterwards. Definitely still worth 5 stars. If I could handle that kind of sodium intake multiple times a week, I would definitely be back sooner.
