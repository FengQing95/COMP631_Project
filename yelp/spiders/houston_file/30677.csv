The Pit Room////Houston is a big place and location coupled with hours of operation it's definitely not easy for a visitor to get around and find everything. I personally was in search of bbq. I was looking for beef ribs, brisket and some good potato salad, beans and corn bread. After searching Â what seemed like forever my husband found this place so I said let's just go. I arrived and the guy I spoke to was friendly he told me their BBQ is Tex Mex being all about the rubs and not the sauce. So I went ahead and decided to try it. I got a 1pd piece of beef ribs, a small piece of brisket and a small potato salad that cost about $40 for take out. I was told it was so good it wouldn't need sauce. It was pretty tasty but I was glad to have the sauce. The sauce was just ok as well. The brisket was smoky and extremely tender. The beef rib was tender rubbed and seared nicely with a seasoned crust. It tasted ok but the crust is not my thing. I like finger licking sticky with sauce ribs. I didn't like the potato salad at all. If you like your meats with no sauce and more of a crust this place would probably be great for you however it wasn't really worth it for me.
