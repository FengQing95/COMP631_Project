Uchi////Uchi has set a standard for creative, innovative sushi restaurants that I hope I can find a replica of in my home areas. We started off the the machi cure which is the Uchi version of nachos (chef's words, not mine) and it was fantastic. The flavors went together very well, the smoked baby yellowtail was smoked perfectly and the yucca crisp had a wonderful texture. Next was the ham and eggs. A good roll, not my favorite since it took me a while to get over the fact that there's pork belly and egg in a sushi roll but it was still good regardless. We also had an ordered of the brussel sprouts... YOU MUST GET THESE. They were some of the best brussel sprouts I had ever had. Next were the thai oysters. I'm a huge oyster fan and this oyster was meaty with the perfect flavors. It was really refreshing after having yucca chips and the ham and eggs.
