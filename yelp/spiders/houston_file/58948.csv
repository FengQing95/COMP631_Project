Baby Barnaby's////This place is generally really good, especially for breakfast or brunch on the weekends. Their corned beef hash is right out of New York and their orange juice has Tallahasseeans writing home to ma and pa. That being said, while the staff are friendly and well-meaning, they often become overwhelmed by the volume of orders. The last time I was there, for example, our waiter forgot our orders and came back to retake them almost 40 minutes later. When the food did come, the eggs were cold. In general this is a great place for a local breakfast, but if you are pressed for time or generally impatient, you might want to opt for something slightly more consistent.
