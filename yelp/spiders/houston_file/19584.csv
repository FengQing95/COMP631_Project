Uchi////Amazing food.  I'm vegetarian and rarely ever visit sushi places.  My boyfriend took me for our anniversary here and we were so impressed.  The main two problems we had with the place was the incredibly long wait and the fact that it is a bit expensive for the portion size.  I suppose that's because of how popular this place is.  Don't expect to get too full but expect to be blown away by the taste.
