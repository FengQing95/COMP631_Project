Uchi////We had a pleasant experience with good food, sake, and dessert. Soon after we were seated, our server Ryan recommended some dishes from Uchi's sake social menu. He was prompt and knew the menu well; he put in the orders for us which were just the right amount (allowing for sharing, we were later able to order more of what we preferred).
