Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////As much as I love to complain, especially with regards to bougie joints in revitalized neighborhoods, I actually had a lovely time at this place. And you will too if you're the type that doesn't mind spending $4.50 on an almond croissant. The bread selection was a deal. $4 for a baguette, 2 slices of olive bread, 2 slices of currant bread and generous heapings of fancy butter and marmalades. Don't go on Wednesdays. They are closed.
