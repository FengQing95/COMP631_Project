Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I honestly don't see what the hype is about this place. The only good thing that was there was the hot chocolate. I'm a complete eggs benedict lover and this place was a dissappointment. I ordered the chilaquiles and bella!bella!Benny, which didn't impress me. The lines get really long but thank goodness I went right after work on Sunday right when the place opened.
