Local Foods////I highly recommend this restaurant! Good vibes & good people with a hipster feel to it. Read the YELP reviews and got the CRUNCHY CHICKEN SANDWICH.. not gonna lie, it was AMAZING!! Came with two sides so I got chips and quinoa. It costs just as much as subway footlong meal and it's healthier for you so WHY NOT?!! Definitely will come again :)
