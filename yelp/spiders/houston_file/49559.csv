Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because the service wasn't phenomenal. It is a very popular place so we had to wait 45 minutes to be seated for breakfast, which is understandable, but once we got a table the service was still very slow. It almost seemed like the only reason there was a wait for tables was because there was unused space in the restaurant and orders weren't being taken/filled as quickly as possible.
