Uchi////I'm not a big sushi eater, but this place was pretty awesome. We went on a Wednesday night and the place was jam-packed!  We were disappointed to find that we couldn't get a table, leave alone a booth, but we were pleasantly surprised to find that sitting at the bar was the Bombay! You get a personal chef when you sit at the bar, he dropped us a plethora of samples throughout the night and we just delved into all of them.  Great food, great atmosphere, a little pricey, but overall this place made the whole night a memorable one. A+
