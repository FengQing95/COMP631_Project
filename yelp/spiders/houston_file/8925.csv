JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great ambiance!! Perfect for a date... cute bar in entrance. Besides midtown location which equals horrible parking it's definitely a place everyone should check out. Especially the cauliflower appetizer it was amazing!! I probably could have a few orders of it and be happy. We also had the dumplings which were forgotten about but once they arrived they were on point! I ordered the first Ramen bowl option, pork Brussel sprout  something (totally forgot the name) unfortunately it didn't come with the spicy option which cost a addition $.50 .... totally outrageous but delicious.  Staff was very nice. I will definitely be going back and having drinks and desserts
