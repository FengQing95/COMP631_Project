Kata Robata////I always try to order a few things from the daily specials menu. This last time, we tried a hamachi crudo with roasted tomato powder topped with mushrooms and it was fantastic. Their sushi specials are always great as well. If you look around in the restaurant, you'll see that a lot of people order the spicy ramen. There really isn't a thing on the menu here that I dislike, and the ramen is no exception. The only downside (if you can call it that) is that the ramen portion is HUGE. So you can order one and share, but then that means you'll be too full to try anything else :(
