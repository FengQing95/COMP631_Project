Baby Barnaby's////We ate here a couple of weeks ago during a trip to Houston. The food was great! We had the apple walnut pancake and the green eggs and both were delicious. My 9-month old daughter thought so too. Service was fast and friendly. There was a long wait for a table (30-40 mins) but we were there on a Sunday at noon.
