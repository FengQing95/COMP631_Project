Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I find myself at Bosscat about once a month it seems. The bourbon selection is off the chart. The signature Old Fashioned uses Makers... I think. But they will make it with whatever you want. I don't usually fiddle with the perfection of Bullet Rye, but they have surprised me. Sometimes the service is slower than I would like, but totally worth it. The decor is one that i works like to imitate for my bar area at home. The industrial look really works.
