Local Foods////As for the sandwich, I was excited because it was on a pretzel bun (I love pretzel buns for some reason). But when I bit into it, I think I might have been expecting something else. It was definitely crunchy, but not because it was encrusted with nuts. I showed my sister--because it had chips on it--which wasn't on the description. (She had recommended it to me, and we have similar tastes.) I was pretty confused. It tasted fine, and I ate most of it, but I think I will try something else next time.
