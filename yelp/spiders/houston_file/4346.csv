JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////A good place to hang out. Parking is easy they have an attach garage that's for FREE. Be careful though I know my cousins car got broken into they didn't get anything of value just a broken window. They have security but they are useless. I think he was playing Pok√©mon go and didn't hear the damn alarm go off. Kinda messed up the whole experience of the place. I'm sorry but I won't be going back. I'll stick to ramen tatsu ya.
