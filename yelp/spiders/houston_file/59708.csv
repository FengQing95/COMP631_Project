Baby Barnaby's////Was my second time coming...service night and day in the worse way! The waitress instead of being warm and inviting had an attitude that she was above providing a welcoming greeting. She just shuffled off a request for me to put my name on the list and left me standing stupidly at the door. Without instruction I stood there  in the doorway dodging traffic entering and exiting this shack. Then a customer complained that I was in his way. I don't blame him, however being an avid restaurant critic I'm not going to act instinctually but wait to be properly served and instructed by friendly staff. Before I unleashed I left. Needless to say I will never return and will  continue sharing my dismal experience with my contemporaries. You can't have a good restaurant without good service. This experience wasn't even deserving of a star.
