JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have #1 Tonkotsu ramen, gyoza, and salad today. Tonkotsu ramen tastes good. Chashu (pork) simmers long enough that you can taste all the flavor in your mouth. The bad part is gyoza. It is so small; and it smells unappetizing. Gyoza sauce is subpar. You cannot smell sesame oil. There is also missing rice vinegar in the sauce. Salad dressing is salty. Â I hope next time when I come back will be better.
