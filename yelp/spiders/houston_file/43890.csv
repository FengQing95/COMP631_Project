Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My visit started off with the most popular item on the menu: the plain croissant. I know what you're thinking: full of carbohydrate, heavy and buttery. You couldn't be more wrong. It's light, crispy and airy, and even though it's huge you won't feel full after eating one, its 10% flour, 5% butter, and 85% air. The pictures of it's air holes are proof. The best part of it for me, is the crispy exterior though. It's like candy from the oven.
