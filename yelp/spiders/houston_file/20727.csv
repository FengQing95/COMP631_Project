Uchi////We were going to order the kakiage but our waitresses insists that we order this instead, and we were glad we did. The portion is generous. my husband really liked it, I like it for the first few pieces but the taste got old for me, maybe since it's very caramelized and I'm not a sweet tooth person. Best brussel sprouts I've had though indeed, I just can't eat a lot of it.
