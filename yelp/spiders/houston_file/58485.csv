Baby Barnaby's////2. They are usually CROWDED on the weekends, particularly the breakfast/brunch side. It's worth the wait, but the inside of the restaurant is nothing special, and the waitstaff can be very slow. The last time I was there we were seated, our order was taken, and then a few minutes later the next table was seated, order taken, and food arrived. Our food didn't come out until after our table-neighbors had left (our party was smaller and had ordered similar items). I wasn't in a rush so it wasn't a big deal, but it was a bit frustrating.
