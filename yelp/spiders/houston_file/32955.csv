Local Foods////I would give this review 100 stars if I could. I have been to every Local Foods location in Houston and I always order the Garden Sammie, and it is one of my favourite meals to have when I eat out. When I came to this location tonight, I was expecting some variety of the sandwich, because they always taste a little bit different to one another. What I did not expect was to have one of the best meals I have ever had. I could tell after the first bite that the ingredients were fresh and the flavour combinations blew me away. The proportions of each ingredient were spot on and the atmosphere while dining was very relaxed and calming. The staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about allergens (I have several food allergies). I approached the manager about how fantastic the food was and he was also very kind and happy to hear the feedback about his location. I would highly recommend going here for a meal, even over any other Local Foods location in Houston.
