Local Foods////As good as sandwiches get!!! I tried the CRUNCHY CHICKEN and DUCK CONFIT. I have only great things to say about both sandwiches. Although both were delicious, I can't wait to try the other sandwiches on their menu. As for the 2 sides I tried: beet and kale salad, I prefer the kale salad. If possible, I'll probably just order 2 sides of kale salad because it was that awesome. Definitely making a stop her the next time I come here! (and I love that there's no long wait).
