Kata Robata////Really enjoyed our experience tonight at Kata. We were initially seated in the main dining room which is very loud, but asked to be moved outside, and even on a Saturday it was much more peaceful. I ordered an old fashion which was not made to my expectations but maybe not the best cocktail to order at a Japanese bar. My hubby had the lychee one and it was delicious. We had the shishito peppers, clams, gyoza, and bone marrow to start which was all fantastic. We ordered the Caribbean roll, the chefs selection of sashimi, and my son had the Nagasaki ramen which were all really good. I ordered a two piece of squid that was kind of slimy, not dry like I'm used to. It wasn't very good. They did charge for extra bread which I thought was a bit tacky considering the price point. Overall it was a good experience and I would definitely go back. The banana creme brûlée was also really yummy.
