Local Foods////I've been here three times, all at the suggestion of other people, and the food is really just okay. I've had the Smoked Salmon, Market Veggie, and Crunchy Chicken sandwiches. Â The smoked salmon was my first and most disappointing. I LOVE smoked salmon on bagels, so I was disappointed that the bagel was really small, dry, and hard as if it had been left out for a couple days. The Market Veggie and Crunchy Chicken sandwiches are pretty good though although I can't say I really remember what they tasted like. They're also pretty pricey but that's not surprising for a place like this.
