Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Sometimes I call in a "to go" order, but about half the time they mess that up. Today I put in a "to go" order, but when I showed up, they had no record of my order -- they just lost it. So I had to put in my order again in person, and then wait. Many times, I'll call to put in an order, and they simply won't answer the phone -- they're just too busy to get to it. Other times, when I get "to go", I get home to learn that the order is wrong in some way.
