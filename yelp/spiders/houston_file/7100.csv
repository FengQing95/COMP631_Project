JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Brandy - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry you are displeased by our seating layout. I understand it's not for everyone. We are always happy to accommodate guests who opt to sit at our 2-person booths or our tables, though this sometimes requires an extended wait time as you mention. Hindsight being 20/20, we would have picked a location in Midtown two times our current size. And speaking of Midtown, pricing is a somewhat common complaint we receive, to which I can only say that I believe we offer a premium product at a competitive price.
