Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////As soon as we walked in the man behind the counter is yelling at a lady in the waiting area that her to go order is ready. She is on the phone and doesn't hear him. He walks over and yells "JENNIFER! YOOR ORDER IS READY, I called you 3 times already". He then seats us and just seems like he woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
