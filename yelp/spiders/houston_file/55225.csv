Kata Robata////I started with some cold saki that arrived too warm.  It was overpriced as well at $35. for a small bottle for one.  The waiter put it on ice to help chill it.  So, I ordered a glass of recommended Prosecco that took way too long to arrive.  By the time it did, the appetizer of five slivers of rubbery abalone were long gone.  At over a dollar a sliver, it was not tasty and not worth it.
