Uchi////I save the best for last! Nama hotate, oh god. The scallop melted in your mouth, it tasted sweeter and richer than uni. I actually like nama hotate better than uni itself, my new favorite. But then again I have not tried uni from Uchi yet hehe. Still disappointed that I was not able to try their uni.
