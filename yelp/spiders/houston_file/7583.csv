JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen itself was very delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed it! I got the Spicy Chicken Ramen (for it spicy) which was great, and my friend ordered something with pork, the name escapes me--but I liked it even better than my dish! I will absolutely eat here again and recommend it to my friends. The only thing I didn't like was the egg, which I added. It was really the consistency that didn't sit well with me. My friend loved it though.
