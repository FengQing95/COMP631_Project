Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The only thing that I would say needs improvement is the hostesses... one of them had a huge attitude problem and came off very rude. Not to mention all of them seemed to be in a bad mood, frowning the entire time. My friend even asked for something to be wiped up off of a chair outside and instead of offering to wipe it up for her she instead handed her a rag... not very professional.
