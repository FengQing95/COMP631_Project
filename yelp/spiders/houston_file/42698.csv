Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'm writing this review after I have visited this place on two separate occasions. The first time I got there way too late (close to 1pm on Sunday) and nearly everything was sold out. I was so disappointed but got to try the almond croissant, macarons, lemon tart, and a macchiato with caramel. Loved everything! I have never seen a croissant that big, yet it didn't feel like heavy in my stomach. The lemon tart was my favorite! As I was eating it, I could chew on the flesh of the lemon. It was so refreshing and light! The macarons are the best if not second ones I've tried.
