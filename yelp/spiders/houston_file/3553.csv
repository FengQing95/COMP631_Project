JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I came here on a weekday at around 7pm so it was packed. You'll have to park in a garage somewhere and walk over which is expected for businesses in this area. Since it was a party of 7, we had to wait for about 20 minutes for the center seating area to clear. In the meantime we got to experience somewhat impatient and rude service by the hostess up front. We didn't get a greeting coming in, she asked us what we wanted, penciled us in, and continued about her way without any sort of friendly exchange. The bartenders are similar, very business oriented. The waiters that came to the front reached around us (it was a full house!) for the things they wanted without saying, "please" or "excuse me." So far, we felt like a nuisance.
