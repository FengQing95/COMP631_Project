JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The kind words of the owner encouraged me to give Jinya another shot, and I am happy to say that they delivered. We had about a party of 10, and at 11:30 on a Friday night, we were still able to be seated within 10 minutes. I tried the tonkotsu black this time and it was definitely much better than the assari. While it's not the best ramen I've had, it was really rich in flavor and the meat was very tender. If you're thinking about coming, I'd definitely recommend the tonkotsu black, and coming during off hours makes it a much better experience.
