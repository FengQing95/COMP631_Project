Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This is a place I'd recommend you go with friends or whatnot just to catch up and have fun! The atmosphere is very lively and it's loud but cool! The drink menu was unique and they have an amazing whiskey room. I'm not a whiskey drinker so I had the Boss Cat Lemonade that had Tito's vodka and jalape√±os, it was delicious, sweet and spicy! For my food I tried the open face turkey sandwich, its to die for- get it! And I tried the sweet potato mac'n'cheese and it was pretty good, my homemade version is better but honestly I'd order this again! My friends enjoyed their food as well! Service was great, they did a good job getting drinks and food out. I also like the music selection, they mix it up which is wonderful! I will definitely return to this place!! Looking forward to returning for a Sunday brunch!
