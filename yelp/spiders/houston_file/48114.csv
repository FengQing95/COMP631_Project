Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I bookmarked this place previously based on the great reviews. I couldn't wait to try it out since breakfast/brunch is my absolute favorite meal of the day! I understood that there would be a long wait since I went on a Sunday afternoon but I chose a beautiful day and immediately lucked up on a great parking spot...(don't count on this however... parking lot was FULL)
