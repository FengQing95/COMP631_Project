Kata Robata////Our absolute favorite place for sushi. The quality of fish is amazing and the presentation is beautiful. The amberjack and foie gras appetizer is a must try as well as the Kobe skewers. Atmosphere is modern and definitely a place you can go for a nice date or even a business group. What's also great is they have happy hour on Sunday's for lunch and daily from 5-630.
