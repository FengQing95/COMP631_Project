Uchi////We shared an order of brussel sprouts with lemon Thai sauce. The glaze was tasty. We also shared an order of the Kamo nabe (crispy rice with duck, mushrooms, spinach and an egg with a spicy 'Korean' sauce). The flavors were subtle but the texture of the crispy rice, duck and vegetables worked well.
