Uchi////We decided to order everything on the hh menu. One of each and double of the more popular ones. Everything was super delicious, prepared in the uchi unique way!  These are what I could have done without because in my opinion they were just fillers-fried sweet potatoes, eggplant roll-too bland, needs some sauce or something to pair with,  the tuna roll- again nothing special, chicken dish- too tough and less flavor. These to me were not uchi pair as the rest of the dishes on the hh menu. My favorite was the ham and egg roll, the roll with salmon, crunch and avocado, and the sashimi dishes-always yummy with something citrus and something sweet. I also loved the escolar dish. We also ordered Brussel sprouts and the foie gras, which are a must when going to uchi.
