The Pit Room////MEAT: The brisket was delicious. Nice charred crust and tender inside. The slices were very fatty. Not sure if they have a lean option but I'd probably request that next time. The smoked turkey and beef sausage were good. Nothing to write home about and personally I think there are places that do a better job on those, but not inside the loop. I would skip the pork sausage with jalapeno and cheddar "cheese" (cheese in quotes because it was more like a cheese product that comes in a spray can). The taste and texture was bizarre.
