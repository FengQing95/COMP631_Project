Baby Barnaby's////I'm a huge breakfast/brunch person so I get really excited when it comes to trying new spots. What stuck out to me was the influx of reviews about green eggs so I obviously had to make my way here. Who would've thought green eggs could taste so good?! This is the first time I've eaten at a restaurant and loved everything on my plate. There's usually one side item that doesn't wow me but this entire plate had me blown away. So yes, my review is based on just one breakfast item and honestly, I'm too obsessed to even try anything else.
