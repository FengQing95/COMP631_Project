JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been here twice now and will plan on coming many more times. So if you're a vegetarian who enjoys ramen, Jinya is the spot! Not many ramen spots will have options for vegetarians, but Jinya does :). The only con is that it's always busy and so there will be a wait (sometimes longer than 30 min) and be ready to not be able to hear your friends when you sit cause it's loud.
