Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////i had a few thoughts for you guys regarding this problem.  i don't know if you guys have heat lamps in the back, but some restaurants use ceramic plates so they can warm the plates before expedition.  or a cheaper trick is to use an aluminum dome over the plate before serving.  use the ones with a hole on top so the food doesn't start to steam inside.
