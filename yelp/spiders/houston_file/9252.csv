JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First thing you need to know about me, is that I'm a ramen snob. I take my ramen very seriously. I first heard of this place back home in LA but never got a chance to try it. When I was visiting my friend in Houston, she told me there was one and I told her we had to try it!
