Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I was looking forward trying their 12-hour beef short ribs, the meat was very very tender and was just right but everything else around it was very salty. I also ordered pig candy, Dr. Pepper chicken and whiskey okra and they were all salty! I think the taste (recipe) of the food was good but was overwhelmed by salt, if they cut their salt in half or more, it would be great. The ambiance and staff were great.
