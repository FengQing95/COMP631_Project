JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Top notch ramen place! I ordered the tonkotsu assari ramen and good heavens, was it spectacular! All the ingredients are made perfectly and put into a cute v-shaped bowl. It slims down towards the bottom so if you think about it, the ramen is a little pricey for the amount you are getting, but let's not forget about quality. I'd say the pricing is fair. My meal was filling, but I got hungry again a few hours later and that's okay. Jinya is the best ramen place I have tried thus far. The noodles are soft, even if it's thick or thin and retains moisture well. The pork is savory and falls apart with natural ease and the broth is oh so thick and creamy. Let me just take a moment to relive my taste buds eating the egg....mmmm... Yep. Eggcellent. I don't know how you can make egg like this without Chef Gordon's godly hands, but there is an A1 chef at Jinya who can cook this amazingly soft egg with golden yolk that melts into your mouth upon touch. HOW??? I don't know and I don't care. Just give me round 2! I can't wait to come back and try all the other food.
