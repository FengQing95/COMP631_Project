Uchi////I went here a few weeks ago with a group of friends. Aesthetically it's nice with a super chic atmosphere and a small outdoor patio. Beyond being trendy and a place to be "seen" the food is amazing. We had a reservation but ended up waiting for half an hour anyway, which was expected given how crowded it was. The waiters really knew their stuff and I liked the team atmosphere of serving. That being said it is pricey but worth it. I wouldn't go there weekly but it's a place to splurge every now and then.
