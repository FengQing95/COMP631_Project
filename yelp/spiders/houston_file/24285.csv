Uchi////If anyone asks me what my favorite restaurant in Houston is, I always say Uchi! I've been going for about 4 years now and love that they periodically rotate options on the vegetarian menu. However, there's always the standard items we order: avocado nigiri, nasu, uchi salad (extra jalape√±o edamame sauce on the side because it's amazing), spicy crunchy, pitchfork, and of course the ever so famous fried milk. There's even a dedicated vegetarian menu for social hour and the service is always great!
