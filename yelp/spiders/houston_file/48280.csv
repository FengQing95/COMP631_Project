Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Literally the best place, ever!!!! Awesome service, great food, and a vibe that this city hadn't seen yet. Kandra is hands down the best server on a Friday morning to have, and I will be back, multiple times! Got the corned beef hash with jalape√±os added, amazing!!! And the pancake trio - get the blueberry one, you'll thank me later! Had to add this, when you Snooze, you win!
