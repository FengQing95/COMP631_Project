Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My all time favorite bakery in Houston ..... beautifully true to French Style.... so inviting and sophisticated.... their selection of pastries are just incredible ... macaroons , almond croissants, breads of all sorts... every time I come here I love it more and more ... the atmosphere is super European ... but so lovely... they have a patio, a barista bar, and an interesting kitchen options .... love this place ..
