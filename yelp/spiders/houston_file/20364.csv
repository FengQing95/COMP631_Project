Uchi////Be prepared to spend that money! This place is expensive however well worth it. The time the cooks spend on your dish makes you treasure each one. I would highly recommend the six course meal unless you want specific things off the menu; like-wise the desserts are excellent! Try the summer melon special if you can because it is limited!
