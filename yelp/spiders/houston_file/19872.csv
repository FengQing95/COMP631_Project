Uchi////To be honest, the rolls were not memorable.  All I remember was thinking "Geez, so pricey and this is all you get?  I want my mind blown!!"  The Machi Cure was very light and underwhelming.  The best part was probably the foie gras sushi, although we would never order it again after I mentioned the ban in California last summer.  Poor ducks.  The fried milk was overly sweet like a giant dollop of crispy condensed milk.
