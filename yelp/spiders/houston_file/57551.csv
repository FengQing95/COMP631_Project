Kata Robata////Great atmosphere and excellent EXCELLENT sushi. The customer service was amazing here. I love the thoughtful gestures Â included in the service. For example, after we received our fresh spread of sushi, we were offered to have the shrimp heads deep fried (Do NOT refuse this, trust me). Our underage drinker in the group had an (underage lychee martini) , which had a really nice presentation and taste for a mocktail. I could say so much about this restaurant, and all of it is great. Definitely recommend
