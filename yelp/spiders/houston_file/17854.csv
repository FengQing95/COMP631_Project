Uchi////The only reason I gave this restaurant a four instead of five is because it's very pricey, but everything I've tasted here was delicious and beautifully presented. The service is also top notch. Be sure to call ahead or arrive early because this place gets packed. If you're like me and have a tighter budget, be sure to check out their "social hour" specials.
