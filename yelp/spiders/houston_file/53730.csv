Kata Robata////A couple of my friends went to this restaurant last week and they like it a lot. So....here I come. I am a little disappointed. The food was okay. I had the unagi bowl, shared the kobe beef skewer with my friend and ordered two pieces of nigiri. The unagi was soft and fresh. The sauce for the bowl was a little tart for me but overall it was good. The beef skewer was really amazing. I had a tuna and a octopus nigiri. They were average. Btw, the green tea cheesecake my friend ordered was so soft, fluffy and nicely paired with red bean icecream.
