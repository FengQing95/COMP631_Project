JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Some of the best ramen places in Houston. It might not be an original Houston restaurant, but it pretty darn good enough to keep me coming back. The broth is pretty "heavy" though. The chasu has a very reasonable protein to fat ratio where it isn't too fatty. The takoyaki was some of the best I've had thus far (take it with a grain of salt though as I have only had like three other places.) though it was kind of expensive in my opinion.
