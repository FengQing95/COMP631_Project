Kata Robata////The theme of imaginative pairings and luxurious congregations is also seen in the happy hour selection. The happy hour appetizers includes tuna tar tar (Cold blend of raw tuna and avocado pieces, served with the exotic taro-lined chips and fried lotus root slices) and Kobe beef taco (Japanese grilled beef complemented with vegetable and vinaigrette in taco wrap). Happy hour sushi roll selection has Kobe beef yakiniku roll (Traditional roll with a generous amount of grilled beef) and salmon and soft shell crab roll. While the happy hour appetizers are delicious and flavorful, the happy hour rolls are disappointing and lackluster especially in comparison to the rolls on the main menu. The beef roll was unexpectedly dry and difficult to chew, and the salmon and soft shell crab roll was an unfortunate instance of an innovative combination that did not yield any surprise. Hence, the appetizers are the highlights of Kata's happy hour.
