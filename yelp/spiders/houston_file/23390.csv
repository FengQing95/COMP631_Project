Uchi////I have never had so much fun sitting at a sushi bar before. The sushi chefs were so much fun and really paid attention to what were craving and talking about. The wait staff was also fantastic. My water glass was not empty for more than a minute. The atmosphere is also super trendy, which added to the whole experience. I started off with the kara kyuri, which ended up being a really great cocktail to start with.
