Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I usually get the pistachio croissant, chocolate croissant, and dabble around with other items. The croissants are great, but the chocolate croissant could use some more chocolate. The burger is a winner, and so is the French onion soup. There potatoes are also great!
