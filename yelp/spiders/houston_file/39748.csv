Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////- Red Velvet Churros: Honestly, this dessert was pretty mediocre in comparison with the rest of the food that we ate. There was A LOT of sugar. The cream cheese sauce tasted like warm milk and didn't enhance (but also didn't take away) from the churro. What was really missing from this dish was flavor. It just felt like we were eating a flavorless cake with lots of sugar and cinnamon. Perhaps they forgot the salt. I would just skip dessert here.
