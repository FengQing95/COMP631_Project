Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////It was a very lively establishment. DJ spinning and lots of instragramable moments. A cool fact about this place is that they carry over 300 different types of whiskies according to our server. He also said the chicken fried steak is as big as Tyra Banks's forehead when I couldn't decide between that or the chilaquiles hah!
