Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I got the pancakes set. Peach cobbler, today's special, and French toast. Truly the most awesome pancakes I've ever had in my life. The pancakes were fluffy and the toppings are great. The pancakes to toppings ratio was perfect. The peach cobbler one was basically dessert for breakfast.
