JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is run by a bunch of jokers! We sat down and ordered our food. We waited 35 minutes for them to bring our food out. They only had one other table that had people in the entire place and had 4 waiters sitting around. Finally one of them came to the table to notify us that the waiter who took our order forgot to place it in their system. What a bunch of retards!
