Local Foods////Super healthy and very tasty. We got the gulf coast shrimp and crab sandwich with quinoa and pasta salad and the house made chips. Very filling and fresh ingredients with excellent flavor and makes you feel good! Healthy food never had a better twist. Also the pretzel bun is to die for! Very fun ambiance and nice outdoor seating arrangement.
