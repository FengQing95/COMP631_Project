Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The most recent time I came here, I wanted to order something different, so I tried the sweet potato bacon smash up (5/5). This felt like a slightly healthier dish, and it was honestly VERY filling and delicious. I also smothered it with hot sauce to give it a nice kick. I would recommend this dish!
