Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We came here for happy hour, and the food was delicious. We had the gulf tuna wraps and the gold medal chicken sandwich. The gulf tuna wraps on happy hour came with 2 wraps for $5. The full order on the menu was 4 for $12 so I just ordered 2 HH orders for $10! If you check in at this location, you also get 10% off your order. I could see this restaurant being a tad pricey for dinner. But if you come for lunch/happy hour, there are some pretty reasonable prices.
