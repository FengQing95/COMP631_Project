Local Foods////Overall the place is nice and food is clean. The concept is sweet and fits right in the village area. But for as busy as it is, I really do think Houstonians are settling on the concept. Concept outweighs the taste at this joint. Just get some damn season and it will be on-point like a Texas Star.
