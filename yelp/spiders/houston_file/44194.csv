Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Will I Return? - No doubt.  Not only am I craving the cookies and that roll as I write this review, but there's also the breakfast side of Common Bond Cafe & Bakery that needs to be explored!  Who am I kidding, breakfast will be just an excuse to bring a dozen cookies home. 1 Star.
