Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////To my disappointment (again) it was completely lacking in flavor. I tried each item separate - nothing. Peppered and salted and was somewhat better. Most Houstonians are used to (and expect) flavors. Throw some red pepper flakes, salt anything into the cakes and they'll be great! Add some Worcestershire, clam juice or olives to the bloody mary!
