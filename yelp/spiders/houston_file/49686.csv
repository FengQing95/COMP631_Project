Snooze, an A.M. Eatery//// I ordered the OMG French toast with a side of bacon, the food took about 25 mins to come out then when it finally came the bacon came out cold then to make it worse it came out probably 5 mins before my French toast. My dates food came out all together though, chocolate chip pancakes & the snooze burrito. Once I got my food it was delicious & more than enough! But we never got refills on our drinks, she came by once.. & well yeah it was just a turn off for the whole experience. Maybe we'll just order togo from now on.
