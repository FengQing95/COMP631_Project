Local Foods////Crispy chicken sandwich - I am one of those people who don't eat chicken. it's a waste of a protein. If you eat meat, don't waste your time with chicken, etc etc. But damn it. I broke one of my fundamental rules and indulged in their chicken sandwich. Â Sweet, savory, crunchy, juicy all on top of the perfect pretzel roll. Holy sweet mother of corgi, this was the best chicken sandwich I've ever had.Period. End of story. My favorite sandwich in Houston.
