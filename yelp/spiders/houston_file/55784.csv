Kata Robata////I'd been meaning to try Kata Robata for a while ever since a friend of mine recommended it to me, so as soon as the chance came, I reserved a table for 6. It took a few calls for my reservation to go through, but the day of, we didn't experience extra wait time as some of the other reviewers have mentioned.
