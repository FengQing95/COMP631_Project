Uchi////Definitely one of the best sushi restaurants in Houston to me! I came in on a Wednesday night for happy hour. It was my first time here and it was a very pleasant time even though we sat on the bar. Food and service were both great. Even though, our server got our order wrong twice 1 drink (we didn't complain since they were good), and 1 small dish (we ordered the walu tempura and they brought out the walu walu). However, our server didn't hestitate to tell us to keep it and brought out the right one after.
