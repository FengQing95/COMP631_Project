JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Patty - Thanks for your great review. I hope you visit us again, and if you do, please ask your server for your ramen to be made with "Less Salt." And I also happen to agree with you that loud music is not for everyone. In fact, I prefer dinner over soft music. However, JINYA's restaurant concept is geared towards a trendy, loud atmosphere. And this is, unfortunately, one of the many guidelines we are legally bound to follow as a JINYA franchise. Regardless, I will continue to relay these messages to our corporate headquarters.
