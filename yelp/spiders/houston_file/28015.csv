The Pit Room////The place was decently clean and the line was short and the staff was friendly. But the food was not great. I had the brisket taco which was good but after eating my father in laws brisket there was really no comparison. I heard real Texans do not go the BBQ restaurants and if this place is a representation of Texas BBQ then yeah I think you should BBQ at home. The pork taco was sweet and lacking in flavor. The elote was drowned in some red oil... yuck! Took it back and got their decent Mac and cheese. Their okra taste like BBQ smoke instead of okra. And their sweetened black tea was good. I got a refill on that. But overall not a place I would not eat here again.
