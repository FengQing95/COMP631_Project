Uchi////Unfortunately, we did not care for the maguro sashimi and goat cheese bigeye tuna, pumpkin seed oil, and fuji apple. The texture of the tuna was nice, but completely flavorless. We did order our normal sashimi and rolls which were also very tasty, but were missing a little bit of the WOW factor that you come to expect when dining here.
