Uchi////I'll definitely come back. I think I need to stop getting the vegetarian tasting, though, and focus on the vegetarian rolls, because now I know what I want. I enjoy the fruit / cold dishes as well as the rice / egg dish that always come with the tasting, but I think I'd rather just have 2-3 rolls that I know I'll enjoy.
