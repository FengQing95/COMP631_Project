Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Walking in is a feast for the eyes. So many treats behind the low glass divider are there as soon as you walk through the door. This was my first visit here and a friend suggested it when I mentioned a cookie craving. She actually said that she doesn't like this place but since I'd never been, she'd let me make my own opinion. She's a good friend.
