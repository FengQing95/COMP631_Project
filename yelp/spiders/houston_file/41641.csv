Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Great pastries. I'd put the the kouign-amman on par with Dominique Ansel Bakery and Kitchen in NYC. Both delicious in their own ways and both worth trying. I'm a big fan of their savory poached egg and ham on rotating bread selection for breakfast too. The fact that they also have Stumptown coffee, friendly service, and a beautiful interior makes it an easy decision for me to find an excuse to come back.
