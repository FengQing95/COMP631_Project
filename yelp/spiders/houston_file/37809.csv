Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////OK, on to the menu! To be honest, I was a little taken aback by the prices of the cocktails for the size...make no mistake, you get what you pay for. I ordered the Kerouac and it is honestly one of the most refreshing cocktails I've ever had. My table split a few appetizers. The hush puppies were so-so while the parmesan crusted meatloaf was incredible! I ordered the "Kentucky Hot Brown." If you have any self respect, you'll treat yourself to this. While it doesn't look like Â sandwich when it's brought out, it is packed with melted cheese and tender meat SO GOOD you won't regret it.
