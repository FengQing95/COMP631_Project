JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The pork bao rolls were excellent, mini tacos were ok, and the ramen was good. I wished the noodles were thicker but the broth had a good flavor. Overall though, I wouldn't say it was worth the wait and inability to talk with my friends. But maybe that's expecting too much out of a place in Midtown.
