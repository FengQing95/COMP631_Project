Kata Robata////I highly recommend getting the chutoro, which is medium fatty tuna. It's a bit pricey (4 pieces sashimi for $18), but boy is it worth it. It was probably the most tender, fatty piece of raw fish I've ever eaten. It almost melted in my mouth. Now I normally don't enjoy eating raw fish or anything raw, but this made me a believer.
