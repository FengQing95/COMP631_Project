Uchi////My husband and I went to Uchi for my birthday and had a fantastic time. He had made reservations in advance, and we still had to wait a while before we were seated. However, the service was terrific- we waited outside and had a few cocktails. The servers were constantly checking on us and getting us more drinks. It was a very happy birthday. :)
