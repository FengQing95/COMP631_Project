JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The menu selections is surprisingly large for a typical ramen establishment.  There are many appetizers available to pair up with your ramen and a wide variety of sakes/drink selections to chose from.  There are also non ramen options available as well.  Started with a nice cold sake suggested by the waiter.  For appetizers, our favorites were the Pork Bun and the Fried Brussels sprouts.  The pork bun is a generous serving of pork belly between a white bun paired with some vegetables.  For those who have visited the Ipudo chains in New York - these pork buns are right up there with theirs.  The Brussels sprouts were surprisingly tender on the inside then crispy on the outside.  Highly recommend both appetizers.
