Kata Robata////Probably one of the best restaurants in Houston overall, simply because absolutely everything is good.  It's clear that they only cook with top quality ingredients.  My faves:  Kakuni pork belly, lobster mac and cheese, Kata ramen, Kata's fresh catch ceviche and the Kobe beef.  We had a few sushi rolls as well and while they were delicious the other food was simply beyond delicious.  It's a bit pricey but the quality shines through.
