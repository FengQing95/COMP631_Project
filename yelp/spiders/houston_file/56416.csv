Kata Robata////While the omakase is definitely NOT cheap - let me be real: it's $135 per person - it's COMPLETELY worth it for a special night out (lol @ me thinking "hey Ma let's go eat freaking omakase for no specific reason and I'll pay!!!). But hey, I'm happy that my mom enjoyed it so much, which made me enjoy Kata even more than I already did.
