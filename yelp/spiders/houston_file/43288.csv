Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My favorite bakery since 2014! I love all their bread. Kouign Amann is my favorite though. I love the caramelized top! Its so delicious!! Â It goes very well with coffee. The almond croissant is also very delicious! I love the almond filling on the bottom. I come here at least once a month although my home is 30 minutes away!
