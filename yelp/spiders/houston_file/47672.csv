Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////After calling to hear that the wait was 15-20 minutes, I decided to bring our family there. When we arrived we were told it would be 20-30. The actual wait was 50 minutes. After being seated, the waitress took a while to come ask us what drinks we wanted. We ordered all our drinks and food right away. She said she put in the order first then brought our drinks. After about 30 minutes and my baby asking to eat several times, I asked how much longer it would be. This is where she told us it would come when it comes and that they opened at 630 so what did we expect? Not cool snooze.
