Uchi////I went to Japan in the spring and have eaten at this location twice since then.  The first time post Japan I assumed any critiques could be due to the fact that I had had so much amazing Japanese food a short while before.  The second time though my palate had reaclimatized to the Houston area, and I am disappointed to say it is not the same as it was last year.
