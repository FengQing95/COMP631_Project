Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Got here around 10 am on a Wednesday. Absolutely loved their regular coffee, and their brioche. Had a taste of almond croissant and I thought it was great. If you are expecting guadalapana's almond croissants with a huge filling, do yourself a favor and go there as its not too far and this place is too expensive if you're not in love with it.  As far as seating and layout... It was pretty packed inside and too hot too sit outside. Thankfully we found a spot by one of the windows inside. It was a bit challenging to maneuver my way inside. I definitely think they tried their best with some creative seating options since they have some communal tables and bars and two booths, but I felt like I was playing hopscotch trying to get in and out of the place without stubbing by toe on someone's chair.  Won't stop me from returning though!
