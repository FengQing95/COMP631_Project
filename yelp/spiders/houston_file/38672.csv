Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The poutine was definitely the star of the show. I would highly recommend it if you stop in here. The fries were seasoned nicely, the pork belly and gravy and cheese curds were really rich, and the fried egg was the perfect compliment. My friend ordered the house short rib. I had a bite and it was amazing. Order this is you choose to go for dinner.
