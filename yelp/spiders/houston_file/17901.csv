Uchi////We ordered the ham and eggs which is a pork belly roll. Prior to this experience, I had had a bad taste in my mouth about pork belly, literally but this roll totally changed my mind. It was crispy and perfectly sized and tasted like the best bite of breakfast you've ever had. Two things that are a must for me are the uchiviche and the mochi cure. Both have such fresh and unique flavors that you really have to try them. We also had the crunchy tuna which of course was good but fairly standard. Next we had the maguro sashimi and goat cheese which may sound like a strange combination but it could not have been more perfectly paired. It came with apples and a sort of balsamic and oil dressing. It was perfect. We decided to also try 2 sushi that we hadn't had before, flounder and madai. Both were perfectly prepared and we really loved hat the sushi rice was warm and a little crispy because it provided such a nice contrast against the cool fish.  The last thing we tried was by far the end all be all to this amazing culinary adventure... Fois nagiri. I could not imagine ending the meal another way. It was one perfect bite of crispy and smooth, sweet and salty, decadent fois gras.
