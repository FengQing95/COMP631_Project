Kata Robata////The Hawaiian small plate is absolutely amazing! Who would have every thought that sashimi and foie gras would compliment each other? Well worth the price to pay for this culinary triumph. The sashimi is sliced and plated in a flat fanned position with a lemony sauce drizzled atop with a small amount of green onions just to give it a little extra umpf while the foie gras is delicately placed at the foot of the sashimi. I tried both individually and together...either way, it was a delightful surprise to how good they were together.
