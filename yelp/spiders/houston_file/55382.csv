Kata Robata////What can I can say. Perfect experience. Waiter suggested we do chefs choice. When James Beard award winning chef sends something to your table you bet it'll be amazing. Dish after dish the waiter basically set up our mark we let chef take full control. I have never been to a restaurant where I ate what ever was sent to the table. Pure bliss this is truly the best sushi in Houston. Best I've ever had too.
