Uchi////Uchi will forever remain a part of my memory as it is the first omakase I've ever tried in HTX. Since then, as a couple we've continued coming here and enjoying a grand night out, blessed with the situation that we had almost no clue what we'd be fed--we just knew we were gonna eat GOOD. With omakase their's always one or two dishes you can say "meh" to, but in the grand scheme of things, Uchi always delivers quite a show and always knocks it out of the park with their tongue flipping pieces of nigiri.
