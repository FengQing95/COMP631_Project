Uchi////Overall, me and the fiance + 2 big eatters came out paying about $110 per person (excluding booze).  This is a place definitely designed for a group of 4; it is pricey and the dishes are small, but it is fine dinning, the fusion is something you can't get elsewhere in Houston (no more dousing everything in mayo and sweet dark sauce).  Uchi's big take on the fusion Japanese food is the citrus notes, freshness of its ingredients used, and definitely no mayo dredged all over the roll.
