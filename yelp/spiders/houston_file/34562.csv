Local Foods////My friends have been talking about this place for some time now and what finally brought me here was my friend not shutting up about how good their kale salad side was.. So we finally arrive as soon as they open and check out the menu. It's a pay-and-order-at-the-counter, sit down, and wait for your food to arrive sort of deal. Friend decides to get the egg salad sandwich thing and I got the steak, bacon, and egg sandwich...as for sides, we both opted for the soba noodles and tuscan salad. At the register I looked at their desserts and noticed the volume to price ratio... ultimately deciding on grabbing a butterscotch brownie for $3. I don't know if people realize this but for just a full and delicious dessert/snack, that's actually a DAMN good deal. The brownie itself was nice, moist, dense yet "tender" enough to easily chew (just like a brownie I guess haha). All in all, I literally would drop by just to buy a few if I were ever in the neighborhood.
