The Pit Room////Nathaniel was very helpful on recommending different food options. We loved the sautéed okra!!! I would come back just for the okra! It's seasoned and I love that it's sautéed and not fried like everywhere else in houston!! The pork ribs were very flavorful and the brisket was pretty good as well! lol. The sauce added a nice kick to our meal. The only thing I wasn't to crazy about was the Mac and cheese.
