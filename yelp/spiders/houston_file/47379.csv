Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////You have to try this place!!!! If you love breakfast, this is it!!! AWESOME food, great people, staff and consumers. The atmosphere was and all around very relaxed and comfortable setting. I had the a cappuccino,tacos, and a side of bacon, which was more than enough. Great seasoning, great flavor!! My son had pancakes, I'm not a pancake person, but best believe next time I will be getting them. Come early the wait was a hour, but really worth it!!
