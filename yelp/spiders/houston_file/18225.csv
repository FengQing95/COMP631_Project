Uchi////Everyone's ready to drop their panties over this place.  While it is good, it's also overpriced and the service is a bit underpar.  The sushi portions are really small, but well done, almost artsy.  The flavor is outstanding.  There was a horrible smell when I was there, which turned out to be the roasting of the soy beans, which tasted awesome, so they were forgiven for that.  Nice people watching.  I spent about $100 for two for not that much sushi at all.  I might go back if someone else was buying.  I'm still looking for that awesome, all-around sushi restaurant in Houston... my quest continues.
