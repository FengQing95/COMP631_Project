Baby Barnaby's////I just moved to the area and I love trying all of the restaurants around my new apartment! Baby Barnaby's is so so delicious. My friend and I woke up early and decided to check this place out. When we walked up to this location, the workers outside greeted us and we sat inside. Luckily there was no wait when we arrived. The restaurant itself isn't very big but then again I guess that's why its called Baby? Haha...but it is a really cute restaurant and has a very welcoming feel to it. They have this orange juice machine that I was fascinated by and I loved watching them make the orange juice. I'm sure no one else will think much about it but I was really entertained !
