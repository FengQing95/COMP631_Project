Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We frequent the Heights location pretty often food quality and service are both high. This location just wasn't hitting the mark. Both service and food quality is was low. French toast breakfast was cold, sent it back, upon return bacon was damn near raw. Asked if we could have crisper back and they sent us the most burnt up inedible pieces of bacon ever. Finally had to talk to the manager which I NEVER do. She seemed unbothered by the whole situation. She said she was going to return the charge to the card but I'm not sure that will actually happened. The food there costs too much to be executed so poorly next time we will take the extra 10 minutes to drive to the heights location or maybe one of the other great breakfast spots in the area like Brazil, Baby Barnabys or even Snooze.
