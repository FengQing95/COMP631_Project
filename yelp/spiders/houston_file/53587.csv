Kata Robata////I went with the hubs and was excited that we got there before happy hour ended (7 pm, I believe).  I got myself a bubbly mimosa which tastes good but was just annoying.  Because of all the fizzy champagne, all the mint just floats in the top and gets all over your teeth.  Not attractive.
