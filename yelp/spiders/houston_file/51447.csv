Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I love eating at Snooze for breakfast/brunch. Their pancake flight (includes 3 pancakes of your choice) is not to be missed. The wait always seems to be the biggest drawback to all of the locations because it's so popular. But, once I've been seated, the customer service and food are both fantastic.
