Kata Robata////Food was good. We got the sashimi plate for 2 and the lobster mac and cheese and that was plenty for 2. We left full and happy. We liked everything in the sashimi platter expect the raw shrimp. Mac and cheese was good too. I'm not a huge mac and cheese or lobster person but I did enjoy this. It is very heavy though. It was very busy and the server didn't check on us much and wasn't very attentive. I had to ask another random server to give me a new water because mine had a fly in it and it took to long for our assigned server to come back and check on us. It was good quality but I've had the same quality sushi in less expensive places with better service. I'd go back for lunch when it's hopefully less busy but I'd probably skip out for dinner. We went for a birthday dinner and they didn't ask what our occasion was or anything. I think if they were less busy or they had more servers it would help them be able to give their guests the attention they deserve and get a 5 star rating. Overall, I recommend for the food but don't expect the most attentive service.
