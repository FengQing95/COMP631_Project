JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went there for the first time yesterday and I absolutely looooooved it! I had the spicy chicken ramen...it was delicious. We had the dumplings for an appetizer and omg they were delicious as well. We also ordered drinks that were very good. Service was great. Loved the atmosphere and we had a very nice waitress. I can't wait to go back!
