Baby Barnaby's////Got the green eggs. Â I don't know if it was a mistake, but there was so much butter in the eggs that I struggled to enjoy the other flavors there. (So I packed it up in a container for my little brother to eat for breakfast the next day :P ) Breakfast potatoes were perfectly crisp but could use a little seasoning. Warning: chicken sausage is sweeter in flavor, which isn't my thing, but I know for next time! As the food quality and service were great, I'll definitely be back to try other things there!
