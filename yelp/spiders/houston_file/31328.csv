Local Foods////The Crunchy Chicken Sandwich is probably the best sandwich I have ever eaten in my entire life...I cannot think of any other sandwich that comes close.  I salivate when I think of the pretzel bun, what I think are crunchy BBQ flavored potato chips inside the sandwich, and some sort of delicious sauce.  The sliced chicken breast was very moist too.  If I lived in Houston and lived near Rice Village, I might eat here once a week...but alas, I do not live in Houston.  My friend also enjoyed the Truffled Egg Salad sandwich.  Seems like both sandwiches are their most popular.  The only reason why Local Foods isn't getting 5 stars from me is because their sides were just ok.  The sides are just a little too healthy and are odd combinations.
