Kata Robata////Went here for my Bday and the food was great. The kobe beef skewers were my favorite. One thing id note is the building has terrible acoustics which makes up for a lot of loud talking. I really enjoyed it but I wouldn't say its not on the same level as uchi. Uchi takes the cake for ambience, quality, service, and food. Not sure I agree with the Chrons rating. But don't misunderstand Â I 'll be coming back because it was still really good!
