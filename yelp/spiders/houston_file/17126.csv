JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This used to be my go-to ramen place in person and via Uber eats... but I think after 2 uber eats incidents wherein this happened I won't buy from Jinya anymore. Uber eats is SO expensive so I only order from Jinya when I really want to because of the extra fees... but wow this is the second time they left out or forgot an entire dish from my orders! I ordered 2 ramens and 1 takoyaki and didn't get the takoyaki. So I basically paid over $100 for 2 bowls of ramen. Basically lost a lot of money... sigh. I think I'm traumatized by now. Don't think I'll be ordering here again.
