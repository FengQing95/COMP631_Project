Uchi////The phrase that described the food is "flavor bomb" with each small bite. Now Iv always said I wouldn't like the fancy places that serve small portions- however this was definitely worth it. I got this 1 mushroom piece thing and it really tasted/felt like fish. The portion is small but really good. The number one thing I loved was the Brussels sprouts! They did sooooo good with this. We ended with the lovely frozen milk dessert which was such a fun experience with sooo many textures that complimented each other very well.
