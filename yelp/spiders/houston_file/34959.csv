Local Foods////This is a nice place to grab a quick lunch. I got the shrimp and crab sandwich with chips and fruit. The fruit for today was grapefruit. It was sweet and juicy and not tart at all. The sandwich had a nice sauce that didn't overpower the seafood and the ciabatta bread was warm and fresh. The chips were Ok. Could have Â had a little salt/seasoning on them. I would recommend this place if you want an option for lunch that's not heavy fried foods.
