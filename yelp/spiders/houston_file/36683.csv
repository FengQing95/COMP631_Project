Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Loved the atmosphere of this place and if you like Bourbon this is your place.  They have the coolest looking private room with Bourbon bottles all over the walls.  I had two drinks, one the Boss Lady and it was awesome and the second was Pineapple and Tequila  which was even better.  We ordered the pulled pork hushpuppies to begin with because we had never heard of this and they were good and we loved the BBQ sauce that was paired with them.  Then we ordered the Bosscat burger and the black bean club sandwich, both did not disappoint.  We thought this place was a really fun place and we wished we lived closer.  We will definitely be back some time.
