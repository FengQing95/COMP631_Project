Uchi////Recently I finally got to try this place after everyone has said it was sooo good. or how it is their favorite. I'm typically a pretty picky person so I was kind of nervous (especially when it comes to sushi). I ended up ordering almost all of the meat dishes possible and of course the fried milk which was super delicious. My absolute favorite has to be the 72 hour cooked pork or beef rib nigiri. If I went back, I would order at least 2-3 of those myself. The next would be this other beef dish that had broccolini in it (I forgot what it was called but looked like a Japanese version of ribeye spelled like ribouai or something lol). The hot rock was also pretty good and it was kinda cool to cook the meat on there.
