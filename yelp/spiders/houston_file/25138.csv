Uchi////Caveat: I love nigiri (fish on rice)/sashimi/oysters so those are what I eat in Boston, NY, Seattle, and California. Read: primarily only in those places, where the fish is fresh. (Raw seafood is, admittedly, the one "food group" I'm picky about and will appear to be a snob for. Please excuse me.) Although I've had decent salmon pieces at Osaka, I had pretty much given up finding good fish in Houston. Until yesterday when I walked into Uchi.
