Uchi////I had a really good dinner here yesterday.  I'll say overall it's a tad bit over-rated in my opinion based on the wonderful things i've heard over the years.  Although, I had an excellent meal, I kind of went in with the expectation that this will be a 5 star restaurant.  It was close but in the end I thought it missed that level by just a little bit.  i will say that the service from our Waitress and Servers was really good.  The servers did a great job explaining each dish if it was your first time to have it.  And the Waitress would wipe off our table here and there as needed and was very knowledgeable about the dishes as well. Now on to the food, here's a quick breakdown of my meal.
