They were out of a fish, and they went ahead and substituted it with a different fish without consulting me, the kori kaki was just ok, and the uni was quite possibly the smallest serving I have ever gotten. The fish wasn't out of this world delicious or mind blowingly fresh. I wasn't given soy sauce or told if the fish was already sauced, it was just a weird dining experience.
