Local Foods////We caught a table leaving and by the time we arrived the busser cleaned it quickly. The food took about 5 minutes and was tasty. My shrimp & crab was on a nice bread that was crisp outside but soft inside. The kale salad was flavorful however the house made chips needed a bit more seasoning but they did stay nice and crispy. My co workers had the piled high pastrami with chips and mixed fruit (which turned out to be a small unpeeled tangerine) and the crispy chicken sandwich with cole slaw/kale salad (i will be back to try that sandwich!) Â Were able to have a good chat and eat before returning to work. I noticed many others were doing the same, a lot of scrubs since it is so close to the Texas Med Center.
