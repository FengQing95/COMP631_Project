Uchi////Uchi has always been our go to for those special evenings, birthdays or anniversary. This time, it was for anniversary, where we ordered take out (we would never do that, but for Covid), and to no surprise, we thoroughly enjoyed the food. We are vegetarians and Uchi has always amazed is with their evolving veg menu. Though got take out the selection was limited, which I understand because they don't want to compromise on quality or experience. We could not order some of our favorites but shout out to Jessica, who helped us with the selection and portions, and made sure our experience was amazing.
