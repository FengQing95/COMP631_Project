Baby Barnaby's////This is my fail safe goto place for Brunch. The Green Eggs are a must try. The green eggs come out juicy, moist and perfectly cooked every time at this location, the original. The other locations are newer and shiner but have overcooked eggs. The servers here are friendly and know everybody's name, they've been there since I moved to Houston.
