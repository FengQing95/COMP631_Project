Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I was so excited to try this new venue after reading the reviews, however I found it extremely loud and very little seating area. The entire bar was closed for a book signing that only took up 1/3 of the bar area. Lame. The food was so so. They need to take the chicken BBQ flat bread off the menu it's gross, I found it slimy and literally had the texture of something purchased at a concession stand. The pulled pork hush puppies were decent but for the price not up to par. I asked for the Sauvignon Blanc and they were out. Really? So I opted for a Rose, which was fine. I find this place a bit overpriced and the food (starters) subpar.
