Uchi////I have been to Uchi many times and truly enjoyed the meal and experience. This last visit left me a little underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong all was well but I felt the 10 course meal we had had lost its luster. Nothing changed and when we asked for change it was a substitute of a chicken dish which felt a like a filler. Â
