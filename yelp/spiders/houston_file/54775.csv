Kata Robata////We had great dinner and great service last night. Always a great pleasure dining here since everything taste fresh and delicious! Salmon and tuna belly sashimi were great but the Japanese snapper was not as good. There a a small thick blunt fish bone when we bit into the sashimi. It was also a but chewier. The pork belly buns were OK..I wish it was slightly thicker and a bit more charred. The rolls and other items we had were great also.
