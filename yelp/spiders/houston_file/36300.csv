Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Can't think of a better place to celebrate my birthday! Everything on the brunch menu sounds amazing. Terry was full of recommendations and the chilaquiles are delicious. Don't pass up the bottomless mimosa/bloody special. aaaaand the music is bomb. Bosscat is officially one of my favorite brunch spots in Houston!
