Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////While I haven't tasted anything I did not like, the stand out so far is definitely (yep you guessed it) the chocolate croissant!  chocolatey, perfectly flaky ooey gooey goodness right there!  The same endorphins you get from the Big O's...yeah that's how good that croissant is.  I'd eat 2 and won't bat an eyelash.
