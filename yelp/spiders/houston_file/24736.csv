Uchi////Dinner at Uchi is definitely an enjoyable, delicious, and pricey experience. Though at a resturant like Uchi, it's expected to spend quite a bit, I can't say the food was good enough to warrant comnig back for the regularly priced menu. I am curious about their omakase and other fixed menus, but outside of the Sake Social, I wouldn't reccomend Uchi for the price. However, I am eager to return in the future and sample more of their menu. 4 stars.
