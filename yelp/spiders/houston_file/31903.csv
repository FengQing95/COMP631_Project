Local Foods////We love this place and eat here frequently. The Kale is my favorite, along with the soups and the vegetarian sandwich. The smoked salmon is pretty fabulous too. I love it all. Everything. The line moves quickly and the food is brought out even quicker. The folks that work there are knowledgeable and friendly. A great lunch spot or casual dinner spot!
