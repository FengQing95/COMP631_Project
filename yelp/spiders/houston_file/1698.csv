JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Ed - Thank yo very much for the 5-star review. We greatly appreciate it. Whenever we read guests' reviews that say our ramen reminds them of what they have had in Japan, we beam with pride. Although our original recipes have been slightly modified to appeal to a more Western palate, the essential DNA of our broths is purely Japanese. So on behalf of our back of house, we thank you for your kind words, and we hope you'll visit us again soon.
