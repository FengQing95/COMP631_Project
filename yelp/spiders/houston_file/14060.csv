JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I gave this location a 3rd chance to make my order correct.   When you order extra Spinach and add Spicy Bean Sprouts, you think you would have that in addition to the Spicy Chicken Wonton Soup you ordered. Well, I guess not.  What they give you is what you get, regardless of any extras you added.  Of course, I drive there, like anyone,  hoping you get what you order. NOPE...THEY STRUCK OUT.  I would love to support them, but they cant seem to get it right in my case.  Receipt # 60020
