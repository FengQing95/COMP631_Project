Kata Robata////The duck cold soba.... is the best cold soba I ever had. Cold soba is usually very plain and bland. Not this one. The duck was cooked perfectly and the foi gras went so well with the noodles. Also, the plating makes the amount of noodles look very little, but the two of us were too full to even finish. This was my favorite dish, I will come back solely for these noodles.
