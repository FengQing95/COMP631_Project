Kata Robata////My boyfriend and I love coming on dates here. I work close to Kata and he likes to meet me there for our favorite, Lychee Martinis (w/Vodka not Gin). Their sushi is both fresh and delicious. The chef often has new and great things on the menu, so it's never the same stuff over and over, even though we only order the same things :)
