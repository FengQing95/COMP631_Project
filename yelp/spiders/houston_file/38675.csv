Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I've only been here once, but I liked the experience. The staff was very accommodating as my friends and I were doing keto. They catered to the fact that we were on keto and adjusted our entrees as well as brought us extra veggies to dip into our appetiser dip. They have a whiskey room, too.
