The Pit Room////Please don't visit The Pit Room... The thought of enduring a 2hour wait line is disturbing (I've stood in the Franklin's BBQ line many times).  The Pit Room Turkey has a smoked flavor thru the meat, the brisket, juicy and packed with flavors and the pulled pork sandwich is heaven btwn a bun! Honestly, the BBQ does not require sauce but if your used to "wet", the sauce is delicious...  The condiment bar is loaded with add-ons.  The sliced pickles will put hair on your chest!  The Pit Room serves up the best BBQ, this side of Austin, period.  Nothing local (incl Killen's BBQ) comes close.  The owner and servers are just the nicest folks and they aim to please!  Not many restaurants can leave a lasting memory and a desire to return quickly.  The Pit Room is a dream come true..  Highly recommended!
