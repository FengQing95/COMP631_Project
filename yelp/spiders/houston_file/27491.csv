The Pit Room////I had me some brisket, sausuge, and of course had to get their Mac and cheese. Brisket is so juicy and tender..you can tell that they slow cook this bad boy. Sausuge is also really good. Had a nice spiciness to it, but not too overbearing. Mac and cheese shells were so good that I ate mine and my two friends lol. This place definitely lived up to my expectations and definitely impressed by buddies from Iowa. Staff was also very nice and friendly. I will definitely be back! Solid A+!
