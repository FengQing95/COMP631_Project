The Pit Room////Came here after work stood in line for 15minutes for lose cut brisket tacos only to be told by the guy with the multi color hair I have other orders to fill with the remaining brisket all I have are pieces which were dried out. Seriously my money is not for dried out remnants of brisket. Pit room you got to do better. Disappointed customer.
