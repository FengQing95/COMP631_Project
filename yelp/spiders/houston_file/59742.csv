Baby Barnaby's////I traveled clear across town to try Baby Barnaby's for brunch after church, and being the "religious" man that I am *cough cough* I barely had enough patience to tolerate the disappointing service. I get it. It's Barnaby's, it's always busy and popular amongst the locals, but 3 attempts to get my order right, after a 30 minute wait outside is not tolerable.
