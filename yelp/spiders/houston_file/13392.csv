JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////When we walked in you would have never guessed we were in the middle of a pandemic. It was packed and there was NO social distancing of ANY kind. We were to be seated at one of their large tables not 3 feet away from another customer and literally bumping shoulders with another. I felt so uncomfortable I immediately denied to be seated and opted to order take out instead. I cannot believe they are allowing such proximity as covid is rising again. Very disappointed with Jinyas concern for customer safety.
