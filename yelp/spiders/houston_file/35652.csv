Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place is a bit overrated. I've eaten here a total of about 4 times and have not been impressed at all. I usually go because other's pick the spot. I've been here for brunch, drinks, lunch and dinner. The food is okay, there are better restaurants out there for the price. My last experience was not the best, however, they handled it well. I ordered one of their brunch salads and it was drenched in salad dressing. I was not able to eat it at all (I am not the one to send things back for little things--yes that's how bad it was)--same for another girl in my group. They waved our salads on the check and offered us a $15 off $30 spend on our next visit. I did not feel like eating meat or a sugary pancake, so I left hungry. I will most likely not be eating here again.
