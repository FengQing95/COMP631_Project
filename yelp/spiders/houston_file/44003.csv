Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////One of my friends told me to make sure to get the almond butter croissant. However, by the time I got there (about 2pm on a Friday) they were all out. Boo hoo. So I ended up getting a chocolate chip cookie, which was SO good. It was crunchy on the outside, gooey on the inside and tasted like cookie heaven. It also had walnuts in it which I usually wouldn't be a fan of in a cookie, but it worked well here.
