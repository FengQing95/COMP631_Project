Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This restaurant was the final stop for my friends and I before flying out of Houston back to Philadelphia. We wanted to get some brunch and decided to come here based on previous yelp reviews and distance from our hotel. We had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated because the restaurant was packed, but I like the system they use of texting you when your table is ready. Our server was attentive, especially considering how busy it was in there. I ordered a decaf cappuccino with almond milk and the Bella Bella Benny. I've never had eggs Benedict like that before, and it may be hard for me to have it any other way. The eggs were perfectly poached with hollandaise sauce and a balsamic drizzle. Rather than the typical English muffin, the eggs were on toaster ciabatta, and a hash brown patty was on the side. Delicious! My friends also tried the juevos rancheros and the lemon poppyseed pancake. We all raves about how good the food was, and it was the perfect brunch place for our last day in Houston.
