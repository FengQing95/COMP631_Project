Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We've coming here almost every Wednesday for the past three years. We enjoy the siting and the food but the service lately has been horrible. The staff, and the order takers have a really negative attitude and make us feel unwelcome. They don't smile and they have a crappy attitude.
