Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Not sure if they're having an off day, but the service was terrible. This I was not a great first impression. Our waiter went extremely long periods without checking in on our table and we waited almost an hour for food. The food wasn't even that great once we did get it. The manager ended up comping part our meal to make up for it.
