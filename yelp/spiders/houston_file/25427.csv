Uchi////Literally the best sushi ever!! This place is absolutely amazing! This is by far the best sushi we have ever had. It lives up to it's hype, and I'm so happy it did. Our waiter Jay helped us and picked out a 10 course meal for us based on our likes and dislikes. He did amazing! The staff is exceptional they all work together so well. Can't wait to go again sometime! The fried milk dessert was amazing! The only picture I have is of the beef tartar because I was so excited to eat the food I forgot to take pictures! Try this place you will not be disappointed. Exceptional food and service is always at the top our list. The flavors are well balanced, the chef knows how to combine all of the flavors so well.
