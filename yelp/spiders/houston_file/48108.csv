Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I love this place. If you want to beat the rush and not wait for over an hour you need to get there at like 7:30 am. Overall it's worth it. Previously they had an "I Love you Elote" Benny that was amazing but apparently it was a seasonal item on the menu and it's gone now :( In lieu of that, the past few times I've returned I've tried their assortment of pancakes. All are good. My favorite is the pineapple upside down one. If you're indecisive you can do the flight but fyi if you ask the waiter, rather than doing 3 different pancakes you can switch a third one out for their OMG French toast (which does live up to its name) Their hot chocolate is a must too.
