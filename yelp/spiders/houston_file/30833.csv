The Pit Room////I am still hungry said no one who ate at the pit room when leaving. You have many options to choose from and you cannot make a bad choice. I had the beef rib with some pinto beans. It was amazing.  The outside of the rib was charred to perfection while the inside was very juicy and flavorful.  I am extremely picky with my barbecue; this did not disappoint in any way,shape, or form.
