Baby Barnaby's////Cons? Maybe a few new/different options or seasonal changes to the brunch menu would be nice...the list is somewhat small. And the place is always super packed (usually at least an hour wait on the weekends)...which of course means it's great, but it can be a drag having to wait. But really it's such a cool, chill place to plant yourself and enjoy the weekend that I don't mind. Will be back soon and often!
