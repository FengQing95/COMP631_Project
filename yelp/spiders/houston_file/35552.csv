Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Lack luster service ruined what may have been a decent experience. Front of house manager had no clue we had a bad experience despite being my group being very direct about our dissatisfaction. Very disconcerting that the management doesn't know what's going on with their 5-10% occupied restaurant. Paying 8 for a beer and 6 for fries the expectation is competent service and this fell way short. On top of our bartender not being spectacular, when we asked the other bartender to help us get our check he absolutely ignored the person seated directly in front of him at the bar... twice... no one checked on us from the time we ordered our food until we left without us having to wave our arms around as if we were on fire. We had to interrupt the bartender just to get the side items we had ordered because she was too busy talking to a server to check in with us to see if what we ordered had arrived.
