Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I came to the restaurant as part of a group of about a dozen people for a friend's birthday. We had a reservation on a Saturday at 12:30PM and had no problem getting a table. Shortly after we were seated, my friends celebrating his birthday and I asked our waiters for the whiskey menu. I am no whiskey sommelier but I have more than enough experience to navigate through a whiskey menu such as theirs. It took at least 30 minutes and asking on 3 separate occasions before a waiter had finally brought us out the whiskey menu. During the 30 minutes we were waiting for the whiskey menu our party ordered our food approximately 20 minutes in. In between the 2nd and 3rd time asking for the whiskey menu one of our waiters brought out a bottle (a special edition of 1792 for bosscat) asking my friend if he would like to try it to which he declined. After finally brining us the whiskey menu I decided to order W.L. Weller Special Reserve. While telling my whiskey order to the waiter he incorrectly repeated back to me the 1792 bosscat edition to which I reiterated to him I wanted to W.L. Weller Special Reserve. After about 15 minutes pass the SAME waiter returns to tell me they just ran out of a Russel's Reserve and he then asks me if I wanted to order a different whiskey. At this point I am halfway through my food so I told him I didn't want whiskey anymore. I had ordered the Divorced Eggs and they were ok but nothing spectacular. I had high expectations for this establishment based on pictures I had seen here on Yelp and their food and whiskey menu. My personal experience left me disappointed in the service. It's a place I want to like but can't recommend to friends or anyone that asks about it.
