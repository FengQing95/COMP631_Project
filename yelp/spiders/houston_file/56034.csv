Kata Robata////So.... since we came here for happy hour, we took advantage of the happy hour price! We ordered 6 items on the menu for two people. It was quite filling. Everything was fresh. There are also happy hour mixed drinks and wine. It was good, but the drink I ordered can have a bit more alcohol to it. Mixed drinks on the happy hour menu were only $5!
