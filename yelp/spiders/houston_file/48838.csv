Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I previously had a review about Snooze that wasn't the best because Â of lack of service from a fellow worker but I have now deleted my reviews to post this new one we went in to Snooze Saturday around 1pm wait was still long but that's expected no biggie the reason I changed and deleted my previous review is because the young lady I believe RooRoo is what the check said was outstanding with her service food was great she kept checking on our table as if it was our first time there her service reminded me of a gentleman that served us our first time which is great the food was great and the overall service was great manager came to our table to check if everything was great which shows a lot of care about there customers definitely going back again management should applaud RooRoo she was great
