Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Three stars for what I ordered, not the restaurant. I got the soft scramble with toast and can't say it was worth the drive. The soft part didn't bother me. It has a powdery consistency that was undesirable. Also, I find this to be a shareable plate, but I only eat one egg. I'm not an expert but I would guess it the Parmesan that make it "powdery -like".
