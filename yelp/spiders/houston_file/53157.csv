Kata Robata////Awesome. I am not a sushi fan, but if I do sushi this will be the place. The way to go is to make a reservation and skip the lines. They have a great and interesting menu, the fish was fresh, and the rolls were well balanced . For the whiskey fans they have Yamazaki whiskey which is definitely a great way to start dinner.
