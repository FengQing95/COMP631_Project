Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Food: I got the almond croissant. So big, about as big as someone's palm. And it's already sweet on the inside with a custard, but the powdered sugar makes the sweetness overwhelming. I couldn't finish the whole thing...or even half; it's too much. Maybe a friend will like it.
