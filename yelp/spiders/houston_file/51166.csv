Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Ham Benedict III was amazing as well. Snooze is not kidding when their menu describes a "perfectly poached egg" under the description because the egg was indeed poached to perfection. When you cut your fork through the layer of hollandaise, egg, ham and English muffin, the egg yolk oozes out and spills down your tower of Benedict goodness. Perrrrrfect. I wasn't so big on the hash brown patty/cake that came along, but it was still decent.
