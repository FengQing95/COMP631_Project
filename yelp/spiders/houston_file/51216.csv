Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////4. Long Waits Made Easy: Â Snooze has a line out the door by 8 AM, but don't fret. Bypass the line, get your name on the list, and give them your number. They will text/call you when your table is ready and you have 10 minutes to get back. Hang out in your car, take a stroll, enjoy the beauty that is Montrose. Time flies by when you're not handcuffed to a waiting area. They stayed within the quoted wait time window (1-1.5 hr) and even ended the text with a :) emoji. :) Indeed.
