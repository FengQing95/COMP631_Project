JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Service: It's about a 45 minute wait during dinner time on the weekends and unfortunately they do not take reservations. I've been here on a weeknight for dinner and there was absolutely no wait which was nice. The waitresses are attentive, food is brought out promptly, and service is on par (no long waits for the check or waiting for them to bring back the bill). I'm used to quick NYC service and don't need the fluffiness of small talk and slow Southern dinners so I definitely love this place for NOT having that!
