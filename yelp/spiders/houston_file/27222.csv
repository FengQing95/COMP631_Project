The Pit Room////Stopped by here for an early dinner. I must the service here is excellent and everyone is super friendly. They even bussed our table for us when we were done. Â We ordered the brisket, pork rib, pulled pork, mac and cheese, and potato salad. It also comes with bread, which is nice. I liked the brisket and potato salad the best. Overall, pretty good food.
