JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Had to try this place because of the hype and because I love ramen. It was good, but not great. Nice smallish setting downtown with seating for about 50 (mostly small groups with 2 big tables). Nice drink menu with the typical beer, wine, cocktails, sake (5-10 of each). Plenty to choose from with appetizers, small plates, ramen, and dessert. They have some ramen creations you can order or create your own for a charge per topping. The flavor was pretty good. Service was okay. They all shouted some word (every time someone came in?) and sitting at the ramen bar it was loud and obnoxious.
