The Pit Room////On to the BBQ, so I ordered the three meat plate with brisket, jalape√±o cheddar sausage, and pork ribs. The sides that we ordered were potato salad and mac n cheese. We ran into our foodie buddy Tom there, and he recommended the chicken tacos. The chicken tacos has shredded chicken, light queso, and grilled garlic on top.
