JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The one negative is the alcohol cost. Geez! $7 dollars for a sierra nevada? $7 for a St Arnold Elissa IPA? Most bars will sell those for $3-5 dollars, and I get it is midtown and all, but that's going too extreme. Stick with water unless you feel like emptying your wallet a little.
