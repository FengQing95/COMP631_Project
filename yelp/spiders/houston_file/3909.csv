JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Shelbi - Thanks for your great review. I agree that our loud atmosphere is not for everyone. In fact, I prefer dinner over soft conversation and light music. However, JINYA's restaurant concept is geared towards a trendy, loud atmosphere. And this is, unfortunately, one of the many guidelines we are legally bound to follow as a JINYA franchise. We appreciate your understanding, though, and can only suggest you visit during off-peak hours when the house is a little less boisterous.
