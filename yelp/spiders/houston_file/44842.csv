Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I still have yet to try the $7 lemon bar and the scrumptious-looking vanilla-bean-whipped-cream-laden cheesecake, but I since my last review have been eating many a croissants and kouign amans (I can spell it now, guys).  I also decided I'm going to stick only to the kouign aman over pan au chocolait from now on.  I'll have to try the almond next.
