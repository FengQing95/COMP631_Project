The Pit Room////Delicious! The Pit Room is within walking distance from my office, so my co-worker and I walked on over today since it is not hell fire hot. I had the brisket with mac and cheese and elote, which I learned today is street corn. The brisket was nice and juicy and the sauce isn't half bad for city sauce. The mac and cheese was very creamy and the street corn was soooo tasty. Best corn I have had maybe ever. My friend had brisket with potato salad and coleslaw. She like everything too. My only disappointment was the cole slaw was vinegar based and not creamy, mayo based but that is just a personal taste. I can't wait to go back and try the brisket tacos and some cherry pie.
