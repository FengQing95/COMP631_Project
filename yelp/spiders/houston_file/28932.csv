The Pit Room////Called an order in and picked it up curb side. I ordered half a chicken and potato salad. My oh my, I was blown away by the sheer freshness of the meat, and the season was spot on, I can taste it through out the entire chicken down to the bone. Yea I sucked the bones too, couldn't help myself. The potato salad wasn't bad either, I just had to add a little little sugar and just like that it turned into heaven in my mouth! Best smoked chicken in the area hands down... I'll be paying you another visit soon, new favorite..
