Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I ordered the Beet, Orange & Goat Cheese Salad; it consisted of colorful roasted beets, arugula, blood oranges, goat cheese and marcona almonds with a fabulous vinaigrette and very thin pumpernickel crisps. I also splurged and added a cup of their French Onion Soup. The soup was so good, and had lots of caramelized onions, gruyere cheese and their wonderful bread croutons.
