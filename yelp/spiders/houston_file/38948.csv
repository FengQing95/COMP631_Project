Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I came with a group of friends during Houston Restaurant Week 2019. It was already bookmarked on my yelp account so this was a good time to try it out. I was impressed with the food options as everything was house made. Â My favorite thing I ordered were the Brussels sprouts - sounds simple but i love veggies and these were cooked to perfection. I didnt order any drinks but the options were very interesting.
