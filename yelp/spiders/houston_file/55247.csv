Kata Robata////Atmosphere was nice. Good date place.  We came here for lunch. Because I heard from Chris C., to give their Ramen a go.  And alllll I wanted in my life yesterday, was good ramen. Great ramen. And goddamn it I found it.  So good, in fact, that I feel like I owe Chris a thank you drink.
