Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great pancakes, benedict, potatoes. The pancakes themselves are just average, but the toppings make them really tasty, albeit over the top. The wait is consistently insanely long, though, and parking is a struggle. The food is definitely good enough to come back, but we probably won't because who waits 1 hr for pancakes?
