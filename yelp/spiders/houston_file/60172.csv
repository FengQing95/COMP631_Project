Baby Barnaby's////Simply the best brunch in Houston. I love the ambiance and the coziness. I don't even mind the wait with the free coffee and water. Expect 30 minutes on the weekend, shorter during the week. While the menu is a bit limited, the servings are large and delicious. The green eggs dish with the chicken sausage is a hands-down must. It's definitely the star of the show. Prices are reasonable for what you get.
