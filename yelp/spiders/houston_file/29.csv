Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Ladies and gentleman there seems to be a new hotspot for drinks and great food.  I came here with a group of friends because we had heard great things about this place.  We were not left disappointed!  Everything was great from beginning to end and it turned out to be a great night.  The valet guys rocked it by swiftly taking care of us and directing us to the entrance!  I was very impressed, at first glance the space is very modern and inviting. Our waiter was so awesome and even though we were a large group, he was very animated and made lots of suggestions.  He seemed genuinely excited in suggesting items to us.  There were so many plates and appetizers going around and they were all equally good.  What stood out to me the most was the pulled pork hushpuppies, short ribs, and the bosscat burger.  They do seem to specialize in whiskey but they also offer girly cocktails.  I think guys can really appreciate their expertise in Whiskey!  Most of us tried the bosscat tea and lemonade and the bosscat mule!  These are generally my go to cocktails.  You simply cant go wrong with them.  I'll definitely be back to try more!
