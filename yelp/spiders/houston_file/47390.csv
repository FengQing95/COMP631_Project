Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I originally went to Snooze in Colorado and I LOVED IT! I was so excited when I heard it will be in Houston. However it's really not the same! The service at this location is decent, the food is not that good and kinda thrown together. I feel like this location can't handle the volume at busy times. The quality of their food goes down when it's busy. Despite there being open tables they can still quote you a 30 to 45 min wait time. This place isn't terrible, but I'm not that impressed.
