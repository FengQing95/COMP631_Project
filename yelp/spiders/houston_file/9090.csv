JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I absolutely love Jinya! Due to the variety and ability to completely change your dish with add-in, the restaurant has become a regular spot for me. My favorite is the spicy chicken ramen which comes with some of the most tender chicken I've ever ordered out. Â Try it with fresh garlic for an added treat.
