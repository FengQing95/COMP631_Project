The Pit Room////I was in Houston for the conference and was impressed by the Yelp reviews. I am not a bbq eating expert but I was excited to have some solid bbq #whenintexas. I came with a group of five so we got the share platter, which includes each of the meats they cook (turkey, pork ribs, beef ribs, pulled pork, and brisket) and four sides. It costed $90. We opted for okra, pork rinds, chips, and bread as our sides. Overall, the bbq was solid. We chatted with the owner, who was sweet and make sure we took the leftovers with us. He would've been made if we didn't! Yes, there was leftovers! They smoke their meat with post oak wood which doesn't infuse flavor in the meet and holds integrity to the rubs and seasoning. They have really mastered the art of bbq!
