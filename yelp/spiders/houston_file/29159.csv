The Pit Room////We've heard great reviews so we decided to check it out.  It was all that and a bag of chips, and a bag of cookies!! We ordered the 3 meat plate, sausage, brisket and turkey.  For sides, we had coleslaw, green beans and potato salad.  Everything was very good.  The outside patio is great, they have big screens for the sports fanatic, but yet, the patio is cozy and quiet.  Two thumbs up!!
