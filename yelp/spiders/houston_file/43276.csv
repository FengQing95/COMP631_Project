Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Coming to this place is always a treat, though I can't always afford it as a college student. At the risk of sounding pretentious, I'm pretty particular about my coffee. Though I'm not sure if their coffee is my favorite, the lavender latte is my go to. Very light and fragrant. All the pastries I've had are pretty good. I just recently had their soft scrambled parmesan eggs as well--came with fresh slices of baguette to smear it on. So yummy, 10/10 would recommend.
