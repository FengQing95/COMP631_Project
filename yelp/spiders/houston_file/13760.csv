JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Deanne - Thank you very much for the 5-star review. We greatly appreciate your kind words. We have definitely noticed a sharp uptick in the number of customers who visit us on the (very few) days of cooler weather here in Houston. That said, we appreciate your understanding of the extended wait times.
