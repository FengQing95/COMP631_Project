Kata Robata////Then we had more sake and assorted kind of sushi ( salmon, toro, kobe beef, and hamachi) and the caribbean roll. OMG! the toro was fantastic !!!!!!!! After the first one, we ordered more bc it was so fresh and it totally melted inside my mouth, but I was kinda disappointed at the kobe beef one. and the caribbean roll was pretty decent too !
