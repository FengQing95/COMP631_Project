Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food.  The food.  The food.  The latte was crafted exactly well.  The menu doesn't say it but the breakfast burrito was HUGE!  Stuffed with everything, meat, egg, potatoes, veggies.  All complimenting each very well.  The French toast topped with fresh berries and its best friend -- mascarpone cheese.
