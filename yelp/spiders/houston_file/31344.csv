Local Foods////Awesome place! It's one of my favorite places for a weekend lunch or after the gym. Some of the things I like the most: healthy food (hard to find in Houston), great sides (they even manage to make kale taste good), and nice variety. Â A couple of my favorite dishes are the pork banh mi and te crunchy chicken. It's a staple for me on my excursions into Rice Village.
