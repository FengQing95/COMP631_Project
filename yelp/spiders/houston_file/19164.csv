Uchi////This is a truly outstanding restaurant.   It is expensive and the portions are small, but I can't think of a place with better sushi.  The fish is incredibly fresh and the chefs are incredibly skilled at preparing it.  There are wonderful non-sushi dishes, too like amazingly well prepared pork belly.  We loved the Brussels sprouts and the fish flown in from Japan's  Tsukiji  fish market.   The waiters are knowledgeable about the dishes and the wine, too.  There is no --" I don't know, I haven't tasted it.".  Thell them the kind of wine you like and they will find it for you.  We go there when ever we have a chance.   So far, we have gone to dinner there early and always gotten a seat.  No lines.  I hear that later in the dinner hour one might have to wait.   Expensive and worth it.  Here is a place where you don't mind giving a really good tip.
