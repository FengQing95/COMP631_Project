Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I love the idea of a pulled pork hush puppy. Great mashup. Cooked very well. Looked delicious. Sauce was a bit meh and it would be nice to taste a bit of smoke in the pork, but that may get lost when fried in the hush puppy. But an awesome started nonetheless especially with a cold beer.
