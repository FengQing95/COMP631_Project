Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat is amazing! First time coming here and from the moment we walked in, we were welcomed. Everything about this restaurant compliments so well. My server Victor is literally the best server I've ever seen. I sat on the patio and he came out of the door with a big smile on his face and energy that can shift the atmosphere. He was patient, very knowledgeable and already knew what would compliment our food choice. He was also very inviting and just has a comforting spirit about him. I ordered the mushroom + quinoa burger and it was delicious. The taste was balanced very well and the sauces were a good addition. Will be coming back.
