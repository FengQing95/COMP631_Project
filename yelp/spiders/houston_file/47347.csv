Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Horrible parking and horrible lines...but...never seems to be an issue because the food is just that good! Pancake flights, Benny's and much much more. I would recommend sharing a pancake flight with the table and getting anything with their breakfast sausage (season on site and really good.) Try to stay entertained with the wait Â and you will not be sorry after tasting the food!
