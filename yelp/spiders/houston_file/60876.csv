Baby Barnaby's////I can't speak enough to the level of excellent food and heartwarming service that this incredible restaurant offers. With a cozy and comfortable atmosphere, this haven for locals to the Montrose area offers homemade and high quality breakfast until noon on weekdays (still not 100% sure what the hours are on the weekend). Normally if you're here before 10AM, you can get open seating without a problem. With the restaurant being relatively small, when there is a wait time it can be roughly ten or fifteen minutes, but always worth it.
