Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great breakfast spot. Ingredients are fresh and taste is on point. Had bar service and I found them to be attentive without being annoying. Portion sizes are good but not huge. I found them to be just right but if you're looking to gorge you might be better suited to IHOP.
