Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Absolutely amazing! Tried the Nutella croissant, almond croissant, and another croissant that had caramelized butter on top, and they were all incredible! Nothing short of a 10/10 for the pastries. We also ordered the bacon and egg flatbread and the French toast with fresh strawberries, and we cleared the plates! Can't wait to go again!
