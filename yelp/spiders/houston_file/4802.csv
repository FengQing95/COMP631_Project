JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hands down the BEST ramen in Houston. I've tried many other ramen places and this has been the most satisfying experience I've ever had. I ordered Â the Tonkotsu black and it was amazing. The broth is extremely well made and the noodles are very chewy. I'm so happy that I didn't feel like I was dying after eating here because I've always felt like that afterward from other ramen places due to how fattening the broth were. My table also ordered the almond pudding and it was a nice finish since it wasn't heavy at all. This place is definitely my go-to when I want my ramen fix now.
