The Pit Room////Im upset this place isn't in Fort Worth. It's SO good!! Thankfully we had issues at the 2 other establishments we tried to eat at that led us to the pit room. The ordering situation was a lil confusing. We were there when there was no line. Which is awesome! But I was confused where to start. But! I don't care!!! Because the brisket was so effin good!
