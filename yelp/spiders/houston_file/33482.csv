Local Foods////I am a Jersey girl visiting the Houston Area and i must say this place didn't disappoint. You can tell they use nothing but the freshest local ingredients in their dishes and everything was really tasty. My sister and I like to order and swap different foods, so i was able to taste a variety of the menu. I personally ordered the veggie sammie with the slaw and seasoned chips, she had the falafel with tuscan kale and quinoa & my niece got the crunchy chicken sandwich with a pasta and the garbanzo. Although I learned that i am not a big fan of falafel, it was nice to try something new. Overall it was a filling but guilt free experience.
