Local Foods////I came in expecting the food here to be mediocre or maybe really leafy given the idea behind this restaurant. However I was pleasantly surprised after ordering the Crunchy Chicken Sandwich. It was one of the best sandwiches (chicken-wise) I've ever had. The pretzel bun had a great crunch and was stuffed high with chicken. Even though the menu says it's nut-crusted, it's actually more of a pesto-like spread on the bread not an actual crust on the chicken. I opted for the the chips and cabbage slaw as sides. Chips had a good crunch but a little salty for my liking. Also had a chance to try my friend's pastrami sandwich and lemongrass soup.
