Local Foods////So I took my wife and went back. I ordered the same BLT with Kale and chips, but I ordered extra bacon because I am a big guy. My wife ordered the Tuna sandwich and she shared with me. Once again, this is not your Mom's tuna sandwich. It was the best tuna sandwich I have ever eaten. Â Then I got to the butternut squash salad. It was like a flavor explosion in my mouth, ( I think I got that from a movie) It crunchy, slightly sweet and very colorful. She also ordered some other salad whose name I can't remember but it was really good also.
