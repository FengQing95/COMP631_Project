Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Loved this place! Came for brunch with some friends and we all got the Bottomless Mimosas. The vibe of the place is chill and fun. Around the table we got the "Fruity Pebbles" French toast, Pork belly breakfast tacos, chorizo and potato Benedict and chicken fried steak. We were all very happy with our choices. The food was so good! We all excitedly tried the French toast and it did not disappoint. One of my friends also got the Breakfast in Bed shot which was delicious. I would love to go back for dinner and try some of the whiskey cocktails. Also bought a tank top that says "Brunch Gangster" that I'm obsessed with. Overall very impressed with this restaurant.
