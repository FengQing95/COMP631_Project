Uchi////Update: Get the avocado nigiri with lemon-miso glaze. Don't ask questions, just trust me. The chef's special nigiri is also the way to go if you want to try a variety of extraordinary sushi. It comes with 5 hand-selected pieces that can include things like sea bream, barracuda, salmon belly, roe (with a shot of quail egg), and more. Make sure to eat with your fingers and turn each bite so the fish hits your tongue first!
