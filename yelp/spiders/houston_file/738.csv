JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I decided to check this place out after hearing about it from several people. It was ok but nothing impressive. My group consisted of three people and we all had different soups. I managed to get a little taste of everyone's to try it out. The Cha Cha Cha's was my least favorite! The broth was thick and lacked flavor. I felt the same about the thick noodles that came with the Cha Cha Cha. Next I tried the Sprouting Up Ramen which was pretty much tons of sprout in an overboard way. The broth was ok but I couldn't get over the amount of sprout they put it in. The Tonkotsu Spicy was pretty good. The broth was better than the other two although I did have to add a bit more spicy sauce. It wouldn't hurt for them to add at least one more slice of pork (they only give you 3) or to cut the egg to give it a better presentation.
