Uchi////The Guy gave us some recommendations, actually he ordered everything he thought was good!  And let me tell you  that sense of surprise was amazing I ended up LOVING the whole experience... I was craving for tempura and the Hanna (cauliflower tempura) honestly was one of the best I have had and that's a hard to find dish in Houston so I was very happy :)
