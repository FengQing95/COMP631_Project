JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////That night, none of the hosts nor Cindy smiled. Perhaps it is awkward for them to serve one person dining in? I was never asked if I was new or if I had any questions with the menu. I most definitely felt rushed by Cindy and did not feel like she cared. She simply took me to my booth, dropped me off, and came back in less than two minutes to ask if I know what I want to order. I did have a question between two different ramen options on the menu and she simply gave me a straight answer that I do not know how else to explain but simply say she just wanted to get this over with. So I simply ordered based off of what I know and looking at the menu. I understand when it is rush-hour, but that night there were quite a few empty booths.
