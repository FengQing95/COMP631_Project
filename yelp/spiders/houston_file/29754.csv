The Pit Room////The food is really good, as evidenced by the long line at 4:30 PM on a Sunday. My only issue is that I was there to pick up a to-go order and there is no separate window or instructions as to where to go. Everyone who walked up was confused as the whether they had to wait in the line to pick up their to-go order. Seems like a minor complaint but it was very annoying, and easy for the restaurant to fix. Just put a sign on the door that says " to go orders, proceed straight to the register". Maybe eventually they will make enough money to build a separate pick up window.
