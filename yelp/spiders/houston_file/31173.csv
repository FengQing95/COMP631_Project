Local Foods////I love a great sandwich/salad place with awesome sides and Local Foodsis my go to. Â To me, this place is the best of both worlds: the efficiency, great value, and awesome service that comes with being part of a successful local chain combined with the uniqueness and dedication of an owner-operated restaurant.
