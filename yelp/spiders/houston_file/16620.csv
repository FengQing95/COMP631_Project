JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place was fire. The ambiance was amazing. And great for a date or friends outing. The food was great and service was excellent. They even had vegan options. It was my first time eating Ramen. I got the chicken ramen. Going back soon! Brussels Sprouts Tempura were yummy.
