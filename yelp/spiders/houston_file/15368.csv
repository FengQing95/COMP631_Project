JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I appreciate your kind words, but please know if you ever receive a seasoned egg that doesn't meet your personal standards, let your server know and he or she will offer you another. We serve upwards of 1,000 eggs per day, so by the sheer laws of probability, there are going to be eggs that don't have the custard yolk that we aim for. Moreover, our poke bowls are prepared with fresh ingredients daily.
