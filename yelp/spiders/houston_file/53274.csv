Kata Robata////When Hubbs ordered the scallops with goat cheese, I gave him one of my skeptical faces with one brow higher than the other. Goat cheese and raw scallops? Seriously, I would never have ordered this based on the description alone. Mr. Sushi Chef, you are seriously brilliant. My toes curled in sheer foodgasmic joy. This combination, although unconventional, seriously works and is utterly mouthwatering and luscious. Bravo ... you have won my heart AND my soul.
