Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My roommate and I made plans to go to this place for brunch on a Saturday, but it got a little late and we didn't get there till about noon (the busiest time at this place). So we had to wait about an hour before we got seated, but the plus was we got to try their amazingly spiked drinks ;). I got the AM Manhattan and it is a must try for all the Manhattan cocktail lovers out there!!
