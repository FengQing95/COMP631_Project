Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered a coffee, their normal roast. It was a medium Ethipian roast and was really smooth. Good coffee fix as you wait for your meal. I had the bravocado toast and had my eggs poached. Â It was phenomenal. The red onion jam had the sweetness of caramalized onions and complimented the avocado spread beautiful. The bread was super fresh and delicious too.
