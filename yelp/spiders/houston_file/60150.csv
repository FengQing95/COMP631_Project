Baby Barnaby's////This is NOT a fine dining experience, but it is a great atmosphere and food quality that is second to none (I will marry the person who can make green eggs like baby Barnaby's).  The staff is great.  If you haven't been here, you are missing one of Houston's greatest and longest lived breakfast experiences..
