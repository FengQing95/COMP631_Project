Baby Barnaby's////My husbands bacon was, "like it was boiled in it's own fat" (not crispy).  So, for the third time we flagged down our waitress,  When he told her that his bacon was not cooked properly, she brought over a plate and had him take the bacon off his plate and she brought it in the back.  About 5 minutes later she came back with his bacon.  Refried.  Ick.  First of all, anyone ever heard of the Canadian Delicacy called twice fried bacon??  No??  It's because twice frying bacon is very, very yucky.  Secondly, you can't take food off a plate and bring it back to the kitchen to recook it.  What if he had already bitten a piece.  What if he had licked it???  You are going to cook his prelicked bacon on the griddle with everyone else's food?  Barf-o-matic.
