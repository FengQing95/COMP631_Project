Kata Robata////Very convenient location from West U and Bellaire, small quaint place.  Service is excellent and food quality is very good.  Sushi prices are very fair including the specialty rolls.  The ramen was great.  By the way the crab for the California Rolls is real, not the fake processes stuff that a lot of places use in town, you know it is spelled Krab.
