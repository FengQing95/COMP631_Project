JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Anne-Marie, Thanks for the excellent and comprehensive review! As an Elite Yelper, your opinion matters a lot to us, so thank you for taking the time and for the kind words. We do understand we have a few space limitations, and with hindsight being 20/20 we would have definitely altered some of the layout. But in the coming months, we'll be opening two more JINYA locations in the greater Houston area, both of which will be much larger in size than JINYA-Midtown. Thanks again, and we look forward to serving you again in the future!
