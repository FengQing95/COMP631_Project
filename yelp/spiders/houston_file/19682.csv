Uchi////We sat at the sushi bar.  The service was great and attentive.  We ordered directly from the sushi chef and our drinks from a waitress that came around. The sake was great and unfiltered.  The best part was that it the glass came served in a box, which I found to be fun and made things a little more authentic.
