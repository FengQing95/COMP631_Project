Kata Robata////Uchi priced but not quite on the Uchi level, Kata Robata offers decent vegetarian sushi at a bit of a premium. For $60, I ended up with four-ish dishes, one of which came out after the meal because the waiter forgot to bring it out the first time! He was really kind and actually took if off the bill.
