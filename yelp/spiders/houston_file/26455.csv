The Pit Room////We were disappointed in our meal last night. The first two ribs we ate were delicious. Deeply flavored and moist. We enjoyed the bbq  sauce. We found the brisket dry at  the beginning dry in the middle dry in the end. We enjoyed the pulled pork. When we ordered more ribs they were dry dry dry.
