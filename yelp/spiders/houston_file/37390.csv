Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////After seeing other yelpers speak highly of the meatloaf bites and the pulled pork hush puppies, we decided to get those. The meatloaf bites had zero flavor; neither my friend nor I are people who like to leave food behind, but neither of us ate our second bite. The accompanying tomato sauce was too sweet and very thin, which made it hard to eat on the bite on a shared dish. The hush puppies suffered from the same lack of flavor. The exterior was crisp, but both the meat and breading were bland. Luckily the mustard sauce added some much-needed moisture and flavor; it was the only thing that saved this dish for either of us, but I wouldn't order it again.
