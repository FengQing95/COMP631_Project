Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Sadly, my experience this morning was awful, the service, the food. At first, management made it clear they saw me as the problem rather than the front or back of the house or the wording on the menu. I ordered the continental, which is billed as granola, yogurt, grapefruit half, and toast. I asked if I could substitute the yogurt for an alternative meat patty and could have soy milk on the granola. My friend ordered a meal with bacon and asked for fresh cooked rather than pre-cooked much earlier and served from the warming tray. I was told yes.The waitress seemed dubious about getting the kitchen to cook fresh bacon, but isn't that why one comes to a sit down restaurant and orders off the menu instead of a buffet line or going to fast food? The meal arrived with no granola at all. After asking about its status, I was delivered what was announced as a side of granola, no soy milk. It was in a 1-inch deep bowl of 2-inch diameter, a condiment bowl. That didn't mesh with what I thought I had ordered, so I checked a menu. Granola was the first item listed, which in my experience means  is the main item. The waitress came by and seemed surprised, too, at the small size. She said the yogurt was the main thing, so this was what came out. The menu should probably have read "yogurt with a granola toppng." The alternative patty was not a cooked patty of the consistency of faux sausage patty, but a dark orange and brown flat 4-inch wide 3/4-inch high mushy patty  with the consistency of mashed potatoes. It had a ketchup taste, not like alternative meat patties I had ordered elsewhere or made from the grocery store. I put this down to my lack of knowledge of Snooze's offerings and made a mental note to myself not to order that again. The toast was not browned, more untoasted than toasted and came without any butter available, just dry and partially toasted. Guess the kitchen was in a hurry on that. With granola being the first item, I interpreted it as a bowl, not a condiment sized topping. The grapefruit half was not sectioned or cut around  the outside circumference, just cut in half. Guess the kitchen was in a hurry again? Why would a full service breakfast not cut the grapefruit? I could see this if it came with a grapefruit spoon or pointy knife so I could get out the sections, but it did not. So, after eating the partial toast and being able to get out some of the grapefruit half, I felt disenchanted. $8.50 for 1 piece of incompletely toasted bread and a grapefruit half whose sections were not accessible. I thought about this while finishing my first cup of coffee. Meanwhile, my friend's bacon came out cold and greasy. He sent it back, again asking for hot, blotted, fresh cooked bacon. The cook came out and told him it would be 15 minutes to get the bacon, He agreed, explaining that was why he came to a full-service breakfast place rather than McDonald's and did get his request. He said it was good. By now, my coffee had been empty a long time. I got up in search of some, poured it myself, while surrounded by staff who never asked to get it for me or even wondered why a customer was pouring her own coffee. I sat down with it and my waitress, who was quite nice, never noticed I had had to get my own. By now, not one to make a scene or generally complain -- I usually chalk it up as a learning experience and avoid the restaurant or the menu items in the future -- I decided to ask to speak with the manager. I apologized to him that my experience was not going well and showed him what I had received while explaining the problem. He said the granola was a supposed to be a side. I asked him how I was to know that from the menu when it did not say granola was a side and was listed as the first item. He jumped in that I was not letting him finish talking. Clearly, he did not want to hear about the menu miscommunication, so I told him that since he did not want to listen to me, I would just pay and leave. As I got out my card to pay, I shared told him about the mushy patty and uncut grapefruit and having to get my own coffee refill. He refused to take my card, so we left it at that, him clearly seeing me as the problem rather than the menu wording, front of the house, and back of the house. My friend finished, and as we prepared to leave, unexpectedly, a bowl of dry granola appeared, no soy or other milk, and lovely, large sections of cut grapefruit. The bowl was what I had originally expected, albiet it was still a bowl of dry granola without any type of milk. The grapefruit slices were at least 4 times the size of those that were in my original grapefruit half. They were quite lovely. I shared that observation with my friend. At this point, the man at the next table leaned over and told me I had done nothing but complain, was ruining his breakfast (he had not received anythng yet), and these were minimun-wage workers so I should accept what I got. Seriously? Be careful of standing up for youself in our brave new world.
