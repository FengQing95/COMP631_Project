Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////too sweet. Stay away from the raspberry lemonade cake, mines smelled like raw eggs. The Avocado toast with an egg on top is nothing to brag about. It looks prettier than it tastes. If you so feel like going through the hassle of coming here please do yourself a favor and get the Kouign Amann. It's the only thing worth ordering. It's flakey and buttery! The tacky toffee crunch gives it a boost in flavor.
