Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////2nd visit to Snooze was bad. Subpar slow service, cold food, and long red curly hair embedded in my French toast. Details: I ordered the same exact classic Snooze breakfast with scrambled eggs and cheese, sub OMG toast. I was sooo good the last time - I had been craving more for weeks. I ordered for pick up just like the last time. I prefer pick up because it is so busy and crowded in there. Anyway, my estimated 15 min pick up time turned into 35 minutes. By the time I got my food it was cold - except the hash browns. My eggs were cold and barely had cheese. My bacon was cold and super greasy. My OMG toast was cold and had a long red curly hair in between the filling of my toast. Gross. Mind you- this is a 2 minute walk to my destination to eat it. Just like the last time. So obviously it was sitting there a long while. Everyone kept asking the 5 hostesses crowded around the front talking to check on their tables and food. I had to ask 3 x. so to pay $17, wait 35 min, then get cold greasy food with hair in it is a waste of my time and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Will be a long while before I eat here again. Probably sometime around Neverary.
