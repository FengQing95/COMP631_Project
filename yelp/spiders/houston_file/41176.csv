Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I went to Common Bond for brunch for the first time. Since there was a line outside the door, we had a good look at what everyone ordered. There were only about 7 items on the menu for brunch.. I saw several people order the huge disgusting looking fatting fried broccoli sandwich with a ton of cheese on it.  I saw several people walk out with at least 3/4 of the sandwich still on their plates. The boudin eggs benedict did not look very appetizing either. I ordered the grits with veal.. and it was pretty gross!!!! My friend did not see anything appetizing on the menu so she only ordered a coffee. The staff was not helpful and we had to scrounge for a place to sit.  I wanted a water to drink and could not find a glass, water, or ice anywhere. I found a paper cup for coffee and poured my own water from a pitcher on the counter.  We went to Starbucks after, I ordered a coffee which was half the price of hers at Common Bond and she ordered a breakfast sandwich. I wish we would have left before waiting in the long line at Common Bond and went to Starbucks.. I would have been much more satisfied with their breakfast sandwich than the disgusting fatting veal grits that I had there.  I am not a fan of pastries; this maybe the place for people who like pastries.  This was a gross experience and I will not go back or recommend this place.
