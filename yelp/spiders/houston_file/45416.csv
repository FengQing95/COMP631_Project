Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If you don't mind paying $11 for a big, gourmet, high quality breakfast sandwich- we have a Common Bond ;-) I ordered a bacon & egg white croissant sandwich. It had a lot of thick applewood bacon, plenty of fluffy scrambled egg whites, aioli and arugula on a fresh buttery croissant. It was really good and filling, even though the arugula was pretty strong and there was a bit too much oil dripping out. Also I would have preferred my bacon cooked through more, because I don't like any white fatty parts on my bacon. But it was enough bacon on the sandwich that when I picked the fatty white parts off, there was still plenty left for the sandwich! I also ordered a hot chai latte and I did not particularly enjoy it. It was very watery tasting to me and luke warm in temperature. The barista was nice to add vanilla for me to help with taste- but then it was too sweet and I could not finish it. A small cup is $5 so I would skip the latte and stick to my regular coffee shop. Pastries looked thick and pretty in the display, but I can't tell you how they taste bc they did not look tempting enough to order any. Customer service, cleanliness, vibe, and parking was A+.
