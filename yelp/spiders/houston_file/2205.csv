JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ramen here is arguably one of the best in Houston. However, I don't think it is 100% authentic to Japanese ramen because ramen I have had in Japan is a lot lighter (I know there are many kinds of ramen but even I don't read Japanese, I am sure I ordered the same kind). Jinya ramen is quite salty to me. Their shrimps are also salty (could be my pallet since my gf loved it). Okonomiyaki is very good imo and I recommend trying it.
