JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Ariana - Thank you so much for the kind words. I'm glad to hear you and your boyfriend are JINYA fans. We also appreciate your understanding our seating protocol. We have a number of large parties so it's only fair to seat groups that are complete in order to keep wait times in check. Thank you again, and we hope to serve you again soon.
