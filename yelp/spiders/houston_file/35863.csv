Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Service left a bit to be desired. The people that sat next to us actually left because they were never served. Â The fruity pebble french toast was great. In hindsight, I should've ordered that. The meatloaf hash sucked- which was what I ordered. The egg was decent but one yolk was almost over hard and the other was perfect and custard like. Beautiful ambiance; nice drinks. Maybe drop the sure loud DJ or give an option for quiet seating. I mean it wasn't awful- just not what I expected.
