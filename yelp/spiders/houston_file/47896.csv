Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Maybe I didn't order the right things. Our server was not enthusiastic and rarely cracked a smile. She seemed tired and not in the mood to be extra friendly, although a server wearing a Zeds Dead hat was awesome and helped with our table often. My blueberry pancake was plain and not really fluffy, nothing special. I got a sandwich called "Sandwich I Am" and the sausage was way too salty and oily. The sauce lacked flavor. It just tasted like cream. The coffee was okay. I wouldn't wait an hour to eat here. I'd rather go to Baby Barnaby's for brunch.
