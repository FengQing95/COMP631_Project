Local Foods////This place was great. It was family style seating with great atmosphere and all of the things on the menu seem to be made with fresh ingredients. I give it 4 stars because my crab and shrimp sandwich was an 8/10. All of the other dishes looked delicious and my sides were perfect. I will definitely come back and try something else next time.
