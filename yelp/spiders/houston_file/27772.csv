The Pit Room////This place exceeds all the hype.  The food is so good here.  I had their homemade sausage and their Frito Pie (Frito chips topped with their homemade chili).  The pork sausage was a jalapeno and cheddar filled sausage.  It was so good.  The beef was also good, but wasn't as flavorful as the pork.  All was excellent.  It's in downtown Houston.  Next time I'm in the area again I'm definitely going back.
