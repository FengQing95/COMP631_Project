Local Foods////Third time (and this is the third time in a month! ) I got the duck confit with the cabbage salad and kale sides. The sandwich was on toasted wheat sandwich style bread with the duck, melted brie, cranberry spread, and greens. There was also a mayo type sauce. I personally like the combination of sweet and savory, and especially the flavors of brie and jam together, so this meal was a hit for me. The cabbage salad and kale were very good- cabbage was Â fresh and crunchy and the kale was also fresh.
