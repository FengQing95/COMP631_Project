Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I am going to say that I love the Chocolate Croissant is worth stopping by!  I have a huge weakness for baked goods.  The ham and cheese breakfast sandwich with an egg.....  mouth watering.  Don't for get to get your chocolate chunk cookie when you get ready to leave!
