Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////FAVORITE brunch place. It's always so packed whenever I go but honestly the wait is worth it at the end. I think the longest I've waited was about an hour and a half. If you decide to go, go earlier in the morning. Parking is small so you have to find neighborhood parking or street parking.
