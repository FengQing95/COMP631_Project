The Pit Room////Was visiting Houston and wanted to good BBQ.  This place did not disappoint.  I got the brisket and venison sausage.  The meet can be pulled apart with a fork and it had a great wood smoked flavor.  The bbq sauce was also on point.  Sweet, smoky, and a slight bit of kick to it.  If I visit Houston again I will have to come back.
