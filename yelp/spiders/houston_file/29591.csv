The Pit Room////Okay I am not mad about this place. The brisket was good and moist and the beef ribs were seasoned to perfection. It is a little bit on the pricier side. I think the most surprising thing for me was that there wasn't a line! Every Texas bbq I've been to has a line out the door and 30+ min wait time. This place had barely any wait and was comparable, if not better, than some of the places I've had to wait a long time for. They have all the different sauces and side dishes too. If you're you looking for some solid Texas bbq and you don't want to wait, come to the pit room!!!
