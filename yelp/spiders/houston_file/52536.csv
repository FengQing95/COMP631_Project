Kata Robata////Nice atmosphere.  Cool people and we were seated right away on a busy Saturday night.  The food was delicious, started with pork dumplings, had the scallops and my date had the kobe short ribs which were outstanding.  My only complaint is that I left feeling...hungry.  For the price, i expected more.  I don't want to be stuffed but i would love to feel satisfied.
