The Pit Room////The quality of the Pit Room's BBQ is second to known. Having lived in Texas my entire life, when I was up in KC I had to stop by. They slow cook, which is the right way to go. I ordered a beer rib which was fall off the bone tender. I honestly could have had that beef rib alone, but I order sausage as well. Stop by if you are in the area!
