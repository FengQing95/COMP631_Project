Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Our waitress was nice and friendly. My fianc√© liked his hot chocolate, but the coffee was too strong for me. I tried 4 Stevias before I just gave up. He ordered the Chile Verde Benny and I ordered the pancake flight with the sweet potato, bourbon pumpkin, and special which was a donut type pancake. I also got a side of chicken sausage.
