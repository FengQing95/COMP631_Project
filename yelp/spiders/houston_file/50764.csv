Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've been to this location a few times. Parking is horrendous, there are only 8-10 spots for the place, while a full and empty lot for the neighboring business stands empty. They do provide water and coffee while you wait, as on the weekend the norm will be 45-60 min for a table of 2-3 minimum. They have good mimosas you can order while you wait as well. I had the snooze classic, but subbed out my toast for a side pancake (their chocolate chip is the BEST I've ever had and large enough to be split by 2 people). All other parties in our group enjoyed their food as well, and it's one of the only places I've been to where you can get an eggs Benedict duo with 2 different types - very creative! :)
