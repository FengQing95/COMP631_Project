Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great drinks, average food and awesome ambience.  It's a very nice space with plenty of room to accommodate large groups.  They also have a private room if you're looking to get away from the loud noise in the big room.  The perfect place to grab drinks before a better venue for dinner.
