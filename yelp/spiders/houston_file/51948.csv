Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We were quickly helped and our server was very kind. I tried the Ooo La La Frittata, which was like a scrambled egg pancake with cheese, asparagus, cucumbers, and topped with a salad. It definitely didn't disappoint, and it was really flavorful! I also got the nitro cold brew, which was okay and not as strong as I would have liked.
