Kata Robata////Let me make one thing clear before you read further: I hated sushi before this place. I'd tried it multiple times at numerous places, but I never liked it. But that was before Kata Robata. True, I only tried 3 different sashimi. But I think after years of hating it, that says a lot. If you have a few people, get the Kata Platter of sushi. It's the chef's picks of the day, you get to try a little bit of everything, and it comes with both sashimi and rolls. I personally love the scallop and sweet shrimp sashimi the most.
