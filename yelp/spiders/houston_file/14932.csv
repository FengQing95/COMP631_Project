JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As far as our takeout items are concerned, the size and shape of our ToGo containers are somewhat misleading. We serve the same amount of broth and toppings in our ToGo orders as we do for dine-in clients. Each bowl of ramen comprises 2-1/2 cups of broth as measured by a specific ladle. Nothing is "eye-balled," as doing so would result in an inconsistent product.
