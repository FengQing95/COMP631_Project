Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////As directed by my friend, Matt, who joined me on this expedition, we ordered a kouign amann (pastry baked with butter and cooked sugar on the bottom). This bundle of joy was amazing. I highly suggest having them heat it up before eating. We enjoyed this pastry with a delicious cappuccino.
