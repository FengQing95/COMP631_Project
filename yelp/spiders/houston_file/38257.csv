Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Okay tell me if I'm out of line here but when I go to sit at the bar and order from the brunch menu I see there's a burger called 2x2 Â burger. Sounds great but I only want one beef patty instead of the two it comes with (hence the name). I tell the bartender taking my order but I say I'd like that with only one patty. He plainly and unjokingly says "No, we can't do that." I'm thrown off so much that I just say okay and order it as is. As I ate the burger I grew more and more upset and confused. It's not like I asked for something outlandish. Anyway I tipped well and told him I hope his day gets better. He was inattentive and unfriendly. Maybe he woke up on the wrong side of the sofa or something but hey, don't bring your bad attitude to work if your job is to wait on people.
