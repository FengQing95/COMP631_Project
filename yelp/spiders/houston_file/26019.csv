The Pit Room////Not impressed.  Had the pork ribs (too salty) with the beef sausage.  The sausage fell apart like hamburger meat and the casing was really chewy.  The mustard potato salad was blah.  I expected more vinegar and pickle in it.  The Mexican corn stuck to my teeth and had very little zing.  It was dressed.  I will go back to what is the best, Elgin and Luling, Tx.  I was disappointed.
