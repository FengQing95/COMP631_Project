Baby Barnaby's////I had the Green Eggs and my bf had the Pink and White Scramble. I cannot speak in enough volumes to how delicious the Green Eggs were -- the flavors of spinach, just-right-cooked eggs, artichoke topped with jack cheese were heavenly. What also made me choose this plate was the amount of food listed in the description---chicken apple sausage, toast, and potatoes accompanied the eggs. All of could think of was how complete this meal was....like a big, happy, family...all in my mouth. Yum!
