Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Spending a lazy morning here just to have time to slow down in life is a great experience. I always get the almond croissant - that stuff is to die for!! My mom tried the shakshuka once, and she said it was delicious. I've had the lavender latte, which is lovely as well. Â
