Baby Barnaby's////Truly one of my favorite places for breakfast! The corn beef hash has never disappointed. This place is typically packed on a Saturday or Sunday mid-morning so if you're super hungry be prepared to wait! There isn't a hostess or stand to check-in but a sign-in sheet on a clipboard. Next up will have their name called and that's when you'll know your table is ready. There's a couple of benches for those who are waiting but space is tight.
