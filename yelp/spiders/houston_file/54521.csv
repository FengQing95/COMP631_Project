Kata Robata////Sushi is very fresh here. Unfortunately they run out of items fairly quickly. They also serve the best spicy ramen I have ever tried. One tip- if you are splitting a bowl of ramen, you will be charged $3 extra. Our server failed to mention this to us. Other than that, everything else was great.
