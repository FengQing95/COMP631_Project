Baby Barnaby's////Had brunch this past weekend and sadly was underwhelmed by the ambiance, waitstaff and most especially, the food. Banana Walnut pancake was dry and crumbly. Green eggs was okay...same for the potatoes. Accompanying biscuit was dry as well. An overall "blah" unmemorable experience. Won't be returning.
