Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was truly excited to eat at this place. The wait time was about an hour if your going on Sunday morning. The earlier the better, the service was slow and it took awhile to get our drinks since the bar was backup. As far as for the food, it was delicious and great presentation. The place is clean and has a very nice interior design.
