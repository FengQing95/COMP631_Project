Uchi////I really really wanted to love Uchi. Since I moved to Houston I have heard about it several times, and finally went for my anniversary. We did the chef's tasting menu and were very excited. The food for the most part was phenomenal, however we were straight up forgotten about. We ordered drinks they never came, and after 45 minutes I asked and then a waiter brought the wrong drinks. We had a very long time in between the ten course meal, at one point we went the same 45 minutes without food or drinks and then several courses came at once after they remembered we were there.. hugely disappointing especially when we were doing the expensive tasting menu and there for a celebration (which we also told them it was an anniversary celebration and they didn't do anything about it). For a $360 dinner for two, you can absolutely do better (even in New York, no less Houston). Don't spend a special day here, but do come if you have a lot of extra time and want great sushi.
