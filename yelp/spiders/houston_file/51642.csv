Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Best brunch in Houston! I'm so glad Snooze has opened up shop in Houston. They deserve the hype. Finding a parking place and waiting for a table are of course a hassle, but it's totally worth it. Most recently I went on a Monday at 10am and there happened to be no wait, but this is quite rare for them!
