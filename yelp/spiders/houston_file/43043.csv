Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Me and my sister has fought in the parking lot here a couple of times (I've won 4/6 fights) . First off , if you want parking , you gotta fight for it. My sister once dropped me off in the middle of the street to cross to the bakery to stand in one of the parking spots so she could quickly turn in . (Parking is ass) . Going inside , the place was beautiful. Great atmosphere , friendly workers. I ordered a French macaroon and decided I didn't want it anymore when it was on my plate & one of the bakers said it was okay and that it I could have it for free. Super generous . I ordered the crab (it was sour but I think that's how it is). The pieces of crab were big & juicy! Their lattes were amazing & creamy. Not the sweetest , but creamy. My sister got a salad, she said it was great. I love it here & I recommend it to anyone who just wants to catch up with a friend or even take time to enjoy their self. But parking is ass though
