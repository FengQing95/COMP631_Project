Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is a great place to grab brunch with friends and family. The staff was extremely friendly and I struck up a nice conversation with the baristas about coffee. The food and pastries were delicious. This place can get crowded so expect to wait awhile. But it's definitely worth it!
