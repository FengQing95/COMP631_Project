Kata Robata////I was recommended by family and friends to try this place. I was able to get a table and sat down before the rush of the dinner crowd. I ordered the Texas Kobe beef skewers and the chirashi bowl with 11 different sashimi pieces with rice. I was blown away by the beef that melts in your mouth while the bowl was excellent while being very true to its japanese delicacy. I enjoyed my time there while the staff were able to describe the different shashimi pieces to me which I commend for that. I would definitely tell other people to come to this place for its environment, staff and food.
