Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Office in the same building, thought I would grab an early a quick breakfast.  Maybe ten tables working.  Sat at bar hoping for even quicker service.  Surly person behind counter seemed more interested in getting ready for service than service .  I would think that an establishment like this would open "ready" for business. After waiting 15 minutes, no coffee refill and seeing no one else around me eating I walked out.  Waste of 30 minutes.  Won't be back.
