Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I wish Johnny Carrabba's had never procured Common Bond. Common Bond's food has gone from amazing to lackluster and disappointing since being bought by the Carrabba company. Common Bond's chicken torta used to be my favorite meal in Houston, now it is nothing but a boiled chicken sandwich (gross). Their service has dropped, and their method of ordering has become stressful and lengthy. I will not be going back to Common Bond, it has become nothing more than a McDonald's in a pastry apron...Maybe that is a discredit to McDonald's.
