Uchi////This carried over into the process of ordering. If you're new to Uchi and/or sushi, I would definitely recommend relying on the recommendations of your server. I'm not a huge fan of sashimi but we got very mild choices. The rolls are a bit smaller than you might be used to so keep that in mind when you order. You can get half orders of the cool tastings to allow you to taste more than one dish.
