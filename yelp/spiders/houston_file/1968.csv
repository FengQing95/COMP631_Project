JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Julie - Thanks for your feedback. Our house specialty is tonkotsu ramen, which is created by reducing pork bones for upwards of 12 hours. Resultingly, the broth is rich and has a milky texture and appearance. We have more than 12 different varieties of ramen, some with a lighter broth such as our "Old School Ramen," and we also have two vegetarian options. Although we fully admit that we will never be all things to all people, we try to do our best every day. Thank you, though, for giving us a try. We wish you the best.
