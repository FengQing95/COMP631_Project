JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love JINYA!! I would eat here everyday if I could. It can get very busy but its definitely worth the right. The spicy vegan ramen is my favorite. It has an amazing flavor and I'm so glad they have it as an option on their menu. I also enjoy the quinoa salad. It's so healthy and delicious and also vegan. The dressing on top of the salad is amazing!!! Besides the food being amazing I really enjoy the atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant. It stays open late on the weekends which is awesome if you leave the bar and you're hungry. If you haven't tried JINYA yet... all I want to know is what are you doing with your life??!!!
