The Pit Room////You can't leave Texas without trying some classic Texas BBQ and you should definitely swing by The Pit Room for this! I got 2 meats and 2 sides and that was plenty enough for 1 person. The beef brisket is so tender and the venison sausage is the bomb! Both meats were very flavorful and smoked to excellence. I honestly should have ordered some beef brisket to-go. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the beans as much. I am not someone who can tolerate spicy food that well and the beans just had way too much pepper and jalapeno in it. But this is more of a personal problem. I think if you are okay with spicy food, their beans are actually very tasty.
