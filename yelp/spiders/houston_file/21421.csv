Uchi////Even though we already loved Uchi, our most recent trip there (for our anniversary) really astounded us. Every person that served us was so polite and congratulated us for our anniversary. They treated us to dessert and a few other treats along the way. The exceptional service made our dinner and anniversary so special and we are so grateful to everyone at Uchi for such a fun night. Can't wait to go back!
