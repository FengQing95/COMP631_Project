Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////There are a good amount of brunchable items on the menu, our table tried a variation of a couple things. Definitely a "leave your diet" at home kind of menu. Got the pork belly tacos for myself, they were delish. The manager? Came by and gave us an assortment of special hot sauces. It was flavorful, filling and oozing with goodness! The Cinnabon burger is great for pics but I felt like it was a little too much going on. Chicken fried steak was large, crispy and flavorful.
