JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is a 5-star review because the only thing I have to compare this to is the instant ramen I've eaten too many times before. So this is what ramen is supposed to taste like? Awesome. I ordered the Jinya #2, cleverly named the Cha Cha Cha. I don't remember what was all in it because I stopped reading after "garlic lover" and "pork back fat". I paid a little extra for extra noodle and extra soup which I really didn't need after all. It was good. It made me want to dance the, well, Cha Cha Cha.
