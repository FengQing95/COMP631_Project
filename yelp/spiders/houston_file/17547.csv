Uchi////If you are thinking of going here, don't think, just go. This is the experience you are waiting for. Uchi shouldn't even be in the category with sushi. There is sushi, and then there is Uchi, and it is worth every penny you will spend. Stop waiting and just go. We have been to Uchi and Uchiko in Austin, and the Houston location does an outstanding job. Be prepared to wait if you don't have a reservation, two hours is average for a Saturday night, but its always worth it.
