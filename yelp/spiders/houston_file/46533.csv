Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This morning I ordered a flatbread. When it arrived it looked delicious. Sadly it was not. Halfway through eating it I literally thought, "Maybe I've contracted Covid-19 because I can't taste anything." Unfortunately/fortunately I do not have coronavirus and my tastebuds have not betrayed me. What has betrayed me is the chef who is responsible for creating a breakfast pizza void of flavor. It's actually an accomplishment. I mean, how do you make bacon bland?!
