Kata Robata////Every time I come here I always have such an outstanding experience! A tip from me is that you always want to try to make a reservation because the wait time is ridiculous on a busy day like Thursday-Saturday. One time I came here with one of my girlfriends and we waited about 45 minutes and it was on a Thursday I believe. (Our fault we didn't make a reservation) Another time we came here and had a reservation and still had to wait about 10 minutes which was frustrating since we had a reservation.. but the foods worth it so what right?
