Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I got macaroons, scones, cupcakes, pumpkin cake, baguettes and some buttery buns, chocolate chip cookies, everything I've tried tastes really good, my son ate the butter bun and live it, I tried a piece and it's really good! My daughter liked the Nutella cupcake I got her, I loveeee the goat cheese & figs macaroons...I ate 3!! I just had the scone for breakfast and it's yummy too! Oh on my way home (League City) I pinch a piece of one of the baguettes I got and it was yummy too!! Ohh and I almost forgot that I got a fruit (blackberry) tart Hehehe!!! It was good but the blackberries were a bit too sour.
