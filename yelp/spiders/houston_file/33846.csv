Local Foods////Our orders arrived relatively quickly, especially factoring in how dang busy it was.  We were a but aggrieved to sit outside in the scorching Houston summer heat, but the shade helped a tiny bit.  As for the falafel sandwich, it was a tad dry, even with that moistening mustard, perhaps the falafel isn't deep fried (which is probably a good thing in the grander scheme of diabetes and obesity).  I will say that bravo, the sandwich innards weren't skimpy in the least.  There's little I despise more than a mouthful of bread and a teensy bit of falafel because bread is just the delivery system, dangit!  As for the beets and slaw - they were rather refreshing and clean tasting, but I swear there maybe we cheese bits in the slaw?  I don't know, I'm so flippin' paranoid these days, it must be because I started watching "Breaking Bad" . . .   I chomped down on my sides and half of the sandwich (had the other half for lunch the next day) and I was set for the rest of the afternoon.
