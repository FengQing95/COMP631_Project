Uchi////We had a great evening at Uchi. Our server was legit and all the wait staff who interacted with us took the time to explain the dish and guide us in how we should tackle said offering. As someone whose idea of dinner consists of an all-too-predictable ratio of meat:starch:veg, I welcomed the nudge in the right direction.
