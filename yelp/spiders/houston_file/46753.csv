Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Came in on a Sunday morning (9:45AM) and had to wait 1hr 15mins for a table for two, but the food and drinks were well worth the wait! Great environment and waitstaff. The food is wonderful and very reasonably priced. They have games and free coffee and water for you while you wait.
