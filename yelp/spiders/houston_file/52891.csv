Kata Robata////Kata Robata was absolutely DELICIOUS.  Extremely fresh and delectable!  This is definitely one of my new favorite sushi places.  We had a variety of different sushi and they were all nicely prepared.  The fish was very fresh.  You should ask about what the freshest items are for the week.  Lots of great dishes (lobster mac and cheese!) and a handful of interesting signature rolls.  I'd recommend ordering off of their daily specials menu as each item that we ordered was simply delightful.
