Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I can't wait to come back (and I've already been twice in two weeks).  It gets busy on the weekends (one server said the wait can exceed 2 hrs).  I came on a Thursday morning and waited 5-10 minutes for a table.  There is free coffee in the waiting area and they take your phone number so you can leave the restaurant to wander around Montrose.  Parking is limited, but you can park across the street.
