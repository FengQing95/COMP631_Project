Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place might be a bit overhyped. Regardless, food was tasty. The cocktails are actually fantastic because it's not your typical brunch place with only 3 brunch cocktail options. I tried the apple spice mimosa and it wasn't too sweet. Only con here was that there was only 1 bartender making all the drinks. It's natural for her to get overwhelmed or forget who ordered what drink. Maybe keeping at least 2-3 bartenders would help.
