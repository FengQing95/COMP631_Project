Kata Robata////Fish and Fish:  I'm kinda confused on this one.  I thought I got grilled kama(neck of a fish) once, but the next time, it was fried with panko.  They do change their menu a little bit so you might want to ask how it's cooked.  By the way, both ways are super good.  I always liked Grilled Hamachi Kama(Neck of Hamachi).  This is a very meaty flavorful part of the fish where there's no bones.  It's easy to eat and yummy.  Dip it in the dipping sauce and make sure they give you shredded daikon and lemon.  It's awesome.
