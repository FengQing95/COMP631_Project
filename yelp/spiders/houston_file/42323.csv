Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Came here in the mid-afternoon on a Saturday and saw how packed this place was.  So naturally, there is a line to the counter.  All the deserts were showcased really well.  Ordered a Cuban sandwich, chocolate croissant and chocolate raspberry mousse cake along with some hot chocolate.  We were pleasantly surprised with the outcome.  Cuban sandwich was very good with smoked bbq pork, ham, cheese and pickle on a dressed up toasted bread.  My wife and daughter loved the chocolate croissant and chocolate raspberry mousse cake. It may get crowded in there but usually, there were a couple of seats that you could find.  There were a lot of patrons coming and going in the cafe/restaurant.  The line was worth the wait.  The place appeals to all walks of life and we saw a lot of different age groups and the staff were very friendly and helpful with suggestions if it was your first time there.  Great place for couples date nites or meetup with family and friends.
