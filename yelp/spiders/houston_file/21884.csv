Uchi////In the end, even though the staff were friendly and the ambiance wasn't terrible, it wasn't enough to compensate for all the problems and my friends and I left unsatisfied and trying to figure out what we were going to eat next so we wouldn't be hungry later on. Unless you're filthy rich or don't eat much, I would avoid Uchi at all costs.
