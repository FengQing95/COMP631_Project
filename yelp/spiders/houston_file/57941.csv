Kata Robata////What stood out the most for me here was the indoor atmosphere... beautiful.. dark, romantic, intimate.. I loved it, the outside appearance wasn't anything special, but worth it. The food was good, the sushi was ok, but the wagu sandos Â take my purse. Delicious! Melt in your mouth. The pho was delicious as well. Must try.
