JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////You are correct regarding our menu change. Our corporate headquarters sends us new dishes every month to keep our offerings fresh and innovative. There's an old adage in the restaurant business that if you're not changing, you're not improving. And while some items no longer appear on our menu, we still offer a vast majority of ramen and tapas dishes. Again, just ask your server and he or she will let you know if it's available as an "off-menu" item or has been permanently discontinued.
