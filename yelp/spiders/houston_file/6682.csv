JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The good thing about this place is you can add so many different things to your ramen. So even though a ramen sounds plain, you can add a lot of different ingredients to add more depth to it. For instance, Spicy Tonkotsu. Just spicy ramen, however, you add a lot of other ingredients and it's actually my favorite ramen dish at this restaurant.
