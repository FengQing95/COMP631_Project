JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I came here during lunch time it was packed but it's the closest ramen spot by my job. The wait time for a to go order was 20-25 minutes so order before coming so you won't waste most of your lunch fighting for parking, walking to the restaurant, ordering, then waiting. A few people parked right in front of the restaurant and ran in to grab their order so if you order ahead and it's ready you can be in and out in seconds
