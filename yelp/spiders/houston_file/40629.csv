Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I liked the ambiance, however I got food poisoning from here. Definitely will not be coming back, I ordered the Mac and cheese and banana pudding. The banana pudding was watery and flavorless, the whipped cream was thicker than the "pudding". As I ate the Mac I started to feel like I was going to puke Â I decided to stop eating and moments later I was running to the toilet.
