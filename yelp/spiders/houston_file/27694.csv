The Pit Room////When we got the sides, without looking at us, the girl was like "what do you want?" Â At the cash register, we also ordered chips and queso with this other girl who was actually really friendly and sweet. It took 20 minutes for us to decide that it was taking too long for the queso, so we decided to check on it. We walked up, asked about it, and the same rude girl didn't look at us again while she said "it's coming".
