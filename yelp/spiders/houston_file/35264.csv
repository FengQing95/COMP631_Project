Local Foods////Local Foods is the best! I love their crunchy chicken sandwich and order it almost every time I'm here, but they have many other great options on their menu that are healthy and flavorful. The sandwiches come with two sides - I usually get kettle cooked chips and fruit, but their potato salad is also very good. The restaurant itself is very cute and there is plenty of seating inside and outside, but it can get crowded at peak times. Parking is usually not an issue.
