JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////** Addition: Props to the owner for commenting on my review because they clearly care about their product. I'll definitely be back to try another bowl! I've never sent a dish back and there was no need to send this dish back. I eat out A LOT! It was fine. I lost focus because I needed to check into my Southwest Flight (karma got me because I was two minutes late and stuck with B49 and C07), but my other thought that I meant to add was charge more and add a third slice of char siu (the highlight of the dish) and the soup's temperature was warm and not hot.
