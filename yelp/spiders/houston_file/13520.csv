JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was not a ramen person until I discovered about Jinya! Honestly everything on their menu is worth trying. I like pork with my ramen so I usually go for Tonkotsu Black or Sprouting Up. If you're a fan of cilantro then the Slurp Up Cilantro is worth trying too. Drinks are ok but the Lychee Mojito is the best one. I like to sit at the bar because they always give me the best service. The bartenders are really friendly and funny. I enjoyed the conversation with them. Thank you Tien and Diana for your great service. Overall highly recommended restaurant!
