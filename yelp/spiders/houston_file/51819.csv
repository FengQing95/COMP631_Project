Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////It had been awhile since I'd eaten here and I was pleasantly welcomed back with a terrific experience. I was greeted by a friendly host and was even seated at the bar before my wait time. I received EXCEPTIONAL service from Gabe. He makes such friendly and fun conversation- all while multi-tasking numerous tasks behind the bar. He's very attentive and pays close attention to detail he made sure I got any substitutions I asked for. I've been back to visit several times already sense! If you haven't been, go get yourself a BLT-Riffic sandwich (add the egg- just do it) or a vegan bliss pancake . I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal or experience while dining with Snooze.
