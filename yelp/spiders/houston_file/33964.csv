Local Foods////Like its sister restaurant, Benjy's, Local Foods is (as the name suggests) all about the dine-local experience, and you can totally tell by how rich it all tastes. As a self-professed carnivore, Local Foods is one of the few places that can make me enjoy a salad that much; you can practically feel the freshness in the crisp arugula, the subtly flavored vinaigrette, and the delicious red peppers. The Panzanella and Arugula are my personal favorites. The crunchy chicken is another great choice, especially with the pretzel bun and ranch dressing.
