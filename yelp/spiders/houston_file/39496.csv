Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came on a Friday night, wasn't packed and everything was spaced out. The pig candy was delicious! Might come back just for that. The drinks and shots were great as well. I had The Bosscat cocktail, was strong and delicious. I also tried the Surviving The Times cocktail and wow, who would've thought about peanut brittle in a drink, loved it! Chicken sausage pasta and 12 hour beef short rib were pretty good as well! Totally coming back!
