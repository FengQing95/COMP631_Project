Kata Robata////If you are looking for more than just great sashimi and sushi, Kata Robata has great options for hot dishes, robata (grilled meats) cold dishes, noodles and even dessert. I've been here multiple times and the best bargain is during their Happy Hour. You can try a lot of great appetizers for around $6 and beers for $3. I also recommend the tonkatsu ramen here for lunch but I haven't gotten it in a while since Jinya opened so near me.
