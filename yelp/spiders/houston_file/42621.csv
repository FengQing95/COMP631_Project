Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'm hoping they get their act together and if they do I will return. The almond croissant was amazing. The baguette was pretty good too (it might be excellent but it was hard to top that croissant). I haven't tried the sticky bun or the scone yet upon penalty of death from my wife but I'm guessing they will be tasty too.
