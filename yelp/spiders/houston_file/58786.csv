Baby Barnaby's////I quickly sat and looked over the menu, and before I could even get to the first couple items, I was being hurried along by one of the waitresses to order a drink. I ordered a hot tea and thought I would have a bit more time to look over the menu before deciding what I was in the mood for. The tea was brought quickly with not enough time for me to read through the menu before the waitress was trying to take my order. I told her it was my first time here and I would need a few more minutes. Without the acknowledgment that I was a new customer, she walked away and said that she would be back. By the time I was ready, she was no where to be seen. She finally came back, but as much as she hurried me to order initially, I thought she would have kept a closer eye on the table.
