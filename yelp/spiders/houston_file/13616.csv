JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Kinda funny, I found this place on yelp because I wanted ramen while in Houston. Funny enough, I found out from my friend that they also have the same ramen restaurant in Los Angeles. Then I did more research, and found out it originated in Japan, but started franchising out here in the states. Crazy. They also have some in the Bay Area now, where I'm from.
