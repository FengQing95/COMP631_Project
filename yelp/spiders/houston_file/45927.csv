Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I ordered three pastries, and this review alone is for the chocolate chip walnut cookie, my favorite chocolate chip cookie in Houston. I broke the cookie in half, and no chocolate chips. I broke it into another quarter and another one, still not a single chocolate chip. Essentially I got a walnut cookie. I understand mistakes happen, there can be bad batches, but NO CHOCOLATE CHIPS? That's unforgivable.
