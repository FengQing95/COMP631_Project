JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Regarding the food, I am glad you enjoyed much of our fare but regret that some fell below par for you. We offer several types of Tonkotsu ramen with different soup bases (Tonkotsu Black, Tonkotsu Spicy, Spicy Miso Tonkotsu and Tonkotsu Assari).  Our Tonkotsu Black and Cha Cha Cha use our thickest broth.  Some guests would say it's "too rich" for them.  Our Tonkotsu Spicy and Miso Tonkotsu use our medium-based broth with a half-and-half mixture of pork broth and a light clear veggie/chicken broth.  Lastly, our Tonkotsu Assari is our lightest Tonkotsu ramen with a mixture of the clear broth with a lesser amount of pork broth. I do hope you try us again, as you mentioned, and can find a ramen that is more suitable to your palate.
