JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Literally my favorite right now. I love the Spicy Creamy Vegan. It's rich and full of flavor. The noodles are thick and perfect. I always enjoy my experience whether at the bar, dining in, or Togo. I'm vegan so I can only speak for these items but I strongly encourage you to give it a try. Also call ahead they can get very busy.
