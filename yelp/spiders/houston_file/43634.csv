Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Aesthetically speaking, I'm a fan of the space. It's got huge floor-to-ceiling windows (natural light, yay!) and shelves full of pastel-colored to-go boxes and white bottles. The counter of baked goodies glow beneath the white lamps, which make them look even more scrumptious. However, I find the layout to be a little awkward in terms of function, though this may just be my perception due to the thick crowd. There's plenty of seating, including some outdoor tables, a long common table, a few booths tucked behind the coffee bar, and chairs and stools at the coffee bar itself. There are also stools at the thin counter facing the windows, but I found the seat-to-counter ratio quite un-ergonomic. The counter was high--way too high to write or work comfortably at a laptop. Perfectly find for chatting with a friend while snacking, though.
