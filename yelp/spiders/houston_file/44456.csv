Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The bakery Items are a 5*. Only reason they are getting a 3* is their menu items are not that great and way over priced i think its ridiculous to spend over $15 on one salad at a cafe. You are better off with a free salad from picking some greens out of someones garden then going to common bond for dessert.
