The Pit Room////I enjoyed the brisket although it wasn't the best I've had in Houston. It's quite palatable nonetheless. The chicken I was disappointed with: I don't know if it sat a while before we got it on the plate but it was less moist than I would prefer. The turkey was a standout, which is shocking for a Texas barbecue spot because here it's all about the brisket. This leaves me wondering what the draw is to this place??? I'm thinking that maybe their pork selections may be more impressive than what we sampled: I don't eat pork.
