Baby Barnaby's////What can you say about this iconic eatery that hasn't already been said? Utter perfection. The staff is usually on top of their game in this tiny venue, and the food is delicious and dependable. All the Barnaby's locations are top notch. I also think the owner should write a book about training staff...he hires the sweetest and most capable service staff in town. I'm a fan.
