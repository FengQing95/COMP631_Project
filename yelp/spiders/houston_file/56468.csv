Kata Robata////Freshest and one of the most innovative sushi (sometimes on par with Uchi) in town. Service is always good (Tai is our recurrent server). They have a regular menu that does not change and has all the classics and a daily menu with more seasonal items, like my beloved salmon with truffle and quail egg, or the madai with caviar. Their salmon is buttery whether as nigiri or sashimi. The ama ebi and its accompanying deep fried head is delicious, almost as good as Sushi Jin (which still holds the top score in this ama ebi category as theirs are fresh and swimming just before being served). The best thing with Kata Robata is the consistency of the freshness of their fish, we NEVER had in the 20+ visits we had a subpar experience, unlike the other 2 restaurants I mentioned above. Simply awesome.
