JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My fav ramen place hands down. Every time I come back to Houston I have to come here. It has to be this location though. Usually there's a wait but it's worth it. I always get the sprout it up ramen since I love Brussels sprouts and it's amazing. If you want it to be spicy they have the sauce at the table so can add spice yourself. I got the cauliflower appetizer and even if you don't like cauliflower, you will love it after you eat that. Their lycheetini is also amazing. I haven't had a good one like that since Miami. Highly recommend if you haven't tried.
