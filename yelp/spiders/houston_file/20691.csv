Uchi////Foie Nigiri (cooked) - Is seared foie gras wrapped with a tiny ball of rice with a strip of seaweed. I rarely have foie gras and when I do it rarely comes out the way you want, however this one was done fairly well. the sauce was a bit heavy probably to cover the slight liver taste, but liking liver, I was disappointed that the sauce was so heavy. My first bite in I had a chunk of yuzu salt that ruined the experience all together.
