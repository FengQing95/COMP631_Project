Uchi////I would've given Uchi Houston 5 stars, if it weren't for their gatekeeper hostesses who gave me bad attitudes the four times that I've been there so far.  Really, why does their need to be 4 different girls working the entrance in that tiny space?? If they could be a little more polite, and not so rude when I call or walk through the door, Uchi would be perfect.  Their hostesses should represent this great establishment better.  Those girls are nothing but glorified door greeters, and next time, I'm getting a manager.
