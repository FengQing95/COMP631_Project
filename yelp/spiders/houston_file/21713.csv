Uchi////If the price point is off-putting, consider going during their social hour to try a lot of their rolls at much cheaper prices.  On my first visit here I brought my two cousins for social hour and ordered at least 5-6 rolls with not much damage to my wallet at all.  Also, reservations are limited but recommended if you intend on visiting during peak hours.  I made reservations for the first visit (social hour), which in retrospect was a good idea because it filled up QUICK and a crowd was waiting by the time we were done eating.  My second visit was at 7:00 pm on a Sunday and a friend and I ate at the bar with no wait at all.
