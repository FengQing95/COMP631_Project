Uchi////My friend thought the "Tears of Dawn" dessert was fantastic, though in hindsight, I think it was a bit too avant garde for my tastes. Sweet frozen melon with a lemon foam, slightly sour buttermilk, and an elderflower with a "dirt"-like texture left me really amazed by the excellent execution of these complex tastes, but still kinda craving a snickers bar afterwards. If you live for the liminal interplay of flavors, this dish is for you. If you're an ogre like me, then I might suggest something more traditional.
