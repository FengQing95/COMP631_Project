Kata Robata////Ginger: HAHA, ok. Hear me out. I have come to find that, just like at tex-mex restaurants and the quality of their green sauce they serve with chips, a sushi restaurant and the quality of their ginger kind of can go hand in hand. So when she served us our wasabi and ginger, I of course dig in. Ginger was... mediocre.
