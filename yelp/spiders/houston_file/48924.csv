Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The pancakes were awesome, light, and fluffy. The bacon was well done and not too crunchy. There is an option not adevertised on the menu, but you can order 1/2 and 1/2. That way you can try two menu options without getting full sizes. Lastly and most importantly the mimosas and morning margs were bomb! (Currently tipsy as I type)
