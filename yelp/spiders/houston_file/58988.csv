Baby Barnaby's////Pros: very good quality food, AWESOME prices (by Houston standards in general, and definitely by Montrose standards), superfriendly (and speedy!) service. It should probably go without saying that, this being an old-school Montrose establishment, Baby Barnaby's is exceptionally gay-friendly as well (and, from the looks of it, I'm pretty sure there's a Sunday tea party at a bar a block to the west).
