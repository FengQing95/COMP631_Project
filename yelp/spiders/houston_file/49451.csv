Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Super pet friendly on the patio! They brought my dog a bowl of water and even his own bacon! What a spoiled boy! They even brought me a fan so it wouldn't be so hot! I love it here!! Richard was my server and he was excellent! Highly recommend this place not only for the service but the food is amazing as well!
