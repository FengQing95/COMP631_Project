JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Di - Thanks for your review. I appreciate your feedback as it helps us improve our station. Please know that you can request "Less Oil" or "No Chili Oil," which is probably what gave your soup the "oily" complexion you describe. And also know that if you're not satisfied with your soup, please let your server know, and he or she will happily remake it to meet your specifications.
