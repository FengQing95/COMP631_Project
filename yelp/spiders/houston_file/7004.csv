JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////There are really only 3 ramen spots that really wow'ed me and this is one of them. They rank the lowest on my patented Ramen Richness Scale TM, at a 7. The richest is a 10, and it made me feel like had just eaten all the Halloween candy. 7 is good. I can eat a 7 more than once a week. And since parking is decent, I sometimes do.
