Uchi////With a pleasantly open central kitchen, it was easy to feel a bit mesmerized by the flurry of sharp knives and fresh Â seafood being prepared. Our party of four had initially been told our wait would be around an hour on a Friday evening, which seems reasonable given Uchi's massive hype. To our surprise, we were called after less than 15 minutes to find our table waiting for us.
