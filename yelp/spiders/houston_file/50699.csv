Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food: diverse, to satisfy both your sweet and savory cravings. I would highly recommend the Frittata, and the Benny Goodman. The Benny Goodman comes in your typical Houston XL portion, with extra runny eggs smothered in sauce. The place is also known for all you can imagine flavors of pancakes. I got toast, fruit and eggs, and was impressed by the freshness. The jam for the toast-- SO GOOD. Â
