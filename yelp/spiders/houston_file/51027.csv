Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Meh.  Not what I remember from the Denver location.  Our food was getting cold already by the time it was finally delivered.  I suspect the waiter just forgot. The chocolate chip pancakes do not have enough chips.  The upside down pineapple pancakes don't have enough sauce.  And the fried eggs are super liquidy and weird. If I had waited instead of sitting outside, I'd be even more disappointed.  Points for sustainability and some good recipes but need to work on execution.
