Kata Robata////The first time I went here we had the lobster mac and cheese, the rising sun roll, a ramen (my boyfriends, I had a bite..), and the kobe beef skewer. We also had a dessert, but I can't exactly remember what it was, but it had ice cream, and a piece of a cake, since I can't remember the exact name, I'll leave that out of the review. Yesterday when I came, I ordered the duck dumpling ramen (all to myself), my boyfriend ordered the spicy soy ramen and the mac and cheese once again.
