Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Nutella croissant: Omg yum, the croissants here are pretty good! This pastry is drizzled with Nutella and is also stuffed with Nutella on the inside, which I actually think makes its too sweet. The croissant part is soft, flakey, and buttery though! I'm also a huge fan of the little round crunchy balls that are sprinkled on top of the Nutella drizzle.
