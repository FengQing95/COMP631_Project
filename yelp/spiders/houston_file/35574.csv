Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I have been here twice now and can say the food is so good. I love the southern flare of the menu. The shrimp and grits is my favorite dish by far, however there aren't many (if any) vegetarian options and for brunch no substitutions or amendments can be made so that makes it tough to find what to order. Â The drinks are good but not great, but overall a great place to have a group meal.
