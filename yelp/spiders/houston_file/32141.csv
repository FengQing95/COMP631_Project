Local Foods////The decor is lovely, modern and clean with eclectic touches like the green cushioned chairs that looked like ones we both grew up with. Staff were friendly. If there's anything to complain about, it's the price, $28 for two sandwiches and two drinks. But you won't hear a single complaint from me. Local Foods is worth every penny. We will be back very soon.
