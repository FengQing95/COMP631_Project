Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Service - We came during a very busy time (11:30am) and had to wait for around 45 minutes. Parking is very limited so either find someplace along the side streets or take a payed car service. Or if you wish, simply wait for a spot as people are constantly coming in and out. The service overall was decent. Since it's such a popular place, the servers are all rushed and hurried, but we got our food in less than 15 minutes so everything was fine.
