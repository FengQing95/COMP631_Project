Kata Robata////The rolls I've tried have been good, but they're just rolls and there's so many other cool dishes to try!  The food presentation is great here, ambiance/decor is nice and modern Asian.  I dislike when nice places pack people in like sardines but that wasn't a problem here.  It'd be a great date place (there seemed to be many couples on dates here when I last went)!
