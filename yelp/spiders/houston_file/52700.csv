Kata Robata////I have to say, I am impressed at how seriously Kata Robata takes their customers' comments. The GM reached out to me and apologized for our dining experience during HRW. We went back for another try on Saturday and the experience was very different from our first time. First off, the service was excellent: attentive but unobtrusive. Â
