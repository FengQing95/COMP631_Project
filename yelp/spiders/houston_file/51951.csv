Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I typically enjoy eating at Snooze, particularly this one. I tried the online system today, it took them 48 minutes to get some blueberry pancakes out, when I asked why the order was taking so long I was informed that their online system only releases orders to the bar once 6 orders have been placed. I spoke to the manager about how ridiculous of a system that is, why should I have to wait til there's 5 additional orders before my order gets ticketed and released. She was completely condescending and uncaring about this situation, I regret not asking her name. She's the African American lady with round glasses and blonde ombré hair, giving ppl a dead stare while they voice something that could be better for your establishment is a real bad look. She could have at least offered a fake apology to go with her condescending demeanor about it taking 40 minutes to make some blueberry pancakes.
