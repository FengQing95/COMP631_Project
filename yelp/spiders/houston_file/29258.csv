The Pit Room////First night in Houston, and I'm dying for some Texas bbq. Based on Yelp and other sources, and our host's recommendation, we tried The Pit Room and were glad we did! Parking was readily available in the neighborhood. It was a bit crowded inside, but the lines move fast. The guys taking the orders were kinda gruff, like the Greek diner skit on SNL, but they do keep the line moving. I got the 2-meat platter. The brisket was nicely done, with nicely crisp burnt edges. The pulled pork was very flavorful, and moist. A side of mac n' cheese was "ok", and the Mexican street corn (a.k.a. elote') was pretty good. There are plenty of sauces and toppings available after you get your order. The thing I liked the best which I got as a side order was venison sausage. It was perfectly smoked, really spicy, and rich without being "gamy" tasting. Interior seating was crowded, but there's a pretty spacious patio outside. What we did was go right next door to The Patio on Richmond bar, which allows you to bring in your Pit Room food....a very nice arrangement. Overall, very happy with the food and atmosphere...definitely recommended.
