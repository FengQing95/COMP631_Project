Uchi////Uchi... we meet again.  I've visited and dined at their Dallas location and had such an amazing time.  This visit was just as impressive and a little bit more special... since I came with my boyfriend.  What's a better date night than some delicious, contemporary Japanese food, drinks, and good (looking!) company.
