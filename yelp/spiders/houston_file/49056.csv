Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I am so happy to have this addition to the neighborhood and I love that people LOVE it; but I believe we have some better brunch options. That being said: GIVE IT A TRY, the Eggs Benedict and pancakes are very good; and the buzz and crowd keep it very interesting and lively.
