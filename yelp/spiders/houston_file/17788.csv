Uchi////I asked our waitress outside who was handling our drinks how much longer? She said I apologize but I think your group was called and since you weren't here you started over on the reservation list. I was like why didn't you tell us that. If we were given that information maybe we wouldn't have sat there and waited for two hours and given a choice to decide if we wanted to stay or not.
