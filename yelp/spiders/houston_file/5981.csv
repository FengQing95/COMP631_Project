JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Michelle - Thank you very much for the 5-star review! We greatly appreciate it. In the coming weeks, we will open our third location in Katy, which hopefully will alleviate some of the crowds at our Midtown location. But, regardless, we appreciate your understanding of our extended wait times, and we hope to see you again in the near future.
