Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Decided to try my first mimosa, and idk if mimosas are regularly just bad tasting or if it was to me(Not an alcohol drinker). But the food was filling, I had French toast, eggs, bacon, etc and my friend had the grilled cheese with tomato soup. I ate most of it because I was hungry and it was edible, but HONESTLY it wasn't hitting like I thought it would've. + The younger black guy(Server) called us beautiful lol that's why it's 4/5 -1 for the food not hitting, will definitely give another try +(My review is a couple months late)
