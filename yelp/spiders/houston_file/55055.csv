Kata Robata////The great: Miso marinated Cod- perfectly cooked, with a flaky interior and a crispy flavorful crust. Muah! Kobe beef- definitely recommend. Â Incredibly tender, and grilled to perfection. Only complaint is that you only get four tiny pieces. Sushi- the sashimi were all fresh, and the spicy tuna was perfectly prepared.
