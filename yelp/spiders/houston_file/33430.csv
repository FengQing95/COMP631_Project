Local Foods////Walking in, you might get the sense from the decor that you'll be dealing with some know it all cafe hipster when you order...but don't worry. We are always greeted with the warmest and most inviting staff that will take the time to help you navigate the menu options and offer suggestions. For instance, last week while debating between ourselves which of the listed sides our little 3 yr old food critic might like, the guy at the counter mentioned they would whip him up a toasted PB&J on pretzel bread with a slice of watermelon.
