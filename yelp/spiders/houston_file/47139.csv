Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I took a walk on the wild side and ordered the Pumpkin Pancakes. It was tasty and filling. Depending on the time you go, it may be a long wait ( 20 minutes or so) however, you can sit at the bar and enjoy your meal. Fun place to people watch and a nice addition to the area for places to eat.
