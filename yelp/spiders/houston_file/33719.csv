Local Foods////I ordered the Salt-Pepper Roast Beef, which should have been named in the order of the most abundant ingredients as kale, cured cauliflower, wheat, tomato, and roast beef. Oddly for a roast beef sandwich I noticed it was rather lacking in the "roast" and "beef" portions of its given title.
