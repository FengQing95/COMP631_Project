Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Tasty food, good service, and fun!!! We tried Bosscat due to its huge amount of reviews and American Asian Fusion menu. It did not disappoint! Beautiful patio sitting and decor. We tried the pork belly poutine, pig candy, 12 hour short rib, and their fried apple pie. SO DELICIOUS! Definitely a twist on their food and it's all so tasty. Terry was our server. He was so personable and fun. We had such a great evening here! It was my cousin's birthday and Terry and Bosscat made it a birthday to remember. Thank you, Bosscat!
