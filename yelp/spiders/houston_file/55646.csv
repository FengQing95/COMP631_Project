However, the staff were incredibly patient and attentive to our table despite my child's high energy. Sidenote: my child was always awesome whenever we took her out to a restaurant, so we were at a complete loss with her random terrible two outbursts. I would say this place is okay for kids, but maybe not the greatest for infants and toddlers since the bathroom did not have a diaper changing table and this was a few months ago. They do have highchairs though.
