Kata Robata////Irascible dining partner got the Agedashi Tofu, which he immediately tried to send back because he actually meant to get a different tofu (no fault of our waitress, she took his order exactly as he had said it).  Anyway his wife convinced him to keep it and it was delicious!  I would order it again - the broth itself is amazing.
