JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen here is pretty tasty indeed. Last trip, we got the Black and the Spicy Tonkatsu. Both were yummy, but I think my preference of the two was the Black, though I preferred the thick noodles of the spicy tonkatsu. Broth here has good depth and richness to it. My favorite part was the noodles though. On both accounts, they were perfectly al-dente with just enough chew/mouth feel to make it very satisfying. Â Service was good as well. Nothing overly stellar, but good food at a good price.
