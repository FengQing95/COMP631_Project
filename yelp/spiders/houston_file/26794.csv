The Pit Room////Visiting Houston and tried them out for dinner last night, excellent like all the reviews say, the brisket was just right, not over cooked or salty as some places I have tried, the pork ribs were amazing, the meat just slid of the bone, pulled pork was good too, it is a counter service place at least the side we were on and the bus boy was so concerned about how we and other guests were enjoying their meals, just added to the experience.
