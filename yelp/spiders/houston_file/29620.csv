The Pit Room////The food as a whole was perfect. I had the 3 meat plate. ( sliced brisket, beef sausage, Â and pork ribs). 1 slice of the 3 slices of brisket was pretty dry. Everything else perfect. The coleslaw was unique and on point. The chips (you gotta to the chips), I wanted more. The lemonade was strong and tart. So I mixed mine with some sweet tea.
