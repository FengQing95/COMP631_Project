JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Simon - Thank you for your review. The late, great Yogi Berra once said about a popular restaurant in New York City: "Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded." When we opened JINYA-Midtown more than three years ago, we had no idea so many Houstonians would embrace authentic Japanese ramen. But today, with more than a dozen ramen options inside the Loop alone, our city is flush with ramen restaurants. So we appreciate your giving us a try at all, and we wish you all the best.
