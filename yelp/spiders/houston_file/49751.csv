Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I started going to Snooze shortly after becoming very ill.  I know this is weird, but I went in with a mobile IV drip I needed to ward off an infection that was damaging my heart. 3 months.  I felt anxious. They were so nice and recognized me when I sat at the bar.  On top of that, I have always enjoyed every single thing I have ordered.  I applaud their support of local products.
