JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hands down my favorite ramen place in NOVA area.  The ramen has the different spicy levels, which is really nice if you want things spicy.  I haven't added any garlic to my ramen but the extra garlics are also good as well.  They are full garlic amd you meed to squeeze them to little pieces.  The broth is thick and noodles are good.  One can say the menu is a bit modern so if you are looking for the traditional ramen ypu might be disappointed.  The ambience is definitely really nice and casual, not too crowded if you get there before 6:30 pm during the weekday.  No reservation is taken so you might have to wait after dinner time.  It is in a good location, parking is definitely not a problem.  Overall, love the place and will definitely come back again!
