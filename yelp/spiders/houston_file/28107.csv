The Pit Room////Very rude and unprofessional staff! After I placed my order the server behind the counter was packaging my food in containers and another man who I'm assuming was the manager/owner told him in Spanish to give me smaller pieces-I'm assuming it was because I specifically ordered a quantity of pieces which I was more then happy to pay for. Then the guy continues to tell me to order 'a la carte' because they were out of a specific meat that was part of a meal and i would 'get more for my money this way anyway.' Â He was very rude and condescending when I inquired why my total was $20+ than what I was expecting. The food was ok, definitely not the best BBQ I've had. Facilities were filthy. Definitely don't eat from the condiment bar-no sanitation what so ever! And the staff made it a very unpleasant experience. I'll support other businesses that treat customers with honesty, kindness and respect just as I treat business employees/owners. Very disappointed.
