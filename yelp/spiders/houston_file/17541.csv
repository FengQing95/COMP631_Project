Uchi////This definitely not a restaurant you go to fill up at, but a place you go enjoy and experience great flavors and fine dining service without having to be in your sunday best. I recommend going with friends and eating each dish family style groups of four is perfect. gives everyone a byte or two so you can try every thing. this is definitely a good place to take a date to impress. AND i do mean to impress because that bill is no joke. id say its about 70-100bux a person to really enjoy your experience there. at the houston location valet is free just drop a tip and skip the headache of finding parking.
