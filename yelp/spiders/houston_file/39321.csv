Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The restaurant has a very casual atmosphere. It is very opened with plenty of seating, a nice size bar is located in the center and there are several televisions on the walls. Initially, the waitress sat us at a regular table. However, the chairs were so short until eating at this table would be very uncomfortable. Therefore, we decided to sit at a high top table.
