Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We got there when they first opened and asked for a table, saying the rest of our party was about 10min away. The hostess was a little snotty imo saying she could seat us but that she would start a timer on us and if we used up the time, they'd ask us to leave. We were a little taken back and said oh we better wait to which she replied well if another party of 5 comes, then you can't have a table until another opens up. This while their tables were all literally empty. I get that you have reservations, but have some level of tact. Our party arrived a few min later and we asked for a table and the hostess literally didn't believe our party was here and then repeated that while she could give us a high top, they had a time limit and that they would ask us to leave if we exceeded it. I can not roll my eyes more. They never filled up the entire time we were there.
