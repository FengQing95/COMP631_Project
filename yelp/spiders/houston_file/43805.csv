Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Raspberry Pistachio Tart - The pistachio raspberry tart took me by surprise. I had expected a stronger pistachio flavor - one that I am accustomed to with hints of bitter almond oil which is so often added to pistachio paste. This pistachio tart however was purely pistachio. The shortbread crust was so buttery and not too sweet. Then there was a layer of what was like a pistachio version of marzipan or probably pistachio paste, then a beautifully piped pistachio custard all around, topped with fresh raspberries and some more pistachios. I do wish it had a stronger flavor since pistachios do not have that strong of a taste, but this tart was still good and I would order it again.
