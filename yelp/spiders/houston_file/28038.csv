The Pit Room////I'm in Houston helping my daughter relocate for her new job. We went to The Pit Room for dinner and loved it. The Brisket was the best I have ever tasted I literally cut it with a fork. The flavor was smoky and delicious. Really enjoyed the sides as well, the beans were truly outstanding. Loved it so much I have been back two more times already and plan to get a pound of brisket on the way to the airport for my wife who is back in Florida.
