The Pit Room////Yesterday was my last day here in Houston.So I asked my cousin if she could take me to a bbq place . So her husband suggested this place. The menu wasn't hard to choose.  On the menu I chose the brisket and smoked sausages with cheddar and jalapeños . The sides were the coleslaw and the charro beans. I did like the coleslaw but it didn't care of the beans . Next time I will try other bbq places to see how do they compare . Bye bye brisket
