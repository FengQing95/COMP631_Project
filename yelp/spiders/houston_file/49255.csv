Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////8. Three minutes later I get the check and the chai.  The waiter says he'll take care of the chai.  I leave my credit card with the check while I wolf down my food.  The chicken sausage was really good.  Everything was good or better, but I had to inhale it so it wasn't enjoyable.
