Baby Barnaby's////Just had dinner here and it was amazing! The fondue fries or waffle fries were excellent and the way they were presented to us was awesome,  I got the Texas chilli burger and even though it's messy (it has to be its a chilli burger haha)  it was fantastic,  even coming a little before they closed the beef tasted fresh and juicy.  Definitely recommend!
