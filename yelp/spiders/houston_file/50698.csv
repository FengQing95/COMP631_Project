Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Super Cute + Bright Eatery, with delicious food! The testament to its popularity: we came here at 8 am for breakfast on Friday, and were barely able to find a seat. By the time we were leaving, at 10:00, there was a line out the door. Looks like Houstonians know where to go to get their breakfast fix.
