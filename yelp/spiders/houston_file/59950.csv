Baby Barnaby's////This place is amazing! I came here with my bf and his cousin. We were amazed at how everything on the menu was just under $10. I got the steak and eggs breakfast with potatoes. It came out just as I had requested with medium rare steak and scrambled eggs (nice and fluffy!). I also ordered oj....let me tell you it was sooo good (a must get w/ your meal!). My bf cousin ordered the same thing but with medium well steak and over easy eggs. My bf ordered the green heart which consisted of scrambled eggs with artichoke and spinach. It came with a side of fruits and toast. He def enjoyed his meal!
