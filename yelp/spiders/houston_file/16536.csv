JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I used to love ordering take-out from Jinya! Their Tonkotsu ramen with the pork chashu was truly *chef's kiss*. The containers that also come with them are also perfect for takeout ramen and virtually mess free. However, this might have happened a few months ago, but for some reason they changed their pork chashu. They're now smaller pieces and the taste is just off...Last time I ate it it tasted like it was old or gone bad. It may not be the case, as they could have switched to a cheaper chashu. Nevertheless, I wish they could switch it back and maybe I'll order more often again!
