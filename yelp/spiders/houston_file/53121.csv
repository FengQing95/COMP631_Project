Kata Robata////I have been here twice.  I am told the owner used to be the chef for the consulate of Japan here in town.  Both times the food was very good.  Service was above average and the price was 4 out of 5 in terms of expense, 5 being the most expensive.  Parking was easy.  The one downside was that both times I went is was very, very cold inside.  The next time I go I will bring a fleece.
