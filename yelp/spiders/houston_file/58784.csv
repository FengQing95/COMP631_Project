Baby Barnaby's////Situated along a very jagged road, that you practically need 4-wheel drive to navigate, is a quaint little breakfast/brunch spot by the name of Baby Barnaby's. It absorbs its look from the local surroundings and is as eclectic as the houses in the neighborhood. You will find every kind of person in here if you sit long enough, but don't get excited about being able to sit that long because it is very small on the inside and you will be unofficially hurried out of your spot once you are done eating.
