The Pit Room////Everything here was home made and hand done.  I could have eaten the home made pickles only and been happy, they were so good.  This place provides not only pickled jalepenos but raw sliced (non-pickled) if you prefer.   In terms of onion, some bbq places do sliced white, some do sliced and pickled red, this place does both.   They get it.
