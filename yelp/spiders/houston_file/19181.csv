Uchi////The Uchi salad: we didn't order this, and they brought it out to us as "something to munch on." The salad was baby romaine lettuce leaves sprinkled with panko. There was a spicy chili oil edamame dressing to dip the lettuce in. Loved the dressing. It was creamy, spicy, and the panko added a nice crunchy texture element. The only downside was they ended up charging us $8 when we didn't even order it.
