Local Foods////I've come many times and tried multiple things on the menu, from their sandwiches to their salads, and everything's tasted great! As a huge fan of salmon, I especially love their smoked salmon sandwich. It was the first thing I tried since visiting Local Foods and still remains my favorite, but at the end of the day, it's really hard to go wrong with any choice here.
