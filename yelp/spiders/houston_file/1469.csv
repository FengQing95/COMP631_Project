JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love it!! Place is not big at all but service was fast and the Ramen was awesome! Went on a Friday about 12:40 was seated about 1:12 it was worth the wait. My personal preference and wish that an Shrimp Ramen is added to the selection. Another good thing about this location that there is an parking garage right behind it attached to the same build which is convenient. One dislike was its only one restroom per gender which was pretty smelly. But I can say this is an place to come if you looking for a different feel and taste.(I ordered the spicy chicken Ramen with toppings fresh garlic,the seasoned egg,and extra soup) Hope this helped Enjoy!!
