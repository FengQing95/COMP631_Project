Uchi////Of the Uchi family of restaurants, I've only been to the one in Houston.  Decor is interesting - semifinished woods, cut in coarse blocks figure prominently in both the entry-way as well as in the seating.  The effect is interesting as it blends design elements from Japan as well as the american west... a statement that resonates with the cuisine served.
