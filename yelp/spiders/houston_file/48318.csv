Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was wonderful.... the service was okay .... but the food made up for it..., I had to park on the side of the street(3blocks down)....the server bought me a pancake Â and it was awesome.... instead of a pouched egg I got them scrambled.... all in all a great experience
