Baby Barnaby's////Fabulous little spot! I stopped by on a Sunday morning and when I saw the pastel rainbow ceiling and heard the Dolly Parton playing I knew I found the right place for brunch. Baby Barnaby's reminds of the little eateries in New Orleans, small but quaint and absolutely delicious! I opted for a waffle with a side of potatoes (yay carbs), the potatoes were seasoned to perfection. The staff was very nice and service was excellent. Come early or expect a wait, there's a small parking lot but it's mainly street parking.
