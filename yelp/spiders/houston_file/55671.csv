Kata Robata////A friend of mine and I had dinner here recently. I know that times are difficult for restaurants right now, but there was really no excuse for the manner in which we were treated. We were not told in advance of making reservations that we were being timed and had only ninety minutes to sit down, order, wait for our food, and eat (we were celebrating a special occasion and would have gone elsewhere if we had been aware of this policy before arriving).  We asked toward the end of our time whether we had time to order another glass of wine and were told yes. We ordered it, and almost immediately after it came, we were asked several times to leave because our time was up. Our waitress was very polite about it, but then the manager aggressively and rudely confronted us. We were unable to finish the round we were told we had time to order but were charged for it anyway.  Additionally, they got rid of happy hour pricing, so ultimately, we spent several hundred dollars to be treated poorly. I have always liked this restaurant in the past, but I won't be going back. Other restaurants are also dealing with COVID difficulties, but I have not encountered this attitude anywhere else. There are plenty of other places in town to enjoy good sushi, and there are many fine dining establishments (shout out to Tony's!) who seem happy to have their customers back.
