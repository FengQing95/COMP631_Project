Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Sweet: The pancakes are a must have! Super fluffy and soft. If you go with a few friends, the pancake flight is the best option to try 3 different flavors. Always make sure to ask for the pancake of the day flavor. The lemon ricotta pancake is deeeelicious, so hope to make it on a day when they have it as a special! The OMG french toast is super sweet and rich. I was only able to eat one or two pieces, but if you have a sweet tooth, this mascarpone cream-filled brioche is definitely a decadent treat for you.
