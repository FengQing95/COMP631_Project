Kata Robata////Obsessed with this place; tried their lychee drink on their happy hour menu and it's my go-to know! Usually always order the same items; chiefs sashimi tower, 2 orders of the salmon Carpaccio (also on their happy hour) the uni spoon (pricy but worth it) seafood ramen (shareable) and the longhorn sushi!
