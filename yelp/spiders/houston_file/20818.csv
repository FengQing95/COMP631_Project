Uchi////Let me start off by saying Uchi super impressed me this time around because the first time I went was 3 years ago it was okay to me at the time. We ordered the chef's omakase this time and it was very good! It was 10 courses of deliciousness. We also ordered blue fin otoro sashimi which was super fatty and yummy. I asked for soy sauce and ended up not using it because all the dishes were already so well put together. My favorites out of the omakase was definitely the nigiri pieces amberjack and the salmon belly. I also really liked the oxtail which had I think a light tempura crunch paired with some basil leaves that were also light and crispy I believe. The wagyu ailoi which was paired with homemade chips that gave me life. The flounder was also amazing with tobiko and crunchy quinoa which gave the dish a well balanced texture. I wasn't really a fan of the king crab only because it had a smoky flavor to it and I just personally don't like smoky dishes but my SO did love this dish. The scallop with nuoc mam was okay and the dish that I usually love the hama chili was too fruity and not spicy enough this time around. The only thing that I may have been upset about is the portion sizes. It's always been super small portion sizes except for some of the cooked dishes, which was a good size portion. After spending $400 I was still hungry. :3
