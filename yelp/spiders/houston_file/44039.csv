Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The flavor of the lemon tart was great -- the lemon notes in the custard came out well, although I would have liked a little softer crust -- it made it hard to eat with a fork. Twas pretty stiff. As for the coffee, it was more on the sour versus bitter side. They give it to you unsweetened and you have the option of skim, cream, or almond milk to add to your liking. Several types of sugar/sweetener are also available, as is self-serve water.
