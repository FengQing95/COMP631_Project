Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place is awesome. My boyfriend and I came here for happy hour and to watch the Texas Tech game. We order food and drinks and it was amazing. Bryce and Benji were THEE BEST bartenders I've met. They made sure our drinks were to perfection!! I had the Ro≈õe Bellini pitcher drink and my bf had a beer and magical orange tequila drink that Benji made for him! I would totally recommend this place for Sunday fun day!!!
