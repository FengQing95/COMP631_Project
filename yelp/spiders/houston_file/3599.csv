JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love the thickness of the noodles and the flavor of the soup base.  I'ved ordered the Tonkotsu Assari twice, which is pretty consistent as far as deliciousness whenever I come, and it comes with the thick noodles.  They cook the egg perfectly and the condiments that it comes with adds great depth to the bowl overall.  I've also had the spicy version and there are 3 levels.  Same flavor as the Tonkotsu Assari but with that extra kick! My husband orders the Jinya Tonkotsu Black and that comes with thinner noodles.  They also have this delicious salmon appetizer that are basically 7-8 slices of fresh, raw salmon with a sour soy sauce and some sliced jalapeno on top.  It's been a few months since I've gone, so not sure if they took this appetizer off the menu.  Definitely check Jinya Ramen out -- it's probably the best ramen place in Houston so far.
