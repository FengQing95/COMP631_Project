Kata Robata////One authentic Japanese dish they have is tonkatsu ramen. In short it had a tasty broth and ancillary ingredients but I had 2 problems with it: the biggest problem were the slices of pork it came with. They were approximately 70% fat. Some bites I had to sneak into my napkin because they were pure fat and unchewable. The other issue is that the noodles aren't fresh. At the bottom of my bowl I noticed many, many tiny broken pieces of ramen; which means it was dried at some point and then boiled. If hats the case they should only use the unbroken noodles. The only time I've seen broken noodles in my ramen is when I make top ramen at home.
