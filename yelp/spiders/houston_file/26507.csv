The Pit Room////A good place to get your bbq fix on. We tried the beef brisket and beef ribs along with the pork ribs. The rankings I would say would be pork ribs brisket to beef ribs. I hear their in house sausage is good too but they didn't have any the day I went. There are plenty of pickled condiments by the bar and 4 different sauces you can get as well.
