Baby Barnaby's////Went looking for Barnaby's, but arrived too early.  Liked the food.  Generous portions, some imagination, imtimate atmosphere.  When the two young women next to us popped-out a backgammon board for a quick game while they waited for their food - - it did not seem strange at all...  Will go back.
