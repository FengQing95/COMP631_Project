Kata Robata////Good location (next to dessert gallery) and really good ambience. Good display of art and use of lighting. Food is just okay for the price. I really wish they had a selection of bento boxes but they didn't. The one they had was a whopping 27 bucks. I had the houston roll, crunchy eel, and vegetable tempura. All three were okay with the eel coming out on top. Houston roll was bland, eel was overly sauced, and the tempura was just a small fistful for 8 bucks. But it was neatly battered and fried to a good crisp and wasn't soggy. For a large group, be prepared to tip 20%.
