Local Foods////Im new to Houston, so I'm taking it upon myself to try out as many restaurants as I can. We came here for lunch on Sunday. I ordered the egg salad sandwich with the homemade potato chips and the guy at the counter reconmended the kale over the Cole slaw. My fiance ordered the crunchy chicken sandwich and side of lemongrass soup. Your can definitely tell the ingredients were fresh however the egg salad lacked flavor and I actually exchanged the kale for the slaw which was what I initially wanted. The lemongrass soup was actually to died for... I could eat a bowl of it everyday!
