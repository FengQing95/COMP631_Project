Local Foods////Now on to the food, the sandwiches here are awesome.  They are brimming with so much meats and veggies that it can be difficult to eat.  My favorite is the Crunchy Chicken sandwich, sliced roasted chicken breast, homemade potato chips to give it a "crunch", provolone, buttermilk ranch, and pickles served on a toasted pretzel bun.  The Blue Crab and Shrimp sandwich is also a winner in my book, shrimp and crab tossed in green goddess dressing served on toasted ciabatta.  They don't skimp on the crab and shrimp!  The Truffled Egg Salad is also a must try if you like egg salad.  Perfect balance of eggs and mayo drizzled with fragrant truffle oil on a toasty pretzel bun.
