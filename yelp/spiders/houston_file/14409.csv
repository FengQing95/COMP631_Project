JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is conceptually cool. 4 seating options: bar, shared with long table, separate tables, and ramen bar. We did the shared long table which was quite nice. The lychee Moscow mule was wonderful. We got fried Brussel sprouts which was heavenly! I got the wonton chicken ramen which was alright; I'm not the biggest soup fan BUT the flavor profile was nice and then wontons were great. I will definitely be back!
