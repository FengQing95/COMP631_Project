JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been here several times before and have very much loved their food. My grievances come from the fact that I've experienced other restaurants during the pandemic and have been satisfied with the extent of their preventative measures. It is not something that is impossible to ask of a restaurant. It's not about how thorough they can be in regards to cleanliness, but instead how much are they willing to respect the health, safety, and impression of their customers.
