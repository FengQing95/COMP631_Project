Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was not great which is why I'm perplexed about its popularity. I had three pancakes: blueberry, peanut butter cup and chocolate chip. The only one that looked and tasted good was the blueberry. I would have been livid had I waited over an hour for that meal so at least I didn't have to wait. There was no whipped cream but instead globs of butter which I didn't want so I pushed them off and used the syrup instead.
