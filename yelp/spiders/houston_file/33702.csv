Local Foods////My favorite item on the menu is definitely their Crunchy Chicken Sandwich.  The sandwich comes served on an amazing pretzel bread bun with provolone cheese melted on to the top half of the bun. The sandwich, in addition to slices of their nut-crusted chicken, comes serviced with tomato, house pickles, a light covering of chips, and a light drizzle of buttermilk ranch.  I honestly can't say I know a better sandwich in Houston.
