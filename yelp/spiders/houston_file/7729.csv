JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Dwight - Thanks for the great review! We are very happy to know our ramen matches up to the ramen you have tried in Tokyo. Unfortunately, I can't speak to the administration of the valet service who are contracted independently by the landlord of the Mix@Midtown building. But at least there's no charge to park on the upper levels! Thanks again, and we look forward to serving you again soon.
