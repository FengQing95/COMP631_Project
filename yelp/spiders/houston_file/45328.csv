Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We ordered the chicken torta, grilled cheese, with an Arnold Palmer and their popular caramel lattes. I asked the gals behind the counter whether vanilla or caramel was better, and both said vanilla because it is sweeter. This was soothing to my ears because I don't want my latte sweeter. Sure enough, the caramel latte was appropriately frothy and the best hands down in Houston (I would say the Texas Fresh Juice latte is s close second). Their bread on the grilled cheese was so good. I also liked my chicken torta, with a large fresh bun, with moist chicken meat that resembled a pot roast, with a spicy "kick." Everything was excellent. On to the breads tomorrow...
