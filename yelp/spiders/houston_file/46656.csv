Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This cafe is great when you want to hang out with a couple of friends and catch up, but there were a few things that I didn't enjoy. Their coffee is overpriced for a small cup of coffee that doesn't really taste like it's worth it. The space is very small and it can get very busy, so if you are on the run or want a pick me up, the wait will be quite long. For parking, there is a small lot that they share with other businesses so it is quite limited.
