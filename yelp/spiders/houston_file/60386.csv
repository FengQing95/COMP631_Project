Baby Barnaby's////After reading the reviews my family and I decided to give this place a try. After putting our name on the list they proceeded to seat people ahead of us. We were by no means a LARGE party. It was 5+a baby. Table after table got cleared only to make room for others. We left. Very disappointed.
