Local Foods////I researched beforehand and identified the banh mi and falafel sandwiches as veganizable.  I asked for the falafel sandwich, but nixed the yogurt (dairy) and sambal (some sort of fishy ingredient), totally forgot to inquire whether the bread is vegan, fail Ellen fail!  I added a side of mustard to moisten up (ew, poor word choice) the sandwich.  Cashier dude said the beets and cabbage slaw were vegan so I was all about them.
