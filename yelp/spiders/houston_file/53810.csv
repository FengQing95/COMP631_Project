Kata Robata////Tonkatsu Ramen: I didn't like noodles because it was over cooked and the broth was WAYYYYYYY to thick. I wanted to pour some water in my bowl to dilute the think broth. Also, a film layer of fat will develop within a min of not touching your soup (gross). Although I like the soft boiled egg, I didn't like theirs because it was too runny and it wasn't marinaded enough to get any flavor.
