JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First of all, be prepared to wait and also be prepared for sitting at a "communal table" which has a bit of a different meaning here than other shared table experiences I've had in the past. These shared tables are HUGE so you will be sitting with about 10 other people on tiny wooden stumps... if you have a jacket or a lot of bags, good luck.
