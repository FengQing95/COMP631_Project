Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Semolina Pancake (5/5): This was an on-the-house dish and were the absolute highlight of the meal.  The semolina pancake was PERFECT, amazingly cooked, rich, sweet, and fluffy.  It was topped with an amazing maple syrup.  This isn't on the standard menu, but it was seriously, seriously amazing.  My dining partners and I all loved this pancake and thought it was hands down the best part of the meal.  I would definitely ask the servers if this is able to be ordered.
