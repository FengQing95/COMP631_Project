Uchi////Food was really good. The staff spoke very well and gave good recommendations. The pork belly and walu walu were my favorite dishes. They have complimentary parking which is really good since the area is hard to find parking sometimes. I recommend you make reservations ahead of time cause I went on a Tuesday night and it was super packed.
