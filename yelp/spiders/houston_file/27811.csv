The Pit Room////We walked in and were greeted by the staff and the Executive Chef, Bramwell as we looked over the extensive BBQ menu. I immediately knew I had to order the Loaded Frito Pie because I had been planning on getting this during my trip to Texas. It came with a side of chopped beef and along side it I had pickled jalape√±os and spicy house habanero sauce upon Chef Bramwell's suggestion. It was utterly superb!
