JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Excellent ramen. Probably the best veggie ramen I have had where the broth is not diluted by the deluge of vegetables. I ordered extra noodles which was served on the side. When I dug into my bowl I realised that they were unnecessary as the amount in the bowl is more than adequate. Noodles are firm in consistency yet absorbs the broth adequately. Sitting at the back of the kitchen bar, I saw their using fresh noodles.
