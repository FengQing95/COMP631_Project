JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I can't count how many times I've eaten here. I've celebrated a birthday here and most of the time when people from out of town come to visit, this is a solid place to bring them.  Great atmosphere and good food (except the sprouting ramen).  We usually order a ramen and add in the crispy chicken combination for a few dollars extra.  This time we also ordered the ebison crispy shrimp which was pretty good!  I would order that again.  My go to ramen order is usually the jinya tonkotsu black, but this time I ordered the sprouting ramen which was a disappointment, but I'll be back for my regular.
