JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This was my first ramen experience besides the $1 packaged ramen. I got the Mi So Hot. I love spicy so I asked the person taking my order is it REALLY spicy? And he suggested I get the Thai chili and habanero to add to it. I'm so glad he suggested it! It was served on the side so I could add what I wanted. The ramen was pretty good! Way too much for one sitting. We also got the Brussel sprout appetizer which I don't usually like, but they were crispy served in a sweet n sour sauce. Super good, probably the only way I'll eat brussel sprouts
