Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Unpopular opinion, but Snooze is a little too hyped up. The food is good, yes. BUT nothing I'd order again. The chicken pot pie became soft fast and the eggs Benedict isn't different from others I've tried before. Actually, would order the French toast again. That was the perfect amount of sweetness and paired well with the fruit. I just don't know if I'd spend another hour in line to order it though.
