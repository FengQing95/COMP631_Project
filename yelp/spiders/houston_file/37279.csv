Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The ambiance of this place is chic, trendy and classic. I liked that the wait staff all had on plaid shirts. It went well with the scene. The floor plan was nice and open. My guest and I sat on the patio to enjoy the breeze. The seats were a little difficult to get comfortable on but I made the best of it. The food and drinks were pricey. I had the hash and my guest had the Nutella pancakes. She thoroughly enjoyed her meal. I thought a hash was going to include some type of potato but it did not. Our waiter was very attentive and personable.
