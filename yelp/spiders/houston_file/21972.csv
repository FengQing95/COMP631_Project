Uchi////Tomato Katsu: Fried green tomato slices were really good! Again, I love sushi, but this was a meal that added some heartiness that filled me up nicely. I'm also not a huge fan of tomatoes, but Uchi manages to make everything I don't normally love into something delicious. Seriously, it's crazy that they have such yummy dishes (like this and the brussels sprouts) for so little! This one was just $5 and came with the most delicious aioli sauce with sesame oil mixed into it.
