Uchi////Great sushi, great staff, great environment.  Had reservations (is a must) for 5 of us.  Still had to wait about 15-30 min.  It was cooler out but they had heaters outside that kept everyone toasty.  We had a few drinks and got seated.  The server was knowledgeable and helped us choose what to order.  Drank Sake and beer, she timed everything perfect.  It is expensive, but if you have the money to blow, this is a great place to do it.  Great dining experience.  Sushi is a bit Americanized by how creative it is, but then again, I have never been to Japan either.  All flavors in the sushi are soooooo good.  I am getting hungry writing this review.
