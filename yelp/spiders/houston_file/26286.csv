The Pit Room////This place is good. It isn't the best Texas BBQ I have ever had but it is good. I had their brisket and sausage, both were tasty. The coleslaw was different and tasty! If going for lunch on a weekday get there around 11 to move quickly through the line. As lunch rolls on this place gets busy. They have a few parking spaces and on street parking.
