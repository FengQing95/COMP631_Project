Kata Robata////My 2 complaints are the middle room,wear they always seat me could use sprucing up. It looks like a facing fast food restaurant for the prices that one pays. More importantly is the hostesses. If you go there, make sure you make reservations. The hostess acts like you are asking for a table for 2 at 10:30 at night New Year's Eve at a 5 star restaurant in NYC overlooking Time Square. I did this twice, at lunch time, and I was dressed nicely with make up and heels, so it was not about looking too casual.
