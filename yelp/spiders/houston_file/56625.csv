Kata Robata////Been here many times but the service sucked this time. The hostess was rude and the waiter made excuses for the dish that was sold out (something about brunch?), said other dishes might also be sold out but didn't mention which ones. I have tried to order the bone marrow 4 times in a row now and it has always been sold out, whether it was a weekday or early weekend evening.
