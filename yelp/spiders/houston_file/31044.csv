The Pit Room////So why not 5 stars?? Well, the prices aren't exactly "great" - although they are reasonable. I am of the belief that a lunch counter style BBQ place could trim a little bit more of the fat (har har) price wise considering the business model. But that's not my main beef (har har again)...a couple times when I've been here, hosting out of town guests the flies and/or gnats in the dining area have been extremely annoying. This is not only unsanitary but it also isn't a good look to be telling someone how great a place is only to not be able to enjoy our meal because we're having to swat at flying insects while trying to eat. One of these two things (price/gnats) I mentioned would be forgivable, however, combined they result in the loss of a star.
