JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Oh ramen, how i will always love you! Of course when I came for the first time I learned just how naive I was when it comes to ramen. First time I came, I got intimidated by the chicken ramen (I thought the chicken looked weird) even though I wanted it and got the chicken wonton ramen instead. Yikes. That was a no-no, even though it was delicious. The won-tons kept falling apart in my dish, but otherwise my noodles were SPECTACULAR! It totally hit the spot!!...and soup almost can never fill me up. My soup had spinach, noodles, the wontons, and other stuff i can't remember since I ate it so fast, it was just so good. This place would ABSOLUTELY be perfect for a cold day. But next time I'm going to get a regular chicken ramen. There are other toppings too so definitely stoked to go for those too. Just make sure to come early, there were people lined up after we left. But in my case I am willing to wait for this cuz this is definitely becoming my fave ramen place!
