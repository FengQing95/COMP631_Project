JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Having lived the life of a single income family with kids, I knew all too well the joys of ramen noodles.. When I was in the USAF, I could buy 10 pkgs of top ramen for $1.00.. It was a small victory that I was able to eat lunch every day for 3 years for 10 cents.. So, I was not too thrilled when my son suggested we go to a ramen bar for lunch.. Well, you can imagine my excitement when a huge bowl of ramen was placed in front of me.. The first thing I noticed was meat!!, and an egg.. Then I rooted around and found veggies.. This was not the ramen I used to eat.. It actually had very developed flavors and depth; I am guessing none of which was from a 'flavor' packet.. I will say I totally enjoyed this and will be back...
