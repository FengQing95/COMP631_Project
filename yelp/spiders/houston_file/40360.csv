Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The ambiance of the restaurant was nice. I liked that they had out door seating . The drinks were great. I had the boss lady. My friends had the good life and one other that I don't remember. The appetizers were great but my main course which was the steak night was way too salty. I could hardly eat the Mac and cheese and green beans. The waiter kindly got me another order of greens but other than that, the food was very salty. The waiter was great . Overall service was great but couldn't give full marks cuz of my entree.
