Uchi////We came here for our 2 year anniversary. My first time trying Uchi and I did not regret it! Sohan was our waiter and he was fantastic! We got the omikase. The dishes that stood out was the oysters and the wagyu. The sushi rolls were okay, they didn't stand out as much as the other dishes. The foie gras was on different level...my goodness. The fried milk dessert was great. We were stuffed potatoes at the end! And shoutout to Sohan for the mushroom crispy rice dish! Will definitely be coming back in the future! Thank you for the wonderful experience!
