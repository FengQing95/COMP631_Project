Uchi////Great food for the fourth time. Unfortunately the customer service is subpar. Oscar acted like he would rather be somewhere else. When we complained about them covering tuna and yellow tail sashimi with a garlic alioli and the small slices, they sent out another plate of a random fish that was going bad. Not thrilled.
