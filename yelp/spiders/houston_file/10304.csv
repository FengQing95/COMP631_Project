JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Out of all the Japanese style ramen restaurants I've been to, Jinya is clearly top tier. Ramen is delicious, and appetizers are mouth watering. Taste is 10/10. The only reason I would hold back from awarding this place 5 stars is the service and ambience. It's crowded and loud, which really disrupts my ramen experience :(. Not really a place for young and old people. This place is for millennials. However, this is a premier ramen destination that won't break the bank.
