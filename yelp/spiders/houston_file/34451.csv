Local Foods////The food here is amazing a caters to vegetarians, vegans, and meat eaters alike. I've had the Market Veggie and Bahn Mi sandwich with Chili, Quinoa, Squash and Barley. The tofu on the Bahn Mi is a little dry but the Market Veggie is as legit as they come. You can't go wrong with any of the sides unless your not a vegetable fan.
