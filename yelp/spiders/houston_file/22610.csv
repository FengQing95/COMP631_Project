Uchi////Hands down, Uchi has the best Brussel Sprouts I've ever tasted in my life. They are Amazing!! I'm not really a big sushi consumer, so I wanted to try other options. I asked for a recommendation from my server and he suggested the Brussels. They even provide the recipe for the Brussels sprouts but somehow I doubt I'll be able to recreate the dish. We'll see!
