Uchi////I love this place. After the first time eating here, I can't find any other better place to eat sushi at. If you don't know how to enjoy food though then I wouldn't recommend it. The Wagyu beef here is divine! The only bad thing I can say is that some of the staff give me a not so welcoming feeling just because I'm young. I feel as though I am not treated with the same manner that they would treat an older customer. My last visit was not that great because our server was just very sarcastic and made me feel uncomfortable. I love this place and hope that I don't get the same waiter next time.
