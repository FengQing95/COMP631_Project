Kata Robata////Arrived for the reservation only to be told omakase was not available. Was told I needed to have spoken to someone (when they don't answer the phone) and that I should have left a message. Also told its indicted online I have to speak to someone for omakase. I scoured the kata robata website and Resy and was unable to locate where I had to speak to someone or that I must leave a voicemail. The manager kept saying how busy they were as if my time calling and reaching out isn't valuable.
