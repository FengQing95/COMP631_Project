The Pit Room////Wow!  Quite possibly the best BBQ I've ever had. I ordered the barbacoa tacos, jalapeño cheddar beef sausage, sautéed okra & coleslaw. The tacos were phenomenal!  I consider myself a barbacoa snob and this was some of the best I've eaten. The sausage was really good as well. The sautéed okra was excellent and the coleslaw had great flavor and wasn't too heavy. My fiancé ordered the chicken taco and it was excellent!  I tried a bit of our friends beef rib and was blown away with how well it was cooked and how great the flavor was!!  We got there 5 minutes after they opened and there was already a line of about 20 people so be prepared to wait....it's well worth it though!  My only complaint is how the line works. It weaves through the restaurant so it makes it very hard to walk around, find tables & get drinks or condiments.
