Uchi////I love this place. Get ready, it stays busy, and is in high demand, take my advice and make a reservation! This visit we tried the Brussels sprouts (again!), Spicy crunchy tuna, Zero Sen, Hama Chili, and the fried octopus. You can't go wrong with these Brussels sprouts, they make you want to lick the bowl at the end, the flavor is just yummy! I even take some of the flavor from the Brussels sprouts and dip my other food items in it! I love the Hama chili, it's such a fresh and delightful taste and I was shocked by the texture of the fried octopus, OMG, it was delicious! I have had fried calamari but this is almost like a blackened form of cooking it so it's totally different and the quality is amazing. The happy hour menu is worth a visit and the drinks are all well thought out. Honestly the food at Uchi, you just can't get anywhere else in Houston, they are smart about their unique menu. While it may not be a traditional Japanese restaurant, it is high end and you can tell that they really care about the quality of the items that they serve. I definitely recommend this for the sushi lover or for people that like trying different things! Â The valet parking is complimentary, do that and save yourself the trouble of hunting a spot down in the crowded area!
