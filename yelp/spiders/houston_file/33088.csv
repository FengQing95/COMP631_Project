Local Foods////I ordered a duck confit sandwich with a side of quinoa and couscous. Everyone had raved about this sandwich to me so I was excited to try it. I'm usually not a fan of cranberry sauce but it complimented the duck so well, I loved it. The sides were great too, fresh. No complaints at all. The service here is really helpful and friendly.
