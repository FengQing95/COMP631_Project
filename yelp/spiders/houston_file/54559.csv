Kata Robata////Another thing, we had called the day before to add a person to our party of 4 and said that we couldn't do it.  The whole time we were there we not only saw empty tables, an empty 6 top was staring at us the whole time.  Third, they were out of bone marrow and UNI which I was dying to try, bummer. THey were also out of hamachi kama yellow tail collar.  So bummer, but I understand they were super busy over the weekend and they order stuff fresh, so I wasn't that upset. I can always come back  =)  Manager was super nice and treated us to the pork belly with 60 degree egg when I voiced my concerns.
