JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////After being sick from what I believe was the Ramen on trip 3 I avoid Ramen like the plague for months, especially Jinya. Then come down with a cold and mind goes back to Visit 1 Ramen and cold brain says, give them one more shot. So I called in for a to-go order, or tried to. Tell the person on the phone I need an order to go, get put on hold very briskly. Second person picks up, I proceed to start placing my order. Second person states in a frustrated tone that she can not hear me. I let her know I was speaking loudly, even though I am in an office setting and she states, again frustrated tone, that it is really loud there and she can't hear...so my own frustrated cold brain said forget it, not worth it and hung up.
