JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The cha-cha-cha bowl states it's for garlic lovers, but it wasn't overly garlicy to me.  I was a fan of the thick noodles that came with this bowl - added the suggested cabbage topping, but wish I would have gone for the brussel sprouts that my friend ordered.  They were AMAZING!
