Uchi////A friend recommended this place for great sushi. Little did I know that I had tried to dine here before (for lunch) but they were closed. It's unassuming from the outside except for the free valet and lot full of pricey cars. My Honda Odyssey didn't quite fit in...so they parked it in the overflow area. This should have tipped me off to the pricing. Make reservations!  It's super busy. I came at 5pm. Opening time. Within 30 min the place was packed. All sorts of different people from stylish older couples, well off hipsters to "ladies that lunch."  I (looking every bit the homeless nerd) immediately felt out of place. Until the food arrived. I foolishly asked for soy sauce. After a friendly explanation that the chef recommends eating the fish 'as is,' and using my hands so I can 'place the sushi in the orientation that maximizes it's flavor.'  So I shoved the fish in my ignorant mouth and 'wow.'  It was good. I was home. In one bite though, I just ate $7.  I was a bit taken a back by the price. I usually get an entire roll for $7.  But I have to admit, it was really yummy. A few dishes later, and we were done. Anticipating serious damage, we got the check. $200. I shouldn't have ordered the tea. Overall, the dishes and experience were great. I'd come back again in a heart beat...if I didn't have to sell my minivan and raid the kids college fund to pay the bill. All kidding aside, it's a great place to take a date and make her feel special on a special night (a birthday in this case).  Thumbs up.
