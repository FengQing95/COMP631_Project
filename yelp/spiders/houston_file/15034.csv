JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Tried Jinya since I've had people recommend it to me but had to do delivery due to COVID times. Ordered a spicy tonkotsu. The selection is pretty extensive however it does feel that the additions are a bit overpriced. Even corn was $1.50 (more depending on where you order). It came packaged well and quickly. The thick noodles were delicious and the broth was tasty. The pork was good but definitely have had better. Â Overall hard to assess definitively on a delivery order, but I would come again.
