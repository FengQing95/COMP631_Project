JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Best ramen place outside of New York. I can't eat pork ramen and I'm not really a fan of vegetarian ramen so I'm restricted to chicken ramen. The best place I've had is Totto Ramen in NYC and honestly this is pretty comparable. The sauce is super flavorful and has a great kick, and I love that you have the option of type of noodles. Get the spicy chicken ramen with the black garlic sauce on the side and you won't regret it.
