Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I came at 5 and was hoping to grab a full meal here, but their kitchen closes at 3. However, one of the staff was kind enough to point us to some good restaurants nearby. I got a cream puff (it definitely had a fancier name) and one of their famed croissants to share. First, the cream puff: the cream inside was heavenly. Cool, lightly sweet, and fluffy, it is the cream of dreams. The dream cream. The pastry is pretty good as well, a bit denser than that of other puffs I've had. The only con is that the large puff is pretty difficult to bite into without the cream oozing out. You'll have to either split it in half or try your hand at sawing bite-sized pieces with a knife. The croissant was superb. The outside is crunchy, the inside is fluffy, and the whole thing is deliciously buttery. It looks massive, but it has tons of airy layers, so it's not too big to consume whole if you're hungry and the perfect size to share with a friend.
