The Pit Room////Now for the food itself - it was Good. And there was plenty of it. I got the loaded chili with a side of pulled beef and I must say it was Delicious. There was so much of it that another person and I could easily have had our entire meal together. I did end up giving my friend the leftovers from my meal to enjoy for lunch the next day. The potato salad was delicious according to my dinner companions and the brisket was a hit. The corn on the cob with fixings on it also appears to be a hit. The pricing for everything was extremely reasonable!
