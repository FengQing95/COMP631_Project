Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This was my second time here and while the food was good the first time the wait wasn't. We waited an hour just to get a table then after half hour waiting to get waited on I asked a waiter passing by if we could order. He went to see who our wait person was came back said he would take our order      This time it was just me so I went early 6:30, walked in sat at counter and immediately was greeted by May and service began. So if you don't want to wait at all I suggest going early. I definitely will be back of course an early morning time. The atmosphere was awesome too. Played a lot of the songs I grew up on brought back good memories.
