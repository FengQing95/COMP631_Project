Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Came here with the family for after dinner desserts and found some incredible pastries.  The macarons were flawless, with a smooth and chewy cookie that didn't shatter when biting it, and a well filled, light and tasty filling.  My older daughter had a strawberry passionfruit pistachio sponge pastry that she gobbled up, and my younger daughter had a fantastic pastry with a chocolate crust, apple filling topped with a coconut cream and covered with a perfectly torched meringue.
