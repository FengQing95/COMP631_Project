Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Excellent! I had the Bosscat drink to start and I think it's my new favorite whiskey drink! The food was amazing. We had the Bosscat burger with chefs choice and Mac n cheese with French onion twist. Yum!! And I had the poblano soup. Amazing! Service was fantastic. Omar was our waiter and was great!!
