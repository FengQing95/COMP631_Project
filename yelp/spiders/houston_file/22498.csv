Uchi////Dear god... why the hell do I keep finding myself at this godforsaken restaurant. I came here thinking maybe it will better than the one in Dallas...WRONG. This place is f$&@n ridiculous. I can't believe they served me endives in a glass cup with ranch dipping. Since when the hell did omakase/sushi = endives and ranch??????This place really needs to f$&@ themselves. If I ever end up at this restaurant ever again I'm cutting my tongue off with a butter knife before I put anything in my mouth.
