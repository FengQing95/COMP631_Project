Baby Barnaby's////Today I attempted to go to this restaurant and there was a 15 minute wait at 9:15 am. I asked for coffee while I waited. They refused. I asked if I could get it in a to go cup. They refused. I asked if I could pay for a to go coffee. They refused. I could not have a cup of coffee until we were seated--15 minutes later. I don't know what kind of breakfast establishment would refuse to sell a patron coffee while they waited at 9:15 in the morning but it is clear that they don't care about their reputation or value customer service. It is clear that you have to wait 15 minutes just to get a cup of coffee. So I went to Brasil instead and got coffee much quicker and with much less attitude. My two friends that I was there with and I plan on never returning to Baby Barnaby's.
