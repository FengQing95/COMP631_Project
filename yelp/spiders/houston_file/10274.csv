JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The location is in Midtown, and there is a free parking garage to the side of the block. The exterior and interior are both really modern and nice. There are tons of seats available, compared to other ramen restaurants. I came on a weekday during lunchtime, and the hostesses and waiter were quick to accompany me and my party.
