Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I don't know why it took me forever to try this bakery out but I finally made it. I came in just to pick up some sweets aka Â perfect bite size macaroons for my office. I picked up an order of 28 total. Now I wish I would of tried some of there food items but i had lunch already. I will say seeing what other people got the food did look amazing. Ok back to the macaroons they were good and fresh I will say that.
