JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Broth: The broth was creamy, rich, and seasoned to perfection. I can eat salty, but nothing ruins it for me more than food that is over seasoned. The temperature of the broth was PERFECT. Not burn-the-roof-of-your-mouth hot, but hot enough to be able to slurp away cause you're hungry af. Ask for the free garlic. That extra kick will make a difference in your broth.
