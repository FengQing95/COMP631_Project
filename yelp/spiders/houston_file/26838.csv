The Pit Room////This place is completely awesome!  The food was amazing!  My bf and I shared two of the two meat meals so we could sample the pork ribs, beef brisket and beef sausage!  Can I just say YUM?!?!  The sausage was reminiscent of an old school BBQ place my parents used to go to in the Bay Area.  By far my favorite!  The ribs and brisket were so tender and delicious.  And the BBQ sauce was on point!  And then there was the vibe....this seemed more like a locals joint.  Super chill.  Absolutely loved everything about this venue.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!
