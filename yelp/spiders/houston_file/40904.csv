Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I want to start by saying the only reason why I gave it a 5 star is because our server Jacklyn went above and beyond to make my experience better, I just lives off her energy. Food wise it was a 3/5 and I'll tell you why. I've never in my life ordered something and return it. I also don't like giving servers a hard time, but I gave her my feedback after she asked me how was it; my response was the Shrimp & Grits I ordered was not good at all. Usually if I don't like it, I'll probably just take it to go & probably never eat it or have them trash it.
