Kata Robata////For happy hour, I've gotten the spicy tuna and the spider roll. I was so incredibly impressed by how fast they both came out. I feel like the sushi chef was secretly right behind me waiting for me to say my order out loud so that he could quickly conjure up two rolls. Not on the happy hour menu but something I highly recommend is the bone marrow. Bone marrow is typically quite rich, but here they also provide some salt, pickled onions, pickled mustard seeds, a lime, and some toast for your bone marrow. The waitress suggested that we order extra toast because a lot of people end up with extra marrow and not enough toast. I'm not sure if that is actually the case and my boy friend and I just like to pile on the marrow, but we seemed to have an excess of toast to marrow. Regardless, it was succulent and delicious and worth the $14 (which is actually a pretty good price). I've also tried the ox-tail ramen, and it was pretty good but nothing to get too excited about.
