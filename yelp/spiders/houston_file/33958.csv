Local Foods////I walked in and thought to myself wow I Â love the ambience of this place. Next I said to myself where do I go? Once I finally found the place to place my order the cashier was super nice. I ordered the duck confit, housemade chips and the kale. It was all about a 6 out of 10 pretty good but not great. Just above average.
