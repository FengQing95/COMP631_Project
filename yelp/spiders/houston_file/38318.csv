Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The chilaquiles was pretty good! I tried my friends, and I think putting that on top of the breakfast tacos instead of the "pork belly mix" would have been a better dish. I heard the burger was good, but nothing special. The fries are pretty good though. I love how crispy they are!
