The Pit Room////The beef rib was really fatty and rather bland. We did not finish it. The sausage was dry and tasted pretty old--we didn't finish this either. I thought the cole slaw was dry and did not have enough flavor--it was just like bitter greens, and the mac and cheese was very bland. We left just about everything behind except for the brisket. Brisket was good. As a side note (and I'm just saying this because I found it pretty weird), this place doesn't make corn bread. Instead, your meal just comes with a big fat slice of white bread. We weren't interested in that, but I was just so surprised that this was a BBQ place with no corn bread. It felt like a staple was missing.
