JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Since it was so late and I was alone I went with the Tonkasu Ramen. If you are looking for a porky thickish base this isn't it. Â It's decent but I prefer a more flavorful broth when I go with a Tonkasu Ramen. I do appreciate the fact it wasn't salt laden as so many seem to be lately. The pork chatsu was good. Cooked well, and thinly sliced. I also, ordered a side of the ground pork which was well spiced. The seasoned egg was hard boiled which I also didn't care for since I prefer mine soft boiled. It's not my favorite bowl of Tonkasu But it hit the spot.
