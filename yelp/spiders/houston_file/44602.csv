Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Coffee is incredible. I am putting 4 instead of 5 stars for 2 reasons. No free wifi during peak hours hours and Â No gluten free pastries except macaroons which are not made In a gluten free environment. But wow! Great place and nice atmosphere. The lunches look pretty amazing. No free wifi until after 2 I guess to not encourage people to stay during their busy lunch period?
