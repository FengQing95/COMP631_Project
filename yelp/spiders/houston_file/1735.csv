JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////AMAZING ramen. I much prefer it over Tiger Den in Chinatown. I don't crave it often, but the black ramen (the most popular) is rich and delicious. I can't wait to come here more often when it's cold outside in the winter. There is often a short wait when I come here but it's worth it to me.
