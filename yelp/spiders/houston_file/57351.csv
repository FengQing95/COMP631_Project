Kata Robata////We got karaage blue crab from the daily specials menu, and pan seared iberico pork with ginger soy sauce, nagasaki chanpon ramen, and chef's sashimi for 2 from the main menu. Our waiter also gave us grilled oyster mushrooms on the house. I loved everything, especially the karaage blue crab and the sashimi. Sadly, there was only crab left for the day, as I was surprised by how tasty a small fried crab could be. The sashimi was incredibly fresh and flavorful. My favorite was the barracuda.
