Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Fantastic atmosphere, completely mediocre food. I had a walnut chocolate chunk cookie, a vanilla macaron and a decaf espresso, none of which were noteworthy in the slightest. I arrived late in the afternoon, so they were out of all croissants. I would be willing to come back and try them, as that would be the real test.
