Kata Robata////The only knocks I have on the restaurant are that service can sometimes be spotty (wait staff may not show up for 10+ minutes; I once spent *15* minutes waiting on a check; had a sushi chef ignore me for several minutes while he kept finding prep work to do), and it can be very loud sometimes. I've been seated solo next to a large (8 top) table with stereo kids screaming at the top of their lungs TWICE! Wouldn't suggest going for Sunday lunch if you're not in the mood for that.
