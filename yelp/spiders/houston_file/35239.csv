Local Foods////I was looking forward to coming here, because I had heard great things. I came at about 2pm on a Saturday and it was busier than I thought it would be. The sitting situation is tricky. You either are able to get a "private" booth table, or need to share a long table space with other people outside your group. We were able to sit at a booth table, although it felt like we were at the same tables as the other people on either sides of us. This is not a place to hold a work meeting, have an even semi private conversation, or a quiet one at that. The tables are so close together that you will find yourself trying to talk over the conversations on either side of you.
