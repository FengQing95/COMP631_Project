The Pit Room////We got the wagyu rib, burnt ends, and all three sausages.  We had plenty left over but no regrets.  I'm not really a beef rib fan and prefer brisket but the rib was delicious. The sausage was really yummy and I was a big fan of the potato salad.  The line wasnt very long on a saturday and they have plenty of seating next door at the patio.
