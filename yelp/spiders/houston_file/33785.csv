Local Foods////With such high hopes from the gleaming reviews I was sorely disappointed by this place. Local Foods definitely gets high marks for interior decoration and ambiance. Most everything in here looks super hipster and cool.. unfortunately they should have hired an equally proficient chef to design the menu.
