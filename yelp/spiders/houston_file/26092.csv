The Pit Room////The pit room is always delicious! Be warned that after an Astros game that fans flock here from all around and there could be an "astronomical" line but it's worth the wait! My favorite thing is the pulled pork taco or the beef ribs, but everything is delicious! You can also take your food next door to the bar to sit and watch any sporting event you choose! Definitely the best BBQ in town.
