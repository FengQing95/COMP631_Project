Local Foods////Working from home with kids being in online classes with different lunch times , had no time to cook so wanted to give this a try. Paid $39 + tip for a salad and a sandwich. Not a all a good experience... salad was not fresh , stale leaves and sandwich was small and no where near what I imagined based on pictures online :(,
