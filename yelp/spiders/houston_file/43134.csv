Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've only ever really been here on a weekend for brunch so there's always no where to park and a huge line, but the line usually goes pretty quickly (they have their system down to a science) and the food and drinks always come out quickly. Everything is always delicious; we usually eat our dessert/pastry first while waiting for main courses to come out, but for not being a full service restaurant I think it's a little over priced.
