Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////So, I'm not a real vegan but this has to be the best vegan anything I have ever had. The mushroom that's used as the protein is packed with a lot of flavored and the texture is still meaty. The bun is soft and has a nice outside crisp to it. I'd take this over a real burger any day.
