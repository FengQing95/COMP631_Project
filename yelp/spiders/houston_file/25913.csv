The Pit Room////I live right behind this restaurant, I can throw a rock from my parking and hit the building, that's how close it is, and I've been exactly twice. Why? A two meat bbq sandwich, coleslaw, beans and a soft drink is $22!   That is ridiculous. Is the food good? Oh yea! Is it $22 a person good? Nope!  My suggestion: start selling bbq stuffed potatoes and do a "locals" discount like el real does on a certain day of the week. If so I'd be here every week.   Final note: They have BigRed soda on fountain kinda rare to find and always awesome.
