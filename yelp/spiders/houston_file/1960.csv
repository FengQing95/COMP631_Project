JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Driving by this place, I was afraid it was going to be super crowded because there were people waiting outside the door for seats. However, the hostess said it would only be a fifteen minute wait, so we decided to sit it out. The interior is cozy, and we were seated at the bar; our waiter was quick to serve us drinks and take our orders. I ordered the Cha Cha Cha, and my father ordered the Tonkotsu Assari -- while he was afraid it would be spicy, our waiter rightly assured us that it was not. The soup and the noodles were delicious, and while the meat was very tender, it wasn't as flavorful as I had necessarily expected. The portions were relatively large, and I was extremely full by the end of the meal. It took a while for us to receive our check, but that wasn't that much of an issue. Overall, the food was a little pricey for ramen, but tasty, and I would come back here again.
