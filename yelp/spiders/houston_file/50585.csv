Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Loved this place for breakfast when I visited my hometown. Prepare for a long wait if you are going there during weekend breakfast or brunch time. I assume it may also be pretty busy during the week. We waited about an hour to get our table at 11am on a Friday. Luckily there is a Starbucks within walking distance, so we spent our time catching up there. There is a small parking lot, so parking may be difficult. We ended up parking in the neighborhood and walking over.
