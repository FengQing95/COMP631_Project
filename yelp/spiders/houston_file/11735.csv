JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Howard - Thanks for your review. For the Tonkotsu Assari, we use about 1/4 teaspoon of ginger paste to 1-1/2 cups of broth. We don't often hear that the broth is too gingery, but in the future, you can easily request that the chef not add ginger to the soup. Also, regarding the pork chashu, it's possible the chef didn't fully separate the two slices of chashu meat, leaving them double-stacked. But if they made the mistake of only adding one piece of chashu, we strongly encourage our guests to let their server know so it can be remedied immediately. I hope you try us again and perhaps sample another ramen that might better suit your palate. We greatly appreciate your patronage and are pleased you tried us out.
