JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This was such a tasty meal! The prices are normal for a ramen restaurant, but the ramen was DELICIOUS! I had the Tonkotsu Assari, which had pork broth, chasu, kikurage, green onions, and seasoned egg. The broth was the right amount of flavor. I never liked kikurage before, but here I enjoyed it! The seasoned egg was my favorite part. It tasted like they carefully seasoned each egg. I ordered the thick noodles, and it tasted like quality noodles.
