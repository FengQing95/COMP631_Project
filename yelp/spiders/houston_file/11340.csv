JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I looove Jinya! The spicy chicken ramen is my fave and pretty much the only thing I've had there. I think I had a lychee martini once that was sub-par but no biggie. There is a weird smell sometimes but I just write that off as a part of being a ramen bar...? Anywho, if you're in midtown and looking for a cheap, yummy, and filling meal, look no further.
