Uchi////We went for the soft opening so we were fortunate enough to get to try many dishes and I have to say we loved them all. I love their unique spin on everything. It is definitely a place you want to take someone you are trying to impress. My favorite was the Japanese style nachos and of course the fried milk for dessert. Its worth checking out. Don't listen to any bad reviews.
