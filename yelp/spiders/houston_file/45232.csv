Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////One of our favorite places to cool down and grab a cup of iced americanos for me and my bf. This place's interior is designed modern and chick quite suitable for girlfriends to chat over sweet things or even couples to wine dine their date night/day. They stay open as late as 8 or 9 so you don't have to worry about having no where to go for your late night sugar rushes coming your way... or is that just me?
