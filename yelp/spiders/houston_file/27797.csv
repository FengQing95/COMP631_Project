The Pit Room////The Pit Room: The Pit Room is an excellent example of a great/wonderful BBQ joint that you can find near the Galleria. I would 100% say that if you want great quality barbecue then this is your best bet if you not in the Heights near Pinkerton's or Gatlin's (which are about 4 miles apart) or in the south near Killen's (which takes my top spot for city BBQ but that's a whole other review).
