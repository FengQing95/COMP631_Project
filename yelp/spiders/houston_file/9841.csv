JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place was really good! My friend and I shared the spicy creamy shrimp tempura & the pork gyoza which was absolutely delicious! Then I had the spicy chicken ramen which was very good, but the chicken just needed a little more flavor. Also ordered the lychee drink and it was refreshingly good. Will definitely try this place again!
