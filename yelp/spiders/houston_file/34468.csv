Local Foods////I got the Duck Confit (completely sold by the awesome cashier) with a side of soup. I don't remember the soup but it was good-- started with "Winter." I read a lot of disappointed reviews about the Duck Confit but I actually really fell in love with it. But I also had no buildup as, like I stated, I came in pretty iffy about sandwiches. However, 8:30AM-5PM without eating an actual meal means eating anything so I went with it. I also really like duck so maybe I'm biased. The Mintade is really tart so be careful and put in ice!
