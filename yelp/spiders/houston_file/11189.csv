JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Although it's a chain, this place never fails to satisfy me! One bowl of ramen is always incredibly filling so I never really order much else however when I'm with a group, we love to get the karaage to share at the table just because it's so fresh and tasty! If you're not feeling in much of a soupy mood, opt for the rice bowls. Just as yummy!
