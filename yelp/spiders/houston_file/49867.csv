Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the huevos ranchos with veggies (3/5) and my husband ordered the corned beef hash. I don't eat red meat so I'm not sure how his food was. We also got one upside down pineapple food pancake to share which was a 5/5, very delicious & moist. My portion was huge & came with 3 eggs cooked to your style- easily enough for 2 people to share. Halfway through my dish I was ready to pack up the rest but I saw a hair on the bottom of the dish. Â We mentioned this to the bartender, along with the ridiculous wait time for our food, and our food was comped (minus the one Bloody Mary I paid for prior to starting our food tab) & we received a card for one free pancake. I was disappointed. I left not taking the free pancake card. We tipped the bartender well despite our experience. We won't be back.
