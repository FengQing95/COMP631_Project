JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////"Tonkotsu Black" was very tasty in the soup and the thin noodles was not as chewy as the thick noodles in the Cha cha cha ramen.  The soft boiled eggs were flavorful and runny in the yolk; gotta love those eggs!  Both curry and chicken chashu rice were good; yet, the latter option had made a better bang for the buck as the rice bowl came with diced chicken, minced pork stew, spinach and half an egg over white rice, and the sauce was sweet and full of flavor! nom nom nom
