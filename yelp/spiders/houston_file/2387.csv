JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////What's nice is this place is in a very nice building, with a free attached parking garage, and their prices are more than reasonable to me, inexpensive even given the level of quality. I'd strongly suggest you go before they raise their prices, nothing is over $12-13 which to me given the location is impressive.
