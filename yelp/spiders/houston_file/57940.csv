Kata Robata////We ordered a lot of other different items but the Texas Kobe beef skewers also deserve a special shout out. It was so tender and full of flavors and just melts in your mouth. It comes w 4 cubes but so worth it. Wish I've taken more photos of the food but we were too excited to eat the food.
