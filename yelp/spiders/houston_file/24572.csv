Uchi////Instead of babble on about which dishes I had in the two times I've been here (soft opening and post opening), I would like to say Uchi is one of a kind in this area of the country.  I know it's different than what you're used to.  I know there are no TVs.  I know it's pricey.  But you know what?  It blows most every Japanese restaurant in the central U.S. out of the water.  It may not be authentic in a traditional sense, but the fusion creations emerging from Tyson Cole's kitchen are a wonder to experience.
