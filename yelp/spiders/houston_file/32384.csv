Local Foods////Shrimp & Crab, Truffle Egg Salad, and even Banh Mi.  The only one I would highly suggest keeping a sandwich form is the egg salad due to it's soft texture.  Your salad is soft, the egg salad is soft.  There's no crunch to eliminate the monotony of eating this dish.  Also - my friend turned the duck sandwich into a salad today.  I hope you like your arugula!  Or maybe ask if they can toss some spring mix in ... personally I cannot eat that much arugula in my salad!
