Baby Barnaby's////Love coming here for breakfast after a long night of work! Everything is delicious here. I've never gotten anything that I didn't like. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is always really sweet. My absolute favorite though is their green eggs. Pure perfection. Their potatoes are always so perfectly fried and crisp. They stay hot and crisp up until I finish my meal, which is so rare. These other breakfast joints should take notes. The people that work here always know how to put a smile on your face. Overall, this is a cute little gem that I wouldn't mind going to everyday!
