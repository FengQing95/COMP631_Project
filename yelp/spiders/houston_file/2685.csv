JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Robin - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry you felt your noodles were underdone. We serve them al dente as they will continue to cook once we drop them from the boilers into the hot broth. If you're ever unhappy with how your ramen is served to you, please tell your server and he or she will remake your bowl or offer you something else. Thanks again.
