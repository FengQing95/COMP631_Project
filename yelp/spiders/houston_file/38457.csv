Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We ordered the cornbread Madeline's and the pimento cheese plate to begin. They were both good selections . We then ordered the chicken plate and the avocado salad Â with a side of Mac and cheese . All were good selections as well. I would return with a bigger group next time .
