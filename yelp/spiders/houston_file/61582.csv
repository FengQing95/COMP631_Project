Baby Barnaby's////Services were mediocre. My friend said there was a stain on her cup so we asked for a new one. The cup never came even after we asked the waitress a second time. We also asked another waiter to take a picture of all of us since it was my friend's birthday. He said he would come back but he never did. We overlooked the service because we could tell how busy the place was. Overall, everything went well and the food was delicious.
