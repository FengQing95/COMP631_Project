Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The staff is always, always very friendly and accommodating. During one visit, I asked to be moved inside because there were some bees hanging around my table. They were able to do so swiftly, even with a wait list. At another visit, I received the wrong mimosa. The waiter comped the wrong mimosa and waited until I was 1/2 way done with it to bring out the correct mimosa. Which reminds me, they have some fun mimosa and Bloody Mary options. Yum!
