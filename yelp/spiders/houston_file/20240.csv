Uchi////6.  Spicy Crunchy Tuna Roll (3/5 rating) - Nothing special about the roll in my opinion.  I tried it with the sauces they provided on the plating and it didn't really pop off for me.  Prob the only thing I had that I was kind of disappointed in.  Ended up eating it with soy sauce and wasabi.
