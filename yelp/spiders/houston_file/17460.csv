Uchi////we decided to do a blind tasting since most of us had never been before and we were feeling very overwhelmed on what to oder. so basically in a blind tasting the chef and your waiter do the picking and they just keep bringing out food for you until you telling them you are getting food. we tried A LOT of food.... seriously at least 10 dishes... every dish we had was great. there was not a single dish where we left food on the plate. my favorite had to be the walu walu. its a meatier fish that came in this hot stone bowl with the most delicious sauce... omg i could have eaten it for days!! we requested that our last dish they brought out be a dessert dish. he came back with Â the fried milk... obviously and also brought us this lemon ice cream with pistachios dessert and told us it was on the house. seriously the staff here is so friendly!! it's always makes the dining experience that much better when they have good service. we also split a bottle of sake which i thought it was going to be one of those baby bottles.. yeah no it was pretty big. we barely finished it by the end of the night. With all that, I thought when we got our bill it was going to be outrageous because from what a lot of my friends have told me... yes uchi is amazing but it was also break the bank... well our bill came to be around $250. okay obviously thats not cheap but i was expecting something MUCH higher. we all ate to our heart's content and we told the waiter to stop bringing us food bc we were full not because we were worried about price. Can't wait to go back to uchi and do another blind tasting. Definitely the way to go!
