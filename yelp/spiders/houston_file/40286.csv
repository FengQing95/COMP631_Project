Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place was phenomenal all around. I chose this for my birthday brunch and one of my friends was running late and our server was so understanding! He was still so attentive knowing we weren't ready to order til she got there. One of the reasons I chose Bosscat was because of the Fruity Pebbles French Toast. It looks so full of life and colorful! I loved every bite. Along with that, we got the donut burger and the pulled porked benedict. I'm all for sweet and savory so this meal couldn't have been more perfect. The donut burger was my least favorite though and I don't think I'd order it again.
