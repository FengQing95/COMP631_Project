Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I should be working but I just woke up from my food coma after eating at Snooze this morning, Â like 8 hours ago and had to share with y'all how happy it made me. I've been to the Snooze in Denver and was thrilled to see one opened in Houston. The lines were outrageous there, we waited almost 2 hours to eat in Denver. NO LINE this morning @ 7:30AM on a Friday (probably because it was 7:30AM...). We got breakfast tacos that were on point, our waitress brought a tray (yes, a TRAY) of hot sauce selections out, and they were really good. Only minor comment about the whole experience is I'm going to need them to step up their tortilla game now that they're in Houston. We have entirely too many fresh tortillas in this city for someone to bring some mediocre fresh tortillas to the table (shout out El Tiempo, shout out Ninfa's - the original, obviously, shout out HEB, etc., etc., etc.,).
