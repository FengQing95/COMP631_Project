The Pit Room////I had the two meats , pork rib and sausage with the potatoe salad and macaroni and cheese and everything was great the macaroni was perfectly cheesy just added a dash of pepper and salt the potatoe salad was delicious just should cut up the potatoes more . The meats themselves was awesome no complaint ! I highly recommend this place ..
