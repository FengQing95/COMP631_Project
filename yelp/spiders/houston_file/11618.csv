JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////All of the ramen that I have had was very tasty and quite substantial. If you come here, make sure to differentiate the ramen that has the thin or thick noodles. For me, I prefer the thicker noodles, since I like the bit of elasticity and chewiness that is a bit lacking in the thinner type noodles. The broth, while good, tastes almost like it is made from a paste instead of slowly boiling down the bones and other cuts of meat.
