Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Despite the menu looking like it could have everything anyone could want; the food was just bad/lack luster/not worth ever having again. I ordered an omelette with 3 fixins, and pancakes...you'd think I'd have had a feast. Nope. The eggs were as undercooked as they'd be in Europe, but eggs here aren't safe eaten that way. I took one bite, and knew I couldn't eat the omelette. So, I tried a bite of the pancake, and it tasted of only one thing - pure, saturated, sugar. There was no flavor, just sugar. I literally did not eat my meal at all. I wouldn't touch it. And this is the first restaurant ever to CHARGE me for food I did not eat, and found disgusting. I literally had one nibble of each plate. My boyfriend ordered the breakfast burrito. He loves breakfast burritos more than any food in the world. He too, did not like his food at all, but ate half of it.
