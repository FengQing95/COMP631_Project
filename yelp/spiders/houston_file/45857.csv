Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Such a cute bakery in the Montrose area! On a good sunny day, there can be a line out the door because the bakery goods are that yummy! When you walk in the restaurant, it's like walking into a magical land with a clean looking interior with pastries lined up on one side and coffee makers on the other side. I was overwhelmed at first because I didn't know what was at the end of the pastries line and didn't know what to choose right off the top of my head.
