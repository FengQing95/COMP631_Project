JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////While we may fundamentally disagree on the subjective nature of what makes a good bowl of ramen, I know we can agree on this: In the great state of Texas, Houston is fast becoming the epicenter of excellent, authentic Japanese ramen. And with more ramen-dedicated shops opening lately and more looming on the horizon, Houstonians now have more choice when it comes to Japanese ramen, and that, ultimately, is a GREAT thing.
