JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Overall, I think JINYA is deserving of 4 stars in Houston. It satisfies a periodic crave for a rich, porky bowl of ramen, albeit at a premium price. Truth be told, if there was more competition in the ramen department in the Houston area, JINYA would not be top of the pack. Since there aren't too many other spots, though (Tiger Den comes to mind), JINYA is a decent spot to get ramen in Houston; just don't think about how much you paid for a bowl of noodles afterwards.
