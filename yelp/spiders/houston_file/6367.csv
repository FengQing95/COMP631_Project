JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the chef's special spicy miso tonkotsu, served with thick noodles. A spicy miso that was actually spicy! Yay! The broth was very flavorful and creamy, which definitely made it more filling. The pork was cut into pieces, but was still very appetizing. I added a soft-boiled egg to my bowl, which I thought was cooked to perfection. I didn't think the portion was huge when they first brought it out, but I could barely finish and had to force myself to get to the bottom of the bowl! The other bowls we ordered were Tonkotsu black and the spicy miso umami. I got to try a bit of the Tonkotsu black and I thought the broth had a very delicious and unique taste! Mmmm.
