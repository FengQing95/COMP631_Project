Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is amazing, definitely not overrated. The food is delicious, whether you go for something sweet or savory. Yes there is almost always a wait, but if you can go on a weekday between the before-work-breakfast crowd and the lunch crowd, it's not too bad. I have ordered the breakfast burrito both times I've been and it is huge, very filling, and great flavors. I've also tried a few of the pancakes and the flavors are unique and delicious. I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu
