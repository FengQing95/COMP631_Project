Uchi////Uchi is one of the best places I have ever eaten in my entire life. The food is indescribably amazing. It is not like other places, nothing like we have ever had before. There is a reason this place is always booked up! We were so excited to go we decided to do the chefs tasting menu, because why not?! It was so fun because it's 10 small courses and all surprises.
