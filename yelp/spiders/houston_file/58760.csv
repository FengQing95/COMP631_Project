Baby Barnaby's////I specifically called the evening before to find a pet friendly breakfast place at 10:30am on a Thursday bc I was taking a friend out for her birthday and needed to take my dog to an appt afterwards in the area. I thought Barnabys would be great bc it loved touting itself as pet friendly and was supposed to have great food. Since I was visiting from out of town, I called a few Barnabys locations to make sure and was told that Baby Barnabys would be open for breakfast and was dog friendly.
