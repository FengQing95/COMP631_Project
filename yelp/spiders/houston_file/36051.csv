Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Based on previous reviews/write-ups I have seen my expectations were pretty high so perhaps that is why I would say it was "OK". I was not blown away by any of the dishes we had. I would have preferred the Cornbread Madeleines to be warm, but the Huckleberry sweet cream butter was delicious. My friends had the Black-Eyed-Pea Sandwich and Bosscat burger along with a side of fries (a little on greasy side). They said it was "pretty good" but would not come back for. I had the Eat Slow with salmon. Again it was ok...salmon portion was on the small side, but I was fine with that b/c i was saving room for the Red Velvet Churros...which was my biggest disappointment. Â Very dry. On the positive side, the drinks we had at bar before dinner were nice and the service was great.
