Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Just left this place. Â It's very chic & inviting the employees are nice. I got the breakfast ham& cheese sandwich which I DID NOT like. I would've expected it to be warm, not cold! The sauce inside is not very tasty either. The latte and pastry I got were good though.
