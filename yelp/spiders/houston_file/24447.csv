Uchi////I was also frustrated by the whole ambiance. I like a laid back feel but this was too casual. Even though they knew we were celebrating they sat us at a tiny table in between two large loud parties with barely half a foot of space between each table. If I were to go back I would definitely request a booth. I wore a nice cocktail dress and felt overdressed especially when two guys wearing T-shirts sat down next to us. It made me feel like a 30 year old boomer for sure.
