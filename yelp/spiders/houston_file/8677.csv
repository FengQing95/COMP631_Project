JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The cha cha cha ramen was interesting in that it had pork and fish broth; the flavor wasn't too fishy and the balance between the broths was good. The spicy chicken ramen tasted light and was okay. The broth for the jinya tonkotsu black ramen was amazing! Rich, aromatic, layers and layers of flavor...I liked how for most of the ramen - you can choose between the thin and thick noodles. I highly recommend the thick noodles!
