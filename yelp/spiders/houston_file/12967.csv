JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I went to Jinya in a Thursday night. I've been there a few times before and I always dreaded having to wait because they don't take reservations and there is almost always at least a 30 minute wait. However, there was no wait when I came on Thursday. I ordered the pork chashu rice bowl. I got the small version at the recommendation of the waiter that it was a good portion size. However I wish that I had gotten the regular because the small was a bit too small for me. It came with an egg and spinach. I really liked the sauce on the pork chashu. Some pieces of the pork chashu was really fatty but overall it was really good. The service was very quick: the food came out fast and it was very easy to split checks.
