Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The waiter, whom was nice enough, did not greet us for over 10 minutes. We probably wouldn't have noticed if anyone bothered to acknowledge us, or at least signaled a busser to drop off water. We placed a drink order for waters and coffee and I had ordered a Bloody Mary. We get our water/coffee, but I don't get my Bloody Mary, and we still do not have place settings, or anything to stir our cream/sweetener for our coffee. Waiter comes back, it's obvious by now that he completely forgot my Bloody Mary, I don't bring it up because our coffee was getting cold and we still had nothing to stir with and focused on getting silverware, which he still
