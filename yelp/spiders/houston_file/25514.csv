Uchi////We made a reservation here and it was my first time! I don't know if I would come again, but it was definitely an experience. The people here are so nice and so attentive. Our server, Muk, especially treated us very well. She's so nice and knows the menu well and what she likes to recommend. I can't remember what we ate, but the small dishes had such unique flavors. I loved the pear and fish one with these somewhat white crackers. All of the fish was so fresh. My favorite piece was the uni, probably the best uni I've had! My bf really enjoyed the king trumpet mushroom nigiri. I wasn't really a fan of it, but he really enjoyed the texture! It is pricey, but I really love the atmosphere. Such a cool interior design and clean bathrooms!!
