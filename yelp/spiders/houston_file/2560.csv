JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Isai - Thank you very much for your review. Personal preferences for ramen, as you know, will vary greatly and widely, and JINYA will never be all things to all people. But I still very much appreciate your kind words regarding our food and establishment and hope to serve you again in the future.
