Baby Barnaby's////It's a restaurant in a cute little house, so it has a very warm feeling. I like the California vibe inside with all of the points of interests up on the wall. There is also seating in the patio, which is nice when it isn't too hot outside. They usually have complimentary coffee outside, and this is great on days when there is a wait (usually around 30 minutes max). It is definitely worth the wait though. They are dog friendly too.
