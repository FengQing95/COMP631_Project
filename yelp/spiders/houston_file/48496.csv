Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've never had better Mimosas or service from anywhere and being a born and raised Houstonian, I actually tried this chain in Denver for the first time and it holds the same standard city to city and obviously state to state. Chef Gordon Ramsey should check them out. If that's impossible all of their employees deserve recognition for the way they easily connect with guests no matter their race or what they're dressed like.
