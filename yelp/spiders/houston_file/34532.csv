Local Foods////This was a great lunch spot while in Houston.  I can tell it's popular which is typically a good sign.  It was packed at 2pm which is after the lunch rush.  The food felt very fresh and wholesome compared to most options around.  My wife and mother in law enjoyed their lunch as well. Solid spot for some healthy eats.
