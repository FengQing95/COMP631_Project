JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I usually start off with their takoyaki, which is awesome. It's so full of flavor and a decent portion for an appetizer. Careful though because it's really hot when you bite into it. I've also tried the crispy brussel sprouts, which were also excellent. My go-to entree is probably the spicy chicken. The problem with a lot of ramen places I've tried is that the broth is way too salty, but this place has got it down. The noodles are not too al dente or too soggy as well. Service is usually good here, and the food has come out fairly quickly every time I've gone here for dinner.
