Uchi////First off, I only came with my boyfriend but of you plan on coming with more than four people... Don't. I saw a party of 7 miserably trying to squeeze in a booth while one of the men was falling of the edge of the seat. There's probably about one table that could accommodate a larger party so I'd make reservations for that.
