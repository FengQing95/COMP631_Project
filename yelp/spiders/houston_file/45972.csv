Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The pastries - oh my.  I'm not a very sweet breakfast/pastry person, so I haven't tried a lot, but their croissants are heavenly. I've tried the regular, almond, and pistachio and you can't go wrong with any of them.  The crust is that perfect combo of flaky and chewy, and the fillings are delightful and taste as if they are made from real ingredients.
