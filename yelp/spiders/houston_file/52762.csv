Kata Robata////in This sort of place  you would think they would have good food and quailty service right? Wrong! The food was VERY sub par for the price and the sushi smelt and tasted awful. I got sick after eating there. I know my way around sushi/sashimi/rawfish etc and like a fool I ate there and paid the price.....all night puking and wishing for a swift demise. you suck kata robota im going to fukuda next time i want fish  ugh or kobe is good too .
