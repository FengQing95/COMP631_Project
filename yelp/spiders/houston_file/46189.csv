Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I finally made it to the infamous Common Bond! People always talk about this place as one of the best bakeries and a good study spot. Well I'm going to throw in my 10 cents and say that this is probably one of the worst study spots because it gets so crowded and loud. I've never not been here when there's a line out the door so yep. Unfortunately I've yet to try their entrees, so this is a dessert review.
