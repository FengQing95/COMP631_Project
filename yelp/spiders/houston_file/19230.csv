Uchi////- Brussels Sprouts. I love brussels, no matter what, but these are undoubtedly the best brussels sprouts I have ever had. We even bought their book of recipes JUST to try making these at home. In fact, we recently dined at a gastropub in Miami where they were clearly trying to replicate this dish. They failed.
