Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This was my first visit and I absolutely love this place. It's a cozy brunch/bakery/cafe. I ordered a fresh fruit tart and a cappuccino. I highly recommend the fresh fruit tart and I'm amazed how they make the design in the cappuccino. I ordered the salted caramel, raspberry, birthday cake and lavender macaroons to go - for a party. At the party- They disappeared- as quickly as I put them out on the table. Needless to say they were a hit!!!
