Local Foods////One of the cashiers recommended mixing your mintade (orange, lemon, mint, grapefruit juice) with one of the teas, to create an Arnold Palmer.  This was a great tip, because it was really good.   I drank at least two glasses and would've gotten more, had I not been so full.  Overall, I loved the citrusy-taste interacting with my meal.  Local Foods is definitely a go-to place when we are looking for fresh sandwiches that are of the farm to table variety.  Love keeping everything local!
