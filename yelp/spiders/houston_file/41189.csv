Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The eggplant comes and it's deep fried to the point that you can't tell it's eggplant. There's a sauce drizzled on top that is somewhat off-putting. A really disappointing replacement to the salad I had ordered. At this point I would have rather just had a refund (not that I was offered one). We had a few bites of the eggplant but most of it went to waste. All in all an extremely unsatisfying lunch. At least my husband was kind enough to share his sandwich with me. When a waitress came by to clear our plates, she asked how it was, and I said "it was fine," not really wanting to get into it with her, since she hadn't been waiting on us. She said, "are you sure?" and I explained what happened. Her response was simply "oh, sorry, wrong day I guess." I kept trying to give these people a chance to make it up, before causing a stink, but they couldn't have cared less about our clearly sub-par dining experience.
