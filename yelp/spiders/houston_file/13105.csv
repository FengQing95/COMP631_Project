JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My friend and I arrived for dinner early Saturday evening (around 5), so we had no trouble getting a table. I ordered the Tonkatsu Assari Ramen and he ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen, plus Japanese curry with rice on the side. The curry was delicious, which got my hopes up for the ramen.
