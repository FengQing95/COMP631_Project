Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I opted for a couple of chocolate chip cookies, another chocolatey cookie, and macaroons in pistachio. chocolate, vanilla, and salted caramel.  The salted caramel was my favorite, but all of them were excellent.  They had just the right amount of sweetness, and fluff.  The chocolate chip cookies though were the real star.  Immediately at home, I grabbed a cold glass of milk, and childhood memories immediately ensued.  That's when you know you have a good dessert in my book, when it takes to back to memories like that. The place itself has all kinds of backed goodies along with tarts, and eclairs.  They have a fairly limited brunch/lunch menu, outdoor seating, and seating inside that has long banquet style tables.  Service was friendly, and helpful.  My main complaint, is the horrible parking, and it is fairly pricey.  $3.50 for a cookie, yikes.  4 cookies, and a group of macaroons was $40.  Super cute place to study (although loud) grab a cup of coffee, or dessert date place.  A great addition to the neightborhood.
