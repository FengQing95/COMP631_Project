The Pit Room////Two reason for the three stars. #1 the food was cold. I think everything would taste 10x better if they can keep the food warm. #2 since it was our first time here, we werent sure what to order, the menu is way above your head so we keep stepping back to see the menu. And the guy cutting the meat was noticeably annoyed with us. If they can have the menu placed where the dessert menu is. Would be much easier to order.
