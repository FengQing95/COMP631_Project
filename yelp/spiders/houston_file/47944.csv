Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Finally got to snooze for a mid-week breakfast date with one of my besties. They did not disappoint! I was previously deterred from going because I would often pass by during peak brunch hours on Saturday's and see the insane line. However, today we went in and were immediately able to sit at the bar which was awesome. I ended up getting the snooze breakfast which was 3 eggs any style (I ended up going with soft scramble and adding in garlic spinach and cheddar cheese yum!), your choice of meat (bacon, duh) hash browns and your choice of toast but I made the most epic decision and traded my toast for a sweet potato pancake that completely changed my life. I'll never look at pancakes the same. I mean, pecans, GINGER butter! There were even small pieces of sweet potato you could see when you cut into the pancake. They were light and fluffy and airy. From the first bite, I knew I'd be back. I didn't get a chance to try a mimosa or a Bellini but the menu looked awesome. I can't wait to go back !
