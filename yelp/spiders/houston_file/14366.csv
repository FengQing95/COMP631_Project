JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food here is delicious and I love that they have vegan options. This location currently has a vegetarian ramen but if you ask for it with thick noodles instead of thin egg noodles you can make it vegan. I wish all the add ons weren't so pricey, however the ramen bowls include a lot in them already. There are sauces and spicy paste on the tables that you can add to your ramen too if you want to change up the flavor a bit.
