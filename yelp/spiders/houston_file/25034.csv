Uchi////My go to for any occasion that needs celebrating. You will be so well taken care of at uchi by the staff and the chefs!! I have done omakase 2 times here (would absolutely recommend for an awesome experience). The omakase (about $120 per person) is good if you aren't to picky and don't want to have to figure out what's good on the menu. If you need sushi suggestions they will definitely give you advice. My personal favorites are the blue fin tuna, red cornet, sea bream, and striped jack fish! A great time to go is during happy hour for !!!sake!!! and rolls are a good price. Other non sushi favorites are the brussel sprouts and the rabbit (you will be surprised, it's so good! Melts in your mouth.)
