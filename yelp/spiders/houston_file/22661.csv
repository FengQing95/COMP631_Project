Uchi////The quality of the food was outstanding. The dishes were all so innovative and creative. Each dish is carefully curated and really pairs together surprising ingredients you would not expect but go together beautifully. Very well done compositions and plates of art. Service was also great. Our server was so kind and brought out the complementary dishes for us based on what she thinks we would like when we were deciding what to order. She was also very well knowledgeable and explained the menu to us well. Thanks to Anja.
