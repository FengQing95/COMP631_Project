Local Foods////On the other hand, my friend ordered the banh mi with kale and quinoa. Oh yes, you have to try the quinoa too! (I feel like I'm just saying try everything, but whatever. I liked the food I tried that much.) But the meat in my friend's banh mi was different than those in the picture posted on here. On other yelp pictures it looks like normal banh mi meat, but in his sandwich it was more of pulled pork. I don't know if it was a special or anything that day (I could just be wrong and they always have a pulled pork type of meat in their banh mi.) But we both agreed the sweet tasting pulled pork was the best part of the banh mi. Who would've thought pulled pork or whatever would be good in a banh mi? Props.
