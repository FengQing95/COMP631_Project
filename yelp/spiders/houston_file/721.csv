JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've heard great reviews about this place and being a ramen lover, I decided to start my own journey with Jinya. I have to say that out of all ramen places I've been to in Houston, Jinya was the most memorable. I love my ramen spicy so I ordered their spicy tonkotsu with extra meat. The broth was savory, spicy, and had such deep flavor that I loved. I like how their soup does not taste greasy because the other places I went to had that greasy aftertaste. The noodles were cooked just right for me with a bit of that chewy texture. I also tried their appetizer called crispy shrimp ball, and I enjoyed it as well. It was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The taste reminded me of a Korean snack called saewookkang (which means shrimp cracker). I will definitely be eating here again!
