Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////While our server was friendly and informative, the hostess didn't seem to deal with multitasking too well. She just had to greet and walk us 10 feet to a table. Instead, we got ignored for a few minutes before she acknowledged our presence, ignored us a little more with a to-go order she was preparing, and then dropped us off at our table. Our food also took quite a while to make its way out of the kitchen, and it wasn't packed--there wasn't even a wait. I can't imagine how they handle the crowds at peak times.
