JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Their green tea mochi had an overwhelming flowery taste. Literally. If you had asked for a random piece of mochi ice cream (cut up into 4 pieces) and they told you to guess what flavor it was, you would've guessed it was suppose to be some sort of rose mochi that was dyed green. It did not taste like green tea at all. I'm glad I did not order it and only had a piece of my friends. I would NOT HAVE BEEN HAPPY.
