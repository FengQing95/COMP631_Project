JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love the ramen here. It's not too fatty like other places and the broth flavor is AWESOME. I haven't ordered their dried ramen yet but as far as I heard from my friends, it tastes pretty good, definitely give it a try the next time I visit here. I love the restaurant's decor, especially their community table is a good concept.
