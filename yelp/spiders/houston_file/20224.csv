Uchi////Great food and great service. Hardly ever has spots for reservations on Open Table app. We usually go on week days. Even when they aren't busy they like to send you on the patio to wait a while and order a drink. I guess they like to make it feel a little exclusive as if you can't just walk in and be seated even though there are several open tables in sight--funny... Once you get past the hosts and to the patio and table, service and food are great as expected from all restaurants this tier in Houston.
