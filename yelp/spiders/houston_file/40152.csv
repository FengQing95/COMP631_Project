Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The hostess kindly accommodated our big group on Mother's Day even though we didn't have a reservation. We had an amazing experience from the beginning at the bar all the way till we got seated. Everyone enjoyed their food. Bosscat has a variety of food selections. For the people with a sweet tooth in the morning the fruity pebble French toast is the way to go. The smokehouse Benedict is amazing for the savory lovers.
