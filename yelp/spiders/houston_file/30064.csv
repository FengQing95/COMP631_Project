The Pit Room////I got the 2 meat dinner option which comes with 2 sides, except that you can't get the beef rib option with this deal. I got the brisket and pork ribs with elote and string beans. My bf wanted to try the beef rib so he got that and paid extra for 2 sides : Mac & cheese and string beans.
