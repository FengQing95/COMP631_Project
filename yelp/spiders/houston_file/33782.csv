Local Foods////Local Foods is one of my go-to lunch spots! I am absolutely in love with their pretzel bun and will always substitute it on any sandwich I get there. The crunchy chicken is one of my favorites and so is the truffled egg salad. Their lemongrass chicken soup is always on point, but sadly not offered year round. I highly recommend this restaurant! It's super cute and perfect for a date or for hanging out with friends.
