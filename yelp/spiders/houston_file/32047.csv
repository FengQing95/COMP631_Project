Local Foods////Local Foods is by far my favorite lunch place in Houston and whenever I come in town I INSIST on going. First off, the aesthetic is so modern and trendy. Very colorful and light. More importantly however, the food is so tasty! It's the perfect combination of healthy and delicious. Everyone in my family gets something different and loves their meal. My brother is vegetarian and they have lots of options to fit his dietary restrictions. I always go for the crunchy chicken salad, with kale salad and homemade chips. I feel like I should venture out and try other things but then again I love what I get so much! The homemade chips are perfectly crunchy and seasoned. The sandwich is pretty big for me so I generally take the other half to go and eat it the next day and it holds pretty well. My family also does take out from local foods for lunch quite a bit and it tastes exactly the same. It doesn't get soggy or lose any of its freshness when doing takeout. Also, pro tip, the mintaid mixed with sprite is amazing!
