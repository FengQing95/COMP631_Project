Baby Barnaby's////Cute place!  They had us sign in at the front on a Sunday morning.  Very cheery environment and crowd.  Food came exceptionally fast with an abundance of potatoes.  nice and crispy. My bf had toast that came with his entree and when he asked if he could change it to French Toast (that was off the menu) they accommodated that for him.  Thought that was a nice touch.  Fast,  friendly , accomodating service.  Well be back for sure.
