Kata Robata////The ramen is some of the best I've had. The broth is so flavorful. It has the right amount of fat and pork flavor but still was light. We loved the freshness and brightness of the sushi. All of it was top notch. Some of the best Houston has to offer. They are too rated for a reason. Service was great. Sushi came out fairly fast even though there was a full house. Can be pricey but the fish is extremely fresh and not always the typical pieces you get at other sushi restaurants in town.
