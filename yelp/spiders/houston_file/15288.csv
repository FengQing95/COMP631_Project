JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The service has actually got better. When I first started going there 5 months ago, the service was always sub par. The reason why is because they felt that I wasn't going to tip. Maybe because I look really young. I'm always generous when it comes to tipping because I work at restaurant. After several times I wrote my critique on their receipt, the services has actually changed. So I am satisfy. The food there is amazing.
