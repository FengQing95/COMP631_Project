Uchi////The staff here is warm, kind and funny...wish I  remembered their names but I would request the same two servers over and over if I could.  They even brought us out a dish on the house as we were celebrating an engagement.  I wish I could make friends with someone here so I can get a reservation whenever I wanted.  I'd book a flight instantly just to eat here and fly back!
