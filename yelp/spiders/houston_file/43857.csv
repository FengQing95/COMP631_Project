Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Their croissants are like nothing else.  Totally worth it!  They take quite a few hours to make, so when they're out, they're out.  I do love a good coffee too.  And they make a mean cup.  It's always busy here and sometimes it's hard to find somewhere to sit, but it's a great spot to meet up with old friends and new friends.  I will be back for the croissants.  Bright and early.
