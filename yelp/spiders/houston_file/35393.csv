Local Foods////It was my first visit and the lady taking my order was helpful in sharing some of her favorites. I decided on the avocado BLT; and chose the kale salad and house made chips(great seasoning)for sides. The sides were pretty good but the sandwich was really amazing. Get extra napkins because it is overflowing with ingredients and great flavor!
