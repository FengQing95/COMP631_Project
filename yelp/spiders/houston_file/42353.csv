Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Heeding the advice of those who say it's super crowded on weekends - because lines and shortages only compound the misery of pre-breakfast, pre-caffeine, bleary-eyed morning grumps - I stopped by Common Bond this morning on my way in to work, thinking I would surprise my coworkers with delicious pastries beyond their wildest imaginings.  That is, until I discovered they were $4 a pop.  Sorry coworkers!  Perhaps I'll bring you some Shipley's someday.
