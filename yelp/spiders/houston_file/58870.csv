Baby Barnaby's////Reasons to nix one star: surprisingly slow for breakfast service, waitress forgot about my OJ, and lastly, barnaby's may not be at fault for this but we had decided to go originally because it has been touted as a dog friendly place. They seemed hesitant we when said we had dogs. Luckily we had two quite little dogs. Just a note!
