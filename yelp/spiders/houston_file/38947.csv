Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I had small bites of the chicken fried steak (which is massive) and the fruity pebbles french toast in addition to my short rib chilaquiles. The gravy on the chicken fried steak had a depth of flavor I had never tasted in that type of dish, almost gumbo-flavor like (which sounds odd but it was good). The fruity pebbles french toast was amazing and combined novelty with taste; even though it seems kind of gimmicky the cereal imparts this nostalgic sweet flavor to the toast. Highly recommend. I did also enjoy my chilaquiles, although to me the fruity pebbles french toast was unique.
