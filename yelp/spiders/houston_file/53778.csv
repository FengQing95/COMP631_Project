Kata Robata////When we were asked by Chef how our meal was, one person in our party said it was 'ok' and it garnered no response. A more 'matured' lady sitting next to us looked mildly chilled and he rushed to turn the A/C off for her. For a $200 tab, I don't expect you to roll out the red carpet but come on. You serve food here. You should care if your customer said the experience wasn't anything but great.
