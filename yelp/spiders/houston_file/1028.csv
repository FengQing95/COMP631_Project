JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had heard a lot of people say that the portions were huge, but I finished my bowl with ease. I would have probably liked a larger bowl, but I have lived my entire life in Texas, so .. take what I say with a grain of salt. Also, I can't complain about portion size with prices as low as they are at JINYA. I will definitely be back - the HOT ramen with the cold, refreshing sake was an outstanding combination.
