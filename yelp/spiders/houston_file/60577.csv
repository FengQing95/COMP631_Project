Baby Barnaby's////So we get there on a Sunday and of course there's a crazy wait. There should be. This place is legit. So when we're finally called in I've already decided what I'm getting: Green eggs. Scrambled eggs with spinach, artichoke hearts, and jack cheese? Hell yeah. Sign me up for seconds! My best friend sitting with us tells me to get the biscuits instead of the bagel. Listen to me when I say this. Get. The. Biscuit. The meal also came with this amazingly delicious and mouth watering apple chicken something sausage. HOLY HELL. YES. Breakfast potatoes were also legit.
