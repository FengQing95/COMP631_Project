JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The waitress that was serving us either was having a bad day or something because she was so rush in everything. The restaurant wasn't particularly busy in my opinion as I read some yelp reviews saying there was long lines, in the contrary we didn't needed to wait (which was the only good thing I guess) she seemed a bit pissed for some reason and just giving slight attitude. But hey I came for the food right so I am okay with bad service
