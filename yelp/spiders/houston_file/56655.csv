Kata Robata////Came here for my 21st birthday and it was definitely memorable. The food was amazing, portions weren't the biggest but were enough to savor and enjoy what I ordered. We had the Kakuni, yakitori, agedashi tofu, pork belly buns, cod, uni sushi, and beef skewers. I'll be more explicit on the ones that made the most impression on me.
