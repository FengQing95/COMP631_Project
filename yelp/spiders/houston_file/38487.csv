Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////After I posted my original review, one of the owners reached out to me and asked if I could come back to re-experience Bosscat as my original experience he stated was not representative of who they were. I realize first impressions sometimes aren't accurate, so I took him up on the offer and was able to try one of their new brunch items and a few other vegetarian plates and beverages.
