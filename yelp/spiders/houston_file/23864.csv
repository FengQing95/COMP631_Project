Uchi////The food was a m a z i n g!!! Every entr√©e was done with respect for each flavor and had certain flavor combinations that worked extremely well. We had the 10-course omakase for ~$100 and was just blown away by the quality of food. We also ordered additional sushi's/sashimi that was very tasty and had high quality fish. I would do an sushi-only omakase when I do go again to this restaurant. Service is exceptional. Our server had great recommendations for us.
