Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place has a pretty corporate vibe, and the coffee was just kind of meh. My son loved the hot chocolate there, though. My german pastry was above average. The little tarlets looked beautiful but we did not try them. An okay place, but surely there are better options in a place as big as Houston. We tried three different coffee shops and really didn't love any of them. Weird. San Antonio has better coffee. Sorry Houston.
