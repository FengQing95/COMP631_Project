Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Where to start? It's so damn good! I had a pancake flight: blueberry, pineapple upside down and a sweet potato with pecans can't recall the name. Amazingly tasty, light, fluffy great accompaniments and really light but tasty syrup. I also had a latte which made me do a happy dance. My friend had a plain pancake, hashbrown, and chicken sausage, she was quite pleased. Her favorite thing was the apple juice which concerned us at first because it was yellow, made fresh from figure apples, it was the best she'd ever had, and she's an apple juice expeet. Love presentation, the speed of delivery, and the service. The wait was a little over an hour to be seated, but I like that they text me to let me know when it was almost time so I could return to the area. Can't wait to return!
