JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////When we did get seated, we got a fantastic waiter who was efficient and friendly so kudos to him! I got the tonkotsu spicy ramen and it was ok to be honest. I've had better ramen places and this kind of ranks at the bottom for me. The flavor wasn't that rich or strong and because of the way the bowls are shaped, the serving portion is smaller. I will say the spinach noodles are good as I got the chance to try some from a friend's plate.
