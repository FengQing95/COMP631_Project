Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came in for dinner last night for dinner and loved it. Â The set up is perfect with lots of tvs so you can catch multiple games with good music. Best whiskey selection I've found uptown. I love how well the staff is trained. Our waiter, James, was on point with the food and whiskey. Will def be back!
