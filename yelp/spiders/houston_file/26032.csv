The Pit Room////I am very satisfy with the food. the place is very popular Â for a reason. I would say its the best place BBQ brisket I ever had. but the menu posted at the Resturant is in some way hard to read and they are kind of pricy I paid $39 for two meals . I thought it would be cheaper in place like that. If you ask me if I would go back again, I will see YES
