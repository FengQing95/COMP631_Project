The Pit Room////I had the two meat dinner (brisket and pork ribs) with macaroni and cheese and roasted corn. The corn and macaroni were great, but the stars of the show obviously had stage fright. The brisket was overly fatty and flavorless. No real bark to speak of. Kind of rubbery. The ribs were also flavorless but I did like how they had some bite to them, they didn't fall apart or fall off the bone. That's just a personal preference.
