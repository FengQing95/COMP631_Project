Uchi////I would give Uchi 5 star because I love EVERYTHING about this place but they have made some changes recently. I went to uchi a few weeks ago and was surprised to notice that the ham and egg roll and the fried milk recipes had changed. Don't get me wrong, they are still great however I'm a "if it's not broken, don't fix it" kind of chick. Anyway, the service is great, the atmosphere is on point, and the food is to die for. My favorites: Brussel sprouts, hamachi nabe, hotate, wagyu hot rock, ham and egg roll, and fried milk. You're welcome!
