The Pit Room////As I pulled into the parking lot there were two vehicles and wondered if they were opened.  After taking photos outside of the sign and wall art I walk in see a crowd. I guess they parked on the other side, walked or ride shared.  I stood in line for a few minutes staring at the menu on the wall.  Decided to order the usual taste test, 1/2 pound of brisket and pork ribs. The menu had other choices like bbq sandwiches, tacos, and chili. I was next in line and told the butcher I wanted 1/2 brisket and funny he thought I meant an actual 1/2 of brisket not 1/2 pound of brisket. It was a first for me.  Anyway got potato salad and macaroni & cheese as sides, and bread was included.  They serve beer too but a little to early for me.
