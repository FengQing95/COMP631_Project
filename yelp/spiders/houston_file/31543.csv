Local Foods////I picked up the red potato salad which was made with red potatoes and also covered in a chipotle-style red sauce. My fiance got a shrimp and crab sandwich which she said was one of the best sandwiches she's had in Houston. Since this restaurant focuses on locally sourced ingredients, the sandwich was definitely fresh.
