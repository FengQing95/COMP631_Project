Uchi////We also got the karaage - fried chicken thighs with this spicy glaze on the outside, served with pickled veggies.  So delish - but they definitely have some heat.  I like spicy food, so it was perfect, especially when eaten with the cool pickled veggies (cauliflower, carrots, etc).  But the hubby couldn't finish his share - more for me!
