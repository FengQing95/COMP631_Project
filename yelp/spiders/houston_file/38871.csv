Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I experienced a few issues while visiting here for the first time. The waiter seemed to very occupied with every other table except for ours.  We had a party of five and some were indecisive about what they wanted to order and did ask the waiter questions regarding the menu. This action seemed to further ignite his disdain for our table, as if to state, " how dare we ask questions about the food we are going to eat and pay for."  We started with mimosas, and they were not appetizing so we asked to replace the mimosas with other drinks, those drinks were worse than the mimosas in my opinion. We ordered the pulled pork appetizer and it was unseasoned. One of the persons in our party had a salad and added shrimp to the salad and the shrimp were severely undercooked. The fries that we ordered were also cold. When I went to get the waiters attention to see if he could rectify the situation he became very dismissive and began speaking to me in a very disrespectful tone and using his hands. After this encounter, because at this point I felt he was being physically aggressive and using your hands to speak in a professional setting is just beyond inappropriate, I asked for the manger. The manager did come but it honestly was too late, and the damage had been done.  I don't think I have ever felt so disrespected while attempting to patronize a business.  I asked the manager that he please not come to my table. The service was terrible on top the food I don't think I'll ever return.
