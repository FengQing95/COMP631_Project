JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I feel the need to update my review after my first experience. Service was atrocious last time around but I must of just had a bad apple because it was a total 180 this time around. Checked out Jinya for the second time with two friends. The waiter did a great job taking care of us and answering any questions we had about the menu.
