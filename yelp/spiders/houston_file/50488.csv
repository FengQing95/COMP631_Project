Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////A few weeks later I ran into a couple servers from Snooze at a coffee house down the street. I creepily approached them and asked something like, "You guys work at Snooze, right?" (Perfectly normal, perfectly acceptable. They were wearing Snooze t-shirts. It's their own fault). I tried to get the skinny on when I could show up to this place without having to wait in line and got the most vague, inconclusive response from them both. One of them said, "You should be fine if you come on a Wednesday". He also explained that the wait time should decrease when they start opening up new locations. I thanked them both for their insight and surrendered.
