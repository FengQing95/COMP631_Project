The Pit Room////Kind of a long line but relatively quick because they don't have much of a menu list.  Pulled pork smelled funky.  Sauce had too much vinegar (made me cough) and was too spicy (overwhelmed the sweet).  It's a good attempt at a sauce but it's not real southern barbecue.  Pricey for one sandwich with no sides.  I might try the beef but never was a beef fan.  Beef kind of smelled sad and depressing.  People seem to like it but I was very underwhelmed.  You can get better barbecue (pork) in the Deep South.  Texas focuses too much on beef.  Also, the bathroom line is long.  Once inside, you discover that the sink doesn't work very well and is rusty very badly.  Soap dispenser takes forever to dispense soap.  They have two bathrooms but both were occupied all the time.
