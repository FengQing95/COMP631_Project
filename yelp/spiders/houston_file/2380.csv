JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So I may be a little over excited as this was my first ramen experience. Needless to say it was awesome.  Really you could give me the broth and a few seasoned eggs and I'd be good. But at any rate I had the spicy Tonkatsu, I'd get it again in a heartbeat. It didn't come with a seasoned egg so added that for $1.00. Should have done myself a favor and ordered a dozen. The par boiled yolk was perfect. Two slices of pork with fat rendered  to the consistency of butter...ah hell yes.  The only thing that would have made this meal better is if I had a hangover; as its spicy pork laden broth would have been an instant cure.
