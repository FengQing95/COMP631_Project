JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Best ramen in Houston. But Tiger Den is a very close second, so whichever you prefer will depend on your tastes and how much you're willing to pay. For me, Jinya takes it with better broth, noodles, and chashu pork. The two are really in a league of their own here, and so I'm only going to write a comparison with Tiger Den.
