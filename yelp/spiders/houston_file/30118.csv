The Pit Room////Went in the afternoon the line was relatively short. Overall this place has decent BBQbut all the sides are amazing. Got the 3 meat:(brisket, pulled pork, and venison sausage, plus the beef rib. Venison was a little dry but Â the brisket was good. The beef rib was a little salty and kind of pricey. Our sides where elote, and green beans. There is plenty of outdoor seating on the patio. Overall I would come back if I am around the area.
