Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////There's a reason why Common Bond always has a line to the door.  Their pastries are to die for delicious and their seasonal savory menu is always delicious.  I won't dive into that menu since it's constantly changing so I'll stick to the classics.  Almond croissant and chocolate chip cookie.  That's really all you need to know.  Also, since they've opened they have also stepped up their coffee game a ton.
