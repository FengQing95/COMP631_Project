JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Overall, I really enjoyed all the flavors in the ramen. I loved the amount of toppings they had available, and that they offered button mushrooms as opposed to just the woodear. But dang, like others have said, additional toppings really add up at $1-2 each. I spent $17 on a single bowl of ramen. I also tried their gyoza and shrimp tempura...both were all right. They don't offer the almond pudding/fruit dessert I saw all these pics of on yelp, so that was a bit disappointing. But, I would come back! It's definitely a great place to have in Houston for ramen.
