Uchi////This is a dining experience like no other that I've experienced and if you haven't been I don't want to ruin it for you. The menu is simply flavor nation, the options are very unique so I had to ask tons of questions and the waiter was so helpful and made great recommendations. Everything we ordered was incredible. The deserts were very unexpected because Jesus was in the kitchen preparing the deserts!!! DIVINE!!! Fried milk....LORD... The fried milk....
