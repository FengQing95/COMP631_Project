Kata Robata////For Starters: I have been meaning to try this place out since it was listed as #2 on Alison Cook's Top 100 Houston Restaurants list, so my boyfriend and I decided to go for our anniversary dinner. Seeing as that it's the new year, we're trying to eat better. So, we braced ourselves to only allow one fatty or fried dish and to try and stick to sushi. We ended up making reservations, of course, and it was so packed when we arrived. We had to stalk people in the parking lot to ensure we could get a spot within the same shopping center. The hostesses seemed pretty frazzled when we arrived. Even though we had reservations, it took a good five minutes before we were sat. It's a Friday night, so I can understand why it was a little hectic. The decor was modern and the lighting was dim lit, but the restaurant was a lot smaller than I expected. Nonetheless, we were seated in a great corner booth.
