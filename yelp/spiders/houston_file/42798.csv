Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been to CB many times for dessert and breakfast, and finally made there for dinner. It was excellent! Had the crunchy salmon and it was cooked perfect with a delicious sauce. The veggies with wild mushrooms that accompanied the fish were scrumptious. Â So pleased with the meal I wanted to encourage other yelpers to check out the dinner service at Common Bond.
