JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Everything here is wonderful. The apps are all very tasty but you are here for the ramen and it doesn't disappoint! The broth is so flavorful you could put an old shoe in it and I would probably not even notice! We came at 11am on a Saturday and there were just a few tables filled. By the time we left at 11:45am the place was totally filled with a wait, so come early!
