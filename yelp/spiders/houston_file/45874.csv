Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I ordered the lox tartine for breakfast which I loved. There were tons of salmon on it and the sunflower bread was a very interesting a delicious twist. My boyfriend got something that I can't remember but he said it was extremely good and filled him right up. The drip coffee was excellent and the vibe is very relaxing and inviting. I am so glad we were able to try this place!
