JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jaelyn - Thank you for the great review. I'm glad you gave us a try based on our Yelp reviews. We serve all of our toppings on the side for two main reasons: 1) If our chefs make a mistake by adding a topping to the wrong bowl, we don't have to remake the order, which would cause unnecessary delays, backing up service considerably and 2) Customers can share if the toppings are served on the side.
