Uchi////What's there to say that hasn't been said? This is my favorite restaurant ever. It never disappoints and always tastes out of this world. . We love the happy hour and sitting at the sushi bar while dining on $6 rolls and $3 sakes. Just get there early-we usually get there at 4:45 to ensure getting a table. Ham and egg roll is out of this world. We got the gyu Kare last night and I almost cried, it was so good.
