Kata Robata////Loveeeee the seafood sashimi salad. Kata has really fresh fish at a great price. I've eaten here on several occasions with friends. Try the Caribbean roll. It has mango inside. If you eat here, please come for the sushi only. I tried items other than sushi the other night. Those dishes are mediocre. I had the seabass that was on top of rice. The fish and the rice was dry. Also had the yakisoba. It was very bland. Â However, I'd say their sushi is top notch!
