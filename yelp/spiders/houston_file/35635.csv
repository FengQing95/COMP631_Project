Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place was amazing! The service was excellent and our waiter Jeremy was very attentive and gave us the best recommendations. We got the barbecue chicken flatbread and the pulled pork hushpuppies for appetizers - wow, they were amazing! The mustard sauce that comes with the hushpuppies is a must!! For entrees the table ordered the kale Caesar salad with salmon, the avocado chopped salad with chicken, the Cajun brick chicken, and the shrimp and grits. Everything was delicious!! Will be back again lots to explore the rest of the menu. Definitely a must try! Can't wait for the brunch menu.
