JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Overall we had a great time and will venture out our comfort zone to eat here. The reason i cannot give this place 5 stars is for the sneezing guest next to me, our food basically coming out all at once which made it difficult to enjoy the meal without it getting cold as quick as it did, and my chashu was very scarce. Reviewing the images on yelp made me feel like Jinya tricked me as my two piece of chashu, even though delicious, did not add up to even one of the piece in the images I've seen.
