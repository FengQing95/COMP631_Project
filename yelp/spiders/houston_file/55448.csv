Kata Robata////One of my favorites for ramen in Houston. Weird, I know. It can get packed on the weekends but generally getting a reservation isn't too difficult. I always get the spicy miso ramen with an extra ajitama. They have several varieties so take your pick. And if you like Japanese cheesecake, their green tea cheesecake w/ red bean ice cream is awesome. So fluffy and soft. Definitely a good choice if you're in the mood for Japanese.I love sitting outside in the enclosed patio seating. It has A/C and it is a little more quiet than inside.
