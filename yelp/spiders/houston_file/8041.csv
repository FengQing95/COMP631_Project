JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Never been a fan of ramen but I was thoroughly impressed. Ordered the Jinya No. 1 (Tonkotsu Black) and added corn.  Broth was delicious and just right -- not too salty and not too heavy -- flavorful and just right.  My favorite part was the seasoned egg -- I highly recommend adding an extra one if you love eggs -- it was cooked perfectly!  I prefer Jinya over Tiger Den, even if I've only been to Jinya once, hah!
