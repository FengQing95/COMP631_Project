Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My husband is vegan and it's difficult to find vegan breakfast options around us. Snooze has an amazing menu and they can make almost anything for you vegan or substituted. We've mainly sat at the bar to avoid the wait and we've had outstanding service. You can't go wrong with anything on their menu. You must try their Pineapple Upside Pancake - it is amazing. Wait times can get to 1 1/2 hours or longer depending on what time you get there/day of the week and how large your party is so be prepared for that and even they have a parking lot, it gets really packed.
