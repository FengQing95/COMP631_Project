Uchi////Zero-Sen Roll - tried this my third visit and love it! Also a plus that it's on the happy hour menu. It strangely is really refreshing and cleanses the palate well. You never expect to find shallot or cilantro in sushi, but they made it written. Leaves you feeling light and ready to chow down more!
