JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Melinda - Thanks for your review. Ask any restaurateur and they'll say the same: No restaurant is perfect. But we do our best with what we have. In the coming months we will open two more JINYA outposts in Houston Â in Katy and Willowbrook, so hopefully that might alleviate some of the crowding at our Midtown location. Thanks again.
