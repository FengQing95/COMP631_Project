Uchi////-Brussels Sprouts (should be $6, but we got it for free!): After telling our waiter that it was our first time (as if they didn't know...with all the squealing over the adorable menus and taking 30000 photos of everything), they sent this dish out as a "welcome to Uchi" gift!  Might have been partially because it was free, but holy crap these were the best sprouts I've EVER HAD!!!  I love sweet foods that aren't dessert - these were perfectly roasted and doused in a very sticky sweet soy sauce flavor. Recommended even if you have to pay for them!
