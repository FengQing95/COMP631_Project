Local Foods////Basically everything is good. Fresh, flavorful, and filling! Currently, my favorites are the Asian Chicken Salad and the Gulf Shrimp and Crab sandwich. The sandwiches come with 2 sides, pick the kale and the homemade potato chips (sooooo good). And try the soups! You can substitute the 2 sides for a cup of soup. In the winter, they have a chicken lemongrass soup that is to die for. But the other ones are good too.
