Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I came here on Saturday morning with a friend for a coffee date, and boy is it packed! Parking is minimal; most likely you'll find yourself parking on the street during busy hours. The line was quite long, but luckily it moved rather quickly for my friend and I. The interior is very nice, clean lines and modern design.
