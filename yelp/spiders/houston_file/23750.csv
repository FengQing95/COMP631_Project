Uchi////I've heard mix reviews of Uchi Houston and only been to the one in Austin so, contemplated going here but I'm so glad I did. Service (5/5) Ambiance (4/5) Food (5/5) but if I had to rate something negative, it would be the price (3/5). It was a bit on the pricey side but worth it for a special occasion and if it's not on your dime.
