Uchi////So on to why I'm having to rate my favorite restaurant 4 stars. I noticed quite a few menu changes the last two times I visited and they were not for the better. Off the top of my head I already know the uchiviche, ham and egg roll, chicken dish, and fried milk have all changed. The ham and egg roll is now disgusting, it tasted like a mushy egg pickled vegetable roll with really no pork flavor at all. The waiter also did not bother telling us that the roll changed when we ordered it or mentioned anything when he noticed we had eaten every last bit of every dish except for that roll which had only 2 pieces missing. The chicken dish is still pretty good with the addition of rice and lemongrass/garlic but the old chicken (OMG) was soo moist, and flavorful and topped with this delicious green sauce. Probably my favorite chicken in the whole world. And the fried milk has shrunk to half the size with only one scoop of ice cream and no chocolate mousse cake thing at the bottom.
