JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Expect to wait if you are with a party size bigger than 2. The seating area is very limited as there are a few booth tables (some limited only for 2 people), a bar, and two big tables in the middle to sit community style. I've had the privilege of sitting at the community table and it's pretty cozy... especially if you're sitting next to a lefty. Â
