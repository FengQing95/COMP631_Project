The Pit Room////I need to go back to The Pit Room again. I enjoyed everything. I would have never guessed this place had been open for only two weeks. I want to go back with a bigger group so we can sample more of the menu. Who is in? I forgot to order the homemade chicharrones. I still regret it today. Considering it is so new, I need to stop by one more time before I truly make up my mind on The Pit Room. So far, so good.
