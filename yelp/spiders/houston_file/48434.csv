Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////over rated. its cute and everything but the servers are kinda rude and seem like they have better things to deal with. I sat at the bar which was very cute and ordered the breakfast pot pie. it was cold and made me sick because its soooo rich. The aesthetic was on point as an old fashion diner but the prices are defiantly NOT old fashion diner prices.
