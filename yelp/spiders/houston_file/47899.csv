Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I don't understand why people say it's pricey, because you will pay the same for this delicious food as an ihop... so not sure why a 11-15 is pricey to them (coming from a college student) I was greeted nicely by the hostess, took a seat at the bar and was also greeted immediately by the bartender, she was prompt and took my order, the food took a while though, but the margarita I had was pretty good and strong! And my food was very delicious! Will come back again, fortunately there was no wait for me this time, but I'm ready to wait if it means having the same experience I did my first time.
