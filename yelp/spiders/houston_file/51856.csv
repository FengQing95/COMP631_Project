Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food: For starters, they have complementary coffee while you wait. I've never seen this at a restaurant and I was extremely impressed by it! I ordered the Snooze Classic with French Toast and a Pineapple Mimosa. The French toast was very good but the cream cheese on top was too sweet; everything else was perfect!
