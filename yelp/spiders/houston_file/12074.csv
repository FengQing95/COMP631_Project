JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////There's a free parking garage for all the retail shops in the area, but it fills up quickly around Friday and Saturday dinner times. There tends be a wait at peak dinner times every day of the week. Fortunately, the fast service makes up for it. Also, for those who seek a good bowl of soup/pho/ramen on rainy days, the garage isn't directly connected to Jinya, so be sure to bring an umbrella...#firstworldproblems.
