Local Foods////I have been in Houston for 3 weeks now and visited them twice now. I cannot say how much I love this place. It says a lot when I visit the same place twice within a month. I like this place because of the farm to table theme and the freshness of the food. This is definitely a cool place to visit for an afternoon lunch or a casual dinner.
