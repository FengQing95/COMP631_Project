Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We talked to the waiter a bit about what we liked. My favorite Whiskey is Makers Mark Private Select and we talked about that. He recommended the Fathers Day flight for us both which they had "on special" for $20. Now I don't consider myself a whiskey snob, but I definitely know by the burn, the level of quality. The whiskeys we were given were nothing like my favorite Bourbon, and they were so rough that I lost my appetite for food. They were bad.
