Uchi////We came around 4:50pm and stood in line for the social hour - and yes folks, there is a line down the block. You get in fairly quickly though depending on what's available and how many people have reservations. You stand in line regardless if you have reservations or not to get in, make sure all people in your party are present. Â We grabbed 4 spots at the bar and ordered drinks and rounds of food throughout social hour, which runs from 5-6:30pm, so we stayed and kept the drinks and food flowing until 6:30! The food was great - good deals for rolls and hot plates, smaller than normal portions but definitely a good deal for Uchi (so I can appreciate the lines of people trying to get into social hour). There drinks are cheap - $3 for hot or cold sake? Unheard of during normal dinner here! So yes, we lined up and we took advantage of what the restaurant had to offer!
