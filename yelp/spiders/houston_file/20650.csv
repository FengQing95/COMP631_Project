Uchi////AH-MAZ-ZING!!!! I love this place. You can't go wrong with anything you order. They have a focus on quality food, quality presentation, quality taste. It's the quality taste that matters most and they own it! We ordered so much food! And every bite was exquisite! Sushi is my personal favorite and this place does it sooooo right! Also, the service is great. There is only good things to say about this place. DELICIOUS!!!!
