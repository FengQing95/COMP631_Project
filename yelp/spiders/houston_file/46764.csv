Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Sunday morning the wait for us was 50 minutes, and the temperature inside was sweltering, probably from so many folks coming in and out.  Hash browns, coffee, bacon, peach cobbler pancakes and eggs benedict items all got good reviews from my companions. Poached eggs were not well drained, and came in a vinegar brine.  Prices were reasonable and service was good.  The establishment has games to pass the time during waiting, and self-service coffee for the wait as well.
