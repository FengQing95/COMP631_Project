Kata Robata////We arrived for lunch on a Thursday and sat at the sushi bar right in front of Chef Hori. Â Since the place is new, we went for a splurge and ordered "omakase", or the chef's special. He just makes whatever he wants and puts it in front of you after he asks you how much you want to spend. We gave him carte blanche so he gave us the works.
