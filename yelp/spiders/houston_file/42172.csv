Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Tried this today and was blown away.  Best chocolate cupcake I've ever had!!! The macarons were awesome too.  This is the first place in Houston that has macarons that are similar in texture as those sold in Paris (especially at Pierre Herme).  I was a little disappointed that they were out of chocolate (seriously? At 2pm?) so hot chocolate was not available.  The cookie was also very good.  Can't wait to come back for lunch!
