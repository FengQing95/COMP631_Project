JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For our entrees we had the "cha cha cha" and the "spicy chicken ramen" I loved the cha cha cha. The pork was extremely tender and the broth was seasoned perfectly. For me the broth is everything and this mix of fish and pork broth was heaven. I tasted my girlfriend's spicy chicken ramen. It was good but not as good as mine! Lol she enjoyed it but did say hat she should have ordered it a little spicier. (She had the spicy).
