Uchi////This place is really, really good! I went here for a team dinner a few weeks ago and we had a great time. The place is very small, so it's not that great for large parties, unless you get the private dining room. It was about 6 of us, and we fit comfortably at one of the larger tables. Our server was really great and made great recommendations. I'm currently doing Keto and she made great suggestions on how I could stay on track. My team opted to do the 10 course chef's special and we were not disappointed AT ALL. All of the courses super fresh and came out fairly quickly. I wasn't able to taste much of the traditional sushi because of my diet, but the food I did have was amazing. This place is very popular, so I would highly recommend a reservation, especially on the weekend. We went on a Tuesday night and it was PACKED. I might dedicate a cheat day to this place just so I can have a real experience with the food.
