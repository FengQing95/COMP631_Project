The Pit Room////The Pit Room looks like an authentic Texas bbq spot, but seems to be average at best. If you go to Texas, you need to get bbq. I would keep this place as a 'plan b' if your 'plan a' fails for whatever reason. Usually a line so expect to wait a while. The beef ribs are good, just a little too fatty for my preference and the brisket is okay at best. The elote comes in a cup, not off the cob as I thought it would. The best thing I ordered was the side of mac and cheese. At first glance, I thought it was going to be overcooked, but it turned out to be pretty good. Overall, I'd say the food is about average, didn't necessarily meet or exceed my expectations of "authentic Texas bbq" but wouldn't completely steer someone away from it.
