The Pit Room////But, the food was pretty darn good over all. It was probably a lot more than we thought we could eat, but the sauce was mainly the best part. It was spicy and juicy and its making me drool right now. The sausage, chicken, brisket and shredded meat was really good. Those were probably my favorite with the least favorite being the ribs. (This is because I don't really like charring on my meat too much.) We also got lots of sauce to go along with all the meat, which was very nice.
