Baby Barnaby's////I ordered the green eggs and a glass of their fresh squeezed orange juice. The juice was delicious, but I wouldn't recommend ordering it (see below). The eggs were also great; a little bit soggier than I expected, but I think it was better that way because of the feta and veggies mixed in. The order comes in a huge plate with a lot of potato hash, too much to finish. You could probably split this dish with another person if you are not feeling hungry.
