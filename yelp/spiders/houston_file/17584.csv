Uchi////About their great customer service, I noticed servers were always picking up trash off the table and replacing dirty plates. I dropped one of my chopsticks and had asked for another set, upon bringing me my new pair, they made sure to take the ones that were no longer being used. It's just those little things and they happen all the time here. Service is spectacular! You get the sense that someone really wants you to enjoy your dining experience. Everyone is so friendly, helpful, seem to really like working here and all have great big ol' smiles on their faces.
