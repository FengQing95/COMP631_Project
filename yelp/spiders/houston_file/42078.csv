Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Tried a latte and the chocolate chip walnut cookie. Cookie was amazing and the rest of the baked goods looked amazing! They had a great breakfast menu but want to come back when the flat breads are available. A little pricey for sure but quality is great and staff was super friendly. Also have some great looking loaves of sprouted sourdough.
