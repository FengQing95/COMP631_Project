Local Foods////Love love this place! Parking can be difficult to find, but definitely worth the food. I highly recommend the truffle egg salad sandwich that everyone is raving about. Plenty of seating inside. I had the kale and quinoa sides, both which were good. Definitely want to come back and try their crunchy chicken sandwich.
