Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is my second time coming here. The first time I came here I would have rated this place 3 stars for a couple of reasons.  For starters the wait was an hour and thirty minutes long. But don't worry you can keep yourself busy by walking to a coffee shop down the street (Southside expresso which has lovely coffee) near by and then snooze will call you when you're next in line. That time I had the pancake flight which was not my cup of tea ; they were cold and overly sweet. But I also  had the eggs benedit III which were delicious. So overall mediocre experience.
