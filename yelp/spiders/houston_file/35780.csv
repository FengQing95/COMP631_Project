Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My friend and I stopped in after dinner to check this place out.  Top notch.  The bartenders were super attentive, and the drinks were delicious!  We ended up staying all night- great music, great atmosphere, and great staff.  The DJ and one of the bartenders even protected us from some obnoxious gentlemen and made sure we made it out to our Uber safe and sound when the time came!  Will definitely be back and will definitely tell my friends!
