JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Also, regarding your server, can you expound on your statement: "He was friendly, but it didn't seem genuine." Was he rude or inconsiderate to you in any way? It would help me greatly to know what he did or said specifically that made you feel his demeanor was anything less than excellent. Also, were there any other specific issues with his, or any others' service that you deemed negative? We work extremely hard to provide good service to hundreds of guests every day, seven days and nights a week. We leave little margin for error in this regard.
