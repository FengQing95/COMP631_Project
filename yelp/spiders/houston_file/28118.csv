The Pit Room////The verdict on the BBQ and chicken tacos was that the brisket was pretty decent. There was a light peppercorn and smoke to the brisket. The pork ribs had good flavor with their rub, but it was not fall off the bone. The highlight for the three meat plate was the jalapeño cheddar sausage, because of its big pieces of cheddar that absolutely melted in your mouth and the jalapeño that gives it a kick. The chicken tacos had grilled garlic on top which was different and their shredded chicken was tasty.
