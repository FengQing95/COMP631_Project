Local Foods////This place is very good. I have been a few times now, and i don't know whether i like the sandwiches or their side items better. I have had a few different sandwiches here and the one that stands out the most is the bahn mi. It was very tasty. Less impressive was the crunchy chicken, which was dry and rather bland. Each time i come i am more and more impressed by their side options. Their Kale salad and barley stand out as highlights.
