Kata Robata////I visited this restaurant while on business in Houston, and totally loved it!  We made reservations, but got there early.  We still had to wait a bit, but they did try to accommodate us.  We ordered the kobe beef skewer, lobster mac and cheese, ramen, hamachi and jalapeno sashimi, and an assortment of sushi.  The lobster mac and cheese was very good, but I have to say I expected more based on the reviews.  I thought the ramen was great, while my companion thought that it was the best ramen he had ever had.  The sashimi was also good, but not as good as what I have had at Uchi.  The kobe beef skewer, however, kind of changed my life.  And, that is the reason I gave this restaurant five stars instead of four.  Absolutely phenominal; be sure to order it when you go!
