Local Foods////Best Kale salad I've ever had hands down. Always looking for healthy locations to eat while i'm stuck out in the city. Sandwich turned into a salad w/ added chicken was the bees knees, the cat's pajamas, and the dogs bullocks. In corny people terms, it was damn good. Service was great which is always appreciated.
