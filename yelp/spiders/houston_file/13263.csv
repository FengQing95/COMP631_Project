JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Melanie - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry for your daughter's experience at JINYA. Please let us know if you have sought or required medical attention for her. Please know that for any food establishment, these types of claims are of paramount concern and are never taken lightly. I have spoken to our head chef and kitchen staff, and also with our food suppliers, to double-check if any of our supplies or processes have changed (which they have not).
