The Pit Room////Let me start off by saying the brisket frito pie is delicious. I just wish it came with bbq sauce to take away a bit of the saltiness from the Fritos. Â The Czech Beef sausage is decent; nothing to write home about. It's a decent establishment and I may be back to try something else. The parking and overall space within the building is a deterrent but if you can get past that... you'll be okay.
