Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My favorite bakery in Houston! There is almost a line out of the door and it's for a good reason. The atmosphere is awesome, the staff is all smiles and polite and friendly, the decor is so reminiscent of a French bakery, it's just perfect! And the treats, oh my gosh, are they delicious or what? My favorites are the ever so popular almond croissant and the most perfect chocolate chip walnut cookie, which might I add rivals my favorite chocolate chip walnut cookie from Levain bakery in NY! Also the lattes are absolutely delicious as well! One of my favorite places to stop and get breakfast or a yummy treat at whenever I visit Htown!
