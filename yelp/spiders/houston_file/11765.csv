JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We were seated at the huge table in the middle. Our server's name escapes me, but she was so nice! We tried the sprouts that are touted as wondrous and they just simply were not. We thought they tasted like any other tempura veggies and were struggling to find any hint of truffle oil. Not a big deal, we still had high hopes. And I'm happy to say that we were not disappointed. I chose the spicy tonkotsu and my bf had the spicy chicken -Â we both added the seasoned egg and chose the spicy level. OH MAN. They were perfect. The flavors were nuanced and the level of spice we chose was absolutely perfect. The pork in mine was sooo tender. My bf said it might have been the best ramen he's ever had! Happy to have found somewhere spectacular on our first try.
