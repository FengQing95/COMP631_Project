Local Foods////I can't forget about the best part. There was this song that played, I have still yet to find it (and if anyone knows it, let me know), and for the majority of the song this woman was saying "boop" every like five seconds. It made my day. I wish I had shazamed it or something. I didn't know at the time I needed it in my life. But a song that basically sounded like a woman pretending to be a robot, basically deems this place as my hipster paradise.
