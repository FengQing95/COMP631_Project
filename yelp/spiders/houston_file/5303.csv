JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Loved this place!!! We arrived around 9 on a Friday, our wait was 25 mins, we left the hostess with our phone number and grabbed a drink next door. We then were called in under 25 mins and seated immediately. Zoe was our waitress. We are super new to Ramen bars and had no idea where to even start. She recommended a few different appetizers. The tempura Brussel sprouts were so amazing they go great with the dipping sauce you get with the cheese puffs. We ordered the spicy chicken ramen with an extra egg. It was perfectly seasoned, just the right amount of meat and broth. My favorite experience at a restaurant by far!
