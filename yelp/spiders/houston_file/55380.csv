Kata Robata////My second time, I tried the Miso crusted bone marrow. It was a little salty, but interesting in texture. Also had the foie gras duck chawanmushi, but I honestly only enjoyed the foie gras part...(and even had better foie gras than this before). The kobe, however, is wonderful. The tropical spicy tuna roll is very nice as the mango adds a nice tanginess to it.
