Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////By the way - this is not a coffee shop, this is a restaurant. Don't come here looking to camp out with your laptop and hog a table all day. The waitstaff work for tips which they can't collect if you suck up time and order nothing but a cup of coffee. Take it to the Starbucks next door.
