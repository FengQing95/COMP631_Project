Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'm a bit hesitant to rate them 5 stars because I've had better chai plenty of times. The chai latte itself is a little too cinnamon-y, so it's harder to get that nice tea aroma at the end of a sip. I also think $5 for a chai tea latte is a bit excessive in price for a normal sized cup. I also think there was a little too much foam, but it did come with a pretty heart design at the top.
