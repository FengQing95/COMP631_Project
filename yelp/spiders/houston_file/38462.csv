Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The one dish we saw recommenced on yelp over and over was the pig candy so we got that to start. The smell of it was just horrible. I am 32 weeks pregnant and was barely able to get it to my mouth, but once I did I really enjoyed the taste. My husband couldn't stand the smell either, but it probably wasn't as bad for him as he isn't pregnant lol. Anyways, it was hard to eat for both us even though it tasted good, because the small was so so horrible.
