Kata Robata////Kata Robata is an easy 5-star due to the overall quality of the dishes offered. What really sets Kata apart is how many different foods are prepared to that level of quality. Obviously Chef Hori is top notch and gets the sushi part down pat - easily the best sushi quality in Houston - but the robatayaki offerings are also some of the best I've had in the US. I'm also a big fan of the other hot dishes, like the lobster mac and cheese and the Kakuni pork belly. Don't forget to check out their nightly specials menu, either.
