Uchi////Second time here and Alysha made this trip much more memorable. She was so kind, sweet and made us feel right at home. The staff here pays attention to everything that's going on around them, making sure water glasses are never empty and no trash or empty plates left on the tables. The sushi here is fresh and they definitely take pride in what they put out. Highly recommend!
