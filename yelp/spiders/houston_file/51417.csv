Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The menu seemed pretty good; there was sweet stuff and savory stuff to fulfill everyone's mood. I decided to get the chocolate chip pancakes, because I love chocolate chip pancakes. They were pretty good! Pretty large portion, so come hungry! The syrup was also good, which is something I really appreciated.
