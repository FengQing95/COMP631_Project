JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I would like to ask if your friend was dining alone, or was she waiting for another guest(s) to arrive? If so, quite often we are unable to seat guests -- even parties of two -- if their party is incomplete. On many occasions, our guests unfortunately have misinformed our hosts that their friends were "just coming around the way" or "just parking their car," only to wait upwards of an hour without receiving service while other parties of two wait for two open seats, a booth, or a table.
