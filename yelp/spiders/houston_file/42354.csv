Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The pastries were absolutely worth the price and the hype.  They are as good and line-worthy as those from Tartine in San Francisco.  The kouign amman was everything I'd expected - dense, flaky, crispy, chewy, buttery, perfectly sweet.  I know this is a 5-star scale, but this pastry goes to 11.
