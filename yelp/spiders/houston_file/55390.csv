Kata Robata////Highly recommend going during happy hour and "trying a bit of everything." The mushroom-oyster from the happy hour specials was too burnt for my liking but I would like to say, the ceviche, carpaccio, pork belly in buns, longhorn roll, and agedashi tofu was amazing! (Eat all the tofu first because it will get soggy if you leave it for last!) I did buy everything from the happy hour special and it was affordable and so worth. I would go here again for sure!
