JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello J P. - Thank you for your review. This is very concerning. May I please ask the date and approximate time you dined with us, the specific location, and with which manager you spoke about receiving the incorrect dish? If you don't recall the manager's name, can you describe him or her? In a word, this is not how we operate our businesses, and I'm somewhat baffled, to be honest. I look forward to your response here or via private message.
