Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came in on a Friday afternoon, the place was dead except for the bar which was full. My friend and I were informed by the host that they could get us a table, but that we'd have to be gone in an hour and a half to make room for the next reservation. I didn't understand seeing as the whole restaurant was empty besides the bar, so we decided to not dine there at all.
