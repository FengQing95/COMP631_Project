Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I had the Michelada, which was good but it did require extra hot sauce. I also had bacon, egg, arugula and tomato (BEAT) sandwich. This was also very good!! It's also adorable inside and they have good service and music. I would go on a weekday because i don't think it's worth a 2 hour wait.
