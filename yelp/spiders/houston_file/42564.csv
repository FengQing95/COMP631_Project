Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Yes, it feels very New York City, which is nice. Right now Common Bond is quite the draw. I mentioned to someone standing in line that "this place will give Cafe Brasil a run for its money". That's the venerable coffee shop/hangout across the street. She said, "What's that?" So I imagine the early visitors are not necessarily locals. We will need to see if Common Bond becomes a place for a superior bakery bite/cafe meal or stays a tourist attraction.
