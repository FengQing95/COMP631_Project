JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jackie - Thank you for your feedback. In the nearly three years we have been in operation, we have seen demand for our product grow considerably while our seating capacity remain the same. We try to do our best to accommodate everyone who walks through our doors and calls in a to-go order.
