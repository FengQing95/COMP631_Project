Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////On to the food.  We tried two dishes, each of which was better in theory than in execution.  The first was the soft-shell crab courtbouillon ($14), with a soft-shell crab, dumplings, pickled green beans and a seafood stock.  The soft-shell crab was excellent, but the stock was mostly salty and lacked the complexity of a deep, dark roux you would expect to find in NOLA.  The dumplings, too, lacked flavor.  The second was the fried oysters with kimchi and blue cheese ($11).  This dish had good flavors, but lacked balance with the briny, creamy, funky and tangy all angling for the limelight.  Mostly, it was poorly conceived, with too many competing flavors and too much funk.
