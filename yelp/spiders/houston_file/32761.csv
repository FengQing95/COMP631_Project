COULD NOT BOIL WATER!!! Then she talked to a second person and I had a second conversation about it and said, "You could either make me hot water or remake the tea." All these times, I've asked nicely and it was returned with I can't do it. Finally hot water came out and the comment was "I could not get it to boiling."
