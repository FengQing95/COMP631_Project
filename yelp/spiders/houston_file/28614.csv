The Pit Room////The BBQ is good. Dammmmn good!!! I'm daring to say the best BBQ chicken I've ever had! It's not dry and that's key for me because so many are. I'm not into dousing dry chicken into sauces to make it edible. The Pit Room chicken is so moist and well-flavored, I barely touched the BBQ sauce. I wasn't a fan of their sauces so worked out I didn't need them. I ordered the chicken plate dinner that came with 2 sides and bread for $12.75. The plain white bread would've been better as warm buttered bread, but I get it, people make sandwiches with their meat. That's just not my preference, though.
