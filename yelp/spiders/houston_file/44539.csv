Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This time I had the savory scone (bacon, chives, a tomato puree-type sauce) and the pain au chocolat (chocolate croissant). The scone was the best scone I've ever had, doesn't get dry in your mouth while chewing like a lot of scones I've had. And the chocolate croissant is huge, I couldn't even finish it!
