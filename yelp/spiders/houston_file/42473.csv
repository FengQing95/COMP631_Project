Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////However - their pastries are amazing! Their plain & chocolate croissants are unlike anything that I have seen outside of France. My mother is French, and I spent my summers growing up spending relatives there - so this is a huge treat for me. I was disappointed the last time I went though, because we were there when they opened and they were out of plain croissants (they didn't have any to begin with that day - how does that happen when you bake onsite and have filled croissants?)!
