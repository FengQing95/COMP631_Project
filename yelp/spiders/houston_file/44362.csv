Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is AWESOME, and the funny thing is I've only had the kouign amann (a flaky layered buttery Breton cake) and coffee.  Common Bond seem to be very popular for this particular pastry, and I can't say that I've seen them in many other places around town.  When you get in line, you can easily see the mountain of Kouign Amann goodness.
