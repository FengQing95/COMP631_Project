JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The Tonkotsu Spicy ramen is my favorite! Add an egg for $1 to get things poppin' and you can always add other toppings to your preferece too - seaweed, garlic, corn,etc. The broth is so flavorful and not salty like some of these other ramen places in Houston. They also have a avariety of starters. The pork belly bun and the takoyaki balls are a winner in my book!
