Local Foods////Local Foods shares a parking lot with a few other restaurants, including benjys. So, it can get pretty difficult to find parking sometimes. However, you can park along the streets in Rice Village, even though some streets are a bit of a walk. The parking spots are rather small, and there always seem to be a lot of larger cars in the lot, so be careful!
