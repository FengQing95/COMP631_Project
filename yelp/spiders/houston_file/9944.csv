JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I truly have a Ramen obsession and eat here like once a week. Considering that I am pescatarian, their Vegan Ramen is easily the best vegetarian ramen I've tried in Houston. I like it best with added Brussels sprouts and the special egg (boiled). JINYA has nice hours so I'm always able to get my ramen fix!
