Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////As we were leaving, we asked one more time to see the manager. He came out and was very kind and apologetic and insisted upon giving us a box of pastries to leave with. This was the appropriate response. We didn't complain to him to try to get something out of it, but rather to make him aware of the training his staff so clearly needs.
