The Pit Room////This is a very good bbq place! I would say it's one of the top ones in Houston. The place itself is small but luckily I went on a Monday in the afternoon. The three meat plate was delicious. The jalape√±o cheddar sausage was tender and there were oozing chunks of cheese on it. The brisket was tender and melted in my mouth. The pork ribs were a bit dry and could've been better in my opinion. My buddies and I also shared a 1lb of the beef rib and it was the best idea ever. You must get the beef rib if you come here! The side dishes were excellent as well. Mac and cheese were simple but good. The elote was a different take at a bbq place so that was refreshing. Service was excellent, fast, and efficient.
