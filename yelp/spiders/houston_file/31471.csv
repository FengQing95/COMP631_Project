Local Foods////This is my go-to spot if i want a sandwich. What can I say? They do sandwiches extremely well. Not only all their sandwiches are delicious, their sides are also quite good. The shrimp and crab and the  truffle egg salad sandwich were my favorites.  Prices are kinda on the steep side considering they are just sandwiches, but they all come with 2 sides of your choosing.
