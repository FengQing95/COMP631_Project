Uchi////The food here is simply orgasmic! Every bite and taste of Uchi's food is a journey. The concoctions of different textures and taste has been carefully thought out and executed in a manner that leaves you wanting more. This place has truly set a higher standard for all other sushi restaurants by serving dishes that are packed with so much flavor it would be an insult to use soy sauce and wasabi. For the first time in my life, I have never had to use soy sauce or wasabi at a Japanese restaurant. And that's a GOOD thing, folks!
