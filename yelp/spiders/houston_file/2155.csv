JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////1st time here, the shrimp tempura appetizer and spicy chicken ramen were off the hook!!!  Seen someone get a vegan bowl and it looked great also.  My next choice.  Nice vibes inside made this spot a great go-to for our late lunch.  Will definitely be meeting friends here.  No cold apple saki?? i love apple saki!! What's up with that??
