Kata Robata////We ordered at least a dozen different menu items and every one of them was amazing.  I was blown away by how good this meal was.  The octopus crudo was unlike anything I've had before and a great way to start the meal.  The rolls were all excellent, everything fresh and many original rolls.  The bone marrow was awesome and the 72 hour Texas Kobe beef was an incredible way to finish the meal.  The cocktails were perfectly made as well.  I loved the way our orders came out a little at a time and in the perfect order.  This was one of the best meals I've had in awhile, I can't say enough about Kata Robata.  As a first time visitor to Houston, this is the one thing that would bring me back.
