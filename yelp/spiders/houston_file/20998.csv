Uchi////First most when I walked in they told me it was an hour and half wait. I decided to wait just because of the hype but we got seated within 30 mins. They don't even have a proper waiting area waiters were running into us by bar which was suppose to be the waiting area. Not as good as some people say it. I got the Brussels sprouts which someone told me is a must... umm nothing too special, I also tried couple of other rolls and it was just whatever literally felt like I was eating paper. Also I tried the fried milk it was lame. Save your time and money.
