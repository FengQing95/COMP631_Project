Kata Robata////Nice place to have a date night, the food is good and yes, it is expensive, but what do you expect for coming to a classy sushi restaurant on Westheimer? The food is unique and so far nothing for me to complain about this place. The atmosphere is nice and the decoration is very classy, intimate and romantic. The servers are professional and I suggest to make appointment before coming here on weekend.
