Kata Robata////We also had hamachi kama - good but nothing special than what I've had before; salmon sashimi- very fresh, good quality; spicy chopped scallop with added quail eggs- first time I had raw scallop so it was different, not bad at all but not wow for me; grilled shiitake mushroom- can't never go wrong with grilled mushroom; mixed ceviche- good and great presentation; rising sun roll -pretty nice yellow tail and avocado inside and topped with peppercorn tuna. I thought it was pretty good but my family didnt really like the peppercorn tuna.
