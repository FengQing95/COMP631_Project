Kata Robata////I came in here expecting basically a high-end version of any Japanese restaurant's standard cuisine. However, I was over-awed by the variety and uniqueness of each of the menu's options. Every item piqued my curiosity in some way, as here you will find food uncommon almost anywhere else.
