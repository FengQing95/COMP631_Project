Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Watch out Bouchon, Common Bond Bakery just might be taking your place.  They have one great edge, their staff is actually friendly!  We were told to go to Common Bond Bakery by a local.   We're so glad we listend.  We got the Kouigin-Amann which looks like an upside-down croissant muffin with a candied butter cap.  It was AMAZING.  We also got a cookie which was great too.  The staff, as I said, was friendly which is almost as important as the food being good.
