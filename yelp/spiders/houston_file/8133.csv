JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Sou - Thanks for the review. I'm glad you enjoyed your visit and have such kind words for us. I'm also glad you can appreciate our open format and our Genki (元気) spirit! I have found that there's not too much middle ground with the Takoyaki -- most folks either love it or don't love it. Either way, we're grateful you came through and hope to serve you again soon!
