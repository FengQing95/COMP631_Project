JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Daniel - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry our ramen did not meet your full expectations. Please know you can always send back your ramen for any reason, and we will happily remake it for you or offer another dish more suited to your liking. I should point out we do offer two more spice levels beyond "Hot," which are "Inferno" and "Double Inferno." These are "off-menu" modifications borne out of many customers' requests to make the broth spicier than our standard preparation.Thank you nevertheless for your acknowledging the ambience of our restaurant. Our ultimate goal is for every customer to leave satisfied and happy after every visit. I hope you return, and if you do, please ask for me or any of my managers on duty. We will make sure your dish is prepared to your complete satisfaction.
