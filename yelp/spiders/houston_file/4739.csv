JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We love to come here for the food! Absolutely amazing every time and the servers are great at recommending items. I'm dropping a star because I went in to order food to go and they gave my order to someone else after I stood there for thirty minutes. They called the person back and handed me the bag he gave back... the bartender was so nice about it, but honestly that kinda grossed me out. I really didn't want food that someone else potentially picked through. I'll keep going back, but I won't order take out again!
