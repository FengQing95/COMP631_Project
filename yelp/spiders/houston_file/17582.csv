Uchi////We get seated at the sushi bar and between my gal friend, Nikki (who works at Uchi) and Son, our sushi chef, we get an array of amazing dishes.  Everything I ate was so good!  Sometimes, dressed with fruits and light as can be, then other dishes so bold and flavorful, creative, and so unconventional.  I loved how when the different servers would bring out our dishes they would always make a suggestion on how to eat it.  I thought that was a really nice touch.  All the food was just so amazing.  I can remember at least three times I had to take a moment while eating, closed my eyes and had a food orgasim...yes, the food was that amazing.  It was my first time trying foie gras and uni (sea urchin) and both were totally painless, even really good.  The thing is I wasn't really even worried, I had no reason to not trust the food.  Everything else I had tried so far was so amazing!  If you try anything, you must try the Wagyu sushi!
