Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went here for a bday brunch on Sunday for 11:30am. Place was calm and still seats available which I was surprised as many reviewers had different experience on Sunday brunch. We had a little wait as majority of the party wasn't quite there yet which was good since the place wasn't overly crowded. The crowd began to come around 1pm-2pm on the day I visited. DJ was awesome he started around 1:30 or so. Yes could be loud for some if you aren't use to that setting. House music before the DJ comes on with a little added tech and pop. The DJ spinning rnb old and new, pop and very mild hip hop thrown in there. The service was ok we waiting a great deal to place entree orders even went to look for him at one point. He claimed he was busy etc. food selection for some may find brunch menu very limited as you can't order from any other menu during brunch. The Rose Bellini was great I'd recommend the carafe.
