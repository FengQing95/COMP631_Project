Baby Barnaby's////If I could give more stars, I would! Baby barnaby's is my favorite breakfast spot. I try to go at off times to avoid a wait, but don't mind waiting for this deliciousness. The green eggs are amazing & soft & fluffy each and every time. The potatoes are perfectly cooked. The biscuits are mouthwatering.
