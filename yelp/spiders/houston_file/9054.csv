JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jason - Thanks for your review. I'm glad you decided to give us a try. To answer your query about our broth, we do not use corn starch as a thickening agent. On the contrary, our pork and chicken broths go through a tedious reduction process that takes many hours to complete, giving our broths a rich, flavorful complexion.
