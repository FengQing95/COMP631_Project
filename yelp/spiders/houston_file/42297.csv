Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The lines aren't very long and the service is great. The only reason I knocked a star is bc the actual pastries are little lacking...the havent really fully satisfied me the two times i have come here. Maybe, im just a sugar-holic and need extra boost to my palate though :/
