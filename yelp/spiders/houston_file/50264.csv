Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Such a fun, colorful & energetic setting. The staff were all so perky! However, it took another hour to receive our orders. At the halfway mark, our waitress gifted us a plate of delicious, "chocolate chip" pancakes topped with pecans, a scoop of (?) butter & (?) syrup. LOL as vibrant as the chick is who brought this out - she did such a poor job describing the dish. But we didn't care, it was way too good.
