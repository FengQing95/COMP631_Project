Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I appreciate the paperless menu in the midst of COVID19 and saving trees, but it's annoying on your phone. I would suggest disposable menus. The food was decent, but it wasn't anything to rave about. I was disappointed in the lack of flavor and fluff in the blueberry pancakes.
