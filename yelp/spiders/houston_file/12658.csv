JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Honestly, what all the other reviews have said is true. We had to wait about 25 minutes to be seated, but it was absolutely worth it. The food was fresh and came out quickly, our service was extremely fast and attentive. My friend had the ramen special & I had the Old School, we shared edamame and wasabi peas. Everything was great. The prices were quite reasonable. I hope to eat here next time I'm in town, it was delicious.
