Uchi////The most bestest experience. Had AMY wait on us and she made the whole experience awesome.  By far and away the best around.  This is NOT your typical sushi place. In fact nothing like it. Had the ten course chef special plus some extras (brussel sprouts and fiore)....worth every dollar because of the food, service and atmosphere.  Drove 45mins to get there and we cant wait to get there again.
