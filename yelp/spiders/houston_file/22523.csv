Uchi////I can't say enough about this place. Their consistency is just stellar & the service keeps me coming back. The sushi guys are always a pleasure to interact with. Santos and Patrick were a ball tonight at the sushi bar. Can easily spend a few hundred here easily but, the liveliness from the staff makes everything worth it. All the dishes were explained and they make you feel very welcome here. I've been here time and time again & never feel like its a rip off. Just sit down and ask the guys to feed you until you say stop. PROMISE you won't be disappointed here at all. The rice and vinegar mix is so well balanced. And, I do appreciate their rice not being stone cold like many other places in Houston.
