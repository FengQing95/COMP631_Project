Kata Robata////Another very good Japanese restaurant in Houston.  I've had a ton of sushi in Los Angeles and New York and am pleasantly surprised to find the quality in Houston so high.  I've had a business lunch here twice now.  Service was superb.  Sushi was fresh.  Side salads were good.  I think this will be my go-to business lunch place.  This restaurant is no secret.  We had to wait for a table during prime lunch time.  When I had a late lunch (1:30 pm) there was no wait whatsoever.
