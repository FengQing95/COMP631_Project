Local Foods////Im famous among my friends for having too many "favorites", but this really is one of my absolute, all-time FAVORITES! I have never had something I haven't liked from Local Foods. Whether catered, to go, or eating there, the food is great all ways. I love the ability to convert any of their sandwiches into salads as that adds so many salad options. And when I'm ordering sandwiches, I always get pretzel bread because it is to die for. Â
