Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I absolutely love this place! It's a bit pricey for a typical college student, but I'm here more often than I should be. They have some of the best pastries I've ever eaten, and their lavender latte is to die for! The service is also amazing--my friend was given a free box of macarons when a mishap occurred (though none of us really considered it an inconvenience anyways). There's wifi on the weekdays, making work very doable here too.
