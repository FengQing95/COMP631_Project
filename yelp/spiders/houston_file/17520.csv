Uchi////Bad Ass! And not really expensive for as freaking good as the food is. Went there with my lady and we got out of there for 100 bucks. She had 2 glasses of wine, I had a couple of beers and we absolutely gorged on the BEST sushit I have EVER had. Actually though, the brussel sprouts are to die for as well.
