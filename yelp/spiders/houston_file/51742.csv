Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////If you want the best breakfast ever go to Snooze. It gets crowded quickly though. That's because it has the best food. Their gluten free blueberry pancakes are to die for. They taste like the real thing. I also like their Juan's Breakfast Tacos and their Chile Verde Benedict. If you have a wheat allergy like I do. Which I hate BTW. You just let them know and they can switch up items for you. For example, the benedict will come on a corn style muffin and the tacos will have corn tortillas. Their hot chocolate is amazing and I also love their mimosas.
