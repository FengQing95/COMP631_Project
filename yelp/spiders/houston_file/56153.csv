Kata Robata////My friends and I shared a variety of dishes here: the scallops with fois gras, miso-crusted bone marrow, and an assortment of sashimi. Each plate, even from sight alone, looked appetizing. Though the portions were small, the food was of such quality that I found myself taking smaller bites and chewing longer both to savour the taste and prolong the meal. The scallops were rich and soft, almost melting in my mouth. Similarly, the sashimi was fresh and of the absolute highest-quality (take this from a guy who works in a sushi restaurant). That said, my absolute favorite dish was the bone marrow. We were given 3 half-bones, spoons to scrape the marrow, various seasonings, and toasted bread. The marrow was creamy and spread almost like jam, which paired nicely with the firm crunchiness of the toast. On the tongue, it was fantastic. The fattiness of the marrow was brought out by the salt, garnished with a hint of miso, and balanced by the starchiness of the bread. Indeed, it was obvious that the chefs were truly masters of their craft. Each flavor was combined to complement and build upon another; no single ingredient or flavor was superfluous or overbearing.
