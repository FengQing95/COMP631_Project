The Pit Room////Wow. As a native Texan whose tried Saltlick, Rudy's, and all the smaller, incredible places, the Pit Room was a pleasant surprise for Houston BBQ. The Tex-mex influence was on point. Highly recommend the brisket taco. Only deduction I'd give was the BBQ sauce - I feel it could be slightly better so they could contend with the other BBQ places we always recommend to friends and family coming from out of town.
