Uchi////Of all the high end sushi places in Houston, this has to be one of the best. Pretty much everything on the happy hour menu was fresh, flavorful, and overall a wonderful experience. The spicy tuna wasn't spectacular, but the ham and eggs were absolutely fantastic. The service is near perfection. They serve a lot of their dishes tapas style, so I recommend ordering a few things and sharing (except the ham and eggs, you're going to want this all for yourself). If you're super hungry though I don't recommend this as your go-to place as their dishes tend to be on the small side. Make sure you're on time for your reservation - they won't seat you without your whole party present and it tends to get crowded quickly.
