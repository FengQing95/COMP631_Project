JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place has thoroughly ruined other Ramen places for me in Houston, it just does it so well. The Tonkotsu Black is their famous dish, and for good reason. I also really like the Spicy Chicken and the Spicy Tonkostu Miso. I'm not sure how many people talk about it, but I also really love the salads that come with the combo meals - whatever dressing they're using in there is on point.
