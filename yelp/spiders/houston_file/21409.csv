Uchi////Uchi is hands down the best restaurant in Houston. There is no other place that can compare or can compete! The food is phenomenal! By far the best sushi and dining experience I have ever had in a long time. I was told that the waiting list would be 1 hour and 30 mins and so I waited that long and boy was it worth it! Service was impeccable and the staff were so friendly and welcoming. Taste quotient is extremely high. The dishes are all great quality, all have beautiful presentations and the ingredients are out of this world and so incredibly fresh & delicious! The ambiance of the place is very relaxed and tranquil. I highly recommend getting the Uchiviche, the Brussels sprouts are amazing and (I don't even like Brussels sprouts), the Walu Walu, Bacon steak and the Fried Milk is also a must! I definitely will be coming back here again!
