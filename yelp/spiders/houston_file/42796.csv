Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////But the other day, sitting with an old friend in Common Bond and enjoying a pastry with an espresso and just talking, for fun, with no agenda, I kind of got it. The pastry itself was fine - it was actually pretty delicious, not too sweet and goopy, but flaky and studded with raisins - a kugenhopf i Â think? - but the place was gorgeous and bustling, rain streaming down huge the windows surrounding us and everyone else enjoying a little sugar and coffee, and I realized that eating that pastry was more about togetherness and experience than about how fulfilling the pastry itself was or wasn't.
