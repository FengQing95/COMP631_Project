Local Foods////Yummy! If you're looking for something light and delicious, this is the place. Everything looks very clean and the food is presented very pretty. There are free drinks on the side and plenty of unique seating. I forgot what my salad was called but it was mainly kale and it was the second salad on the menu! The serving size was very large, I only finished half of my salad. I tried my uncle's duck confit sandwich it was really good! The chips are a little too salty for my taste though. The smoked salmon that my dad had tasted normal- nothing out of the ordinary. Overall, good place to dine, anytime!
