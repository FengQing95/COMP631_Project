Baby Barnaby's////I went for the BLT & eggs & she had the chicken fried steak & eggs. When our order came, I was very very suprised at my plate. I mean it was only a BLT, so I wasn't expecting it to be so pretty!! All the veggies were super fresh, especially the tomatoes & those huge slices of wheat bread were the bomb. My eggs were light & fluffy. I should've taken a pic, bc I've not seen a sami look so pretty before. Grabbed a bite of my sis' fried steak & it was pretty yummy, but still think my BLT was better!
