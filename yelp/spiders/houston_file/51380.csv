Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The pineapple upside down pancakes were AMAZING!! Flavorful and fluffy, while not too sweet. This is a cute breakfast spot with great food. They don't have options for bottomless or pitchers of mimosas but they do have great individual breakfast cocktails. There are a good bit of vegetarian options also!
