Local Foods////first of all ...I am not a food critic! Â I am a food praiser. Wow, I was among the first few customers at this new Restaurant that opened next to Benjy's in the Village. I thought great another sandwich shop, that will be nice. Wow I had no idea. I have made two visits so far; the first by myself and the second with my wife. I ordered the BLT with Kale and pine nut salad and the Fresh Home Made potato chips. It was so good.
