Uchi////Have been here about 5 times before now, but this is the first time for happy hour and I am dismayed at the service and lack of respect. Was told we have 2h which is absolutely fine however was asked to finish placing orders 45m prior to this 2h mark (literally a little over half our time into eating), and then asked if she could bring the bill at 30m to the end of our meal. Absolutely ridiculous and so insulting, cannot believe they would treat regular customers so differently during happy hour.
