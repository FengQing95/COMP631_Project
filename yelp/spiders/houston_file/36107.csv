Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I was in Houston for a few days and found Bosscat by chance. This place is amazing, the staff was helpful in navigating through a tremendous whiskey offering. The bar team (Matt, Tim, Crisia and Layton) recommended some great whiskey, food and took great care of us. The food was tremendous and on a 3 day trip, I found my way back for a second round. I'm looking forward to my next trip to Houston and I'll definitely go back.
