Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I can't even begin to write how much I love this cute coffee shop. Everytime I come, the service exceeds my previous visit - something I did not know was possible. Excellent assortment of coffees. Desserts to die (or kill? ) for: chocolate chunk walnut cookie, oatmeal cream pie, PEANUT BUTTER JELLY MACAROONS. I didn't know macaroons were capable of making me feel so special.
