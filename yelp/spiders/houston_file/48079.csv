Snooze, an A.M. Eatery//// Yesterday, we came in with a party of 3. We were quoted 1 1/2 hr. So two of us went to attempt to get drinks at the bar. This has never been a good idea. Each time we have sat at the bar we get served by two red head females who are very rude and short. Orders have always been wrong and it takes well over 20 mins to even put an order in when sitting infront of them. It seems as if they don't feel obligated to serve anyone and purposely move as slow as possible so that they don't have to work as hard..or just plain rude and stupid. Back to yesterday, we waited around the bar for 40 minutes desperately trying to get someone's attention so that we could order beverages during our long wait. Not one time did anyone acknowledge us or anyone else trying to get their attention. After 40 minutes of the two red head bartenders ignoring us and moving slower than any syrup they serve, a barback came over and took our order. Closed us out but only brought back 1 of 3 drinks. We said forget it and went back outside to wait. Once the 90 min time frame was over we asked how much longer. The hostess told us 20 more mins. We waited the 20 mins. No luck. We went inside to ask and we were then told 30-40 more minutes. Really? People who came after us had ate and left all in the time we were still waiting. They said parties of two were getting bumped up but I continued to watch parties of 4 be seated that were on the list after us. Why? I asked. No explanation. We asked for a manager. Emily came out, I told her from the beginning about the terrible bar service and not being able to even get a drink. Emily then went to get the GM Chris. Who was not helpful at all, had no explanation as to why his staff behind the bar wouldn't help us other than there was only two of them. I never saw Chris or Emily walking the floor for the entire time we had been waiting. So if they were short staffed, why were they not helping? Also, after telling Chris and Emily we weren't able to get drinks they never even offered to help us get their attention again or help us out in an order. Chris continued to say "ok." After everything we told him that occurred along with other similar experiences. It was clear he could careless about keeping guest. Really dry and bland staff as a whole. The GM Chris is just as bad as his mute, slow, unfriendly and worthless bartenders. Be prepared to wait. Try getting a drink at the bar so you can see how big of a joke this place is.
