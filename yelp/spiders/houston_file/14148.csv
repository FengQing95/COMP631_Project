JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We also ordered their shrimp balls as appetizers which were good but nothing amazing, in my opinion. The dessert was mediocre too, we tried out the chocolate mochi, green tea pistachio popsicle and the pana Cotta. Compared to the ramen, these didn't blow my mind. Will be back here when I'm feeling fancier than my dollar ramen packets!
