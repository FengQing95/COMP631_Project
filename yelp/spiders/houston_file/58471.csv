Baby Barnaby's////Baby Barnaby's is hands down the best breakfast in Houston! I mean seriously yum-o! I work at Sweet Lola Yogurt Bar, and every week the ladies and I have a meeting and we ALWAYS get the breakfast tacos and burritos to share! Moreover I am quite literally addicted to the fresh squeezed orange juice that they have here, you can NOT get anything near this juice at a store, SO SOOOO GOOD! I have also taken boyfriend and roommate here and we've tried the breakfast plates that have more traditional breakfast foods like eggs, house potatoes, bacon, and biscuits... they are phenomenal! So fresh, so healthy [if you make good decisions], and the best way to start your morning!
