Baby Barnaby's////Well since this is the 121st review, I think this place has established itself as an institution.  If you go, expect a wait; the place is small.  Once inside you'll find salt'n'pepper grinders on each table, a machine squeezing fresh orange juice, quick and friendly service.  I ordered (organic) coffee and the waiter brought me my own pot.  Good thing too because they are BUSY.  The Green Eggs are exactly as you'd imagine: a gooey mush that doesn't look very appetizing, but is nonetheless delish with artichoke as the leading flavor.  Potatoes=potato cubes aka american fries.  Don't expect any lunch entres here, it's breakfast only.  If you're looking for greasy cheap breakfast this may not be the #1 choice.  However, if you're looking for well-prepared and well-presented healthy options, this place has a lot to offer.  I will definitely return.
