JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Our entire party ordered some form of ramen and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it.  I ordered the spicy chicken ramen bowl which was simply delectable.  The broth may have been the best I've ever had.  Not overly spicy, or thick.  Overall, I'd give Jinya a thumbs up and will most likely return; just not at their peak-hours.
