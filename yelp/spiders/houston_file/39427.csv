Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We visited during restaurant week - my husband ordered the mahi mahi from the RW menu. He was astonished that his food tasted like nothing. It was completely flavorless / the fish, the beans, the rice.... absolutely no flavor. I'm not even quite sure how that happens. I don't eat fish or I would've tried it for myself.
