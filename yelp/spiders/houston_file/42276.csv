Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My dude said the iced latte was one of the best he's had in Houston - he's really particular. It was described as "pleasantly mild" in terms of coffee flavor, with the right amount of creamy mouth feel, and blah blah blah. He went on and on. So apparently go with that, if you're into girly milky coffee drinks like the man I plan to marry. *facepalm
