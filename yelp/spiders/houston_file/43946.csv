Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Ok so it is time I go ahead and write up my review for this fabulous little café/bakery.  Please be forewarned that if you are not there right before they open, you will be met by an insanely long line out the door; and once inside, another line awaits to get to the main counter.
