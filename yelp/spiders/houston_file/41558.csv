Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We dropped by around 1pm on a Friday and was disappointed to see the almost empty sad dessert case display. There wasn't much of a selection to choose from except for the macarons and 1 or 2 croissants left. I ordered 2 half boxes of macarons to take with me. I did not realize they also include a charge of $2.00 for each macaron packaging box. WTH?! Overpriced and over-hyped. Macarons did not have that slight chewiness as it should. The center filling is gelatinous and not buttercream like.
