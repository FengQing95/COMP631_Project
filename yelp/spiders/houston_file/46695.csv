Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'm not sure what happened to the quality of this place..??!! When it was previously owned by the Roy Shvartzapel the breads cookies etc very good and when first changed hands to Ruggles owners. Now I'm not so sure my son claim that their cookies and croissants are inedible...I hope they get their QA back to where it used to be if not going i'm taking my business elsewhere or my own house bakery.
