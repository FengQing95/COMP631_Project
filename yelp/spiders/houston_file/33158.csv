Local Foods////I've visited Local Foods just a hand full of times so far.  The sandwiches are pretty good (I'm not a huge sandwich person fyi) and nice presentation.  I've had both the crunchy chicken and duck confit sandwiches.  Both are pretty good; I like the crunchy chicken best of the two.  The atmosphere is nice.  Depending on when you visit, you can expect the hipster or business crowd.  It's definitely on the pricier side for a cafe/sandwich establishment but it boosts healthy eating.
