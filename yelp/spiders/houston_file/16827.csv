JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Meh, nothing special. I was surprised at the line at Jinya as I found the food to be pretty subpar and flavorless, as well as expensive. My fianc√©e and I came here for dinner and it was nothing to write home about. We got the ahi tuna tacos which were cute but just tiny bites, and the ramen didn't have the super rich brothy taste we're used to.
