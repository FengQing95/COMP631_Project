JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Tram - Thanks for your review. And thank you for the kind words. Unfortunately, parking is an issue pretty much wherever you go in Midtown -- not to make excuses -- but our building does offer free valet service on the first floor of the parking garage (tipping is recommended). For future visits, please ask your server to cut your seasoned egg in half. It's a fairly common request, and we would be happy to accommodate. Thank you again for your patronage and we look forward to serving you again soon!
