The Pit Room////Fast-paced, great brisket and ribs. Falls off the bone. Sauce on the side are delicious. I highly suggest you look at the menu and decide what you want before you line up. This place gives fast service and you don't want to hold the line up trying to decide what kind of meat you want. 2 meats and 2 sides was more than enough ... and I was starving. Money well spent on the quality of food Â come hungry!
