Baby Barnaby's////I took my mother to the Baby Barnaby's Caf√© restaurant this morning and we were waiting for a table right by the entrance when not even for a minute later Scott, the general manager, asked us to go to the other side of the restaurant to wait for our table because we were "on the way." Since we were the next table on the list and my mother uses a walker to move around, I asked if she could please wait there because I didn't want her to walk all the way to the other side of the restaurant and Scott said "No you need to move and go to the other side or wait outside of the restaurant." I explained to him that it was difficult for my mother to walk and that I did not want her to go to the other side. I then asked if she could at least seat on a chair nearby. He replied in a louder voice "No, you can wait outside then but you need to move." My mother started to move and not even five seconds later he AGAIN told us to move in a borderline yelling voice. It was so loud that the tables around us turned and starred back. I asked to please realize that that she is a handicap person and moves very slow. To which he replied "don't we all? Specially without coffee."
