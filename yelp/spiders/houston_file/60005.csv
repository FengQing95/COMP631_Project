Baby Barnaby's////I personally love this place. We have been here many times and the food has always been good. Their pancakes are delicious- especially the seasonal ones! They also have some outdoor space, which is always a plus for me. The only downsides are the wait times and the parking. There are only a few actual parking spots, but the street parking is abundant.
