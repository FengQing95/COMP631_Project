Kata Robata////The pace here was perfect - some tasting menus leave you with way too much time in between each course (I'm looking at you, Quintonil) while others make you feel rushed. Here, it was perfect. I initially thought it was a little odd they didn't have specific tasting times (ie 8 spots for 6pm) but I actually prefer this because you don't feel pressure to wait or speed up based on the other diners.
