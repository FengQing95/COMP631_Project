The Pit Room////Was in town for the NEA Assembly and we were told that this is the place to go for barbecue. Read up on it so we knew what to expect with the line. It was a relatively nice evening so standing on line in the parking lot was no big deal, and the line moved steadily. Luckily we were meeting friends who had already staked out seating for us. I used to live in Kentucky and loved pulled pork so I thought I'd try Texas pulled pork. It was excellent. Threw some raw onion and pickles on it and I was in heaven. The staff was incredibly polite and efficient and helped my friends who were not so familiar with bbq. I always get slaw with bbq and it did not disappoint. My friends said to get the chips and queso and they were right,it was addictive and the 2 ice-cold Lone Stars I had grabbed helped to cool things down. Fun atmosphere-- there is a method to the madness -- and really nice and helpful crew. Don't pass this one up.
