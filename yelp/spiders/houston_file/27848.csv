The Pit Room////Best BBQ in downtown Houston. The brisket is super tender and well seasoned, the crust makes you want to have more. The turkey breast is one the the best I have ever had, it's tender and juicy with great taste. The sides are flavorful, the beans and the special of the day, fried okra were what I chose.
