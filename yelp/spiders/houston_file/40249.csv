Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I ordered a starter and two sides for my meal, which turned out to be way too much food for one person. But that just meant I got to take some home! Everything I had was very good, and had a creative edge. For my starter I chose Parmesan-encrusted meatloaf cubes with tomato-bourbon jam. The meatloaf was very good. The jam was not the best, but I appreciated the creativity. I tried to order Whiskey Okra as one of my sides, but our waiter had to come back to tell us that they were out. Instead, I ordered Brussels Sprouts (which were twice as expensive) and good but a little overwhelmed by the toppings. Not necessarily a bad thing, because it was cheese and bacon deliciousness. Lastly, I ordered the Mac N Cheese, which was excellent. It seemed to be flavored with a hint of cinnamon, which was a pleasant surprise.
