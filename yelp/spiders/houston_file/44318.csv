Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been here a few times now and would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to give it a shot. Their pastry and dessert display makes you want everything. I normally get the peach and blueberry fritter. Delicious and not overly sweet. The Blackforest cheesecake was really good but got way sweet at the end to where we couldn't finish. Strawberry shortcake is a must!! Is this the best bakery ever and I'm dreaming about their food? No, but it's a really good place to meet up with friends and grab some food and dessert. Having two parking lots in that area of Houston is also a huge plus.
