Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I hope to give this place five stars after I eat a meal here. I was really hoping to jump on the bandwagon and give it five stars, but I haven't had a "OMG THIS IS AMAZING" moment. I was so anticipating the opening of this place since it will be the closest I will ever get to El Bulli, since it does not exist anymore.
