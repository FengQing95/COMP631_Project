Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Had a friend get me almond croissants to go. Wow! The croissant first of all is HUGE! Then its so light and flaky and airy with the perfect almond sweetness. It puts la madeleine's croissants to shame. And makes grocery store croissants look gross. Ive heard excellent things about all the other bakery items and coffee. A must go!
