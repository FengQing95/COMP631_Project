Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The environment and experience at Bosscat is amazing! The food was savory, flavorful and filling. We got the short rib Chilaquiles and fruity pebbles French toast off their brunch menu. YUM! The manager, Mark went out of his way to introduce himself, give us a tour of their whiskey room and the history of Bosscat. They love their customers and make sure we are well taken care of!
