JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Excellent. Although we came during a packed time we were seated fairly quickly. I got the pork chef special with cilantro and spicy sausage(Oh my goodness what a great combo suggested by our server). We also got the gyoza and a single pork bun. The pork bun was a fun spin on the traditional Dim sum porkbun (hirata bun style/open face). The gyoza were served hot with a good amount of filling. The Raman noodles could have been a little less done but I enjoyed them and the broth with the sides mixed in and just plain was great. The bowls came out hot but not boiling. It was easy enough to eat without waiting for it to cool. We will likely make a return visit to try some of the other menu items.
