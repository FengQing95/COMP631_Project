Baby Barnaby's////. I enjoyed every single bite. The portions were huge and for the price, it's a damn good deal. I ordered a side of tortillas with mine just because I needed all the carbs apparently lol. Â The portions were so huge that I could finish everything and I notice other people sharing plates so that should speak for its self. The place it's self is pretty small but you won't notice with all that goodness in your plate! You'll definitely be glad you waited.
