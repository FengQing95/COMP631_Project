Uchi////I have been to kuu sushi restaurant and I can say that uchi is by far my favorite sushi restaurant! I am a person that doesn't eat sashimi very well but their sushi's are so fresh! The taste is very unique in a good way. It's a very cozy place with great employees! There's free valet parking in the back and there is always a wait time.
