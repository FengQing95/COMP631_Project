Kata Robata////One of my favorite sushi places! I generally wouldn't choose to eat japanese food in Houston but went with the crowd. It was a surprise, a pleasant one. I'd come back again if I'm in Houston again. The rolls were extremely delish, I can't remember which ones I had. I do remember the nigiri being fresh and tasty. It wasn't even that fusion, which is amazing. Can't wait to visit again!
