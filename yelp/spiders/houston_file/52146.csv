Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////There's a ton of servers roaming the floor.  And that led to some breakdowns in service. Our meals were delivered and the server (not our original order taker) took off like the Flash.  We sat for 5 minutes before we found our original waiter and reminded him we asked for honey, and that we needed salt, pepper & ketchup. He took off and another 5 minutes passed before a third server brought the condiments.  So, a 10 minute wait equals lukewarm food.  A tasty meal that could have been even better with more aware servers.
