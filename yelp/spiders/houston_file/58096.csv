Kata Robata////The bone marrow with toast was..SO YUMMY. The only thing I have to say is the toast seemed to be so airy with various big holes that it made it hard to place my bone marrow on. Other than that, loved it and PRO TIP: don't skip out on the toppings and esp the lime juice. It really gives it another dimension.
