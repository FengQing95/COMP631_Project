Baby Barnaby's////holy barnabys! this place is amazing for breakfast. Tucked away in an unassuming neighborhood, Baby Barnabys is all substance. The coffe was great, green eggs and ham was very flavorful. The boyfriend got a healthy plate and his egg whites were cooked perfectly. The chicken apple sausage on the side was the perfect compliment to the meal. I walked away belly bursting full yet i didnt have that guilty feeling of i just ate a greasy cow. All in all, the food is really fresh and unpretentious. The line is pretty long sometimes but it is definitely worth the wait.
