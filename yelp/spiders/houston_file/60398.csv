Baby Barnaby's////Baby Barnaby's definitely hit the spot for brunch.  If I had never had Breakfast Klub I would give it 5 stars, but it is not in the same category as Breakfast Klub.  Do not get me wrong though, the huevos rancheros and the green eggs were delicious.  I loved the potatoes served with each plate too.
