Kata Robata////The food here is amazing and our waiter was so helpful. He went above and beyond and everything he suggested was so good. I asked our waiter's name before we left because I especially wanted to write a review about him but I can't remember his name since it took me almost 2 months to write this :( I think his name was Paul but I could be wrong.
