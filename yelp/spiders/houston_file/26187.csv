The Pit Room////This place is pricy for what you get. The line moves quickly, however there isn't a lot of seating once you do get your food. The potato salad was delicious--the chopped beef sandwich was just...meh. They had a really great beer selection though. I probably wouldn't be back unless immediately in the area--there's tons of better BBQ places around for a lot less.
