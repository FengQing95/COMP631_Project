Kata Robata////Sorry, I was a huge fan of kata robata until today.  Historically a go to place to get consistently fresh sushi/sashimi.  Today quality was subpar.  I've had grocery store sushi that is better.  Really no excuse for that when you are so busy and should have fast turnover of fish to always serve fresh.  Looks like I'll be coming here much less.
