Baby Barnaby's////Where can you enjoy a 5 dollar breakfast in a comfortable neighborhood setting? Why, Baby Barnaby's of course! I have enjoyed Barnaby's for years now, so it seemed high time to give Baby Barnaby's a try. I think I had been put off by the stories of long waits and sometimes surly service. Let me just say that it is both worth the wait and the service is great.
