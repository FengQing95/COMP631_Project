Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I ordered two cakes from here for a friend's birthday. They were DELICIOUS. People at the party that didn't even like sweets were obsessed. They were decorated beautifully. They were a lot smaller than I thought they were going to be but everyone was happy.
