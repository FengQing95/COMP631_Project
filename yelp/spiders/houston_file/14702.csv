JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Ada - Thanks for your review. I'm glad you enjoyed our fare. But, more importantly, thank you for pointing out the white quartz featured in the community tables. For starters, we clean the white rocks every two weeks, but in these past two weeks we experienced a surge in traffic at JINYA-Midtown, especially among large parties of 6 or more guests.
