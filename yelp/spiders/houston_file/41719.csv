Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have been to paris so I feel I can truly compare it to the bakeries in paris. The bread here is quite soft. You don't need to hear t up and it is still very moist and soft. Most American places' bread become hard. I love the pastries. Always delightful to eat them bc of the texture. The food, such as burgers and small plates are quite tasty as well. Definitely a just try if you visit houston.
