Uchi////I recently went to a Uchi on a Friday evening at 6:30 pm with my girlfriend.  They have valet parking behind the restaurant, but we were lucky and found free street parking nearby.  We don't typically go to Uchi because there's always a long wait, and by no surprise, there was an hour wait when we arrived.  We didn't have any reservations unfortunately.  Luckily, there was open seating near the bar right away, and they actually serve their entire food menu there.  We opted for this option.
