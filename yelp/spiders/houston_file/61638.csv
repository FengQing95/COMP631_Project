Baby Barnaby's////Incredibly rude staff. Upon arriving, there was no host in sight so my pregnant wife attempted to go into the restaurant to check-in. But a male waiter outside shouted to stop her and asked DID YOU SIGN THE CLIPBOARD, as if he was expecting us, as first time visitors, to know where it was. He didn't even instruct us to the location of the clipboard. We were initially excited to take our pup here, but was shocked by the rudeness. Needless to say, we left right away. Glad to be taking our patronage to somewhere else. To the ownership/management - please train your staff on hospitality.
