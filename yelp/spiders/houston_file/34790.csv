Local Foods////Walking into this place, I didnt want to like it. It gives off this chic, central market deli vibe that normally would turn me off. I wanted to get the duck confit sandwich, but they had run out. they had the turkey confit instead, which I accepted begrudgingly. Â I didn't realize that the bread was simple, sliced, whole grain bread which was really unappealing to me.
