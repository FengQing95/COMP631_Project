Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Very friendly staff, took the time to explain the desserts I pointed to and were patient with me. Made my iced vanilla latte just right. I wish they would seep their teas a bit longer though. On another note: Great selection of pastries and they bake their breads every morning-grab a loaf on your way out! (around $4-6 dollars each)
