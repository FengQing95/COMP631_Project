Uchi////Love love love this place. I have been here twice when I visit Houston. I have been here during Happy hour. The service is excellent , I love how they immediately clean the table off trash like even small piece of paper that held the chopsticks together . Each dish is delicate and prepared with much care. Every mouthful is delicious.
