Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////It's a great place for brunch. Their pancakes are the real deal. I tried the chocolate chip pancake, the blackberry pancake (day special) and the pineapple upside down. The blackberry pancake had a nice nutty flavor going with the coconut flakes pairing. The pineapple upside down pancake had me fighting to stop myself from ordering another one. It's fulfilling in a whole different level of yummness!!!!!!
