Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////"This order was probably the single worst experience I've ever had with Favor.  You can see from my patronage, and my usual remarks, that I don't say this lightly.  Even after I spoke with my driver on the phone going over the order, the hash browns came completely undone (ordered extra crispy), 'sandwich I am' was nothing but soyrizo!!  That's right, the rest of the sandwich was not there!!  The hot chocolate was small instead of large, and I got another cold lump of potatoes (?) that I didn't order, came packed with the grill cheese sand.  The thing is, I've ordered this same breakfast twice before and there were no problems anywhere near this.  This ain't right man, this ain't right."
