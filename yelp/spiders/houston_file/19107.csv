Uchi////I have dined at Uchi multiple times and always been pleased by their impeccable quality. Their tasting menu was an exciting prospect that I decided to save for a special occasion. When such an occasion finally came up, we sat at the sushi bar to try to gain the full experience, including the visual aspect of the chefs creations, and what I would have expected would be vivid descriptions of each dish. We got the ten course tasting menu, drinks, and multiple other dishes. Our sushi chef was clearly relatively new, and each time we asked for descriptions of our next tasting menu item, his response was a disappointing "I don't know." Given that this is a reputable restaurant, and the tasting menu is largely meant for food connoiseurs intending to dine for the flavor experience, this was very disappointing. After spending $400 on a dining "experience," I second guessed my initial excitement. Furthermore, I called and emailed the restaurant to see if there was anything to do to rectify the issue, without ever receiving a response. Although their flavors are generally outstanding, this was not the experience I had imagined from Uchi, nor the response I would've expected to receive from such an established restaurant.
