The Pit Room////I was so excited to try my first Texas BBQ and this place didn't disappoint at allllll. My partner and I are not huge beef people but they ran out of chicken and wow I'm glad they did. The brisket was tender, flavorful, and 10/10. The Mac & cheese could use some work. The potato salad was delicious. Would have given 5 stars if not for the Mac & cheese.
