The Pit Room////The place has a cool vibe, very different from the old-school bbq joints. We had brisket and ribs here. While the brisket was very good, the ribs were awful. It was chewy and lacked the texture of perfectly cooked ribs. We asked the folks to replace the ribs with another serving of brisket, and they courteously obliged. The sides were pretty good too!
