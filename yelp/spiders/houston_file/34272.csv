Local Foods////The Truffled Egg Sandwich (6/5) - made me never want to eat anything, ever, except this. Yes, I've had the Crunchy Chicken that everyone seems to rave about, but it can't compare to the Truffled Egg Sandwich. Get the Truffled Egg Sandwich. And eat it. Eat all of it. You WILL be happy.
