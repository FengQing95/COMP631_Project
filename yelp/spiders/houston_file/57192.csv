Kata Robata////Love this place. Always have, always will. Try the Kobe beef skewers, foie gras, chu toro, any of the rolls, the seaweed salad, grilled octopus... really the entire menu is to die for. And our servers are always great. Most recently, Karen had the best recommendations and was super helpful and kind.
