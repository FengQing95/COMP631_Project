Kata Robata////However, menu is pricy.  I came here on Monday (MLK Day) and was told that they don't offer lunch specials on holidays.  This was incredibly disappointing.  I highly recommend restaurant for their creative menu.  However, sushi is good but too pricy if there is no lunch specials...There are many other sushi restaurants in the area that offer better options.
