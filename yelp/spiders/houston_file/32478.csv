Local Foods////The sandwiches here are good, but they are nothing special beyond the merit of the ingredients individually. Of the ones I've tried, the salmon bagel is definitely my favorite. The pretzel buns there are also really yummy. However, I sometimes feel as though the food's main merit is the quality of the individual ingredients and not how they are put together, so most of my meals here have been mediocre. Moreover, I have never left Local Foods full despite the hefty price of their sandwiches (~$10-13) - the portions are pretty small. That said, I really admire what this restaurant is doing with respect to its ingredients and food sustainability, and I think other restaurants should follow suit if they haven't done so already!
