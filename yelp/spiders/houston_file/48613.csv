Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I love this place! It's best to go very early on weekends or during the week, because the wait for tables extends out of the door. I parked across the street at the strip center as Snooze's parking is very limited. The menu is so very creative and the food is absolutely amazing. I love that they support local farmers and vendors. They're listed in the menu. I had the Peach Cobbler Pancakes and Hashbrowns. The portions are great, I could not get over how fresh and delicious the chunks of peaches were. I'm definitely trying the Drunk Monkey French Toast next.
