Kata Robata////- Although $17 seems like a lot to pay for skewers of beef, in my opinion I am shocked it isn't priced $30, ITS THAT GOOD. I have several times told people this is the by far the best thing I have ever eaten in my life, and I still stand by that. It melts in your mouth, and you will want to order another order of them.
