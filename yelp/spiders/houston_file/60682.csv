Baby Barnaby's////Walking up it is not immediately obvious where to enter, but head to the right of regular Barnaby's and you'll find a lovely porch and the entrance to the teeny tiny Baby. As promised there were new choices not featured on the breakfast menus of the other location- I enjoyed the bagels and lox plate while my companion feasted on the pink eggs plate, a concoction of diced ham and eggs that he enjoyed immensely.
