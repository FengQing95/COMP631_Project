JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Sammie K. - Thank you for your review. First and foremost, I regret that you did not enjoy your experience at JINYA. I agree that your server failed his duty by not being able to explain the ingredients to our ramen bowls, and for that I apologize. Based on your review, may I ask if you selected the "Mild" or "Spicy" level for your Spicy Chicken Ramen? The "Mild" option means we do not add any of our signature chili paste or hot sauce, which can be found on the table, but we do add a small amount of chili oil to the bean sprouts as that gives the item more flavor.
