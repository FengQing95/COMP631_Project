Baby Barnaby's////I've been avoiding going to baby barnabys because my first love was (adult??) barnabys cafe on south shepherd and it didn't make sense for me to abandon that for a baby version. But I finally dragged myself food and was delighted to discover that the food is just as legitimate, rich and heavy but packed full of flavor. I might even go as far as to say the decor is even more quaint than the regular barnabys cafe. However, parking is the only downside so if you're going for the green eggs like I usually do, and would rather park comfortably, the regular barnabys offers pretty much the same menu so might as well visit there!
