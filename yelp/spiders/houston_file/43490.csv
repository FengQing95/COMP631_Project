Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Two things make Common Bond an amazing place to go: Incredible baked goods and great customer service. I went here for lunch and got the chicken torta - the chicken was stewed to perfection and served on a deliciously soft bun. The prices may seem a little high, but it is absolutely worth the money.
