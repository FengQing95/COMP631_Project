Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////When I first walked into the cafe, I already knew I was going to like this place. The environment was so fresh and friendly. Looks very vintage with a little bit of modern mixed into it. The food was awesome! I ordered the Croque-Madame and it was absolutely delicious! I had to get some dessert as well, so I went for the Turtle Brownie. It did not disappoint. They have very fancy desserts and it is a bit pricey but it was worth it. The customer service it a great. They were very welcoming!
