Local Foods////IF you are Vegan- read this! I give this place two stars instead of one because I am sure it might be decent if you do not have any dietary restrictions...or if you are treated differently by the person behind the counter. Â I decided to have dinner here after searching for vegan friendly places on Yelp- I am not completely sure how the order is determined for listings of different places, but it came up number four so I read some menu items and saw that they had a few things that were vegan- and thought it sounded great so decided to give it a try.
