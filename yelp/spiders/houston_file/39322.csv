Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Henry was our waiter and he was excellent! As we scrutinized the menu, Henry told us about their hot food items. Everything looked so appetizing. We started with the Frog legs and hush puppies. The frog legs had a pungent flavor. It was almost like eating hot wings, but you knew it wasn't because of the shape. The hush puppies were the size of a gold ball and were savory. Pulled pork was mixed in the hush puppy and it was served with a Carolina barbecue mustard. I was looking for more, but didn't want to be greedy. We also tried the okra. OMG!!!! The okra was cooked to perfection. It wasn't mushy, had a little crunch and had been caramelized in bourbon. Yes, total comfort food heaven!!!! Everything thus has been finger licking good. I really didn't think it could get any better. However, when they brought my entree and I took a spoonful. All, I could say was WOW. I had my coworkers to try my shrimp and grits and they felt the same way. DAMN this is good!!!!! The creole spices, homestead grits mixed with creamy Gouda was paradise. I'll definitely be back for happy hour and more unique comfort food.
