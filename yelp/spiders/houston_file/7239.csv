JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Probably one of my favorite spots to eat ramen in Houston, and it's a chain!  Despite that connotation, Jinya is a very reliable place for a quality ramen menu and I wouldn't hesitate to come back for more.  It's a great date spot too, especially if you're bringing someone uninitiated to the art of ramen.  The accessibility and hipness of the restaurant only helps to bolster the tastiness and quality of the ramen.  I've eaten at both Houston and Clearlake locations, and I'm pretty happy with the ramen served in the Houston area by Jinya.  Two thumbs up and I would definitely come back again.
