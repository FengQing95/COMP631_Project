Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////When I say I am recruiting people to come here, if you ask me where I want to go for breakfast I am most likely going to say here!! I save my cheat days just for Snooze! I get the Juan's tacos and omg it's soooo good, I make No substitutions and it's good EVERYTIME! Now the best thing there is the cinnamon roll pancake, it's is not on the menu but order it! I promise you it is worth every bite! I dance every time I put some in my mouth, the CINNAMON ROLL PANCAKE! DO IT! IT IS SO WORTH IT!! We usually go Sunday after church and usually it's a wait, sometime even an hour wait but trust me on this, it's worth the wait.
