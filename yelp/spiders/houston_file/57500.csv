Kata Robata////This was our first visit for our wedding anniversary and it was amazing. We had a little hiccup when we first walked in due to nobody greeting us or acknowledging us. But Sean (forgive me if I didn't spell it correctly) was amazing. He is so attentive and friendly. He's on point and knows the menu. Very knowledgeable and knows what to recommend. Thank you for such an awesome experience. We will be back soon. Food is amazing.
