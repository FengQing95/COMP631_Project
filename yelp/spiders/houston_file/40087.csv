Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Absolutely loved this place. The service was good, the food was even better! I got the Banana, almond protein pancakes, chicken sausage and egg whites, super healthy and very very tasty. The drinks were good too. My friends got some pulled pork egg Benedict and they also loved it.
