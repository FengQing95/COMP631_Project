Kata Robata////OK, this is my favorite Sushi place in Houston.  Free parking.  Fabulously modern decor.  Very attentive waitstaff.  My favorite dishes: sake mussels, ramen, tropical roll, anything off the robata, friend whole flounder (when they have it - enough for four people).  They used to have a capirinha, but I think they took it off the menu-boo hoo.  I wish their kitchen stayed open later for nibbles!!!
