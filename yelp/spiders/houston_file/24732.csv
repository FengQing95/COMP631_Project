Uchi////A dish that fell short (very short) of expectations was the hot rock beef. Though it might make for a great Instagram pic or addition to your snapchat story, don't expect much else. For $17.50, you'll recieve 5 small pieces of "wagyu" that taste like average sirloin, accompanied by a simple ponzu dipping sauce. It's by no means bad-tasting, but I'd reccomend spending that money on a few sirloins at HEB, or at least any other dish on the menu.
