Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Excellent customer service!! I ordered a custom cake on a Tuesday to pick up on Saturday. When I went to get my cake there was a mix up and it wasn't ready. The manager was extremely apologetic and offered to deliver the cake to my house Sunday morning, so that I would have it for my party Sunday afternoon. I was a little nervous as I wanted to see the cake and make any changes in case it was plainer than I wanted, but that was really the only option. Fast forward to Sunday; the cake was delivered earlier than promised which I appreciated so much and most importantly, it was incredibly gorgeous! One of the prettiest cakes I have ever seen! I was so impressed - it truly was art! When the time came to serve it, I was actually sad to cut into it and never imagined it would taste even half as good as it looked, but of course it did! It was exceptional. We talked about it for days!!  Common Bond hits the trifecta of fantastic food, beautiful presentation, and exceptional customer service. They are a unicorn in this busy city and everyone loves unicorns  I will be a customer for life.
