Kata Robata////Yum! Came here for lunch for 2 on a Thursday without resos. They told me 10-15 min wait but actually took less than 5 min. Busy spot. I had their fried tofu, mixed mushroom, asian truffle oil sauce. Vegan friendly. Beautifully presented. Fast responsive service. Apparently Texans JJ Watt is a regular. Hope I see him next time!
