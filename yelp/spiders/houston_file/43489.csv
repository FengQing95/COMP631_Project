Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First time trying this place for my boyfriends birthday after seeing all the positive reviews ... pastries looked good but aren't very good (Kraftsmen is a lot better). My latte came out spilled and lukewarm. The egg scramble came mildly warm.. overall not impressed
