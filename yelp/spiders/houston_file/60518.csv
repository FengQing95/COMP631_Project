Baby Barnaby's////The wait was lengthy but to be expected for a Sunday morning. Once we were seated and ordered, the food came very fast. My green eggs were swimming in oil. I'm still tasting oil, ick. Beyond the oil, I could tell they had some good flavor in there and was sad it was masked by the heavy oil. The chicken sausage is just not good and not a sausage I would consider breakfast-y. The chunks of apple in it were so unappealing. The potatoes were excellent, however, and they graciously let me substitute an english muffin instead of the toast. My husband ordered the corned beef hash and he said it wasn't the least bit "hashy" but nevertheless, it was good. On our walk out I was admiring some girls pancake, which was enormous and looked amazing. I should have just gotten that.
