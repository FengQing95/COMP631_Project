Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Since its opening I've been here a few times, mostly for the desserts and other bakery items since the kitchen timings are fairly limited (closes at 3pm). The macarons are divine - possibly the best I've had in Houston. But was finally able to come in at lunchtime last week and had the Quinoa Salad, and holy crap, this ain't your Grandma's quinoa salad (assuming your grandma is a 20-something hipster). It was a warm salad with some ridiculously delicious sauce at the bottom and topped with fried oysters. I was so excited about how good it was that I had to text my friends about it immediately, mostly so I could keep myself occupied and avoid fulfilling the urge to shovel the entire contents of the bowl into my mouth. One must at least maintain the illusion of being poised and lady-like, but be warned, it'll be hard to do at Common Bond.
