Kata Robata////I feel like I was cheating on Jus' Mac by even coming to check it out ... but since I was here, you might as well. This is the one dish that all crustacean gangstas' such as myself dream about. I have attached a photo - but you might want to prepare yourself, like you would before attending a Tenacious D concert if you have seen the Complete Masterworks DVD. Delicious lobster. Savory. And not hunks of it. They are thoughtful pieces, delicately inset like rubies in a tiara. The cheese is creamy, bold, and tasty - not overpowering, but addictive. The noodles are all individually cared for and cooked perfectly - there is no odd Blue Box of Mac and Cheese grocery store nightmare where your thoughtlessness of tossing back shots of bourbon while you cook it leads to some scorched noodles, some rock hard ones on the edge, and some really slippery odd ones in the center. Overall, someone gave this dish a lot of love in the back and it shows. The thoughtful placement of the lobster shell is just a final smiley face on your meal that things are alright.
