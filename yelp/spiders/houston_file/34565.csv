Local Foods////Parking was plentiful in their little lot they share with the places next to them. Interior was nice and clean. Servers and cashiers were nice. Food came out at a good time (albeit we were the first ones there so that's a bit biased). I was a little meh about price point first but after considering where they source their ingredients (I actually have no idea if they source locally but I'm just gonna give them the benefit of a doubt since it's in the name) and the overall execution of the food, I'm totally down with making this a go-to spot.
