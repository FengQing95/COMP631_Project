Local Foods////Local foods is like heaven for people who want to feel like they're eating healthy food, and for the most part it is very healthy, though the portions can be way bigger than you think! Every ingredient they use is just so fresh, you can't go wrong. There's limited outside seating and it's overlooking a side street, but still a nice treat if you're there on a day when the weather is actually nice in Houston. The whole place is very casual. The parking lot in front is almost always packed full so try a side street of you're trying to come here during lunch on a weekend for instance.
