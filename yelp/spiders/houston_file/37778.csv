Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat - Nice ambience. A little loud on the music. When I found myself shouting at my friend, I reached out to the manager and he was very accommodating. Our waiters, James and Terry were fab-bu-lous. Food was great and the cocktails did the job. Great spot for after work drinks/date night/large groups and if you're really not sure what to do with your time.
