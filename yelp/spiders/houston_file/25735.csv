The Pit Room////Nice clean small space. I ordered the 2 meat plate. The lean slice beef - 5 stars - the flavor was so good and smoky!! The meat was tender and of high quality. Much better than other BBQ joints I've tried in houston! The jalape√±o pork sausage was good too! Nice and spicy- semi well done just how I like it. I was nervous when I saw it had cheese in it but it was good. They need help with their sides. The choices were different for me at a BBQ joint but I guess bc it is Mexican - infused BBQ. I had the charro beans which I felt lacked a little flavor and potato salad which wasn't bad at all - I just didn't eat it bc of the semi runny texture. I am picky about my potato salad. The BBQ sauce had a weird vinegar smell and watery texture. It did not taste good. The bread was fresh. The price was too expensive compared to other places. Over all I would return bc it's hard to find BBQ restaurants around here where the meat tastes like it is straight off the pit!!
