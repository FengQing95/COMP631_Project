Local Foods////This place is fine.  The day we went all the sides were a bit "one note."  The sandwiches are good but neither my wife nor I had anything more than a 3-star experience.  I have several friends that think this place is the greatest thing to happen to food since Prometheus brought us fire, but I'm definitely not in that camp.
