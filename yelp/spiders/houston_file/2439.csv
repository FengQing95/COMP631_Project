JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////After falling in love with Ramen Tatsuya in Austin, I had to give this place a try. Overall I was very pleased. I had the takoyaki, which I have never had before, and it was delicious. Then I ate the Tonkatsu black with the spicy ground pork added into it. The ramen was pretty great also. I felt like the egg could have been better though. It was a little overcooked, and the flavor just did not compare to the marinated egg at Ramen Tatsuya. Overall I'd like to go back and possibly try something different and see if this place can't earn my 5th star, but as for now it falls just a little short of deserving it.
