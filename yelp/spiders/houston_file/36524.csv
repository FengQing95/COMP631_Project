Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We came here with a big group of friends and they accommodated us quickly. They have excellent whiskey and bourbon drinks!!! They decorated with a very modern industrial vibe, which I loved!! The food is delicious. We tried the Mac and cheese, Brussel sprouts, and the salmon; all were great. At night they have a DJ who sets a fun atmosphere for restaurant transition to bar! We will come back!
