Local Foods////I come here for the delicious duck sandwich, which is available only during winter time. I can't even describe it - it's so good!  Wish they served it year round bc I'd visit more often.  Also wish they had a more kid friendly menu.  Cool place for lunch with a casual atmosphere in a great location!
