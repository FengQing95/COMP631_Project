Snooze, an A.M. Eatery//// As we all know it is a franchise place from Colorado, and when it first opened it required 40-50minwait. They use local ingredients to cook the very best quality of food possible. Very friendly , casual/ ambient atmosphere. Somewhat hipster like. Easy going yet energetic vibe. You have the option of sitting inside or sitting out side on their patio. I highly recommend sitting indoors since you'll be facing bunch of ppl waiting or Parkin lot while eating.
