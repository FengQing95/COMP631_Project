Uchi////Like other reviewers commented: it's expensive. Don't think you're going to get out of their for less than $100 per person. It's a great place to celebrate though and there's enough variety to suit just about everyone's palate. There's even a vegetarian tasting menu (incidentally, I chose this place for the gift certificate because the beneficiary is vegetarian).
