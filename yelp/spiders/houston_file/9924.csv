JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My boyfriend and I were hungry so we came here for a late night snack. 15 minute wait, not too bad. We also ordered our food within seconds of getting seated. Staff was nice but they definitely rushed our food. My boyfriend order a Spicy Tonkotsu Black, however, the shell was still attached to his egg. The manager was notified and we were given a 10% discount?
