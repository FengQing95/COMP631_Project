Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////One of my favorite whisky bars. Where do I begin.... first and foremost I'm a sucker for whisky and this place has an impressive selection. I often come here to sample things that either i haven't had and want to purchase or can't purchase due to limited availability. The layout is nice especially when they have the pull up doors on the side open. Now, the prices aren't cheap it's not for anyone on a budget but the drinks selection/cocktails are excellent are well worth it. The bartenders are knowledgeable which I also appreciate, not just drink pourers who don't know their stuff.
