Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great food! There is too long of a wait though (not necessarily the restaurant's problem - being busy is good for business). 2+ hour wait on a Saturday. I recommend ordering it to go. I was able to call it in, pick it up, and eat at my house in less than an hour. It would've been a lot longer otherwise.
