Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Loveeeee the Kugelhopf!!! The croissants here are very well made crisp outside and fluffy inside. Macaroons are delicious too but on the pricey side. Their savory brunch items are very limited, tried some of their ever changing savory items and they were pretty good. Go before 1 or they'll start running out of the best items and the lines will be too long and parking a pain. Oh also all of their espresso drinks are delicious.
