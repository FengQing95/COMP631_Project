Kata Robata////A very late review. Dined in october 2019. A little disappointed on the service up front. Called for an omakase reservation and when we arrived, they said they didn't have us down for omakase. And then told us that the omakase chef isn't here on Wednesdays and Sundays, which I wish was mentioned over the phone! My boyfriend and I wanted omakase to celebrate our anniversary, but we were really disappointed.
