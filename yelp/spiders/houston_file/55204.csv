Kata Robata////For starter, we ordered seafood sashimi salad to share and it was amazing. The fish was very fresh and salad is just delightful. We also ordered a roll of rising sun, kakuni pork belly, Texas Kobe beef skewer, and hamachi and jalape√±o sashima. The waiter said they have the best rising sun roll here and he did not lie. OMG! It is to die for. I wasn't a big fan of the kobe beef and the pork belly but that's more of my issue than the restaurant.
