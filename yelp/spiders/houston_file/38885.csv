Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Shrimp and grits were good! Wish I would've gotten more grits. Plenty of shrimp tho. Not too cheesy, great flavor. My homegirls for the ribs chilaquiles and the presentation was horrible. It looked like meatloaf. She said the food was good tho but I would've positioned the meat in the center and the chips on the outside so one can see that entire entree.
