The Pit Room////I came here with my mom for lunch right when it opened and there was already a line. That's how you know it's poppin! My mom and I shared the two meat dinner which comes with two sides and one slice of white bread. We decided to get the brisket and the venison sausage (black pepper and garlic), mac n cheese, and charro beans. Overall, everything was delicious! The quality of the meats were very good. The brisket was tender, juicy, and it's so tasty when you eat it with jalapenos! I really liked the mac n cheese too. I can't wait to come back and try the other meats!
