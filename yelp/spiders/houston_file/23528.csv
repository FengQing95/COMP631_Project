Uchi////Gyutan ($7): 1/5 Now this irked me. Weirdly cut piece of beef tongue on a balled up piece of rice with some lime zest on top. Not bad, but certainly not good, especially for the price. I've seen pieces of this same sushi done very differently, so I feel like they skimped out on the sake social servings, which doesn't feel justified to me as I'm paying $3.50 for a piece of meat on rice.
