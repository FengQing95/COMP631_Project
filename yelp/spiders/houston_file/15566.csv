JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Good ramen place in downtown Houston. It isn't the best ramen I've had but it is a solid ramen place. We got the Jinya Tonkotsu Black and Sprouting Up ramen. Both were good but the Tonkotsu Black one was better. We made one of the ramen's a combo and had gyoza and salad. Both were good. The ambience and service was excellent.
