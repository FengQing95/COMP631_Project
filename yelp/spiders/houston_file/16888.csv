JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Their chicken charsu meat was very lean yet tender and the vegetables helped mellow out the spiciness of the broth so that the flavor won't overpower and potentially ruin the experience. Â For those that cannot handle spicy...I recommend the broth to be "mild" in spiciness. If you're up for a challenge...then the spicy hot is the way to go.
