JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////While Visiting from out of town we stumbled on this gem. The Brussels sprouts are amazing, the spicy chicken is delicious and not too spicy at all, the current special, Kara-Men, was so yum and spicy. Hansel was our server and he was amazing. He made great recommendations and had no problem subbing ground chicken for pork on our ramen dishes. They almost lost a star for the hostess staff who was not so welcoming but the server and food totally recovered the star. I Definitely would come here again if I was in the area!
