The Pit Room////Had high hopes but it didn't live up to it. Pricey place for small servings. Had the 3 meat and the 3 taco dinners and some more sides. All 3 meats were dry. Like no moisture . Â Barely any meat for the dinner. Got a side of corn for my little boy and it was $4. Like a cup worth of plain corn. The sides servings are little small. Killens is killin them
