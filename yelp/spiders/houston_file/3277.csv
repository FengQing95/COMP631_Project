JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We just recently changed to our new menus only a week ago and I took the liberty of making sure that each ramen description specifically state what is included in the ramen so as to prevent misunderstandings. I'm so sorry the egg issue got out of hand and got you upset. This should never be the case and I will discuss this issue with my staff. I value my guests and understand that it takes years to earn customers and minutes to lose them. I appreciate your patronage and hope that you give us another chance to make things right for you.
