JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My experience at this Establishment was by far not the best! Being a tourist in Texas for the Anime Matsuri convention I really wanted to try and get me some decent Ramen so I looked up on Yelp for some Nearby highly rated Ramen for me and my friends to go try out, the food I won't lie it was decent and the atmosphere was Okay until the female manager came around and approached us pretty hostile when my buddy was letting one of the servers knew that they got his ordered mixed up, she was quite frankly unprofessional and very rude for a problem that could have been fixed without a hassle but she made it into a big deal! Honestly I left really unsatisfied with that experience and will rethink on ever coming back to this establishment ESPECIALLY this exact location.
