Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Probably my favorite place in Houston for brunch! This has become a team request, and I'm often scheduling our morning meetings here because there is something on the menu for everyone. It's not super accommodating for large groups 6+ but worth the squeeze because the food is just that good! Parking is a bit of a challenge because of location and sometimes a wait but, again, worth it. They serve coffee while you hang out so grab a cup and stay, you'll be glad you did. Best Eggs Benedict in town and the Hash is legit.
