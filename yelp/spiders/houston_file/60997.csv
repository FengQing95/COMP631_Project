Baby Barnaby's////As for the food, it was delicious. I had the pesto chicken salad sandwich, which I highly recommend. Their sweet potato fries and Mac and cheese were awesome. Prices were very affordable. Portions were huge (sandwiches could easily feed 2 for lunch). Their menu has a great variety so everyone can find something they'll like. I can't wait to try some of their other sandwiches and salads as well as their breakfast food. Â Great place and I will definitely return!!!
