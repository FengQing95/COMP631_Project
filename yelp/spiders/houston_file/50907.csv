Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We went with a 2 hour window because we read about the 1.5 hour and 2 hour waits on reviews - but I was told it would be just 25-30 minutes, and the place does not seem that busy. Then we observed the slow/uncaring staff mulling through the day, witnessed the unfriendly and unmotivated hostess - then got a quirky and forgetful waitress - then, who knows who is in the kitchen. It's pretty obvious this "team" just DOESN'T CARE. As long as the owner and manager allow this to continue - and, it's pretty clear they do not care - I can tell you with 100% certainty this customer definitely does not care to EVER eat here again.
