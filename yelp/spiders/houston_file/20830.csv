Uchi////- The complimentary Peanut Butter Semifreddo came to us as a surprise. Like the super-awesome kind of gift that only comes when your birthday falls on Christmas. Again, it's like peanut butter and apples you ate as a toddler, but maybe it went to college, "experimented a little", and eventually earned a B.S. in psych. I almost liked this more than the Fried Milk... Please don't hit me.
