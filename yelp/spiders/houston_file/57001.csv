Kata Robata////I had read the great reviews about the miso lobster Mac and cheese so as a connoisseur of Mac and cheese I had to have it--TRULY IMPRESSIVE was my initial reaction. And by the time my plate was empty I truly questioned if I could handle dessert. This dish absolutely lives up to its high praise
