Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Delish! We got the Pancake flight, tacos, and one of the Benadicts. All were very very good! The peanut butter cup pancake is super rich but good, sweet pot is nice and sweet but also light?, The pineapple was soooooooooo good! Only down side is they do not offer coconut milk in coffee which is tastier in coffee vs almond milk for dairy free options.
