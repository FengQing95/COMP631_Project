Uchi////My girlfriend and I decided to celebrate a late Valentine's dinner @ Uchi. We had a reservation for 8:30 but didn't get sat until 9. People linger, and stay longer, can't hold the restaurant accountable for that. Our waitress was Kaitlynn, super helpful and got us started with the tasting menu.
