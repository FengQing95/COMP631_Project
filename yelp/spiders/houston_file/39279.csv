Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came in for a Sunday brunch,  make a reservation or show up early! We were there at 11 (when it opens) and there was quite the line outside. We ordered a Spicy Bloody Mary, and one of their brunch cocktails (Knuckle Up) made with Knob Creek along with avocado toast.  The drinks were delicious but the toast lacked a bit of seasoning. For our main dish we split the breakfast burrito which was just alright. Service was great and so were the tunes. They may be loud for some people's liking, but we were jammin!
