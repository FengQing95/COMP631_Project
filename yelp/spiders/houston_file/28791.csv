The Pit Room////As we were eating a staff member walked around and was super friendly asking how everything was. Super sweet. My sister got a to go box and put her food in it and wanted some of their pickles. The same staff member went and got her a nice plastic Tupperware container for my sister to take some of their pickles to go. She was so happy. Lastly as we were walking out a guy comes from around the corner with a plastic bag for all her food and bags it for her right before we made it to the door.
