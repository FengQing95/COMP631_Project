Uchi////I love Uchi! Every time I come here, it's a great experience! I love that everything tastes so unique and every dish is a conversation piece. The fish is amazingly flavorful. I recommend the fried ice cream or peanut butter panna cotta for dessert. The yokai berry cold dish is amazing! The scallop sushi is fresh. The biendo roll has a great dipping sauce and is wonderfully refreshing. The kanburi crudo is scrumptious as well. Basically you can't go wrong with anything on the menu! I want to be there right now!
