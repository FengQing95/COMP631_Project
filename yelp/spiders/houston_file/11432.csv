JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Natalie - Wow, thanks for the 5-star review! And, of course, Welcome to Houston! We're very honored to have been one of your appointment-dinner destinations, and we're pleased that we met your expectations. Unfortunately, we do often experience a wait during peak hours, so thanks for your understanding in that regard. In the coming year, we will be opening two more JINYA outposts in Katy and Willowbrook, so hopefully you won't have to travel so far to get your ramen fix. On behalf of my entire crew, I thank you for the kind words, and we look forward to serving you again in the near future!
