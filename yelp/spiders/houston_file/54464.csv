Kata Robata////Anyway, the decor is modern with clean lines. The presentation of the dishes was quite surprising. Most sushi places don't try this hard to impress the eyes. I have to say, many of the items on the appetizer lists made me raise an eyebrow, but when we tried them, we were pleasantly surprised!
