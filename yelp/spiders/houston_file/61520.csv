Baby Barnaby's////Food: 4/5 They're known for their green eggs and ham, so I HAD to try it since it was my first time! Their eggs are perfectly scrambled with cheese, spinach, and artichoke (think of spinach and artichoke dip in a scrambled egg form) with a massive amount of potatoes that were roasted, seasoned perfectly, and crispy on the outside. It also came with toast and chicken apple sausage which was nicely grilled and charred ! I can definitely see why it's recommended.
