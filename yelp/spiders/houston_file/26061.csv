The Pit Room////My wife and I have been fans of this place since day one. Now we find ourselves at the pit room/patio at least 3 times a week. The staff is awesome, the BBQ is done better than most I've had. And believe me, I've had alot of BBQ in Texas. I say yes, yes, yes... Great for special events as well. Pet friendly patio is awesome.
