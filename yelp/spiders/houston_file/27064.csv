The Pit Room////We were so excited to eat here based on the reviews. We arrived around 12:00 on a Saturday and had to stand in line outside to get in. Good sign, right? My husband and I were both soooooo disappointed. We both opted for the beef brisket, and granted, it might have just been a bad brisket day, but the brisket had no flavor except for smoke. Now, I love a good smoky piece of meat, but I kept trying to taste the beef but all I could taste was smoke with every chew. The meat was moist and tender and had a good char on it, but neither of us could eat it. I chose the charro beans as a side, and boy did they look yummy- but, they were bland and again, all I could taste was the smoky taste left behind by the brisket. They had roasted green beans as a side special that day and they were delicious.
