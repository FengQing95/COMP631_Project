Uchi////+ Uchiviche - salmon, striped bass, cherry tomotoes, yellow bell peppers, garlic, cilantro, raisins and a bit of citrus. Picking up as much as I could with my chopsticks, it was a delicious little bite! The meatiness of both fish along with the little bit of sour of the citrus and sweetness of raisins and all the textures fit well together.
