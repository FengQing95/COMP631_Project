Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Crisia is the besttttttttttttt. The staff is super friendly, and they helped me resolve an issue with the food that was brought out with no issues. Great service, big league. Mimosa always full. So full. Believe me. The only downside is that it's so loud in here with all of the concrete and no reverberation padding.
