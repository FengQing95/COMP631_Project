Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went here with my friends for a late dinner and it was great! I ordered the BBQ Porchetta Sandwich ($14) with a side of Bosscat fries ($6). More on the higher-end side for a burger and fries but it was worth it! Burger tasted amazing! Fries were HUGE! Servers were attentive and nice! Definitely would come again!
