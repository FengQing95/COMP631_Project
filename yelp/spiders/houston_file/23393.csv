Uchi////Then something cool happened. We noticed a reindeer moss dish on the menu and were talking to the chefs about what it entailed. Then they looked at the rest of what we ordered and came up with a custom dish for us including the reindeer moss. And it was awesome. There were grilled/roasted mushrooms in it and it was artistically just a beautiful dish. Then came the pitchfork makimono. Again, a delicious roll. I also had the akami sashimi (tuna loin) and it was decent but it didn't feel as fresh as the rest of the meal. Then there was the wagyu sashimi... it is amazing. Also a must get dish.
