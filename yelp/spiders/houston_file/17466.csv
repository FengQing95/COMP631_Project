Uchi////The food here is phenomenal. Carefully crafted sushi and a variety of hot and cold dishes are served family style. The fish is incredibly fresh and often needs little adornment. We have been twice since it opened at the beginning of the month and have had a huge variety of amazing food. Some of our favorites have been the machi cure (yellowtail, yucca chips, marcona almonds, garlic and pear, served as finger food) and uchiviche (melt in your mouth bites of salmon and striper marinated with bell pepper. The makimono are fantastically composed (the California roll is fresh and delicious, not just the filler that I usually think it is) and you can't go wrong with the sushi. Desserts are light and unusual. We had a cardamom creme brulee special that was served with carrot sorbet and a variety of other tastes. The fried milk off of the regular dessert menu is also a winner, not nearly as heavy as its name would imply.
