JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I really enjoy coming here.  They have a pretty cool selection of sake, which is great bc its normally packed and it helps the wait lol.  I love all varieties of anything spicy, so they win there, however I have a soft spot for the spicy chicken ramen.  I love that seating is available by the kitchen...the cooks work really hard and seem to enjoy what they do.  Maybe thats why the ramen is delish!
