Uchi////The food here is amazing. However, last night I was sitting at the table next to the restroom. I got up to use it - no one between me and the restroom. Â A host or waitress comes running over shouting that I have to wear a mask to use the restroom. I had to go back to my table to get one. And then again walk to the bathroom - no one near me. Completely ridiculous and embarrassing.
