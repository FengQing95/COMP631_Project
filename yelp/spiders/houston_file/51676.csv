Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So, the food is quite tasty in a diabetes-inducing kind of way in reference to pancakes and other sugar-laden treats.   The ambience, and I guess some diners like it, made us extremely uncomfortable. The music is super loud and jarring and not in sync with chill morning vibes.  Parking is a major hassle at this location.  But if u like blaring music and sugary treats, go check it out.
