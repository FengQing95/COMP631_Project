JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Really good ramen but a little overpriced.  This is one of the better ramen places in Houston.  I have tried the Tonkatsu Black and the Cha Cha both were good.  The Tonkatsu Black is fantastic, broth and noodles were good.  The Cha Cha has the thicker egg noodles which I was hesitant to try but ended up loving it.
