Uchi////Amazing! Amazing! I am a huge sushi connoisseur and have extremely high standards. Having not tried Sushi in Houston Uchi is by far on-par and over delivers. The attention to detail is evident from the moment you walk into this Sushi Oasis. The girls at the front are pleasant and professional. I sat at the bar and Patrick was outstanding. My experience began with a hot towel and a complimentary shot of traditional Japanese sake and a warm towel. The hot rock was excellent with melting wagyu beef. I enjoyed the biendo roll and yellow tail sushimi. If you like quality, sushi and artistry, uchi is your place!
