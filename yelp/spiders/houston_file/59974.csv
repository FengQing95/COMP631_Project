Baby Barnaby's////This is one of the best places for breakfast in Houston. (My husband loves breakfast so we have been to many breakfast places, some a hit, some not.) The worst thing about Baby Barnaby's is the wait on the weekends. The staff is always friendly. The orange juice is fresh and you can watch it being squeezed in front of you. I loved the green eggs and the bagel and lox. Anything is good on the menu though, and prices are VERY reasonable. I actually love to come here if I'm off on a weekday to enjoy breakfast and a book.
