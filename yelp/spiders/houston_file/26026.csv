The Pit Room////I like that even when it's busy, they move the live fast!  The servers seemed tired but it's all about the food. Good brisket and sausage. The sides are good, specially the Mac and cheese.  Good selection of Texas beers! Sometimes if you get there late in the day, they will run out of some of the meats
