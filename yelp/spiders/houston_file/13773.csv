JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As other yelpers have mentioned parking can be bit of a challenge but recommend valeting around the corner inside the residential unit, which payment is based on gratuity.  If you plan on coming during lunch better get here no later than say 11:30 a.m. otherwise seating can be tough, but many times there's room at the bar.
