JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have to start by saying that I'm not a connoisseur of ramen but I thoroughly enjoyed my chicken ramen here. I actually got the chicken wonton ramen and the wontons were the star of my dish. Definitely recommend this place. It also has a great atmosphere for hanging with friends or a date.
