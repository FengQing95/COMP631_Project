JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My absolute favorite place for Ramen. I always make the trip to go because I am NEVER disappointed with the food or service. the Takoyaki is one of the best in town!! A MUST try if you go there. The Lychee Mojito incredible and the only kind of mojito I'd ever actually like. It's always packed for a reason ;) Well worth the wait though. I highly recommend parking in the 24 hour fitness garage because it's free and easier than driving around for street parking. The menu has something for everyone from salads to buns. I LOVE JINYA
