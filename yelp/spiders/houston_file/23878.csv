Uchi////Uchi is my all time favorite spot for anything sushi. My boyfriend and I come here at least 2x a month, sometimes once a week. I love it. Be prepared for a wait of 45+ min without reservations. We walk in a lot anyways and will have a drink and appetizers on the patio. It's worth the wait. And happy hour is always great as well.
