Kata Robata////Love the food here (really pricey but delicious). The 2-star review is based on the service. First the hostesses are very rude. There is never any pleasantries. The moment we walk in, there is no "hello" or "welcome"... it's always just snapping "do you have a reservation!?". After taking information down, they are quite rude about demanding (almost kicking) people outside to wait for a table. I understand there is no waiting area, but there is a professional and courteous way of requesting or guiding people. The servers are really not much better. They are short with customers and walk off while people are still talking or asking questions. I really love the food here but the experience is frustrating. And I don't think customers paying $$$$ should feel that way.
