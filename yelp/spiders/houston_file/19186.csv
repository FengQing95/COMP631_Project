Uchi////geoduck, golden plum, radish, iberico ham, red curry: I've never had geoduck before because I heard it wasn't that good so I don't know what to compare it to. I did enjoy this dish though. The texture of the geoduck was almost like calamari to me, maybe a little tougher. The plum added a nice sweetness, the radish a nice crunch. I actually don't remember the curry.
