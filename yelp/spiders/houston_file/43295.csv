Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love their macarons. I know, I know. Everyone says try the pastries and ignore the macarons but I could not say no. I tried the salted caramel macaron as well as the chocolate and the flavors and texture were incredible. I love the dense and chewy interior paired with the crunch of the smooth shell. Incredibly well done and will definitely be back to try more of their other options. (If I can somehow resist the temptation of the macarons)
