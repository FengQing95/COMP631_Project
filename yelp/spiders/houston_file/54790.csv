Kata Robata////Their Spicy Ramen is (surprisingly) delicious. I have had better noodles, but the broth is milky with just the right amount of spice. Instead of Pork Belly, they use braised pork (looks / tastes like ground pork) which was still tender and flavorful. Not bad for Houston ramen! Also a rather large portion, so come hungry!
