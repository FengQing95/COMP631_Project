Baby Barnaby's////While the food was good, the experience with the person waiting on our table was horrible. Thus the reason for the rating.. Live out in Katy so this was our first time here, it was a Saturday so there was a long wait which we expected so no issue there. However, when we were able to be seated our server Scott started off somewhat friendly; then I asked if they had straws (since some places no longer provide straws. I didn't want to assume....again our 1st time here. Well the response I received was "do you want to know if we have straws or do you want one?" This took me aback as I certainly didn't expect that after the long wait. Was the sarcasm really necessary? 1st strike.....then the horrible attitude continued. After our food was delivered by another server (much nicer) the waiter came to check on us asking if we needed anything. We indicated that we didn't. He then proceeded to say "no salsa" to which I said no, his response was "really I thought you for sure would want salsa" someone at our table pointed out that the comment was not okay & racist. He quickly said I mean because she is SPICY. Really? Not necessary. Note: I am a dark skin Latina...that comment again was uncalled for. I am a business professional & not usually offended by people like this & their ignorance but honestly it was clear to me that he was racist & should not be serving people. I literally cried on our way home...the whole experience made me feel horrible. I do not recommend this place which if it were based on food it could be 4 stars.
