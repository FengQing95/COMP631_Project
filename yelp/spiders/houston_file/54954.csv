Kata Robata////Let me brief you on my feelings about ramen. To me ramen is something that I grew up with eating out of a bag, so ramen... is just ramen. I've eaten $15 ramen at Ippudo NYC (and where we ran into Anne Burrell) and I thought it was okay. I've had Chef Takashi Yagihashi's $15 ramen in Chicago. I've had a couple other places in Houston and nothing has impressed me. Kata is probably the only place where I've had ramen and said "wow." Yes, that good. The end.
