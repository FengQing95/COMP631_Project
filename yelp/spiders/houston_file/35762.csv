Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////They also did something that I have done. Use both caramelized onions (umami galore) AND fresh purple onions for the crunch and onion-sulfur-bite. Delish! And the best part was their fries. They cut their potatoes into meaty planks, fry 'em and dust them with their house seasoning. (I normally hate seasoned fries since they all taste like Sysco products.). These are obviously done in-house from scratch. The seasoning and crunchy fires are paired with house-made ketchup. Their ketchup uses "Chow-Chow" in the recipe. Chow-chow is an old school Southern condiment, and I gotta say these were the best fries I have had in Houston in 10 years. (I don't give that praise often, only when deserved.) Just friggin' awesome!
