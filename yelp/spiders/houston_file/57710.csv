Kata Robata////The restaurant didn't look that full, but it was pretty loud. It was difficult talking to my boyfriend because we don't usually talk loudly. The lighting is really dim and we sat near the back, close to the door to their tables outside. Every time that door opened, there was a cold breeze and there was a big party eating back there. I was pretty cold all night due to that.
