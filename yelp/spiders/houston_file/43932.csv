Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Mai's guest reviewer: the cool down in the weather and the confluence of hipsterdom along montrose brought many ppl here today. Luckily the food was pretty good. However they need more bigger water cups. I had to refill too many times. As I write this my water is filled so a few redemption points there. Everything that Mai said.
