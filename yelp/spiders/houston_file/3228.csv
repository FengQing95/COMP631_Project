JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ordered Tonkatsu Black and ramen is pretty good if the bartender hadn't stuck her thumb into my bowl as she pass it over across the bar. I think the staff was trying to say "irasshai" but sounded more like a muffled "shy". It was kind of irritating to listen them them YELL it as they walked by to seat EVERY table. It's a greeting not a public service announcement. I realize you don't go to an Asian restaurant for service but this isn't Chinatown. Avoid sitting at the bar.
