Kata Robata////I have not tried the sushi, which is supposed to be pretty good, but the ramen today was subpar. The atmosphere in the restaurant was nice but the aesthetic pleasantness did not make up for the lukewarm, bland broth and undercooked noodles. I have to say it, will be difficult for someone to convince me to revisit this establishment.
