Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////5 stars! I love coming to Bosscat, because of the nice, lit scenery and helpful people that are here to serve you! The manager Jose Chancoy is super friendly and is willing to hear your experience and our waiter Omar P. had the best service to give at our table. Hands down! I'd recommend sitting in his section when you come because he will take the BEST care of you! They have a patio to sit outside with your fellow mates or the bar where they have exotic drinks and wine to crave your thirst. This family-filled restaurant is a must or a night out event with your friends to catch up is the perfect vibe! The servers are knowledgeable about all the refreshments and the food is one of the best in town. I ordered the mouth watering oysters to set the beginning mood, which led me to order a nice, sizzling grilled steak (medium rare) for my entree. They have a DJ in front on the weekends to ply the latest music and pretty lights to make the place a warm welcome. Definitely going back!
