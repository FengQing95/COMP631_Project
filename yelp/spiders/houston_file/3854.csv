JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jake - Thanks for your review. I'm not sure I agree (or fully understand) your description of "draining your ramen water, rinsing the noodles, and adding in fresh, hot water when making the broth." Our ramen broth takes more than a dozen hours to prepare, and we have a dedicated chef whose sole job is to oversee its production. So for that reason, while I do respect for your opinion to which you are fully entitled, I must take umbrage since I know how much work goes into our process.
