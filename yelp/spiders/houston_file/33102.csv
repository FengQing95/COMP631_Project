Local Foods////I feel like once I get the truffled egg sammie, this review will be locked down at 5 stars. I got the shrimp and blue crab sandwich with sides of kale and potato salad for $13 which was the priciest thing on the menu. Most sandwiches fall around $11 which is appropriate considering the quality of ingredients. Some of my bites had small shards of shell from the crab which didnt bother me because it just confirmed that the crab meat was indeed real and not overly processed. I also tried my friend's sides of beets and white bean salad, and of the four, I'd say the white bean salad had the most flavor. Â
