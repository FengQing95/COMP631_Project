Kata Robata////The lobster mac and cheese was done pretty well.  The only time I had better lobster and mac was  when I was living in New England.  There was a healthy amount of crab.  The macaroni was cooked well and the cheese was gooey and flavorful.  I completely understand why this dish is such a hit.  4.5/5
