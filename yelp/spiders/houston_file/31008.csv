The Pit Room////This place was delicious. All of the sides and meats came out perfectly. My friends and I ordered on a busy week day. The restaurant was completely packed. You can tell this restaurant means business when the condiment station is spotless. We ordered a 1 lb of beef ribs, elote, mac and cheese, coleslaw, cheddar pork ribs, and of course the brisket. We loved the brisket the most. So tender and moist. Perfect with their dipping sauces and bread. The ribs and sausages were not dry either. Definitely order the elote and mac and cheese. If you plan on taking the food to go definitely call ahead to limit wait times. If you are in are in downtown H town this is a great BBQ spot to check out
