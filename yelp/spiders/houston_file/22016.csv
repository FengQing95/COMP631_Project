Uchi////Highly disappointed we arrived at 5:04 pm and there was an 1.5 hour wait. The place was half empty. I have been bragging about the amazing service and food Â this place has to my New Yorker friends. The hostess was very unfriendly and we were sooo disappointed that we were there 4 minuets after opening to be told the wait was that long. I definitely will not be coming back. YES the food is amazing and have been here several times but service is part of the experience and I was completely let down and embarrassed more than anything
