Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great brunch & cocktails. I love the strawberry margarita it's fruity w/ the right amount of tequila. I came here before heading to the airport & the staff were very nice & outgoing. They even brought out a bowl of straw berries for my 6month old who kept reaching for my margarita. I ordered the cornedbeef hash & it was the best I had so far. The corned beef was extremely tender & juicy & the potatoes were nice & soft on the inside & crunch on the outside. My only complaint was that my scrambled eggs with cheese which were very bland & literally had 3 sheds of cheese on them , the cheese wasn't really melted & my food wasn't hot despite the extended wait. I'd still come back next time I visit Houston tho.
