Kata Robata////We have our Sushi favorites and don't stray often, but these days Kata Robata is the #2 or the #1 joint in town depending on who you ask so we finally had to go. Reputation deserved: Traditional meets gourmet, and the $30 sampler's a super deal as everything is crazy fresh and perfectly presented. Menu-wise, a touch of the exotic and nouveau dresses up what might otherwise be run of the mill or more typical selections. Reasonable mingles with pricey. Solid 4/5 at least.
