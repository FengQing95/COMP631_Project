Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////They really know how to go the extra mile, food was awesome but service was impeccable.  They made me a special off menu drink when I couldn't find exactly what I wanted.  When my date wasn't 100% satisfied with his burger they insisted on buying him a new entree, when he refused (the burger was good and nothing was wrong with it) they brought us dessert.  Most importantly it was service with a smile every step of the way.  I can't wait to come back but I'll have to recover from this food coma first!
