Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Dropped in for some dessert and they did not disappoint. Their dulce de leche eclair was light, creamy and had the right amount of sugar. Their brownie was dense and chocolaty and we got another dessert as well that was really good but I can't remember the name. The only reason they weren't 5 stars for me was because of how close the tables were set.
