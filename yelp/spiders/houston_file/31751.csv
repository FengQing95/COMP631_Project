Local Foods////My husband loved his chicken sandwich and his sides, I loved the meat and fresh herbs and veggies on mine, though the bread was a little stiff and hard to bite into to. The dressing and juice from my sandwich did help soften up the bread though. The vegan chili was fantastic. I've never eaten a vegan dish before and was very impressed!
