Baby Barnaby's////This place is the perfect spot to go to for brunch on weekends, better yet everyday. The line might be too long, but trust me, it is worth the wait! We usually get their famous green eggs and the steak and egg. And of course a side of toast and fresh squeeze orange juice. The service here is always on point, even though they're busy, they find their way to always check up on their customers. Over all experience I love coming in here!
