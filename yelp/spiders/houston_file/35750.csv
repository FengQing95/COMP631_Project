Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Love this place, I've been here twice and my server from my first visit remembered me. Very cool urban vibe which brings in a young-professional crowd. I love it! The service is fantastic and the food is great. I like their drinks, though I think they could expand their drink menu a bit more. This is my new go-to after work with friends!
