Local Foods////I haven't found a better lunch spot in Houston yet. The food is very flavorful and fresh. Even though the menu is full of a variety of great sandwiches, I keep on coming back for the crunchy chicken sandwich. Potato chips and crunchy chicken on a pretzel bun... Do you need anything more in life? Local Foods isn't the cheapest place for lunch, but it's worth it.
