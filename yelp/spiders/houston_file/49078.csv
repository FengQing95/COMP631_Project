Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Been wanting to check this place out for a while. The ambiance is very hip and modern. They also offer games outside while you wait. I tried the breakfast pot pie and did not enjoy it . I waited20 minutes for a seat and then another 20 for a fried egg covered with sausage gravy over a light flaky crust with a hash brown. I will come back to try the pineapple upside down pancakes
