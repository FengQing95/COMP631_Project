The Pit Room////The meat: the ribs were fairly tender, but I def wouldn't call them fall off the bone tender. The brisket had a great flavor, and the interior pieces were tender with enough fat to keep them moist but not too much that you felt cheated out of your meat. The burnt out ends, however, were too dry and tough to be edible, which is a shame since burnt ends are one of my favorite bbq items. The potato salad was good but not great. The Mac n cheese was good, however it definitely tastes like a sauce made from a pasteurized cheese product, like a white velveeta. My Mac n cheese loving kid was not a fan. The charro beans were unnecessarily spicy, and that's saying something coming from folks from the bayou that are used to enjoying spicy food. My partner and I only took about two bItes each and my son wouldn't eat them after 1 bite. The regular barbecue sauce was too spicy for him as well, but my partner and I found it tolerable. For the parents out there, I would look closely at the menu before bringing Littles. My kiddo ended up only eating meat and bread.
