JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the Spicy Chicken Ramen with extra spinach and fresh garlic through Postmates. It arrived and after pouring in the broth I went to take my first bite and there was a piece of hair in the soup. I have blonde hair and this was clearly black hair. Grosss!!!! Will never try this place again. Please use hair nets and be more conscious when making people's food.
