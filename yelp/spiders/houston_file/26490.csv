The Pit Room////Location: I'm not quite sure if it's every time, but if you input the address into Google Maps, it might lead you to the bar next door. Just look for the round black sign that has the Texas symbol in it. The parking can be weird if you do end up at the bar first. Just make sure you turn into the parking lot and there should be a lot of spaces. The lot isn't small.
