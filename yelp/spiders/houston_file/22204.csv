Uchi////Long story short, after 2h we decided to ask for the check. We had a 9 course meal... In an effort to make it up for the terrible service, they gave us two deserts and gave us a discount, which represented pretty much our beverage consumption (4beers and 2glasses of wine). At that point we were so tired of everything that we barely tasted the deserts and left.
