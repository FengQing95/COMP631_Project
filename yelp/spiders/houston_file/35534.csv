Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Well where do i start... walked in to a lively bar with a very friendly barstaff that whipped up some tasty cocktails. Try the 38special! Food was on point i had the porchetta sandwich which was juicy and flavorful. The whiskey selection was impressive with over 300 offerings!! Ask for Matt behind bar he knows his suff! Highly recommended!
