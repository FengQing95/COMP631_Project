Kata Robata////It bums me out to write a 3 star review but that's what Kata Robata deserves. I made reservations via Houston Restaurant Weeks' website. They called and confirmed my reservation. Good so far. Get to the restaurant and my friend and I are seated promptly. Still good. Asked our server Jacob for the Houston Restaurant Week menu which is apparently only for ppl who made reservations AND had told them specifically it was for Houston Restaurant Week. Not so good.
