Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place comes highly recommended for their Sunday brunch so I had to come here to check it out. FYI, for the brunch, ONLY the brunch menu is served, which was slightly disappointing because I would have loved to sample some of the items that are on their regular menu. But, I will just have to come back (which is not a problem). I LOVE THE AMBIANCE OF THIS PLACE!!! It's the perfect classy chic vibe that is elevated by the eclectic patronage. Definitely a people watcher's spot. Lotss to see here. I made reservations a few days in advance to ensure that we would have a table. We had 11:00am reservations (as soon as they opened), which is a perfect time to go. It wasn't initially crowded and all of the food menu options were available - you run the risk of items being unavailable the later you wait (they stop brunch at 3pm). I ordered the Sticky Bun Breakfast Burger because it looked and sounded gluttonous. My friend got the Bosscat Burger. We split the Bosscat fries AND an order of the fruity pebbles french toast. We also got the "Bosscat" drink. We went IN!! Soo...I loved the Sticky Bun Breakfast Burger; the meat was outstanding - well seasoned, impeccably fresh. I kinda wish the sticky bun was a tad sweeter (I like sweet stuff), but it was definitely good and the combination of sweet and savory really worked. The bosscat fries are AHHH-MAAAZING. Highly recommend. They are real potatoes that are cut in large wedges, seasoned and fried perfectly. Love the crunchiness. My friend raved about her burger and it was HUGE! The french toast was probably the least favorite for me. I thought it was dry and I guess I'm not much of a fruity pebbles gal. Never ate it as a kid. I would have enjoyed a more traditional take on the french toast with a different, softer? bread. I love that there is a live DJ. The music was great and was not too loud. My friend and I were able to carry a conversation without having to scream at each other; we were in the back, though. The bar area was lit! It looked like a great time. I will definitely be returning to this gem of a spot, but for lunch or dinner.
