Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I ordered the cheesecake and the eggnog macaron for dessert and a flat white coffee to go with it. All I have to say about the cheesecake is; IT WAS ECSTASY! The cheesecake had a "fluff-like" texture to it that resembled of marshmallow whip. I liked how it wasn't too dense nor was it too sweet;just almost perfect. It took my brother and I less than 10 minutes to finish the whole thing.
