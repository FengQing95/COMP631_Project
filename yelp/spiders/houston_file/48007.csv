Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've only ordered the pancake flight to go. The place is always busy. I waited a while for my ordered so I suggest ordering like 30 minutes before you pick up. The pancakes were so good. It consist of 3 different (your choice) choices, I opted not to have the extra toppings. I had pumpkin, blueberry, and I think the cinnamon roll. I look forward to eating in next time I go.
