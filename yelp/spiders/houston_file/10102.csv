JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Amisha - Thank you for the 5-star review. We greatly appreciate it. I'm glad we rank so highly among the ramen shops you have visited in Houston. I would, however, like to make a point of clarity: Our spinach noodles are NOT gluten-free as you mention. Some folks make that same mistake, though our menu does not label our spinach noodles as such.
