Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////For my inaugural visit, I only had the opportunity to try a vanilla latte and a Pain au Chocolat (or a Chocolate Croissant as the Panera crowd calls it...just kidding), but it has set a strong baseline for the rest of the cuisine when I return!  The latte was flavorful but not too sweet, while the croissant was big, flaky, and buttery, as all good croissants should be.  I've heard some rank their pastries right up there with what you'd find in Paris, and since it's been 4+ years since I've been there, I'm just going to have to take their word for it.  Regardless, it's right up there with some of the best I've had.
