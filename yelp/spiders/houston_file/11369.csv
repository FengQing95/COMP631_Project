JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Heriberto - Thank you for your review. If you spend a little time in Midtown, you'll find that the parking garage next to JINYA is one of the only free parking garages in the area. It's not perfect, but then again, this is what happens when demand exceeds supply in parts of our fair city. We appreciate your understanding regarding our extended wait times during peak hours. Please know that we have five other JINYA locations in the greater Houston area, none of which are quite so busy as Midtown. But regardless, we are most grateful for your visit, and we thank you for your patronage.
