JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I always order the Tonkatsu Black with a side of corn and have always been satisfied. It's pretty filling and tasty! I usually judge ramen based on the base broth and Tonkatsu Black meets my standards.  I think next time I go, If I'm feeling ambitious, I might order the spicy! Sometimes if we are hungry, we will share a small chasu rice bowl on the side.  The chasu rice bowl has chasu pork, veggies, and half an egg.  It's very delicious!
