Uchi////Although completely satisfied and full, we ordered desert the fried milk- oh my goodness, it was a delicious surprise- definately worth getting, but my favorite was the peanut butter semifreddo with apple-miso sorbet. Â both of these desserts had impecable presentaiton (acutally, everything did) and rounded out our meal.
