Baby Barnaby's////My perfect breakfast spot in Houston.  The huevos rancheros with eggs over easy, great coffee, and the occasional small glass of freshly squeezed orange juice makes my Sunday morning perfect.  Arrive early to avoid the crowds, but even waiting here is a delight with the coffee and the people-watching.
