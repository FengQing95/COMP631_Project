Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Love it. Come in knowing....1. Lines are long and the place is crowded 2. When they sell out they are out. Sorry. 3. Plan on no parking. 4. This is a cafe, not a fine restaurant. 5. Menu is very small and they sell out of food as well. So come early or plan on just having a pastry and cappuccino. But the food is amazing. Pastries are ridiculously fresh. Coffee is delish and the place is super cute. I've been 3 times this week. Sorta have a crush.
