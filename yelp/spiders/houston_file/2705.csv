JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It's ok. I've been to Jinya twice, and I'm sure I'll go again, but I haven't been overly impressed. I've tried two different dishes and the broth was too "watery"; not a lot of flavor mostly salty. Noodles are good. It is a franchise chain afterall, and I'm sure the quality might have suffered for business reasons after it expanded. Reading their "about" section doesn't tell me much about them except wanting me to open my own franchise. I've had ramen in New York, Los Angeles, Austin, Madrid, other Houston locations, and Jinya would not make my list among those. I don't crave it. But good luck to the business owners, there's always room for improvement. I will try a few more times.
