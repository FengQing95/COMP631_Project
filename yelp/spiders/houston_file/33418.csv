Local Foods////The only complaint I have is more of a personal preference. I wish they had a hot soup option for vegetarians. Yesterday was rainy and terrible outside (as is today) and it would've been nice to have that option with my meal...esp since they don't have teas or coffees on their menu. Which also means that ordering a hot water with your meal (which is my preference all the time whether I'm drinking alcohol or not) is not going to happen!
