The Pit Room////Looking for a late night meal after a long day at work, these two weary travelers accepted the recommendation of our hotel concierge. The flavor of the brisket was amazing, no sauce needed. We knew it had to be good when we arrived at 8:30 at night and guests were still lined up, almost to the door. This KC boy knows his Q, and let me tell you, we were not disappointed.
