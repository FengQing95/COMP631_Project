Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I sat alone and people watched, quite intrigued with how people from different walks seemed to converge here: hipsters, yuppies, and the ones you just know are made of money. Then I realized this place is called Common Bond... Well OH. I get it now. Yoohoooo.... Evidence over here that not all Asian kids are smart.
