Uchi////So we finally get seated and we had some stellar dishes (hama chili, an amberjack special, scallop nigiri that contained the world's creamiest scallop) and we had some dishes that literally got spit out. Â The funny thing is that when we told our waiter we hated one of them, he said something about how in a recent meeting they told the servers not to bring out all the "good dishes" at once. Huh? Shouldn't all the dishes, in the opinion of the chef at least, be good? I recognize people have different tastes, but shouldn't a restaurant stand behind what it's serving?
