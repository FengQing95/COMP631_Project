Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It's probably more like 3.5 stars, but this is a really nice bakery with a variety of options.  The burrata and heirloom tomato sandwich was light and filling, not exactly as flavorful as we were hoping but still really nice.  The side of parmesan fries were not what we were hoping for, they had a dusty raw flour taste to them and not enough salt.  We got the chocolate chip and chocolate walnut cookies to try and they were kind of underwhelming.  I think the standout was the cherry and cheese danish.  It's not usually the type of bakery item I would go for, but the dough was really nice and the filling was the right balance of sweet and tart.  You can tell this place really cares about what they're putting out.
