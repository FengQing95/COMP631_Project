Kata Robata////The food was excellent and the waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu (he was a sushi chef at the restaurant prior to starting that very week as a waiter).  Unfortunately, he was still learning so the service left a little to be desired.  Went with two friends and we ordered probably half of that menu.  The miso lobster mac and cheese was amazing with chunks of lobster and creamy mac and cheese.  Of all the sushi we ordered, I enjoyed the scallop-based pieces we had and all of the more complex ones were well executed.  The drinks were also good, well made and stiff and the bartender made a few concoctions of his own that were just what I was looking for.  Recommend this as I haven't had better sushi in Houston.
