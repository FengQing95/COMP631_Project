The Pit Room////Prices are not cheap, myself and my wife ordered 1 meat plate, 1 beef rib, 1 taco, I drink and a beer. Total $53, I don't mind paying if the food is good but this is not worth it. I am sticking to my familiar BBQ joints so that I can get my money's worth. Pitroom is another hyped up joint.
