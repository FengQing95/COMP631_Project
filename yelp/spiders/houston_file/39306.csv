Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Don't get the butcher board there was like two pieces of cheese one piece of prosciutto like the jam I had to dip my bread in there bc it was watered down. It was watery maple syrup whatever it was. The fried mushroom Â was fire but they only give you enough sauce for one mushroom and charge u extra .50 for sauce. The service was horrible the only nice person there was the lady serving waters. Our waitress today would just walk away from the table when we weren't even done ordering, avoid us we didn't get to try anything else other than a bisque my friend and I planned on sharing and she brought us a plate to share a soup. So I had to wave down a bar back bc it would take her 10 mins to come back after I told her I was starving, so we just left and ate somewhere else next door and our waiter is an old 80 year old that can't walk but his service is faster and 1000 better than hers. At least we know to never come back there if ur food is gonna be expensive AF you better at least have good service so we can order fast enough to spend our $$$
