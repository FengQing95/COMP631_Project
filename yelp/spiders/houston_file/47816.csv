Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Probably one of the best brunch places in Houston! The food here was amazing, the mimosa wasn't too strong, and the service was great! I ordered the breakfast pot pie which to my opinion wasn't the best, and a bit bland, especially if you enjoy more spices in your food, but I did try other foods Â which I really liked.
