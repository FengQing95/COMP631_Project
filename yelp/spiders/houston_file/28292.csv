The Pit Room////What a shame! I've been here two more times and taken clients as this WAS one of my BBQ go to's. How disappointing, we we served ribs that were grossly over cooked and when I asked them to swap them out the cutter was highly annoyed. The brisket was dry and they were out of chicken and sausage! Normally outages at a food BBQ place are understood, but at 11:30 on a Monday? I hope they step it back up as we really like this place.
