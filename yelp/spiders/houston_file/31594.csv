Local Foods////We ordered with the cashier and the food was brought to our table very quickly even though it was busy.  The sitting options were interesting with your regular round tables and booths and also long benches that different groups would share.  The staff is very friendly and the lunchtime crowd seemed to be mostly well-to-do professionals and housewives.
