Local Foods////I wasn't wowed by this place but to be fair, I did not get the crispy chicken sandwich. I came at about 3PM for light bites with some friends. Their way-too-sweet iced coffee is premixed and poured from a gallon jug. The jalape√±o hummus was good but my hummus to bread ratio was pretty off and we ended up with about half hummus left with nothing to dip into it. I think I'll have to be back for a proper meal at a proper meal time to really get a better picture of the place.
