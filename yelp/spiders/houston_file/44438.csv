Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////What a beautiful bakery! It's a gorgeous place inside. It feels like going into a high end boutique but a bakery. I came for the almond crossiant and I left smiling. I didn't even eat the almond croissant until I got into the car. The service was very good. The look of the place amazing. The almond croissant was the best almond croissant I've ever had. Nice and big. Crispy and flavorful on the outside. Soft and fluffy on the inside. You will not be disappointed.
