JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Regarding our restrooms, I regret that when we first built our establishment, we weren't anticipating the amount of people who would be coming through our doors at any given moment. No restaurant is perfect, and with 20/20 hindsight, we most definitely would have made the restrooms larger. So on behalf of my entire staff, I do appreciate your not having lowered your rating for that reason.
