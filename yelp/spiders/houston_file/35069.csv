Local Foods////But who am I kidding. I've never sampled a bad item on their menu. Crunchy Chicken Sandwich, Garden Sammie, Posole, Vegan Bowls, Vegan Taco Salads--everything I've eaten here has been delicious! Local Foods has been staple in my Houston lunch spot shortlist for years, and it has earned its spot!
