The Pit Room////Small in building size but not in size of food. This is a great place for barbecue. Pricy but any quality barbecue is. I say it stacks up to Goode Barbecue in terms of quality. The interior is very wooden and their glass bottled drinks are pretty pricey, so I just get a water. In conclusion, this is a nice place in terms of quality meats for Montrose.
