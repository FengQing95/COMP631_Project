JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ok sooooooo me and the wife wanted to try an authentic ramen noodle spot and we came across this place. Let me just say for the ones that arent familiar with the Midtown area, parking can be tricky and please come prepared with comfortable shoes because you will be walking at least a couple of blocks if your lucky.
