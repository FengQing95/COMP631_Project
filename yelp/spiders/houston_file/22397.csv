Uchi////Happy Hour at Uchi is simply amazing.  Definitely try and sit at the sushi bar, if at all possible.  And try to be there before the doors open if you do not make a reservation as it gets packed.  The service was on point throughout the entire meal and every dish we ordered was outstanding.  And definitely order the brussel sprouts!
