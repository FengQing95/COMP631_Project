Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I really enjoy the coffee and pastries. I usually get a cappuccino and kugelhopf. I've tried their food and breakfast and wasn't impressed either times, especially for the prices. I would not recommend the lavender cappuccino, it was too fragrant and artificial.
