The Pit Room////We got here right when it opened and thank goodness we did because the line was out the door!  I had the beef brisket and beef rib.  My mouth just waters thinking about it!  The sauce was so good!  The sides were great too.  I had the mustard potato salad and coleslaw.  Both sides were wonderful!
