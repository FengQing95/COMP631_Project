Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place is great for breakfast or brunch but beware super popular so super crowded on weekends. My bf and I like to try to come super early on the weekend or do yourself a favorite and come mid week. Everything in the menu is delicious and they cater to a variety so diets (vegetarian, no pork, etc). Super friendly staff and bright and friendly restaurant.
