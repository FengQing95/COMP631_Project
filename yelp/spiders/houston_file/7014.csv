JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////F*cking love  this place  from there jinya bun(which are a literal must try) to there tonkotsu black and brussel sprout ramen.  Love it!  One thing  they do seem more Americanized  if we're talking authentic  ramen and some of there soups can be meh (meaning the cilantro one and any with chicken! ) but to each it's  own.  Over all Greay taste  and they  stay open  late! Not to pricey either. Also i didn't  care for there soft shell bao bun and i love crab.  The staff was awesome!! Also everyone I bring here (newcomers and all) love it! Especially  those delicious  addictive jinya buns!!
