Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The negatives to our visit were that the the plates were very greasy and we were only checked on once, so there was no opportunity to ask for napkins. The boyfriend got tired of waiting around, so he walked to where the servers were congregated to ask someone to grab him a hot sauce. There were also quite a few flies hovering around, which is most likely a result of people waiting in line with the open since there's not much space between it and the hostess stand.
