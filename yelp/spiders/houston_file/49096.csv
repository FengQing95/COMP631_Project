Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze Eatery has easily become one of our favorite brunch restaurants.  Both times we've been the food and customer service has been phenomenal.  While placing my order I contemplated between two different pancake options and our waitress took note of this.  Our waitress not only brought my pancake order but also a sample pancake of the other option I considered.  Things like that go a long way for us and will continue to make us repeat customers.  I don't think you can go wrong with any of their pancake or french toast options!
