Uchi////Very disappointing service at Uchi's. Took 30 minutes for the 8th course to come out. Usually I don't mind the wait especially if it's a busy Saturday night. But during the time we were waiting, the couple next to us had received 3 courses and an additional free dish "on the house". We had the same server by the way. Didn't understand why they received preferential treatment when we all paid for the same $200 meal. Was so excited to try this place out for our 3 year anniversary.... Never coming back here again.
