Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Everything on the menu is outstanding. I love their craft cocktails, it's a lot of fun to sit at the bar and let the bartender create something unique based on your tastes. But it's just a fun to have a regular table and enjoy a number of their delicious menu items. The menu is constantly changing but consistently appealing. Whether you dine in or order delivery, the food preparation and presentation is perfection. I highly recommend the braised short rib, the roasted brussels sprouts and their banana pudding for dessert. WOW. DELICIOUS!
