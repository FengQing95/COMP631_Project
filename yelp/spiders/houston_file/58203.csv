Kata Robata////Decided to get some sushi at @katarobata for some dinner and as always did not let us down. We started with some of the duck wasabi soba noodles, the lobster Mac and cheese, and three chicken skewers! Yea the place is a bit pricy but we'll worth it!! We also got some sushi but they were devoured on delivery . Great quality fish for a decent price point vs other high end sushi places. Remember to make a reservation!
