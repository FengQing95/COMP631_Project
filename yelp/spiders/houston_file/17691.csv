Uchi////Can this place get a bad review? First off, I'm a waiter and let me tell you that I am more critical than most, I will admit. In saying that, holy hell! I was blown away. Our server kicked ass!! I just asked him about the fish and he knew everything, and more. Not to mention their whole staff seemed that way.
