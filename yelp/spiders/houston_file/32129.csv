Local Foods////The roast beef (not on the menu anymore) was great, and I was sad to see it go. The Shrimp and Crab sandwich was incredible. The seafood was fresh, the dressing was delicious on top, altogether it was wonderful. Crunchy Chicken is great, as well as my wifes favorite, the House Smoked Salmon.
