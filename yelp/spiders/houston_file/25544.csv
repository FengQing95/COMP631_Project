Uchi////The restaurant is quite beautiful using classic architectural elements curiously with a hint of a popular modern/contemporary accents... black Industrial piping with lots of wood. I can't help but stare at the liquid chalk board in the back, and by chance, we always get reservations on the left side away from it, so I'll find my eyes wander towards that direction while waiting on the next dish or if conversation runs dry.
