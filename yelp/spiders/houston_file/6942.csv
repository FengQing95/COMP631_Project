JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Whoa, this was a surprise.  I ordered the Tonkatsu Black for lunch and it was delicious.  Noodles were cooked just right and had that bounce to it, and the broth had really great flavor.  The rest of the ingredients were tasty but fairly standard, but the important parts were really good.  Service was quick and we had no trouble getting a seat.  I'd come back for lunch any day.
