The Pit Room////It was okay.  The ambiance was perfect for a bbq place, and I loved the big outdoor patio bar.  The cashier was super friendly.  Otherwise the bbq itself is extremely over-rated.  One review said it was the best in Texas- but the brisket was dry, sauce was so-so (there is better bbq in Texas) - Mac N Cheese was slightly better than okay- green beans were a bit over cooked.  The jalapeño cheese sausage was ok.  The meat (sausage and brisket) seemed at room temperature/ cold when served- couldn't see that shine from hot bbq served elsewhere.  But again, it could be due to being a bit too dry. I would go back for the outdoor patio/ bar on a great spring/early summer eve to relax with a bevie.  For the bbq - just average, definitely wouldn't return for it.
