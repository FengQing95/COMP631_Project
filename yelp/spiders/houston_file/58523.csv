Baby Barnaby's////After a pretty short wait we were seated inside. I forgot how small it is (maybe its a good thing that it isn't on a major street, because then the wait would be insane). I found myself torn between two ends of the breakfast spectrum: huevos rancheros or the healthy breakfast? My friend convinced me that since the huevos rancheros came with black beans and a whole wheat tortilla, they had to be healthy. Even though i knew she was wrong, i took the bait and ordered them and they ended up being great. Although, technically i think the sauce they put on them was more of a salsa than a ranchero sauce, that doesn't take away from how good they are. Then i got to the breakfast potatoes. Oh my God, these might just be the best in town. They have a great crunchy exterior and a piping hot, soft, and delicious interior. With a little help from mister ketchup bottle, i was in heaven. All hopes of this being a healthy breakfast while my bike goes unridden for two weeks back in the Bay Area have gone out the window. But for this hedonistic hour on a sunday morning back in Houston, i was okay with that.
