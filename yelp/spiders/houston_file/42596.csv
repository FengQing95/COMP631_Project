Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The star attraction for this bakery is the pastries of course.  The brioche was amazing.  It's more than a simple bread, the butter within it made it that more rich.  The croissants may look too golden brown and burnt but it was anything but.  Perfectly crispy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside, truly decadent and well-executed.  The fruit-topped croissant was equally amazing.  The chocolate cupcake was insanely moist and oozing out chocolate, yet it was light without the aftertaste of guilt and disgust.  The kouign amann was one of my favorites.  This dosant was insane on many levels.  With each bite, you can taste each individual buttery layer from this mutant croissant.  This guy in front of me in line has eaten here daily claims this is exactly like the Cronut he has had at Dominique Ansell's bakery in NYC.  The chocolate chip cookie was explosive in its chocolate content.  This ain't your ordinary Pillsbury doughboy cookie.  Lastly, the macarons.  Comes in all assorted flavors.  We got passion fruit, vanilla, chocolate, pistachio, PB&J, and lemon.  Light thin crispy shell, has a delicious chewy center.  I know nothing about macarons, but my sister who knows much about it mentioned this one has the perfect "feet".  Same guy in front of me says the macarons here are comparable to the ones in Paris that he frequents monthly and blows the local competition.
