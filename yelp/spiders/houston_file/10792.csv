JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////In my opinion, this is the best ramen in Houston, and is very comparable to the ramen I had in Â Japan. I prefer the tonkatsu white, which is a saltier/more chickeny flavored ramen that is easier for a western palate.The Tonkatsu Black is also very good, and has more savory flavors that are stronger.
