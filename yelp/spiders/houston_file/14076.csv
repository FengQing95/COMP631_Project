JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I tried both Ramen we ordered. The thin noodles were my favorite as it was easier for me to eat them. The thick noodles seemed to be a hit and were enjoyable as well. My favorite part of the meal, however, were the pork gyoza and the shrimp ball. The shrimp ball was perfectly fried with no excessive oil dripping and the cream cheese center filling was just the right amount. The exterior of the shrimp ball was perfectly coated and crispy. The gyoza was fried correctly and the gyoza sauce on the table definitely added to the flavor.
