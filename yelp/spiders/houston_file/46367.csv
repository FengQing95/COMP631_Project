Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I walk to the bar and meet another worker who tells me I can't sit there. So at this point I was very confused. I told them that the cashier had asked me to sit there because I didn't realize there was a line. In a condescending tone this person says "Yes, there is a line." and motions for me to sit in a section that's really not for dining. Eventually I was allowed to have a corner table which was fine by me. Mind you there were open tables everywhere once that line died down.
