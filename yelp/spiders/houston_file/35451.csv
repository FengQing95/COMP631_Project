Local Foods////Been here so many times over the years! This week, I got the gulf seafood sandwich with sides of the Tuscan kale and potato salad, as well as the Buddha bowl. The gulf seafood sandwich was good, but not the best I've had here. (I really like the crunchy chicken sandwich and the truffle egg salad sandwich.) I wish there was less shrimp and more crab in it. The Buddha bowl was good as well, though I wasn't a huge fan of the pickled ginger, which was also in the sandwich. (I prefer their spring harvest salad.) I will always get the Tuscan kale as one of my sides--it's that good. Fresh, with pine nuts and I want to say parmesan or another grated cheese. The potato salad is pretty good too--light but hearty. Side note: Local Foods is great for group orders! They individually labeled our orders.
