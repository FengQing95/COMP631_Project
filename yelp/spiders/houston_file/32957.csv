Local Foods////Service is also phenomenal and I love restaurants that go above and beyond.  Once, my food took longer than usual to come out (15-20 minutes).  Manager personally followed up, brought it out, and refunded me the entire ticket.  That, my friends, is how you turn a bad situation into a life-long customer.
