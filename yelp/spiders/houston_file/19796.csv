Uchi////I was not impressed by Uchi. The food was good but did not live up to the hype. We had the tasting menu and some of the items were delicious. However, most of it was pretty average and nothing to write home about. Maybe if you're okay spending several hundred dollars to leave hungry this place is for you. As for me I will not be returning.
