Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I came back a couple more times and it seems that after the chef went away the things got worse. Most of the servers are no longer wearing their uniforms and hats. I'm still not impressed by their coffee and their pastries are honestly overpriced. The baristas are not friendly at all and they make you feel like they're having a party and you're not invited. I stood at the bar watching them in a slow moment and all they did was talking to another barista off duty and not caring about the costumers at all. Their almond croissant was ok. Did they lower the (still too high) prices?
