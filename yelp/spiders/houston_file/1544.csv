JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////To that end, may I ask what date and time did you dined with us (and to confirm that this was at our Midtown location on Louisiana Street)? What did your server look like, and more importantly, did he or she say or do anything specifically that upset you? You mentioned that "it always feels like the servers are rolling their eyes in their head every time I speak." Did the server(s) actually do this? Or what was it about their speech or body language that made you feel this way? My worst fear is that our servers may be acting or performing in a way that they are unaware of. Specific examples of behavior that you have found unpleasant will go a long way to remedying this.
