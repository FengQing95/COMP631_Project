JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My friend was in town for the night visiting and the boyfriend and I have been wanting to try this place for a while so it was the perfect opportunity. Boyfriend started with the JINYA bun which was pretty tasty. They give you this soft bun with a big, fat, cut of chasu, very yummy. I would recommend it. I started with the tempura brussel sprouts for the table. It was a dissapointed. Wouldn't recommend it. They should just stick to that usual flavorful grilled one offered at other competitors.
