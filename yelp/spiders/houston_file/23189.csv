Uchi////So we landed with about 10 min left in happy hour. First time there so we ordered about 8 dishes off of the happy hour menu and some saki to get us going. The beautiful thing is that even though we ordered that much and plus a roll off of regular menu, each came out separately as you finished one, within a few minutes the next dish would arrive. It was like a sushi parade!
