Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Breakfast in bed shot (3/5): Really interesting concept. Its bourbon with maple syrup, chased with orange juice and bacon. To be honest, the shot itself was so thick it was kind of gross having thick tasting bourbon go down your throat, but it did taste like pancakes so not too bad. The best part would be the bacon you eat at the end. Nonetheless this was a fun shot to drink with the whole table for brunch.
