Kata Robata////I've mostly been to Kata Robata for special occasions but I've been consistently impressed with the food and I find myself excited to go back (in fact, I was thinking about coming here for my birthday for the omakase!) and try more menu items. I have yet to come for happy hour but this will definitely be in my future plans.
