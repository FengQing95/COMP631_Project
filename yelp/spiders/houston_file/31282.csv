Local Foods////Great place for something different! I was sent here on the recommendation of a few different people and I was not disappointed. They serve my husband's favorite root beer (Virgils) and Vietnamese iced coffee... did I mention Nutella rice krispies? And that was just dessert. Atmosphere is great, although a bit crowded, and the food is fresh and interesting. The staff was very nice and helpful too. The only reason I didn't 5 star it is that they may have been a bit overwhelmed. They were very busy when I was there which made for a battle to find a place to park and a place to sit, as well as having to wait for clean glasses to get water. Otherwise, absolutely worth it!
