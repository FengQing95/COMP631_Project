Kata Robata////Do these two things and thy will be in sushi heaven. That being said, I called Kata and was informed that they had some fresh otoro. I was very impressed with the quality of toro sashimi here. There was no fishy smell, and it melted in my mouth. The bad thing is that the pieces were so damn little!
