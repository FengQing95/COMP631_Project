Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////They sold out of the pain au chocolat as well as the regular croissant, so I snapped up an almond croissant and kougin-amann for $9.25 inclusive of tax.  The almond croissant was so puffy and airy with its crisp buttery layers!  And the sweet almond sugar paste inside was super fragrant and a pleasant surprise.
