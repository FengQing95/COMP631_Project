It was slightly crisped like a panini. There was plenty of shrimp and crab inside the sandwich, and it went fantastic with the condiments inside. The truffled egg salad sandwich is a classic that you can't go wrong with. As for the sides, I have not been a big fan of them and I've had the kale, chips, and coleslaw, but the sandwich more than makes up for it. Arrive before 11:30 for lunch, otherwise, it gets packed in here!
