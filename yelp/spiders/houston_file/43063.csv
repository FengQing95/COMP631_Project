Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I went there for the first time today, and I wasn't impressed. The orange-cranberry scone was rather bland, and the coffee was downright putrid. I will probably try again, but I don't really see what the fuss is about. Seemed incredibly touristy instead of a neighborhood bakery.
