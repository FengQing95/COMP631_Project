Uchi////This place is AMAZING. I came in by myself as I was in Houston for a work trip, so they sat me immediately at the sushi bar. This was at around 9:25pm and there was clearly still quite a long wait. The sushi chef's were friendly, talented, and joked around which made it a fun atmosphere. The cost is pricey, but it's worth it. My favorite dish was the bacon tataki under hot tastings, the flavor and tenderness was incredible!
