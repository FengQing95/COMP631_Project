The Pit Room////Pit Room is probably the top 5 in my list of best bbq in Houston! I had the pleasure of seeing them at work when I shared the same commissory kitchen with them, and was glad to see them open and blossom. I really, really, really enjoy eating their brisket! It's one of the best briskets in town to be honest..! I was able to take some German clients of mine to try some good ol' southern BBQ, and they all loved the brisket, and ribs (we're not gonna talk about the sausages/brats because well, they're Germans, lol). I think the beef ribs is okay, not my favorite from the H, but by no means bad at all!!
