Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////OVERALL: It's a chain restaurant, and I am typically not big on chains. However; the food was good and I can understand why it's so popular. However, I do not think it's worth a 2 hour wait. For the 15-20 minutes that we waited, that was completely fine. But with living in Houston, and having sooooooo many delicious breakfast options to choose from, that won't take half of the day to complete, you will probably catch me elsewhere for breakfast. I don't think the pancakes are enough to make me return...
