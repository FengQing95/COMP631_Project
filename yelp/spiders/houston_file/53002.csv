Kata Robata////On the flipside, the service needs work, and the atmosphere lacked character. My biggest complaint was that all of the food practically came out at the same time. They should have served the raw/lighter items first and paced the dishes so we could be enjoy them properly. So if you come here, I would recommend you order just a few items at a time or sit at the sushi bar and order the chef's omakase.
