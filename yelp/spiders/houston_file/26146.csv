The Pit Room////If you would like some of the best driest bbq in houston then the Pitt Room is for you!!! Between my husband and I we had the brisket, pulled pork, chicken, pork ribs, and sausage.  Everything was over smoky flavored and extremely DRY!!! The sides didnt fare any better. If I could have rate it any lesser than 1 star I would have.  Do yourself a favor and save your $50 bucks and go anywhere buy here! Horrible!
