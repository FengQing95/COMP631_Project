Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This bakery has a nice ambiance, good coffee, and really delicious fruit tarts! The macarons are very average- not terrible, but not amazing either. I've been dying to try the almond croissant, but every time I've been, it was sold out! Also, I personally think everything here is slightly overpriced. Overall, I would recommend coming here. The cafe is very instagram worthy and is a nice place to have a cup of coffee with a friend!
