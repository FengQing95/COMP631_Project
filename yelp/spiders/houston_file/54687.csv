Kata Robata////*Food: I've tried several dishes here and although I'm not an absolute fan of all of them, I can say they're great quality dishes. My favorite dish here is the spicy soy ramen. If you see me at Kata Robata, nine times out of ten I will be having the ramen. I usually request to get the ramen with grilled chicken instead of the pork (servers have to check with the chef). I love this dish soo much.. The broth has a great balance of creaminess and spiciness and ramen is perfectly cooked. And for $14, the portion is pretty large. Another favorite is the lobster mac n' cheese. Succulent lobster pieces with rich, buttery mac n' cheese. Oh so heavenly! This is also a dish I usually share because of the large portion and richness. I also like their specialty rolls. I recommend the longhorn, salmon & soft shell crab (FAV!!), and the sexy scallop. One of the few dishes that I actually didn't like was the uni chawanmushi (japanese egg custard). Don't get me wrong I was glad I tried it..but it's just not my cup of tea. The dish just seemed one note and lacked texture. One of the most disappointing things about Kata Robata is the dessert menu. Honestly, none of the 5 dessert choices really seem that appealing. I've tried the strawberry shortcake...It was kind of a fail for me. There were just so many elements going on in the dish that it didn't seem very cohesive.
