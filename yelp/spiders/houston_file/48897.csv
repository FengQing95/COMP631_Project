Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze A.M. Eatery was worth the wait! I moved to Houston about a year ago and had to try it after hearing all the buzz about it. I LOVED it! I now bring all visiotrs here to experience the pancakes. I had the sweet potatoe pancake, a specialty one and the cinnamon roll. By far the sweet potaoe was the best. It was so good I tried finding a restaurant for sweet potatoe pancakes. The cinnamon roll left a lot to be desired. Don't believe the hype, it's not worth the money. Also, they don't have maple syrup so that's a let down but other than that no issues.
