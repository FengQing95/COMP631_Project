Kata Robata////I got there right around 5 when the restaurant opened.  The decor is pretty impressive - upscale, modern, classy.  They've got a great selection of stuff for dinner from ramen to sushi to hot dishes and cold dishes.  I got the kakuni pork belly with egg, which tasted quite good.  The egg and pork were cooked well, but it was a simple dish without too much that stood out.  Ordered a couple rolls to go along with it, but ended feeling kind of unsatisfied.  On the whole, the food quality was good, but I don't think it was anything special.  For the price and portion, I left kind of feeling underwhelmed.
