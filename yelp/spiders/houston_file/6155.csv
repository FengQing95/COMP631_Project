JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your feedback.  Which ramen did you order at Jinya?  We offer 12 different kinds of ramen and the protein in each one varies depending on which type of ramen you order.  For meat lovers, there's the Cha, Cha, Cha.  For those that like it lighter, we have the the Old Skool ramen which offers less meat.  All guests also have the option or ordering extra meat on the side should they wish to do so.   I'm sorry to hear you feel the ramen you ordered was bland.  Please know that at ANY TIME, you are welcome to send your ramen back and we will gladly remake or replace it for you for no additional charge.  It's my goal to ensure that all guests enjoy their food at Jinya.  I've visited Agu several times and they too have different portions of meat depending on what type of ramen you order.  It's all based on personal preference.  Should you ever return to Jinya, text or call me:  650-906-6308.  I will gladly treat you to a bowl of ramen of your liking to replace the one you had today.
