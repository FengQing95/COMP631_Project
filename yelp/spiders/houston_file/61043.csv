Baby Barnaby's////I got the pink and white scramble (eggs+cheddar+ham chunks), she the green eggs (eggs+artichokes+some other greens). We each ate half of our plates and traded to be able to try everything. I would recommend the green eggs over pink and white because the latter, although good, was probably something I could make at home. The green eggs themselves had a creamier consistency that was unique and filling. Really good to spread over the dense toast that is served. Alongside the eggs are chicken sausage and potato cubes, which are each also made well. I personally found the sausage a bit on the sweeter side but my friend really liked it. The potatoes were crisp on the outside and sandy soft on the inside.
