Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is definitely our favorite breakfast/brunch spot. The service is always great, the food is consistent, and the prices are decent. The menu is huge and there are plenty of vegan and gluten free options. The acoustics of the inside dining room aren't great and the music can be really overbearing at times, but that's easily rectified by sitting outside on the patio (which is amazing in the spring and fall).
