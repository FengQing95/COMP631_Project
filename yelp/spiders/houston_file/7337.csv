JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My boyfriend took me to JINYA last night for date night. We went pretty early so we didn't have to wait. They have separate tables or community seating, they sat us at community seating so we didn't have to wait. Definitely a different experience as I prefer my own table. The fried Brussel sprouts are by far the best thing on the menu. They are extremely crunchy and add some Gyoza sauce on them and they are fantastic! I ordered the spicy chicken ramen and it was just OK. Was the perfect amount of spice but wasn't a big fan of the chicken. Tip- you can order thicker noodles if you don't want the thin, my boyfriend always orders thick but I prefer the thin! You can also get extra noodles for your left over broth for only $2..makes a great second meal! I don't think I would come back here for dinner but would be a great lunch spot. Â Our service was great which is why I am giving JINYA 4 stars over 3!
