Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I sat there waiting 30 minutes for an order that should have taken no more than 10-15 minutes to prepare and have ready. Her response was "I didn't know it was for you." I told the initial order taker where I was waiting for my order and no one apparently passed that on. Also in sitting there with no water, no order of a meal in front of me for 30 minutes and no one was curious why I was sitting there? For my health? Apparently not.
