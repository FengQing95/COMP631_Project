Uchi////I tend to be skeptical when it comes to new places and I came here for a friend's going away dinner. The staff was attentive and very knowledgeable about all the dishes. We came here during happy hour and ordered a lot of plates to try. Everything was delicious and left me craving for more! The flavor was complex, a sort of asian fusion I haven't experienced. I was blown away by the flavors! To end the night, we shared the fried ice cream. Everything was consistently impressive to the very end. I can't wait to come here again!
