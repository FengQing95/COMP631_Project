Uchi////When we were seated inside, I found the dark bustling ambiance to be pleasant, and our server was very nice. I went with the 6 course vegetarian tasting menu ($65), which they were happy to prepare vegan for me. The courses were mostly mediocre at best, with the highlights being the cold vegetable salad, and eggplant nigiri. These were excellent-rich savory flavors and perfectly cooked fresh vegetables. Everything else was too salty, and too simple for this price point. My friends got a variety of fish sushi and did not enjoy any of it, which was disappointing to hear from sushi lovers! While I appreciate the availability of vegan options at Uchi, I would not come back here.
