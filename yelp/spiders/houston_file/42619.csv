Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I finally got to the cashier and inquired about lunch. She informed me that breakfast is until 10:30 and although lunch usually starts at 11 today it would be late because the kitchen got behind on breakfast and hadn't prepped for lunch yet. This is insane. Thankfully I didn't need to have lunch there but what if I was meeting someone for lunch at 11? To top it off the chef, Roy Shvartzapel, was out front greeting customers. Normally I would say that's great customer service but given that lunch was evidently going to be late, he needed to be in the back prepping with his staff.
