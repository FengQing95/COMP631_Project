Uchi////I walked in on a Tuesday around 6. The decision to go there was made on a whim. My party (totaling two) had not arrived so I headed to the bar. Delicious $3 nigori sake for sake hour ending at 6:30pm. I ordered one of those as well as the pan-fried pork and baked walu walu. Both were ok but the sake was the best of three. The bartenders are attentive, polite, and friendly. Nathan has a great smile. The patrons are sophisticated.
