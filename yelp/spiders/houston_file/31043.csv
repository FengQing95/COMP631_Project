The Pit Room////Love the Pit Room. It's one of my "go-tos" for taking out of town visitors to sample some Texas BBQ. I typically get the two meat plate, with brisket & pork ribs, but they also have some really tasty tacos if I'm feeling like going the Tex Mex route. Yes, I consider bbq joint tacos to be Tex Mex food... Think about it, people!
