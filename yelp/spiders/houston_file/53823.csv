Kata Robata////Not a fan of the lobster macaroni, it didn't seen all that Japanese-y, but having lived in Japan, I can see how that dish would appeared in a Japanese restaurant menu.  A box of macaroni is less than a $1, here you are paying $19 for it, talk about markup!  The lobster head-shell and tail looked so fake, that we wondered if there a line of them hanging dry in their kitchen from recycle (btw, we are just kidding about that...)
