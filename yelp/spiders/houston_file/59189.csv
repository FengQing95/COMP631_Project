Baby Barnaby's////The real winner was the biscuit, I remember a few people mentioning the biscuit on yelp but it seemed to be overshadowed by talk of the green eggs. Man oh man, those biscuits were delicious! I normally eat fairly healthy but I'd eat a dozen of those biscuits if given the chance. Make sure to try a biscuit or two if you are here, they will not disappoint!
