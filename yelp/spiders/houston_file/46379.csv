Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First time at Common Bond, and I was impressed! My coworkers and I were doing community site visits and stopped her after lunch for a snack. They were raving about the sweet treats, so I was very excited to try them out. The restaurant has a nice ambience inside and it was very neat. I am excited to return so that I can experience some of the food and partake in the happy hour.
