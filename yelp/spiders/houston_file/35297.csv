Local Foods////My go to is the crunchy chicken sandwich. The sandwich consists of layers of chicken, seasoned tomatoes and lettuce, pickles, ranch, and crushed salt and pepper chips. The combination of flavors really complement each other so well. The absolutely star of the dish is the pretzal bun. It is both soft and a little bit crispy at the same time and the flavor is so wonderful. This sandwich needs a heavy duty bun to keep everything in line and this pretzal bun is up for the job.
