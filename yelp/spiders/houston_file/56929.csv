Kata Robata////I would've loved to try the foie gras and pork belly, since I've heard great things about it. Overall though, while I think Kata Robata has certainly earned its reputation as one of the best Japanese places in Houston, it seems to me like it's a place more for experimentation and modern, contemporary twists than true Japanese cuisine.
