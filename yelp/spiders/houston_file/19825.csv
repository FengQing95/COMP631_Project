Uchi////Amazing! If you want to go on a culinary adventure, this place is for you. It has everything: Ducks in a jar, Raw fish in lemon sauce, great wine selection, and best of all the waiters know it all. You don't even have to order, just tell them what you like to eat or what you hate and they make your meal for you. Even better, it's small portions leaving you trying lots of things without feeling full.
