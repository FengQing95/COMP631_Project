Kata Robata////I have been craving this place ever since my first time. My boyfriend and I had a date night here and we arrived right when they opened. It was a special occasion so we made reservations for omakase. Hands down the best sushi I have ever had. I wouldn't call ourselves sushi experts but we are definitely not newbies. We decided on the hot and cold omakase option. While I wasn't a fan of every course, (mainly due to my taste buds)You could still tell the food was super fresh. The place was definitely not as fancy as I was expecting (or dressed for) but it had a very comfortable laid back feel. Our waitress was very friendly and explained everything we were eating and gave us front row seats to watch the sushi chefs in action. The entire meal was unforgettable. I didn't want the courses to stop!!! The sushi was fresh and melt in your mouth and the hot dishes were savory and exquisite. Hate to say it but they have made me not even want to go back to my old sushi places. Omakase for two with cocktails was around $300 but it was worth it honestly. Top notch place! Can't wait to go back!
