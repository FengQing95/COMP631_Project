Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Came here 9am sat morning and it was a 30-45 min wait for 2 people! We waited though and were happy we did. Got the corned beef hash with wheat toast and scrambled eggs, and the French toast with side of sausage links. Both were delicious. The hash hit the spot though I have to admit I'm a kid and mixed together the eggs, corned beef and potatoes... Mmmmmm. The French toast was yummy and the three sausage links were way bigger than expected. Would definitely come back.
