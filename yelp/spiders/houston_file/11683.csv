JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////LOVEEE this place. If you are traveling from out of town to Houston, this is definitely a place you want to try. I have tried a lot of different ramen restaurants in Dallas and Jinya definitely blows them out the waters. Jinya is also compared a lot to Tigers Den. Although I have yet to try it, from reading different yelp reviews it seems like Jinya wins.
