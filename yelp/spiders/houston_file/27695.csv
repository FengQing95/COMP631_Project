The Pit Room////After we finished our food, the queso was still not out. THEN we saw her walking around with the queso in her hand, but of course she didn't know who to give it to cause she never looked at us. So she walked a full circle around the restaurant and when we came up to her to tell her it's ours, she said "you saw me walking around?" Like it was our fault for not letting her know. Well excuse me, we didn't know if it was ours or another table's and maybe if you looked at us while you talked then you would've known who's it is....
