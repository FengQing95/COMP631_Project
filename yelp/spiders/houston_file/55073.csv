Kata Robata////Kata Robata is a bit hit and miss. Much of what they serve is amazing, but some of it is underwhelming. I was particularly disappointed by their cold dishes. These are presented separate from the sushi menu. And appear to be composed dishes with thoughtful pairings. Though the flavors were usually good, most seriously lacked seasoning. Of course there is soy sauce on the table for sushi and sashami. But it was not clear which dishes needed seasoning until after you taste them. In my opinion, every dish should have been presented perfectly seasoned or (at an absolute minimum) with a sauce on the side. It should be clear how the dish is intended to be eaten, before tasting it.
