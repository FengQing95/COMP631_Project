Kata Robata////This place used to be Hue, but added a grill and just reopened yesterday.  The interior decoration is mostly the same.  The menu has changed, as the vermicelli dishes are now gone.  I got the caterpillar rolls and crunchy eel rolls, which were ok but not the best.  My co-worker got a bento box with beef, chicken, and pork and was very happy with his food.  I would probably come back, just to try something other than the sushi.
