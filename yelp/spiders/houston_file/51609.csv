Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Experience - Eating here has inspired me to try making hollandaise sauce and Eggs Benedict at home to recreate the flavors. We came early, maybe 40 minutes after they have opened, but the place was already packed. From the very extensive menu, I narrowed down to my main goal which were the Eggs Benedict, but even with the 6 options, all seemed so promising that I had to go with the Benny Duo - the half and half option that let the indecisive eater chooses two Benny toppings. Mine was a combo of Smashed Avocado and Bella Bella (prosciutto and balsamic dressing). I ordered an AM Manhattan to really kick off the morning as well. Quick service even for a packed place.
