Local Foods////I got roast beef. I like my roast beef pink but it was brown and kinda dry. the different flavor profiles in this sandwich was interesting: roast beef, curry cauliflower and kale. it was pretty good but the saltiness prevented me from finishing it. my hubs even said that it was salty and he loves salty things.
