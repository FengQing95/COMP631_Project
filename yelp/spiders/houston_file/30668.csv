The Pit Room////In my view,  The Pit Room is the best barbecue by far in the Montrose. Although I love everything on their menu,  I have to mention that their pork ribs are especially delicious,  and the meat falls off the bone without being overcooked. I also have to mention their potato salad, which is among the best I've eaten in s long time.
