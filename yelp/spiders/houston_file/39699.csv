Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I wish I could give Bosscat more stars because the ambiance is awesome. I have to say Forks down on this place for me.  The Manager, Mr. Ty was extremely apologetic.  Perhaps it was just a bad day in the Kitchen and at the bar.  My friend and I went there this past Saturday early afternoon around 1pm.
