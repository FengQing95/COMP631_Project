Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////A must try if your visiting Houston or if you're  a local.  Fresh baked goods and delicious savory meals.  Get anything  with an egg on top.   You won't be disappointed.   I also love to give Common Bond bread or pastries as a hostess gift.   The packaging makes me happy.
