Uchi////+ *Pitchfork - I have to say, since seeing wagyu beef on the Food Network and hearing about it's quality, I had to have a dish that included it. My first experience with wagyu, I noted its incredible tenderness and juicy flavor, unlike any beef I've ever had. Inside the roll also included avocado, and topped with leek crisps. I believe on the side was the yuzu kosho, a kind of citrus sauce that completed the dish. To. Die. For.
