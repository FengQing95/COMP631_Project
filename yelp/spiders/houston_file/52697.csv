Kata Robata////We went on a Friday afternoon around 6:00, and I was honestly expecting a lot more people. Weekends plus sushi happy hours usually mean big business, but maybe people just haven't caught on. Their weekday happy hours are 5-7 and feature $4-$6(-ish) appetizers, $4-$8 sushi rolls, $3 drafts, and $5-ish drinks. I'd give you more specific prices but their website isn't functional yet. We ordered a LOT of food and left with only $40 in damages, so it was a pretty successful trip. On the appetizers, I suggest passing on the skewers--there are other restaurants that do it better. For $6, their salmon burgers are a little costly, but they taste absolutely delicious and earn my appetizer rec. They feature 8 or so of their regular rolls. My favorite was the Tiger Roll (I think? Again, no menu to jog my memory), which actually had guacamole in the roll and not just avocado. Inspired, particularly for Texas.
