Baby Barnaby's////I had the Pink and White Scramble. Deliciously cooked eggs. Cubed ham to compliment the fluffy clouds. Though, I thought the eggs were a bit wet, which left a small puddle on the plate. Usually, I am not a fan of fillers but the potatoes... slight crisp, with a chew as if the potato collapse on itself. The toast, I wasn't too much a fan of it. Just glad it wasn't overly toasted.
