JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Nothing wrong with this place. Take out is a little difficult but food is consistently good.  Noisy and crowded during lunch hour. Can you blame them? Prices are a little high for ramen... I mean, there's not much to ramen, and it doesn't need to be $12.  Still, tasty and good.
