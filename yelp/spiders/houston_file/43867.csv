Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I am in love!!! If you are a Nutella lover you must try the chocolate Nutella Bombe and the chocolate croissant. The bombe oozes Nutella from the middle when you cut into it and one is not enough. They are definitely not stingy with the Nutella in the croissant either. My only complaint is the distance, I wish they would open one near Katy. I will definitely be going back to try all the other beautiful desserts.
