Uchi////So, I have been in Houston for the last 7-ish years and have always heard about Uchi as an amazing place for sushi. What I had not realized is that the third Tuesday of every month is Vegetarian night, where they have extra vegetarian dishes. My boyfriend is vegetarian and this was of course, a very appealing deal. We made a reservation and showed up to Uchi for date night and to see what vegetarian night was all about.
