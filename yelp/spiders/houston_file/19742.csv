Uchi////Uchi was awesome!! Came to Houston on a business trip from Silicon Valley and decided to check this place out. Got to admit that I was skeptical about having Sushi in TX being that Silicon Valley & San Fran have got some of the best Sushi spots in the US but I got to tell you that Uchi certainly can give those CA spots a run for their money. Keep up the good work guys.
