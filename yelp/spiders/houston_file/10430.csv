JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is hands down the absolute best ramen I've ever had. Planning my next visit before I finished my meal. The broth was flavorful and silky. The ingredients were fresh and each one complemented the other. I am in love! The ambiance was relaxing and understated. I vant waite to try another bowl.
