JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Giving this place five stars for the service it was outstanding on busy Sunday night. I had the Takoyaki, which was awesome, some of the best I have had anywhere. I did order the Tonkutsu Spicy ramen, and had good expectations. Now, honestly for me personally the broth felt too rich, and the noodles where far too thick. This could easily be a reflection of my personal tastes and not the actually quality of the ramen. But for how hyped up this place is the ramen was actually pretty sub par, I have definitely had better. Nonetheless, they were extremely friendly, and had a great ambiance.
