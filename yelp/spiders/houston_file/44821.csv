Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is beautiful! The pastries remind you of a New York bakery, I couldn't decide on one item, so I ordered a box full! We got the almond and chocolate croissant, the kouign amman, and 3 chocolate chip walnut cookies. Everything was light and flaky, exactly the way it's supposed to be! BE WARNED: this place seems to always be busy on the weekends!!
