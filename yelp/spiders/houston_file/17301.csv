Uchi////I made a reservation for a Saturday early evening and was seated with absolutely no wait.  The key here is to eat early. The praise that has been heaped on Uchi is very well deserved.  After reading all the helpful Yelp reviews, we decided to go with the Wagyu beef on hot stone (super tender), foie nigiri (rivals the foie from old fav Catalan), brussel sprouts (even if you don't like brussel sprouts try it, amazing seasoning), bacon tataki (tender and flavorful), hama chili (super fresh), eggs & ham (great combo of flavors), Uchi salad (great starter dish),  fried chicken (karaage), fried milk (oozing hot milk), and other sorbets. Out of all those dishes, the only one I wouldn't repeat is the fried chicken. Everything else was excellent. The service is excellent too (Travis is awesome), they are constantly refilling water and drinks and every time a dish is brought to your table they tell you exactly what it is and what goes well with it.  Who needs Nobu when you have Uchi in your city now?
