JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Sooo good. I got the Spicy Chicken Ramen and I ate the entire thing!! I'm someone who struggles to finish a plate and had no problem doing that with this dish. I had a bad experience with ramen before and was convinced I would never enjoy it but this place was a pleasant surprise. The only thing I will say is the table layout is kinda crowded so the people next to you will be able to hear your conversation. But that's just me, regardless I give it five stars!
