JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I want to give Jinya 5 stars but it's really just a personal opinion. I think their ramen is good, not the best in Houston but still very good. The atmosphere is really dark and I'm not really digging the decor on the communal tables. I think they could've done something a little cooler. The prices are pretty high for ramen but they have to pay the midtown rent so I guess it makes sense. I just feel like they need to iron some things out...
