JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Next, with all of our ramen bowls, we use a specific ladle to portion the broth with no ingredient estimated nor "eyeballed," otherwise the taste profile would be incorrect. Moreover, if you add more toppings or switch from thin noodles to thick noodles (Vegetable Soup Ramen comes with thin noodles), this will take up more volume in the ramen bowl, ultimately giving the appearance that there's less broth in the bowl. Thank you again for your visit, and please let us know if we can be of further assistance.
