Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I tried this place simply for the fruity pebbles French toast. This was a nice easy walk from the Galleria hotel which I Â was staying in. They offer outdoor patio but when I was their it had just finished raining so I couldn't try the outdoor patio. The French toast and the atmosphere of the place was great as they played nothing but sports on every tv. I would definitely go here again on my next visit
