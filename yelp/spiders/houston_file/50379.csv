Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Parking is also often a pain. I usually don't even try to park in their lot and just go straight to looking for street parking on Lovett Blvd. All of that being said, I actually do enjoy Snooze's food. It's exactly what you want for brunch...I've gotten the egg white frittata and egg white omelet (the latter of which I think is the better value, because you get hash browns with it). I've also gotten the pancake flight, which is a solid option to share with your brunch bunch. I will say that the pancakes were a little too sweet for me, but I've also always been more of a savory brunch person anyway.
