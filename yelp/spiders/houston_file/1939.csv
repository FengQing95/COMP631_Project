JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jasen - Thanks for your review. I, too, have dined at restaurants that serve $15 to $20 bowls of ramen. But after visiting more than 50 ramen worldwide (I put in a lot of research before launching JINYA in my hometown of Houston), I've discovered that every ramen restaurant is unique in every aspect, from the noodles to the broths, to the price points they target. That said, I appreciate your feedback greatly.
