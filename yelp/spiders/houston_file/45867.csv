Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////now onto the food... my total came out to be around $31 for the fried chicken and biscuits, black forest cheesecake, and a pistachio croissant. for me, this was kind of pricey for me but because of the area i figured it was reasonable. the black forest cheesecake was decent, nothing too much to say. the presentation was really nice and it tasted like how a cheesecake should. the fried chicken and biscuits was what threw me off. when it arrived to me, i noticed that my biscuits were not warm and that the chicken and gravy were mildly warm. which made me question it. when i took a bite, i found nothing special about it. the portion compared to the price is really devastating for me. nothing special in my opinion. as for the pistachio croissant, i can't say much because i bought it for my mom and she said it was amazing but that's all. maybe because i did go on a saturday at 11am, the place was packed which may have led to the result of my main dish.
