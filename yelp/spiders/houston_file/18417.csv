Uchi////I admire Uchi because of its innovation and absolute "respect" for the delicate nature of Japanese food. I'm proud to live in this part of the city and Uchi is making it even more awesome than it is. Congrats to their success and hope to see a "cafe" version soon so more people could experience the chef's talent in a more affordable price range...
