Kata Robata////I came here with a friend at the recommendation of another friend for happy hour.  It's a good happy hour place and has a nice ambience but I would never come here during non-happy hour times--yeah, it's that expensive.  The dishes were good (but kinda small) and the servers were attentive.  I would definitely pre-eat even for happy hour.
