Kata Robata////We liked their miso marinated black cod and kakuni pork belly. They were delicious. However, their unagi roll is mediocre at best, I would give 3.5 stars if possible since I like their ambiance, service and food so far. We will definitely go back again to try their sea urchin pasta, foie-gras+unagi, uni chawanmushi and lobster mac$&cheese. Oh yes, will have to try their robata dishes as well in future.
