Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Walking in, I thought that the space was pretty cool.  Nice patio packed with people and going in there is a large square bar that was also packed.  Thinking that my friend and I were going to eat, we asked for a table and were seated in the high-traffic area - not too cool.  Behind and to the left of me was the door to the kitchen and I was looking over my shoulder to make sure I wasn't trampled by one of the (very busy) servers.  And directly behind me was one of the busier point-of-sale machines so servers were going back and forth to that also.
