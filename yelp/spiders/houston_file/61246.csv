Baby Barnaby's////My personal favorite on the menu would have to be the Steak and Eggs! For only $9.95, you get a pretty large portion of steak along with plenty of sides. The steak is always juicy and tender. The potatoes are always crispy and full of flavor. Also, the eggs are cooked with just the right amount of fluffiness.
