Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was in Houston for a week, and we ate at the Montrose location everyday! First of all Gabriel at the bar what an absolute delight he was so pleasant, helpful, and cute personality! Let me start with the grits just a side of grits, and they were hands down the best grits we'd ever had, second the shrimp and grits is to die for, that pineapple upside down pancake was delish, and not overly sweet. The pulled pork Benedict was one of the best I'd ever had omg Â and those Juan's tacos for the win! My mom and I split an order with each a side of grits more than enough food and delicious!! Gabriel will be back to see you next time we're in town! Thanks for making everyday enjoyable!
