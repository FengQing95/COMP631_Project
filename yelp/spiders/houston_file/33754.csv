Local Foods////The shrimp and blue crab sandwich may as well have just been a shrimp sandwich, as the smell and flavor of it overpowered the crab completely. There was plenty of seafood, but I didn't enjoy that the shrimp had such a potent flavor/smell, and it really colored the rest of the sandwich for me. I think it would've been better if the shrimp had been more closely mixed with the other sandwich fillings, as it would've taken some of the edge off.
