Kata Robata////Very good indeed. Overall sushi and sashimi was excellent.  Even the Mex-Jap kobe beef taco was o-i-shi-i.  I also ordered a spoon of the uni with crab.  The uni was so delicate that it just melt in my mouth within one second of entering my mouth that I left me wondering, I didn't even get to "chew."
