Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Starting with the appetizers, we were blown away. I wasn't convinced that I would like the chicken and cheese dip but I quickly became addicted! The pig candy, which is like thick sliced bacon in a sweet and seasoned sauce, was also such a hit at our welcome dinner, as well as the sliders (omg I am coming back for those and/or a full-sized burger. So good!). Guests were surprised that we had 3 more courses coming because there were such generous portions. The salad was a nice switch-up before the main courses came. We got the shrimp and grits, which has a tomato-based creole sauce, which is different than what I was used to but very delicious. The grits were so creamy and the sauce had a little kick to it (so some guests ordered the sauce on the side). The 12-hour short rib was so tender, and I heard great thinks about the steak and the brick chicken, which we had with mashed potatoes and string beans. I felt very passionate about the string beans, which seems ridiculous because they were just a side but they were cooked perfectly.
