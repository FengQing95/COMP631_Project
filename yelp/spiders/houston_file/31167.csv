Local Foods////Good food, wonderful space. Will be interested to see how they develop the menu over time. We've been a handful of times and everything has been, at the very least, satisfying. Obviously trendy? Perhaps, but that is a dickish and reductionary thing to say Imaginary Strawman; high quality ingredients served interestingly in a pretty building is a solid concept not beholden to fashion. Wish this place all the best, though it wouldn't kill them to try heating some of the stuff up.
