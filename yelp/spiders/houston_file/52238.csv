Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I wanted to get brunch today and we decided on here, since I haven't been in years. We got seated right away and the hostess was super nice! I will say we were waiting awhile for our drinks to come out, and we really wanted to drink them before we got our food. So we let our food sit for maybe 30+ minutes before we got our drinks. It was busy, but it was inconvenient.
