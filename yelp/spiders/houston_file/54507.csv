Kata Robata////What an awesome find.  It's like Tapas style Japanese food.  I loved the variety of items I was able to try. The interior is new, sleek, and modern. They have both inside and patio seating. The only reason I can't give them 5 stars is the service.  Service was not very good, to the point that my sister said she wouldn't go back.
