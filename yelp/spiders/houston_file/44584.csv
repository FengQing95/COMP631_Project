Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Rave reviews on Yelp, not the best taste in my mouth. I found front row parking on this busy day. Just stalk the people leaving! We walked in and were greeted by wonderful looking pasteries. We got the chocolate chunk walnut cookie and an almond crossant. My husband and I had a bite of the cookie and could not eat anymore. The lady recommended it and it was not one I should have followed. The crossant was just ok. I have had better (like from Toute Suite.)
