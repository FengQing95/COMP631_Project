Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Update: Changing my rating from 1 star to 4 because the cafe experience was good, and I received courtesy follow-up from Common Bond management today. They do not tow, but the landlord does. They are working with the landlord and towing company to try to minimize this happening.
