JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The point of this review though, is to commend the service. Today we went for lunch. There was a minor issue with the bowl I got, the kind of thing that happens anywhere so I won't even go into detail. The waiter took the bowl away, and sent the manager who graciously comped the meal, even though there was no need for that and we didn't expect it. Just made me love this place even more. Quality noodles, beautiful, lush broth, and thoughtfully prepared add-ins. It's a great addition to the Houston dining scene.
