Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////For my Houston friends, this place is amazing and a must try.  The wait staff and host were very friendly and made the hour wait bearable.  (Give them your number and they'll text you when your table is ready.)  The party sitting at our table before us ordered sweet potato pancakes to go by left before they were ready so the waiter gave them to us as an appetizer.  They were delicious!  Had the Boss Hog Bloody Mary (bacon infused bourbon in this baby) and it killed!  The place is popular on the weekends so be prepared to wait for your order and enjoy another Bloody Mary!  The Pot Pie is flaky and superb!  Everything is farm fresh and delicious.  And inexpensive for the area.
