Uchi////My favorite course by far was the Plum and Wagyu Beef.  It really was a perfect combination of flavor and texture (particularly with the Sweet Plum Chips).  Along with the Plum Chips was Chopped Plum, a sauce (which I think was a Plum Reduction) and the Sliced Wagyu Beef (I mean, how can you go wrong with Wagyu Beef anyway).
