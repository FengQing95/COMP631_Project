Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I keep hearing about common bond this and common bond that.  I had this bakery bookmarked and a few of us after attending a UYE decided to fulfill our craving for carbs.  The bakery was pretty busy and solid. I could not believe the amount of desserts (cakes, cookies, croissant, pastries etc) that were available.
