Local Foods////As someone who packs her lunch and pretty much eats a sandwich 5 days a week; that fact that I can crave a sandwich on my day off is kind of amazing.  But Local Foods, basically a sandwich shop, does some next level work.  When you eat a sandwich from here it's just so decadent and delicious (and not the bad decadent where you can only eat 2-3 bites because of the richness).
