JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Christian - Thank you very much for the 5-star review. We greatly appreciate your excellent and thorough review. We appreciate folks like yourself who embrace our culturally based-business practices as handed down to us from our corporate headquarters. As a Japanese-originated company that began in Los Angeles, we have long sought to not only bring ramen to Houston, but also ramen culture, as well.
