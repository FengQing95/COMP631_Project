The Pit Room////Just a quick parking note. DON'T! Uber, for sure. We parked on the street behind, Bonnie Brae. Within 20 minutes our car had been towed. Thank God in a way because we knew exactly what to do when our friend's car was towed, just a half an hour later. TTU fans: -$480, City of Houston: +$480!
