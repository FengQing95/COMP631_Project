Baby Barnaby's////This is a pretty great breakfast joint. I've been here twice so far, and on my first trip I was a bit confused on how to get a table. When you get here walk up to the clip board and sign your name in. No one told me this, but I figured it out after watching a few people do it. They have water for those waiting to be seated and the wait can be bit long.
