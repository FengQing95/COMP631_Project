JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First time visit. Brief history: enjoyed ippudo in NYC but not blown away. Here, I ordered the "Cha cha cha" being a garlic fan, but didn't notice much garlic flavor. Ramen was fairly monotone, though the pork was succulent and tender. Best item we ordered here was the pork bun. My brother-in-law ordered the black ramen, which he thoroughly enjoyed.
