JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////They give you one cup of broth, not nearly enough for the meal. $3 extra for more broth. They have new owners and are penny pinching. $ for additional soup is petty. Owner wrote back to me. My response, stop being stingy with the broth, makes the place look cheap and like it's cutting corners.
