Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Anytime I am in Colorado I plan a visit to Snooze.  The new Houston location would make the Denver original proud!  The service was outstanding (shout-out to our awesome server, Victoria)! The food was was perfection, and they have lots of yummy morning cocktails! You will likely have to wait for a table, but I assure you it will be worth it! Snooze, I think you need to start scouting your 2nd Houston location!!
