The Pit Room////We each did a meat and side. I had pork ribs and green beans (they were out of okra), my boyfriend had brisket and elote, and my dad had jalapeno-cheddar pork sausage and mac and cheese. It came out to $10-13 a person. Portions are big enough that this makes for a more sensible meal than the suggested dinner with two sides.
