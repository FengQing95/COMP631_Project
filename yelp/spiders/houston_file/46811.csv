Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Excellent. Got up early and arrived at 730 for no wait. Ordered egg white frittata and corned beef hash. Side of one blue berry pancake and the pancake of the day w raspberry and chocolate chips. Pancakes are huge. Everything was excellent. Corn beef hash is always too salty and this one was perfect. I substituted chicken sausage for the prosciutto in my egg whites and it was healthy but really flavorful. Highly recommend. Â We left by 830 and there was already a line forming outside.
