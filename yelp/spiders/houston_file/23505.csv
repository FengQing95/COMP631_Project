Uchi////I always start with the brussel sprouts.  Even if you do not like brussel sprouts I can guarantee a 90% chance that your taste buds will thoroughly enjoy these. As I mentioned I usually leave ordering up to my waiter so I do not usually remember what I am eating but off the top of my head I highly recommend the Walu Walu, Hamachi Nabe, and hands down the best Foie Gras I have ever had in my entire life.  I am not a huge dessert fan but the fried milk to conclude my meal is an absolute must every time as it is not too sweet.
