Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We visited Bosscat Kitchen last night to celebrate a birthday along with 10 other people. The decor and ambiance is really nice, the chairs aren't (metal and uncomfortable). The service was kinda slow but it was a busy Saturday night so no issues there. The drinks prices are average for the area but when I order a Moscow Mule I expect a drink and not a ginger ale so I was done after that (loss of a star there). The food was where the second star was lost. I ordered the mushroom "fries" and outside of the spicy batter it was tasteless, the sauce didn't help either so  I didn't finish it. The snapper was over fried and tough to even cut. I had two bites and I was over it. Out of 12 people, maybe 5 actually finished their food, I can't speak for  what they had or if they enjoyed but that's not a good number if the food is great. Total bill at the end for two people $139. We may return to try again  but the first impression was not great.
