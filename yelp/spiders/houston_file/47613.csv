Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've been here twice and I loved the spiked coffee. The food is also delicious!! I've had their flight of pancakes and their eggs Benedict in various styles. One of the styles had chorizo. You can't go wrong with chorizo. The atmosphere is hip and it's a great place to work or meet with friends for book club.
