Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Absolutely love this place. Starting from the airy aesthetics to the countless choices of bakery items, everything about Common Bond has really impressed me! Common Bond reminds me of my times in super bougie Parisian cafes. I could tell every pastry item has been made with care and all the ones I've tried have been delicious. I recommend the fig and goat cheese macaron (it's seasonal so get it fast!) and the alfajor cookie!
