Kata Robata////My boyfriend and I ordered the chef's special which came with about 8 different types of raw seafood. We were pleasantly surprised with the presentation of this platter. It's so pretty... I didn't want to eat it! Our sashimi platter was made right in front of our eyes and included raw prawns, salmon, tuna, Hamachi, and a few other types of fish. We were told by our server that sometimes the chef includes uni but we asked for no uni... (I know.. n00bs). For those of you who enjoy the taste of uni, you may get lucky and get some of that pretty yellow uni with your special. The prawns were so sweet and creamy. Yes, creaaammmyy. Super fresh and definitely something I would order again. Once you're finished with the prawns, you can even have the prawn heads fried up and brought back to you (if you're into eating prawn heads that is). The cuts of sashimi were thick and filling but my favorite sashimi was the hamachi. oh. my. goodness. This fish has won me over. The texture is like tuna but tastes sweet like fresh salmon. oh my gosshhh so gooood. Hamachi sashimi is definitely a must order.
