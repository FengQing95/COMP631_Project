Local Foods////Thanks to Yelp, I tried Local Foods for the first time today.  Ate the crunchy chicken on a pretzel bun with kale salad and couscous sides.  Three words: FRESH, FLAVORFUL, & FILLING!!  Will definitely return to try other items on the menu.  The store has modern decor and is very clean and spacious.
