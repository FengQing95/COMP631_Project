Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I went on a sunday around noon wait was Â ~1hr and i think it always like this on the weekends. Parked on the surrounding streets without any issue. Pancakes is my favorite thing from here so I ordered the flight with sweet potato, blueberry danish and samoa flavor pancakes and they were all delicious. My personal favorite was the sweet potato. The portion was pretty good definitely enough for two people to share.
