Kata Robata////The place is upbeat and clean, the music is funky jazz, and the server we had that night was affable, and attentive. The food is, per the server, is like Japanese Tapas. Very good sushi, and the salads and meats were very tasty: light and savory, but not too heavy or too salty. This is definitely an experience I would repeat. Light and tasty fare. A little on the expensive side -- the food is not 5 star, but the atmosphere and the service are: should probably give them 4.5 stars.
