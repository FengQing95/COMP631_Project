Uchi////The ambience is great - modern without being cold (I especially love the large old-school looking bulbs), nice kitchen, good cook books on shelves (a rather prominently-displayed Robuchon haha). The tables are close together but feels intimate, not cramped, and somehow the conversations stay separated between tables. The best kind of noise level.
