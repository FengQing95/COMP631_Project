Uchi////Will also mention that for two people our HH bill was nearly over $100. As for drinks, I ordered one cocktail and my friend ordered two sakes off the HH menu which is probably only $20 altogether. HH portions are small as they are tastings so we ended up ordering a lot. A higher price point than most HHs.
