Uchi////The Hama Chili and the Hot Rock were the best items for us.  The wagyu beef that you cook yourself on the hot rock literally melts in your mouth.  I would definitely recommend ordering this.  The rolls were pretty disappointing to me, so I would avoid these ones.  The Fried Milk dessert is what they are known for, but I also didn't really enjoy it.
