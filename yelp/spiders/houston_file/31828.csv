Local Foods////Everything on the menu is delicious and fresh. The people who work there are super friendly and so quick. This is my go to lunch spot any day of the week. They also cater and we use them a lot now for corporate events and that has been wonderful as well. My personal favorites are the market salad, lemongrass soup, and the crunchy chicken. If you haven't been - go!
