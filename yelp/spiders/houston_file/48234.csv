Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////It was Saturday morning in downtown Houston so without a doubt there was a 45 min wait.  No biggie, got on the list and waited.  The food was fantastic, the coffee good the milk ICE cold.  During the wait I read several reviews, I have to say the Pot Pie peaked my interest so I went for to, it was so delicious.  Light flaky pastry, sausage gravy it was perfect.  Service is great, staff knows the menu and answered lots of questions thoroughly and confidently.
