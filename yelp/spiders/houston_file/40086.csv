Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My husband and I had brunch on yesterday and it was absolutely amazing. The best part of our experience was the superior customer service by Marisa. She ensured we were taken care of from beginning until we left. She even took some great pics of us after we requested that she take a quick pic. Her personality and customer service was unmatched as we dined quite a bit while in Houston. Â We also had the pleasure of letting the manager know how great she was as well. Food is amazing and remember to ask for Marisa if the opportunity presents.
