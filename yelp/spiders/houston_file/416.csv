JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Justin - Thanks for the great review. We appreciate your feedback, and we will use it to improve our service. I will remind our staff to slow things down a bit; however, we do serve as many as 600 guests during a regular dinner service, and as a high-volume, high-turnover restaurant, it is imperative that we keep the wheels churning. Though I fully agree -- sometimes things can feel a little rushed, which is never our intention. Like any business, we must strive harder to maintain that balance of a relaxed dining atmosphere with keeping our wait times as minimal as possible. In a word it is no easy task. But we will work harder to achieve this goal.
