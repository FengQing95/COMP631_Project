Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went here for brunch Sunday. Nice ambience and very clean! Our waiter "Jerry" was super helpful and friendly. I ordered the red velvet churros as an appetizer and I loved them! For my entree I ordered the shrimp and grits...I was not a fan. The tomato based creole sauce was too much! It saturated the grits. Maybe next time just a dollop of this wild be better. The grits themselves what little I could taste on their own were ok. I've Â had better. The eggs were good and the shrimp were as well. I ate the shrimp and eggs basically. Will try them again to taste more of their menu.
