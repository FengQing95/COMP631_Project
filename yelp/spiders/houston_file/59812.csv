Baby Barnaby's////This is not the typical American corned beef hash. I was expecting moist shredded corned beef with a little potato. Â Their's is more along the lines of the original corned beef hash which is chopped meat with spices. What I received was mostly cubed potatoes that had been cooked in the fryer, a small amount of what I think was chorizo, and it was extremely dry. As a kicker, the eggs were medium well. Almost a solid cooked yolk.
