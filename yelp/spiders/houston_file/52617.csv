Kata Robata////Went with three of my best friends--ladies nite out--and had a great time with the food!  Waitstaff was quite friendly and very patient with our indecision--too many choices. We decided to try different things on the menu and skip the sushi so can't rate them there--except one of us had the foie gras sushi and she was in heaven.  It was quite spendy for dinner, but we were able to sample and enjoy several fine dishes.
