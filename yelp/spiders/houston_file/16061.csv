JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Still hitting the spot. Every. Single. Time. ! I sat at the bar and was quickly served. I ordered the sprouting ramen and asked for them to make it spicy. I love it because it comes with the thicker noodles. My fave! It was hot when served about 15 minutes after ordering. Like I said, fast serving. I will say that I find them a little over priced I believe I paid about $16-17. Although I love their food I wouldn't spend that much often for ramen. But hey, given their location, I'm sure they have to price up. It's on the outskirts of downtown. Would recommend to try!
