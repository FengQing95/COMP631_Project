Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I like bourbon and this is one of the few places in Houston that makes a proper Old Fashion, mottling the orange, using cherries and the key...simple syrup. Vibe is cool after work and there are some interesting food choices. I will say tho - the shrimp and grits came with a red sauce that did not have a cream base, and I just didn't think the textures melded well. Overall, great experience. I've gone a few time and I'll go again.
