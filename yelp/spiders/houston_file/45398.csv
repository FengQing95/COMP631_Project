Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This was one of the desserts in the cake display case. This was in a small plastic cup in layers of caramel pudding, then an apple caramel compote and vanilla bean cream on top. You would think this would be super sweet but it wasn't! It was smooth and with the apples added the great texture.
