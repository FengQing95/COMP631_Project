Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The Parking lot is small so on weekend mornings come early or you have to park on one of the side streets and walk! The staff is very courteous and polite. They are very friendly and I have had conversations with some of the employees. This is a great place for family brunch or even sometimes you can just bring your lap it and study.
