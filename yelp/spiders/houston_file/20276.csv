Uchi////I ordered tempra onion ring. it took  30 minutes to get to my table.I asked the server  I got some onion ring at Jack in the Box in 1 minute. Why did it take 30 minutes.Uchi cannot beat Jack in the box! " We put this " Uchi in the box' Onion ring into tempera source." Uchi in the box"  tempera was better than Jack in the box. Now I needed to pay. I was expecting to have to pay at least $50. But my friend paid. Lesson learned.The best way to save money at Uchi  is to go with rich friends.Am I going to be back to Uchi? Yes, Definitely,If i have another rich friend!
