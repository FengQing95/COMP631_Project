Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////So why three stars?  Oh man... I went back and forth on this one, and it came down to just kind of falling short of expectations.  Comfort food is all about flavor, and I love the idea of remixing and refining it.  Each item we ordered had so much potential, and with some adjustments could be phenomenal.  The pulled pork hush puppies were a bit bland and missing that strong crunch you expect on the outside of a good puppy.  They came with a honey mustard sauce that was packed with flavor, which helped immensely.  The chicken flatbread was alright, I probably wouldn't have gone for this one given other options on the menu, but it's what the table wanted.  Okay flavor, a little mushy on texture.  I had the shrimp and grits for dinner, which was not what I expected really.  It was a creole tomato based sauce with shrimp over cheesy grits.  After a few bites it started to grow on me, it was definitely comfort food.  However, it reminded me of something I might make at home, rather than a more elevated dish commanding a $21 price tag.  I snagged a taste of the short rib from my neighbor, and it was very tender but again a bit short on flavor for me.  We finished up with the red velvet churros, which could again have had a bit more crunch to them.  The sauce was nice, and really saved this dish for me.
