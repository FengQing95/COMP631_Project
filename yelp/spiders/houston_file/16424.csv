JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////There are several good ramen places in Houston, but this is my favorite go-to ramen bar! It's been hard for me to shift to other ramen choices, but I did recently find the chicken ramen a very enjoyable lighter choice. The Tonkotsu pork ramen with thick noodles has been a perennial favorite for me - give it a try!
