Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////AMAZING. The only drawback is lack of adequate parking and long lines when it is busy. But the food is SO good. We have come here for breakfast, lunch, and just coffee. I also special-ordered cakes with them, a process that they made SUPER easy. The cakes were simply stunning and tasted incredible. I love their regularly changing menu options, their freshly-baked section, their bread options, and coffee bar. Everything here is simply superb. They have community seating in sections so they can get more people in to eat at one time. It's a good way to meet new people. A little loud on the weekends, but WORTH IT. Love love LOVE this place.
