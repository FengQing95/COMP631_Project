The Pit Room////Brisket - super tender, juicy, and very well seasoned that I didn't find myself using BBQ sauce! That's when I know the meat is good when it needs BBQ sauce to masquerade its real taste. Although speaking of sauces, the BBQ was a bit too tomatoey for my liking. At the end of the day I didn't even really need it because the meat was well seasoned.
