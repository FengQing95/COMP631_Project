Kata Robata////My first time at Kata Robata will be my last. A group of 6 of us went during lunch. A coworker had warned me that lunch usually takes an unreasonable amount of time but we decided to give it a try. Surprisingly, we were sat almost immediately. But after that there is only disappointment.
