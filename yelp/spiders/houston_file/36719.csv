Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came in today with high expectations for brunch. Service was great we were seated pretty quickly and our waiters were very attentive which is why I gave them one star. I had the chicken fried steak and my girlfriend had the fruity pebbles French toast, they both looked great when they arrived but that was all they had going for them. As far as the fruity pebbles my girlfriend said the bread pieces were hard and not sweet at all, so all she did was pick at the soft parts and eat the fruit served on top. Living in Houston all my life I have never been to a place that didn't have good chicken friend steak, well that changed today. First the breading it wasn't crunchy at all and had no flavor it Â was just mushy, which is why I basically peeled all of it off. Second the steak had to flavor it was just chewy meat, there wasn't eve salt and pepper to give it some. The only thing that made it edible was the eggs, which I ordered over easy but they came out over hard. I almost forgot the gravy, it was basically just food coloring for the steak, no flavor and hardly any of it which I guess it's a good thing. Well Bosscat you let me down today.
