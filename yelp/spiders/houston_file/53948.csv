Kata Robata////I will recommend this place and for sure be back. The biggest downside is the price but since I love food and am the kind of person to write reviews on Yelp I don't mind at all paying for a satisfying and interesting meal. I don't hand out 5 stars except for a perfect meal and this meal was perfect.
