Baby Barnaby's////When you arrive, you place your name on a list to be seated either inside or outside (you choose). Really small establishment, with a home like feel. Food is really good and affordable. Water is already on the table. I liked not having to wait for it to be served, but not the fact of not having any ice in the glass. The restroom is small (for one person) and is fairly clean, but could use an automatic air freshener. Staff is friendly. I would definitely go back.
