Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The people I see not enjoyed Snooze are those who like to take their brunches slow with a lot of service. Despite their best efforts, the waiters have so much going on to really keep checking on each table. (For the record, I did have a lot of service at my table both times, but the diners on either side of us never were asked about how their food was.) The atmosphere is also hectic with a lot of people.
