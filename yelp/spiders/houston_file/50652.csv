Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food is so good!! We waited for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Keep in mind it was New Years Day so that might have something to do with it. ‚Äç Not from Houston I was visiting a friend. It took longer to wait to be seated than it did to sit order and eat. This isn't the first Snooze I've been to so I do understand the wait. The food was so worth it though! I had the chocolate chip pancakes and they were to die for! The chocolate literally is pouring out of the pancakes but not too overwhelming of chocolate. Try this place you won't regret it!
