Uchi////I had an odd experience here on a Monday evening at the beginning of October. Having been once before, I brought my parents to Uchi as a belated birthday present for them both. After looking at the menu, we all opted for the easy way out - the 6 course tasting menu quoted at $90ish. The first course arrived in a single large bowl and I asked and the server confirmed we were to share and the same would be true for subsequent courses. The food was great, but as the dinner went on I couldn't help but think it wasn't very much food for what would be a $300 - $400 bill at the end. Our server was knowledgeable and nice and even gave us a few extra dishes to share. So the bill comes and it's for about $140 - $90something for the food and the rest for drinks. I am still totally confused by this. Maybe someone can help me? It was too little food for 3 adults but seemed too much for one diner, so I'm not sure what she did. And in 25+ years of restaurant dining all over the world, I have never not been given the per person price for a set menu. If I had known it was $90 for all 3 of us, I would have definitely subsidized our meal with additional items. Really, I would have preferred to just pay $300+ and get enough food ...
