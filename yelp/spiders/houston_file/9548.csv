JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great date night spot- like any night! Ambiance and design of the interior are superb. I think we popped in late on a Wednesday wearing our gym clothes and realized that, although it's casual, it's patrons are on-trend and actually planned to be there, (not typical for old married folks like us during the work week), so I suggest putting some thought into your attire if you don't want to feel out of place like we did.
