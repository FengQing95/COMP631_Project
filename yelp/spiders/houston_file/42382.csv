Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My husband and I both got the chicken biscuit.  We were disappointed. The breading looks thin but was heavy, greasy, crusty, and tough.  I actually couldn't find the chicken inside, and when I did, it was dark meat. While I'm not a fan, my husband is, and he felt it was over-cooked and barely there too.  The portion was huge-could have done with one breast meat piece instead of 3? 4? large dark meat portions. We both enjoyed the biscuit and egg portion of the dish, and agreed we would rather have had "chicken biscuit hold the chicken."
