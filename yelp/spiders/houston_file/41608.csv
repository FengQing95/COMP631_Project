Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This time it was afternoon and once again there was a long line but not as slow. This time the case had even less to offer than before, but once again the back glass revealed cooling rack after cooling rack filled with pastries and employees hustling to fill them. This time my wife explained this was our 2nd time here and we would really like a croissant. We were told Flat out no, no oh sorry about that or if you're willing to wait we can make you one. Nope all we got was no. Now I was pissed and I said "what the hell are they baking back there and when can I get it". The response I received nearly caused me to snap a hipster in half, i swear this is what she said "stuff and I don't know when" god forbid she ask somebody.
