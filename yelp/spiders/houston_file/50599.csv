Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We placed our food order as soon as the drinks were set down. I got the Benny Duo, which allows you to try two of the benedict options - very important because there are only so many times I can make the boyfriend wait over an hour for food. Thankfully it came out quickly because it was about 2:00 by the time food arrived. I decided to get the elote benedict and the benny goodman benedict. They're definitely smaller than regular benedicts but still quite filling. I liked the idea of using an elote quinoa cake instead of an English muffin, but it lacked flavor since corn and quinoa don't have much oomph on their own. The Benny Goodman was presented nicely and is actually more of a minced smoked salmon spread instead of salmon slices - very yummy but too heavy to have more than one of. The boyfriend ordered the Snooze spuds deluxe and he really loved it! The hash browns were fresh and those scrambled eggs were the fluffiest I have ever seen. I have no idea how they made them so beautiful.
