Uchi////what is there even left to say about love. i vividly remember the first time i tried escolar at uchi during an austin restaurant week in my undergraduate years and consider that the moment i became a genuine fan of sea fare. when i think of the weeks after my fianc√© and i made our intentions official, i remember the complementary glass of bubbles and the considered engagement of our server here. this is the first place that i tried a dozen-plus ingredients that i otherwise would have avoided out of ignorance. there is an ineffable value to trust - and, that is the compliment i can offer uchi. i trust them to provide me with an experience no matter how many times i visit, no matter how seemingly insignificant the particular moment, and no matter what i order on the menu. and, whether that visit is in austin, montrose, or denver, i trust that experience to feel a touch like home.
