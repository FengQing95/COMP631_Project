JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Chad - Thank you for your 5-star review. We greatly appreciate your kind words. It is true, wait times can stretch up to 30 minutes or more during peak hours. But we try our hardest to keep the tables turning without rushing people along. I'm also glad you enjoyed our Tonkotsu Black ramen. It's one of the most original recipe-dishes at JINYA, and definitely a crowd favorite. Thanks again!
