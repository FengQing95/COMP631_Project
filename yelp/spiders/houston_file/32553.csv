Local Foods////Local Foods never disappoints me each time I come back to grab a bite to eat. Whether it may after my run, a meeting, a hangout with friends...Local Foods is the place to go for casual fine dining with a laid back atmosphere. Quality food for an affordable price. I am in LOVE with their smoked salmon bagel sandwich. Perfectly crisp poppy seed bagel with a hint of garlic and cream cheese. Very generous on the smoked salmon. Brings me back to my college days at UH getting a breakfast bagel at the UC. I digress.
