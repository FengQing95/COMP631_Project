Baby Barnaby's////I came here today with my mom. I woulda given them 5 stars, but the wait was about 45 mins for inside seating, the other option is on the patio.  I had the greens eggs with smoked apple chicken sausage, hash browns and toast. It was delicious! The eggs are a little mushy due to the spinach, but nothing to complain about.  While here, you should definitely try the fresh squeezed orange juice!
