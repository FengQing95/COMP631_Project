JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Michelle - We thank you for your review, and are happy to hear you enjoyed your meal with us. We appreciate your kind feedback, though I'm a little confused. We do offer dine-in service at all eight of our Houston locations, and per Gov. Abbott's mandate, we do require guests wear a mask if they enter our establishments. To date, I have not heard of any guests being "harassed" about our enforcement of the statewide-mask policy.
