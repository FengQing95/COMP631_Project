The Pit Room////With that said, the meats saved The Pit from a 3 star review. Brisket had a beautiful taste with a crispy outside and an inside that just melts in your mouth. The beef rib was a waste of money because it had WAY to much fat in it, so that sucked.I did also really enjoy their chili as well, spicey.
