JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////How in the world is the vegan ramen so creamy??? This vegan ramen was so legit. Before I went vegan ramen was practically a staple in my life. Now it's really hard to find a place that serves vegetable broth. This ramen bar has multiple vegetarian and vegan dishes that are 100 % customizable. I can add as many or as little veggies as I want and it is amazing, fresh, and delicious!
