The Pit Room////The food is great. We had the chicken, brisket and beef rib. Loved all of them. The frito pie was just ok. Chili tasted sweet and wasn't that good. The potato salad is really more like a deviled egg and those are not my favorite. The BBQ sauce is great. Now if the staff was a bit more friendly. They are not rude just not friendly. Didn't even thank us for our food. Which also this place is a bit more expensive than other places of equal food quality. Over all good but because of the price and the lack of customer serive we would not put it back on the list of must go places.
