Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I can only speak for the patisserie as I haven't actually sat down for a meal. But if the real food is anything like the baked goods, then I'm going to have to sit down and try it. Common Bond is a bit pricey and the lines can go out the door but it's so worth it. Everything always tastes fresh and they don't skimp on the fillings, chocolate sauces, etc. Their cookies are a must try and are giant discs of chocolately goodness. Croissants are nice and flaky. I try different things everytime I go, and I am never disappointed. Service is also very friendly especially considering how hectic the place can get.
