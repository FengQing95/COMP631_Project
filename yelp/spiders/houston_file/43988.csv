Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The pastries looked good from the window outside.  The croissants looked ginormous.  However after the long wait, I felt like this place was over rated.  The large croissant was empty and hallow.  The almond croissant lacked almond paste and the chocolate croissant lacked chocolate.  Even the brioche lacked flavor and the fruit croissant was the best out of all of these.  It seems like for what they're charging, they're being very stingy with the ingredients.  Even the glass of fresh squeezed orange juice is tiny!  I had brunch here and was not impressed with the dumpling/gumbo business.  Seems like there should be more "brunch-like" dishes instead of them trying to be so fancy.  The ham sandwich with the syrup, cheese and egg on top was good.
