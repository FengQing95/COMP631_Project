JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The entrance area looks out into Elgin St. and is pretty good for people watching.  You can catch a drink there while you wait for your friends.  The inside is similar to a trendy sushi bar.  The Ramen has more options than you will see at most places.  I especially like the broth here.  Tasty but not too salty.  I will be coming back.
