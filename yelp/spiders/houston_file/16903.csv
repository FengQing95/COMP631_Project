JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Got the chicken ramen which should be the flagship product and was more expensive than the tonkotsu. Deeply disappointed. The chicken lacked flavor and the noodles were not impressive. The broth also lacked flavor especially near the bottom of the bowl. The given amount was not filling even with noodle refill. On the plus side the service was quite quick and garlic is free.
