Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My wife and I attended the grand opening this morning.  We expected perfection and got it.  We were blown away by the pain perdu and the quiche.  The sticky bun was also outstanding.  The croissant was the best we've ever tasted, but it couldn't quite compete with the other wonderful offerings.
