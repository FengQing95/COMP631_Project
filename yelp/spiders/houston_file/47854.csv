Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Our original waiter then comes back to take our order, having no clue that someone else already took our order, when we tell him, he seemed peeved by it, which was a little awkward. Anyway, we ordered the pancake flight with peanut butter cup, blueberry danish, and sweet potato pancakes. I get the Chilequiles Benedict, she gets the Havana Daydreaming. The Sweet Potato Pancake was the star of the show, perfectly done with the right amount of everything, bravo chef! However, as genius as the rest of the food sounded, it was just average and lacking well-executed flavor, it was rather just a pile of good ingredients that the chef threw together they maybe they thought we would overlook. The peanut butter cup pancake was just a pancake slathered with way too much peanut butter (I never in my wildest dreams thought I'd say that!) and chocolate syrup, Blueberry Danish pancake was not bad, the Chilequiles Benedict... I don't know what I expected from a Colorado Mexican dish, but nothing about it had anything to do with Chilequiles, and the barbacoa was just dry shredded beef, and the poblano hollandaise was again slathered on. The Havana Daydreaming, man we had such high hopes. But as much as it had going on, it was bland! She needed salt, none of the tables had salt, there was none at the waiter station. We went through the same long, drawn out process as we did for silverware, with not one, or two, but three waiters deep and a random busser came to the rescue. The table next to has ALSO asked for salt and ALSO never got any. They had to resort asking us for salt.
