JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is sleek and shiny inside. The decorating flourishes are nice and attempt to cultivate a relaxing environment. The inside is unfortunately quite reverberatey and loud. The music is too loud, even a non-Ferengi would want it to come down a few decibels at lunch. Even though the resto was not peak full it still felt like I needed to know sign language or just draw pictures on napkins and slide them back and forth across the table to my dining companion. Or you could just shout at your dining companion like you in the club, trying to holla at a spicy fellow patron over the loud music.
