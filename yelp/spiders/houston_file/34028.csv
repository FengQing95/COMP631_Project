Local Foods////I'm incredibly shocked by the great reviews for this place.  I hadn't been in quite some time and my friend and I decided to give it another try.  Mistake.  First thing was the ice in her cup had a bug frozen into one of the cubes.  Ok, gross, but I guess stuff happens until I looked at the table next to us and noticed the girl had one in her ice too...loss of appetite thinking how dirty the ice machine must be in order for that to be happening.  On top of that my tea had the worst after taste in the world...had two sips.
