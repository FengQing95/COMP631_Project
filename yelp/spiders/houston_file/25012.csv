Uchi////It's a special place and their staff aren't just employees to my wife and I - they're friends and people we go to visit with when we dine. To us, part of the beauty of dining out, is getting to know the staff. At Uchi from the top led by GM Gio, to their reservation manager Karen, to their private party coordinator Jessica, to all of the chefs, waitstaff, and reception.. you get amazing people who genuinely care about your experience when you're there. Chefs Bigler (sushi) and Chris (kitchen) lead Uchi to greatness day in and day out. We can't go a week without getting "the itch" to return and these wonderful people are just as special to us as the food.
