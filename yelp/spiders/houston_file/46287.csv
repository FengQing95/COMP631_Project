Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////You walk past all their delicious baked goods on the way to ordering your breakfast. We ordered just about everything. Cookies, cakes, doughnuts, croissants, croissants with marzipan, chocolate, lemon, etc. You get the idea. We ate it all (felt fantastic) and it was delicious! They are also known for their pies but that will need to be for our next visit.
