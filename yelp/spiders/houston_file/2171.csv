JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Best ramen I've ever had, but also the first outside of the grocery store ramen. Love this place! The broth made my mouth so happy. I had the Premium mixed broth with pork. I loved it so much I got a couple orders to go. Will be back and highly recommend. The only reason for less stars is not big enough portions for price, but I do live in Texas. The portion was likely what I should eat anyway.
