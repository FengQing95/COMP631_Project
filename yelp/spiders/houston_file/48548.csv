Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered a mimosa (ended up having two) that were well balanced and not overly mixed with champagne, nor was it too weak. I also ordered a Benny Duo consisting of the Ham Benedict III (I always try the classic and make sure the restaurant can get it right) and the Bella Bella Benny. Both were very good however the English muffin was a little tough on the classic. May have just been the wrong choice using a butter knife to cut it (all I was given), it was more of a hassle then I would of liked. My friend ordered the Breakfast Pot Pie and had no complaints (that I know of for now!). We shared a Pancake Platter consisting of the Peanut Butter Cup (friends choice, too much PB for me), the Blueberry Danish Pancakes, and the Pancake of the Day which was a Strawberry Cheesecake pancake. The pancakes were very good and held their own, as we used no syrup. If you're used to eating them with syrup, as I am, then they may be lacking in sweetness for some tastes. I felt the Blueberry Danish could of had a lot more creme rather than just a dot of it injected into the center.
