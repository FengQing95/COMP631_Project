Baby Barnaby's////Me and some coworkers are in town for some training and decided to drive around and look for a brunch place. This was the third place we went to, the other two being in really rough locations or having crazy lines. It was WELL WORTH the search. Great location and part of town. They offer water and coffee while you wait in line. We ate outside. My coworkers got the pink and white, and the green eggs meal. I had the awesome country fried steak with eggs. Comes with the best potatoes ever, and some toast. Timely service, cool atmosphere, and amazing food!
