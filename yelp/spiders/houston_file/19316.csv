Uchi////* Service is usually excellent, but not always. On our most recent visit, our server was rushed and not very helpful. Then at the end of the night, we had to wait 10 minutes because someone forgot to add our bar bill to our dinner bill, which we politely pointed out when the bill was presented. Now I am not one of those people who expects things to be comped, but she didn't even apologize. And then we walked right past her on our way out without her acknowledging us. I'm not usually that fussy about service as long as it's competent, but at places like Uchi you expect more.
