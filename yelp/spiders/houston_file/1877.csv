JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi William & Anna - I'm sorry you found our ramen too salty and lacking in flavor. If you're ever unhappy with how your ramen turned out, you can send it back immediately and we will prepare you another dish or remake it until you find the right flavor combinations to suit your palate. Nevertheless, we wish you luck on your continued foodie adventures, and we thank you very much for stopping by our humble home to give our ramen a spin.
