JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My husband and I have been to Jinya a few times now. We are vegetarians so it's not easy to find a place with delicious vegetarian ramen. This is a golden gem! The vegetarian soup is always nice, clear and has clean taste to it. The place also has great atmosphere. Great for a nice lunch, dinner or even catching up with friends.
