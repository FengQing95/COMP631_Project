The Pit Room////Very solid BBQ. I'm not a fan of their BBQ sauce, but the meats were good. They have a good assortment of sides. The mac and cheese was delicious, but a bit runny. The tacos are worth trying, they're an interesting mix of BBQ and tacos. If you like garlic, get the chicken tacos and you'll get to watch them stick about a half clove in one taco
