The Pit Room////One of my favorite bbq places in Houston. There is typically a line to order and seating can be scarce during busier hours, but it is well worth the wait. I looove the Mac n cheese side. I have had the brisket and pulled pork tacos, which are a delicious twist on the traditional taco. I recommend sharing one of the meat dinners and maybe getting a side taco or two.
