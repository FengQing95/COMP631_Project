Kata Robata////Probably one of my favorite places to eat sushi now. All of their dishes are delicious and unique. Their smoked hamachi (yellowtail) is like eating bbq sushi. It compliments perfectly with the thinly sliced citrus pear at the bottom. The chopped scallops and uni are fresh and savory. The chopped scallops has a bit of fish roe in each bite which adds some crunch texture that is simply wonderful. The rest of the sashimi is very fresh and delicious. Definitely different from store bought "sashimi grade" sushi. You can tell they get their fish from professionals. Lastly, they have foie gras as nigiri for $7.50. Beautiful indulgence. I'd give them 4 stars just for offering foie gras.
