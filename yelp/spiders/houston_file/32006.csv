Local Foods////We had the Banh Mi and the seafood sandwich and let me say they were amazing. The Kale and slaw sides were delightful, and the fresh made watermelon lemonade was so refreshing. More importantly, the service was impeccable. They went out of their way to make sure that we had a wonderful experience, and mission accomplished! Thanks Local Deli!
