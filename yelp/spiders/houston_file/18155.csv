Uchi////My brother and I checked this place out during social hour (5-6:30 pm), because let's face it, we ain't made o' money. Our waiter asked if it was our first time and we said yes, and he was extremely knowledgeable and informative about all of the items on the menu we had questions about. We mostly ordered off of the social hour menu, and we ordered in two rounds. After we put in the first round of dishes (uchiviche, ham and eggs roll, crunchy tuna roll, and an eggplant nigiri that I forget the name of). Then, we perused the menu some more and the second time our waiter came around, we ordered the Zerosen roll, walu walu, machi cure, and brussel sprouts. Now, when we ordered the brussel sprouts, he laughed sheepishly and said they were already on their way! He went ahead and put in a complimentary order for us as a surprise, because he said even if we didn't order them, we HAD TO try them. How freakin' nice.
