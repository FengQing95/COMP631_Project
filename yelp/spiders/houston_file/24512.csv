Uchi////Food was great which I can't say about the service at Uchi ! I was very pleased with the quality over quantity thy they propose! I didn't like our waitress, she touched my brothers chip a sticks that is not sanitary, specially with the Coronavirus going around this winter! Don't know what her problem was but shot out to the chef !
