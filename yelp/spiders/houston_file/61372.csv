Baby Barnaby's////I would like to take a minute to mention how AMAZING their potatoes are. They come as a side with most of the breakfast dishes but the portion they give can be a meal in itself! My mom ordered a side with her pancakes which was pretty useless because we all had so many potatoes in our dishes that she could have just shared with us. But I must say, these potatoes are the real deal! Possibly the best I've ever had in Houston thus far.
