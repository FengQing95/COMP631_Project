Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The things I most notice is not only is everything excellent at this establishment, but they take normal nice, workers, and empower them with a true service attitude.  That's the one real reason I knew I was not in Paris. ;)  I sort of posed slightly difficult questions or requests to everyone, and in each case, everyone had a positive, yes, attitude to honoring my request.  These were normal high school kids, on three separate occasions going above and beyond.  I was really impressed with whomever is hiring and training these young people.
