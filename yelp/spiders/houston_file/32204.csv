Local Foods////The pinnacle of food in Houston. Again and again, I return to local food for their Crunchy Chicken Sandwich. I am always pleased with the consistency and flavor in each meal. Additionally, the posole--an amazing soup with chicken, cilantro and lime--is in and of itself enough to return repeatedly to this restaurant.
