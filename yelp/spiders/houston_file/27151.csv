The Pit Room////The BBQ was tender and tasty and pretty delicious. The okra side was very tender and still didn't take away from the okra flavor. The mac and cheese was creamy enough and had a good flavor. I enjoyed all of the food and I'm not really a huge BBQ fan but I like good BBQ when I do have it. The lemonade was tangy and not too sweet and went really well with the meal. My brokers was tasty and had a good amount of fat on it to keep it nice and tender. Would I go back? Â Probably but they were giving out books to visit the top 50 BBQ joints in the place so it might be a while.
