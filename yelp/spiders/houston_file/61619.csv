Baby Barnaby's////I opted for the breakfast plate which most definitely satisfied my brunch cravings. I was pretty amazed by the bacon, which had little grease and was the perfect amount of crispy. The grits were a little more bland than I would've liked, but besides that I was very satisfied with my meal.
