JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////But as a team of 60+ people, we do our best to keep the tables turning WITHOUT making anyone feel rushed. Occasionally customers will bring laptops and folders filled with documents to hold impromptu business meetings at our tables. We don't prohibit this, but we also don't encourage it. We simply make do, and hope that these folks realize there might be numerous people waiting to get seated.
