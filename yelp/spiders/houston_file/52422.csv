Kata Robata////Amazing!!! I love sushi restaurants and this is the best one by far in Houston. I went there with co-workers and we had a great time. The drinks are fabulous and the food is awesome. We all shared sashimi, a Houston roll and a spicy tuna roll. To be honest we had more then that but I cannot remember the names of them. Therefore, the entire sushi menu is amazing because we basically ordered 2 of everything that night. I am going back tomorrow and I am determined to try something new so I can sample more of the menu.
