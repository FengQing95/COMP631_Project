JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The menu had an extensive selection of ramen to choose from and I tried their black tonkotsu and spicy tonkotsu, both with thick noodles (personal preference)! First impression is that the portion was generous! A big bowl of pippin' hot delicious ramen brought a big smile to my face. The broth was super delicious, porky flavorful, rich, creamy, everything. The thick ramen noodles were cooked perfectly and I was so glad I opted to change to thick noodles, since I love the chewiness and textures of the thick noodles as compared to the thin noodles. The soft boiled egg, wood ear, and bamboo shoots were all icing on the cake. I was pretty much in ramen heaven and so were all my friends. They all loved their ramen too!
