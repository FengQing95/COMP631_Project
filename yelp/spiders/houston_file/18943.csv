Uchi////The vibe is cozy and warm inside.  Uchi attracts a large swath of urban Houstonians, from wealthy River Oaks residents, to funky young trendsetters who clearly want to "be seen."  Despite being turned away once for not making reservations, the hostess was really chill and did not come across as haughty.  Oh, yeah, make reservations.
