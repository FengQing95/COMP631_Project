Uchi////$800 without tip for party of four. Granted we did get expensive sake $200.  Still food $600 for about 20 dishes. I think we must have gotten overcharged and not caught it.  Ordered one chef's tasting meal for table and asked waitress to bring other dishes of her choice. Waitress seemed new because she was not knowledgeable of sake or menu.
