Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food at Snooze is great, don't get me wrong. But management is inconsistent & customer service can be terrible at times. My family & I drive about 45 minutes to Snooze a few times a week, but today they lost some customers. We have waited almost an hour for service before, so that is not the problem. Typically, we have waited outside, sitting at the tables on the side of the building without a problem because this place gets PACKED with people on the inside, and my father is handicapped. Sometimes nice waiters have come & offered us water while we wait in the scorching Houston summers. So, on this particular morning, the wait was 15-20 minutes, not a long time considering 2 days prior, we waited almost an hour. So, we sat in our usual "waiting area," on the side of the building until not one, but TWO waiters came over & asked us to move. My mother & I explained that we have always sat there & waited, and the second waitress, a blonde named Julie, got the manager. We again explained to the manager that we have always sat in this area, and that two days earlier, we sat at a table right next to another manager for 45 minutes & no one said anything. At that, she said "ok," and walked away. However, she came back and asked if we were really on the waiting list, to which I said "yes," because I've been here several times before, so I know how it works. But she went back to check, and came back to our table again, at which the frustration was too much for myself & for my parents who were just trying to get breakfast, and we left. Today Snooze lost three loyal customers as we will not be returning due to terrible customer service. I couldn't help but notice that there were other people sitting & waiting for tables that they did not bother. So why us? My advice for Julie, her waiter friend, and the Saturday manager? Either get a sign that says where people can & cannot sit while waiting OUTSIDE, or don't drive your repeat customers away.
