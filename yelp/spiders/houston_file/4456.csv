JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've never tried real ramen before, so this was an excellent first experience. Cool, casual atmosphere with great service. You can use the sauces at your table to make your ramen however seasoned or spicy you want. Order off the menu and then feel free to add-on any favorites (like crispy onions!). Also try the Jinya Bun- a fun and delicious pork belly delight!
