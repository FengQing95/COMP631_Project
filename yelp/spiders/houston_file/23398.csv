Uchi////You could drop Uchi in LA and charge 3x the price. Blown away by this place. Great ambience, attentive service , unique flavors. We loved the cool tasting flavor combinations and fun spin on foie gras and vegetarian sushi. Only downside is no cocktails, but don't let that keep you from experiencing this place. It was hopping for a Monday and not too pretentious for walk ins. The tasting menu that ran until 6:30PM was a steal. Glad this made our Houston list!
