Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The food is good, but nothing blew my mind.  We got the Chicken and Biscuit and it looked a lot better than it tasted.  It was good, but it was so heavy and lacked flavor.  The batter on the chicken was excellent, wished we got more chicken and less biscuit.  The Spicy Boudin Benedict was good, but was also very heavy.  The Boudin was the best I've ever had and I found out it's made in house.
