JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had such a great time at Jinya! Not only was the food excellent, but the atmosphere was fun and trendy. It has long communal tables, small booths along the side, and a full bar with a few seats as well. As for food, I ordered the Tokyo Yatai Ramen, and I was shocked by the sheer amount of food. I was full after just a few bites, but maybe that's because it was packed with protein (chicken, pork, and a steamed egg) as well as noodles (duh) and a delicious broth. I'm definitely looking forward to eating my leftovers! I also tried the creamy shrimp tempura for an appetizer, and it was fantastic--the flavor of the spicy mayo on the shrimp was addicting.
