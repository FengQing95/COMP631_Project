Uchi////In my top 3 restaurants in Houston.  Uchi will change the way you look at Sushi and will probably ruin most other places for you, so beware.  Something about the rice is just so unique and amazing.  No need to drown in soy sauce or slathers of wasabi.  Went with my girlfriend a few months ago for the Prix Fixe.  The staff was super cool, knowledgeable, and made what could have been a very pretentious, stuffy experience into something that was fun and low key.  The ambiance reminds me of a lot of my favorite restaurants in New York, in that it is a fine dining experience that is fun, exciting, and innovative.  A little on the pricey side, but worth every penny.  Leave your sports coat at home.
