Local Foods////First time here and I had such a great experience. Staff was super friendly and the food was tasty. I recommend the Gulf Crab & Crab sandwich and the "Crispy" Chicken sandwich. They even give 3 pickle spears! My brother also forgot his phone on the table and one of the employees caught us in the parking lot before we left. Overall a wonderful place!
