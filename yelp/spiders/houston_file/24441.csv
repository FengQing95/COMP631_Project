Uchi////Uchi is an institution, though it started in Austin.  GF took me here for my birthday and it was a great time.  Sushi fusion is my take.  I've been here multiple times before for the desserts and finally got to try the sushi! I would say it's solid for a high class sushi restaurant.  They take some risks with fusion, and that works for the most part, but traditionalists may have some issues.  It does get a little loud though and it was expecting a more intimate experience.  Otherwise service is solid.
