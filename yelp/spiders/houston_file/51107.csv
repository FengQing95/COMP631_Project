Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze almost ruined Mother's Day for us. We placed a pickup order, 4 days in advance, on May 7th for a 10:30 AM pickup on Sunday, May 10th. I got there at about 10:20 AM, noticed a large crowd waiting, and gave them a call to ask about the pickup procedure. They said they were backed up and it would be about another 20 minutes and that they will bring it out to my car. Ok, no problem I can wait. After 20 minutes pass I give them another call and no answer. After a few more tries I go inside and they've got a very flustered staff and open order receipts taped across the wall in a frenzy. Dozens of people waiting inside and outside. Clearly no organization; which is surprising given that most restaurants should be operating in this fashion for at least a few weeks now, and there should have been further prep/staffing given the volume behind Mother's Day. But what do I know I only have a measly bachelors degree in supply chain management. Anyways, I asked two separate staff members inside and both responded with my "order wasn't ready" but no ETA. Meanwhile, people who had been waiting longer than me were getting refunds, which was a telling sign. But I gave Snooze the benefit of the doubt, because they should already know about my order that I placed 4 days in advance, right? Wrong. After a total of 50 minutes later at 11:10 AM, I mentioned to another staffer that I've been waiting a while and if they could please check on my order. She quickly comes back out saying that the order, that we placed 4 days in advance, got lost and is backed up even further, with at least another 20 minute wait, with no guarantee. How can you look me in the eye and tell me you don't know how my order, that I placed 4 days ahead, got lost; and that you have no idea when it will be ready? No, sorry, and I wasn't expecting to wait an hour so I asked for a refund, and my dog had to pee so you're welcome for the free plant fertilizer. Luckily, our favorite Korean bbq place came in clutch with their quick service and tasty food! Thanks snooze! I never really thought your overpriced eggs were worth it, and today reaffirmed that opinion!
