JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had the Tonkostu Black Ramen and it was good, but definitely needed some extra spice. I had to add some more soy sauce to give it more flavor. My fianc√© had the chicken ramen and he enjoyed his a lot. The really cool thing about this place is you can customize your ramen or add any additional ingredients.
