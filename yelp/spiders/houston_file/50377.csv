Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is a great place for brunch...if you're willing to wait. Don't come here if you're already hungry; it's a guaranteed recipe for hangriness because the wait is usually at least 30 minutes - likely more. The only way to avoid the wait is come super early in the morning (weekends are the worst, but weekdays are still pretty busy), but if you're like me, you'd prefer to sleep and eat your brunch at, well, brunch time.
