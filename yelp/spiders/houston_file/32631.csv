Local Foods////We went in for Saturday lunch, the menu was great! Plenty of fresh, healthy & leafy options, all at very reasonable prices. I had the Asian Chicken Salad and my partner had they Summer Harvest Salad. The food came out promptly (although finding seats was still a challenge). The ingredients we all fresh and the flavours complimented each other well. The servings were very generous and you could easily have them boxed for later.
