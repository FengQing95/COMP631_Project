Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the Breakfast Pot Pie and it was party in your mouth deliciousness. This tastes just like your traditional pot pie, with a generous amount of crust - which, let's be honest, is THE best part. The flavors did not lack at all, fully encompassing your mouth with every bite. The hash browns that came on the side were your typical delicious hash browns, nothing real special but they were definitely real delicious.
