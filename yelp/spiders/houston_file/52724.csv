Kata Robata////I have been to this place 3 times, all 3 times with great experiences.  We always sat at the sushi bar and loved chatting with the sushi chefs (one of whom is the owner, Taka).  They are really funny, always recommends great food, and makes new stuff for us to try.  If you are open to trying new things, the sushi bar is awesome.
