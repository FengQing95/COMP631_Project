Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Saw this place and after many attempts to eat here it finally happened.  The wait this time was only 30 min and this was on a week day around 930am.  For Sunday brunch around 11 the wait was almost 2 hours!  The food is great and the staff is super friendly.  I had the OMG French toast and it was delicious!  I also had a Bloody Mary and it was perfect.  They have several different kinds of bloody Mary's. I chose the traditional.  This is a Great place but I do suggest getting there early or you will be waiting a while
