Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Super cute and delicious bakery. Exquisite and obviously they aim for perfection. As an avid lover of fruit tarts, I purchased a fruit tart and was pleasantly surprised by the freshness of the fruit. And was unfortunately surprised, at how different the custard was, it wasn't as thick or flavorful as I would have liked. It was still delicious and a pleasant experience. I would definitely return and try other things on their menu.
