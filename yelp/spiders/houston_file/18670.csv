Uchi////i had to wait a fortnight before writing this review, just to be sure i was being fair.  guys, this place is simply not worth it as it stands right now, but im gonna give it 3 stars because of the effort.  i really do believe they are trying very hard to be as good as they can.  if they improve the food they have the potential to be a 5 star.  for reference, we went in on a random monday at 5:15pm, nothing special.
