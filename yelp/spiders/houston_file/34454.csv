Local Foods////Came here for lunch on a Wednesday and it was packed but there was hardly any wait. I ordered the bacon, steak and egg sandwich and my friend ordered the smoked salmon bagel sandwich. I'm not a huge fan of smoked salmon so I definitely preferred my sandwich. I'm also not a huge sandwich person so I felt the food here was kind of overrated. For my sides, I got the Tuscan kale and housemade chips. The kale and the house-made chips were just okay. A lot of people rave about these sides, but the flavors really didn't appeal to me. Overall, this makes a decent, quick and healthy lunch spot if you're looking for a sandwich or salad.
