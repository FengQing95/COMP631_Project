Local Foods////Party of two and a half (we took the dog) for lunch.  He had a chicken sandwich on a pretzel bun with house made chips, and I had the lemongrass soup.  That soup was AMAZING!  Good location, but parking can be a challenge during peak hours.  The patio was clean and nice.  I'd say this place is a bit on the yuppie side, but I mean that in a good way.  If you're looking for healthy, fresh, and local this is your place.  If you want a burger and fries, you should try a looking a few blocks over.
