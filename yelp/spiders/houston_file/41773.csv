Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Wish the management would encourage diners who have finished to either move on or buy another coffee.   One booth was occupied by a woman who was just reading her smart phone and obviously finished.  :(   Luckily we found an outside table in the shade but it was still hot and humid.  (the delicious pastries helped compensate!)
