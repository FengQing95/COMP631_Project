JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Mary - Thank you very much for the 5-star review! We greatly appreciate it. And you're right -- we often say if instant "Top Ramen" is like instant coffee, then what we're serving is like Starbucks. It costs a lot more, but you know where the money goes when you taste it. I'm pleased to know we can count you and your husband as regulars because it's folks like yourself that keep us in business. Thank you again, and we look forward to your next visit !
