Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////100 degrees in Houston summer, with no fans, no misters, and just a tent outside for those waiting was NOT enough. We waited under the tent for about an hour, and finally gave into a pineapple mimosa to cool us down. Unfortunately, it wasn't even cold enough to refresh us. We eventually attempted to wait inside, as we couldn't before with the amount of people crowing the restaurant. Once you walked inside, there was no circulation. Still, hot air. Either way we were miserable. Our wait ended up being just about 2 hours, and we couldn't get ourselves to leave since we had waited for so long already.
