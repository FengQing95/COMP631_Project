JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////In regards to our bok choy, we prepare fresh bok choy every morning before lunch service, and once more before dinner service. And the chashu we add to our ramen bowls is measured in weight; therefore, the size or length of the chashu pieces are not considered when preparing our bowls. I hope this provides some insight. We look forward to hearing from you.
