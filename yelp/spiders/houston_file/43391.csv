Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Oh Common Bond... i could wax poetic about your decadent pastries and your delicious food!  This is my go to place for out of town guests because it NEVER disappoints!  The only thing disappointed when I leave here is maybe my waistline and my wallet - since I can never seem to leave without spending less than $40 (did I mention the pastries??)
