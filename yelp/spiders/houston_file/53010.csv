Kata Robata////Well, here goes my first 5 star review & it goes to Kata Robata! My new obsession has been finding good ramen noodle in Houston and decided to go on Yelp for some help. While the reviews for their ramen noodle weren't all good, the reviews for their sushi were very favorable. I figured if I ended up having so-so ramen & incredible sushi, it wouldn't be the worse day ever. So I decided to call an hour & half before coming in to see if I could get a reservation for 2 @ 7:30 on a Friday night. (BTW, I'm not really scare of rejections.) And to my surprise, the hostess said, 'Sure!'
