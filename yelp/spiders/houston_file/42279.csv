Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The atmosphere isn't like any place in the area. We're sitting here at Westheimer and Dunlavy and I don't see too many actual "hipsters." It appears to be mostly Gen X-Gen Y freelancers, realtors, grandparents, lunch dates, and work-from-homers. The music is awesome, like "the best of 80s and 90s indie rock" sorta thing, and loud enough to enjoy but not so loud you gotta yell.
