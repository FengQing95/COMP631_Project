Kata Robata////Kata Robata is consistently great. I've had dinner here over a dozen times and they are ALWAYS consistent and perfect. My favorite items are the Kobe beef skewers, pork shumai, Texas himachi roll, rising sun roll, o-toro sashimi, spicy soy ramen, and wagyu sandos. Not only is the food delicious but the service is outstanding.
