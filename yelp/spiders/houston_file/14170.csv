JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My first time coming to this place, I've been wanting to come since a few people have said the food was really good. I could agree with them! The soups were really satisfying and no guilty feeling after finishing a whole bowl! I ordered the spicy chicken ramen noodle (there's mild, spicy,hot) and an iced green tea. On their menu it shows you the calories for each item, they also have a few pics. The staff was super nice and fast. Our waitress was busy with other tables but other staff members stepped in to help and take our orders. It's nice to go to places and see this kind of teamwork because it just shows their customer service is a priority! We ordered and we got it about 10 mins later. Such a fast turnaround giving the fact it was really busy. A good spot to come and hang out to grab something to fill you up but not make you feel bloated or toooooo full!
