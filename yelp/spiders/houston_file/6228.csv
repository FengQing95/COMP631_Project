JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Overall, the ramen was mediocre. All it came with was seaweed, garlic, and scallions. If you wanted to add anything extra, there was an additional cost. Im not sure if it was because we came on a busy night or if that's the way their ramen was suppose to taste. However, Im hoping to come back and give this place another chance probably on a less busy day.
