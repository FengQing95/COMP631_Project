JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ok.  So literally awesome dining experience on all fronts - food AND service.  First time here ordered the most common ramen per recommendation from the waiter.  Wife got spicy soy.  Now I'm used to Kata Robata's spicy soy ramen, so when I tried mine - wasn't in love with it.  My wife's was fantastic - possibly better than Kata's.  I asked the waiter if he could swap it out and his attitude and response were awesome.  Brussel sprouts and salad were bomb too. Definitely going to come back and bring everyone I know.
