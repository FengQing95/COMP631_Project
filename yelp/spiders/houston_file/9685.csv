JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had the Tonkotsu Black Ramen. If you like your pasta al dente then you'll like their thin ramen. I prefer to dine at Shin-Sen-Gumi since I get the option of how I want my noodles cooked. My first few sips of the broth tasted bland. As you make your way down to the bottom of the bowl you will begin to taste more of the flavor. It started to get too salty for me, making the broth not light enough like other ramen shops I have been to. The tonkotsu is deliciously tender!
