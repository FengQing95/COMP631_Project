Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////For breakfast Â I had the French toast which looked really pretty but didn't do it for me taste wise. I liked that the bread used for it was really thick, but they cooked it too long which made it difficult to eat. He had the Shrimp and Grits which he reports as just regular, nothing special.
