Uchi////It's sad to say but my recent visit was not so impressive....service has deteriorated...dishes has lost Â  uniqueness... I asked for wasabi n soy and got a nasty look by one waiter who told me i didnt need it and walked off...had to ask another waitress...what a snob...what happened to service and politeness...anyways it's good we have many better sushi places in houston....lol
