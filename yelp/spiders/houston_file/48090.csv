Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////OMG!!!!! I had the best breakfast while visiting Houston for a spa getaway. I stayed at the fabulous Hotel Zaza in Houston's Museum District and was in search of an amazing breakfast..... Found it and only about a mile away! Luckily I was able to use the bad weather to my advantage and was immediately seated and waited on. The atmosphere of the restaurant was awesome! It had great music, great staff, and was very clean. The restaurant has a retro but modern look to it (if that makes sense ;))! I wanted a bit of variety so I ordered the eggs benedict, hash brown, this yummy pancake Â (consisting of white chocolate chips and cinnamon pecans), and the Mayan Mocha to kick start my morning off right! This restaurant is definitely #1 on my list! It's so good you have to tell everyone, yet so good you want to keep it all for yourself!!!!!
