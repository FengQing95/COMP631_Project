Uchi////The staff and service levels at Uchi are, hands down, bar none. They treat you like royalty! Additionally, I don't even like seafood and enjoy every single thing that Uchi serves - fresh ingredients, amazing combinations of flavor, and they help you choose which items to order and how many of each. You will NOT regret visiting this restaurant, it is so worth it!!
