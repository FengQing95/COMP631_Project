Local Foods////Had lunch here today and I tried the avocado BLT with spicy aioli and fried egg... so good!! The veggies were fresh and crisp, the fried egg cooked just right, and the spicy aioli gave the sandwich a good kick. For sides I had the house made chips and the Tuscan kale salad. The kale was delicious and I was tempted to order more to go, but I was so full due to the generous portion size of the sandwich.
