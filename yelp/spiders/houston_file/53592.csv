Kata Robata////Went on a Thursday night and was seated right away. The restaurant quickly started to pick up. Got loud very quickly, so if you want to converse with someone you need to talk loudly. The waiter never brought my iced tea either. Food presentation was nice and it tasted good. Would I come back? Maybe if I was in the area, but I wouldn't come out of my way to go here.
