Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Fresh Fruit Tart- I am a fruit tart man. Deep down, I can not resist fruit tarts for some odd reason. Genetically, it was impossible not to get this. A divine cookie bowl, half blueberry/strawberry topped with raspberries down the divide sitting on a berry mixture to seal them down. I couldn't handle myself. One bite into this gave me the biggest grin in the world. This is the berry-splosion your body has been waiting for. The sweetness may overcome those of you who aren't prepared, possibly put you into shock. But my penchant for devouring sour patch kids and berries from our yard as a child has galzanized my stomach for this very moment.
