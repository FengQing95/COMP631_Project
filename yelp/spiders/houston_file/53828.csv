Kata Robata////Service was excellent. Our waiter introduced all our entrees. Portion sizes were small, but the quality is exquisite and we were all savoring the flavors. Go early, there's a happy hour. When we left around 8:15, the parking lot was at capacity and there was definitely a wait. I definitely would return, perhaps for happy hour or lunch, to make it more palatable for my wallet.
