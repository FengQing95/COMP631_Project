Uchi////I love Uchi.  My only gripe is that they do not carry any 'special' fishes like fatty tuna or any different types of Salmon or mackeral as Kata Robata does.  There are many different types of fish that come around the world and at different times of the year.  I think that Uchi would prepare those fishes very well and craft them into amazing plates.  But I am content with what they do carry and their specially prepared dishes.
