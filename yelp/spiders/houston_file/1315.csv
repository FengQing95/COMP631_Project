JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen is rather rich and tasty with many ingredient options to customize it to your liking.  There are very few options for good ramen in the area so it is great to see this location doing so well.  If I had to give one complaint it would be that the price of a bowl is bit on the high side but the quality is definitely there.
