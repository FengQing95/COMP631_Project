Local Foods////I prefer a healthy dose of dill mixed in, and I'm okay with experimentation with ingredients (Liz used to add sliced green olives to the potato salad), but I was a bit put off by the word "Truffled" preceding Egg Salad on the menu at Local.  What no bacon, chopped up cupcakes , or any other manner of trendy foods?  How dull.  It was made with trusted farmer's market vendors' items, so I ordered away.  Hatterman's eggs!  and Slow Dough's pretzel roll!  (Crap.  I don't sound like a snobbish hipster foodie, do I?  Listen, I don't wear plastic framed glasses, t-shirts with dumb phrases and birds on them, and/or have an ugly hipster 1970s geek haircut...dyed black.  I'm just a FM junkie.)
