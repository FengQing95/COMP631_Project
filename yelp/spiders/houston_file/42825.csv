Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is impressive on all fronts of mood, decor, and food/drinks. The selection is nice but Common Bond really knows how to make good-looking pastries that taste okay; they look better than they taste (which they aren't bad just not great). Not only do they make baked goods they also serve brunch/lunch items which sounded delicious but was quite pricey. They also have a coffee bar with baristas dashing to and from making various impressive looking cups of coffee concoction. I didn't have any but was told that their coffee is quite competent especially if you're a coffee snob (as said my coffee snob friend). Overall, I would have to say this place is worth a visit if you're ever in the area or nearby as it's quite the experience (I admired the decor/space). Prices range from $5-10 and more for dishes. Â
