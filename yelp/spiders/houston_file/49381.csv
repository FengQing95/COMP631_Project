Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I am a HUGE fan of Snooze.  It was my last day in Houston so I came at 7am to have my GF flight of pancakes. Their peppermint smore pancakes was TO DIE FOR.  It was simply the best pancake ever.  I also got pumpkin pie and blueberry danish (my other fav).  I know on weekends they must be busy, as all are.  but I love this place and I' so glad I got to come.
