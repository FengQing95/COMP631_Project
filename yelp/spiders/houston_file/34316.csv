Local Foods////Yummy flavorful food. We were stopping through Houston on our way to New Orleans so that we could see a friend. She recommended it and I had it on my list of places to try already so it worked out. I absolutely loved the decor and vibe at this place. It's part market, part fancy sandwich shop with lots of communal seating. Pretty sure we came on a weekday for lunch and the line got pretty long still. Seems really popular.
