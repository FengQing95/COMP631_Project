Kata Robata////1) Great service-since it was our first time, we asked our waitress for a breakdown of the menu and which dishes to choose. All of her recommendations were spot on, and she came over a number of times to grab our order, refill water, or simply ask us how we were liking the food. All the staff-from hosts to waiters to cleanup-were friendly and attentive.
