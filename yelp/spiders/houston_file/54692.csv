Kata Robata////This has been my go to sushi restaurant for years. I should have wrote a review a long time ago. I always get the Kobe beef skewers, the duck/foie gras chawanmushi, foie gras scallops, and lots of sushi and sashimi. It's always fresh and prepared to amaze my taste buds. The wait can be a bit long but you can't blame them because the food is that good.
