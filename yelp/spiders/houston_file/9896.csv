JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi JD - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry you felt we didn't deliver on the high reviews; alas, disappointment is the first-cousin of expectation. Should you give us another try, please know that you can request "less salt" or "less oil" for your ramen -- in fact, just ask you server and he or she can make any modifications you desire.
