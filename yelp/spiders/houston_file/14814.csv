JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Alyssa - Thank you for your review. We regret that you did not fully enjoy our fare. Hopefully there was nothing fundamentally wrong with your ramen bowl (ie. too salty, not enough flavor). But do please know that if you are ever unhappy or dissatisfied with your meal for any reason, just inform your server and he or she will be happy to remake your food, replace your item(s) with another suggestion, or remove it from your tab. Otherwise, we appreciate your giving us a try, especially since in Houston there are so many options for ramen these days.
