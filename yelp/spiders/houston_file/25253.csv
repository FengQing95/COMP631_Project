Uchi////This is by far the best restaurant I've been to in Houston!  So good I had to go twice during my short trip.  Everything here is fresh and phenomenal and the happy hour menu offers a great way to introduce people to these outstanding dishes in a less expensive price point.  Coming from NY I can say that this is a standout spot that reminds me of many of the places in the big Apple....except we would be paying double or triple the price.
