Kata Robata////For the second course, I started with the hamachi sashimi, which was served with segments of grapefruit and some greens. The combination of the grapefruit and the hamachi was delicious and light, especially after the sweetness of the tofu dish, but it wasn't one of those dishes that made me say "Wow!" It was great, just not "Wow!" The surprise of the night was the other dish we had for this course, fried green tomatoes and shishitou pepper tempura with kimchi grits. I know...that does not even sound remotely Japanese, and I know it's not really, but you have to trust me that this is one of the best things I have ever eaten. It was surprising and satisfying in a most unexpected way. Our server joined us in commenting about what a truly excellent dish it is, saying that those grits are one of the things on the menu that she finds herself craving, and the shishitou peppers are a new taste for me, a delightful combination of heat and sweetness with a nice green bite. This same friend and I had gotten fried green tomatoes at Liberty Kitchen a couple of weeks before. We loved everything else we got there, but their fried green tomatoes should totally be jealous of these, because these fried green tomatoes, at a Japanese restaurant, totally put those to shame. No contest.
