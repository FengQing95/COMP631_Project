Local Foods////The Food is fresh and very good.  My wife, daughter and I ordered the following:  Mixed greens salads, Asian Chicken salad, Shrimp and Crab sandwich, posole soup and tomato basil soup.  Both salads were larger than expected and probably impossible for 1 person to finish comfortably.  The mixed greens salad had lots of walnuts, cranberries and an unexpected generous amount of shrimp.  Decent salad dressing but unfortunately no blue cheese dressing.  The Asian salad was also large and had a huge amount of chicken.  The dressing and sauces were good.  The Shrimp and Blue Crab sandwich was very good.  The tomato soup was slightly different than expected but very good but had a bit heavy handed on the olive oil.  The posole soup was the biggest disappointment of the meal.  Very sparce in added ingrediants - mainly just broth and no real special or unique flavors.
