Local Foods////For a sandwich joint, Local Foods is a gem, though it doesn't quite live up to it's hype. Â Like most people, I tried the Truffled egg salad and crunchy chicken sandwiches. In my opinion, the crunchy chicken sandwich was just better - more content and a lot more flavor. The egg salad was just good ol' egg salad with basic veggies slapped on a fresh pretzel bun. But don't get me wrong, both sandwiches were delicious.
