Baby Barnaby's////Baby Barnaby's is where they serve breakfast/ brunch and next door is Barnaby's where they serve lunch. Baby Barnaby's is fairly small so if you are coming here on a weekend, make sure you come early enough to avoid having to wait. Either way, the wait is worth it in my opinion. This is a very dog-friendly establishment where they will give water to your dog. Not only that, but the staff is so friendly also.
