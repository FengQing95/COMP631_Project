The Pit Room////We drove up, and the first thing you'd probably notice is the line going out the door of people waiting to order their food. It was a Saturday night, so mostly understandable, and it was around a 20-30 minute wait to get your food. What is more concerning is the lack of seating in the restaurant to serve the amount of people in line, but there was some outside seating and apparently a bar next door where you can sit with your food. Regardless, finding a table is pretty stressful and not exactly effortless.
