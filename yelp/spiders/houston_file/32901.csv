Local Foods////I know some people might be put off by the $10-$15 price tag of the sandwiches, but believe me they are totally worth it!  Generous portions, local fresh ingredients, and nice atmosphere.  Be prepared because there can be quite a line on the weekends for lunch.  Kind of stinks it closes at 8pm too.
