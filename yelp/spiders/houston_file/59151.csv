Baby Barnaby's////Great little restaurant with good service.  I came here earlier this morning and was able to get a table right away, although there were people waiting outside as I was leaving.  I tried the green eggs and orange juice because of the recommendations on here and neither disappointed me.  Coffee is coffee to me so I'm not sure what's so special about that, although having a carafe of water at your table is very convenient.
