Kata Robata////Came here a couple times for lunch to try their Ramen. I've heard good reviews on it, so I wanted to try it for myself. The service here is wonderful the waiter/waitress are very nice and attentive. It gets really packed during lunch, so I can only imagine that it would be even busier at dinner time. I've never had their sushi here before but from what I can tell (from my coworker's plate) it looks really fresh.
