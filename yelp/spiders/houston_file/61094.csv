Baby Barnaby's////There's honestly not a whole lot to add here. Really delicious brunch, and the biscuits were surprisingly good. The green eggs and ham were an awesome order, and I'll probably get them again. The line can get long, so I'd recommend coming here earlier. When you get here, just put your name on the legal pad they have hanging. I'm also not sure why this Barnaby's Cafe is so much more popular than the others, but I guess I'll have to try the other ones too!
