Uchi////One of the MOST UNUSUAL sushi restaurants I've ever been to in the United States.  I read the reviews and made a beeline for Uchi.   My experience with sushi was so so SO different, it's going to hard to describe.  I'll do my best.  But it's late at night and I'm tired.  I should be sleeping not writing reviews... LOL!
