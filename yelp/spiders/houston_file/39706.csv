Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I have  been to this restaurant several times it's a good place to go for brunch fantastic DJ ! The owner stopped by our table and took really good care of us. John made  sure everything was perfect, my gfs enjoyed a great dining experience . As for the food we had the bass cat burger which I can honestly say is one of the best burgers I had along side Perrys Steakhouse Burger The beef is ground in house , ask for the burger the chefs way along with a side order of Bosscat frys!!! The craft cocktails are amazing and very different , not your typical brunch mimosas...
