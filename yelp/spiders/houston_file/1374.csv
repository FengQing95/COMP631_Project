JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////May I ask if there was anything in particular about our ramen that left you underwhelmed. I know that may be asking a bit much, but please know our reputation, online or otherwise, affects dozens of people who depend on our restaurant to provide for themselves and their families. We are always looking to do better.
