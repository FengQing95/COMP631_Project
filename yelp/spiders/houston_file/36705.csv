Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I've been to Bosscat for dinner 4-5 times. It's freaking delicious, the service is awesome, and that's clearly why I keep coming back. I finally took everybody's (Destiny's) advice and came for brunch. BRO. Turn. Up. Delicious food, well-made cocktails, and our dude Terry. Great time. Oh, and it was my birthday brunch so mad love to T-dog for keeping the gins coming.
