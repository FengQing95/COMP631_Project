The Pit Room////Not much more to say besides please go. The Brisket and Pulled Pork Tacos were perfection. The brisket dinner is sent from Heaven lol. Even the layout with indoor and outdoor seating is spacious and comfortable. The smallest of caution is that some of the sides are spicy, but as long as you like some heat you are fine. If you want something more tame, try to potato salad or mac & cheese.
