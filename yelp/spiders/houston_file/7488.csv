JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Amanda - Thank you for the 5-star review! We greatly appreciate it. On behalf of our entire staff, we are grateful you gave us a try. Also, please know that if ANY part of your meal isn't what you were expecting, let your server know and he or she will make sure to accommodate you to the best of our ability. And in the case of the improperly cooked seasoned egg, we would have been happy to provide your friend with another one.
