Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I seen all the rave about the fruity pebble French toast and had to come check it out for myself. When arriving, the lights are dim and music is blaring like a club. Which is okay, I'm just here for the food. We sat down and kind of twiddled our thumbs as we watched waiters walk by. Finally after 20 minutes, someone helps us. My husband asks for the drink menu, and we waited another 15-20 minutes just to receive that. Our waiters then switched, which confused us. The French toast came and I couldn't wait to take a bite. All the hype was OVER hyped, and it was just okay. The bread was too crunchy and it wasn't sweet enough. My coffee was extremely dark and it took 2 creamers to barely lighten it. I couldn't even drink it and just opted for getting a coffee down the road. All in all, $50 for some okay tasting food and liquor. My husband loved the variety of whiskeys, but I don't think we'll be returning.
