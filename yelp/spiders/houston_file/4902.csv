JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been wanting to check out all the ramen noodle spots in Houston after I visited Tiger Den. I did a FB poll and several people recommended this spot. My first visit,  the wait was insane.  I think almost an hr so i left because there was absolutely no room left to wait.  It was extremely packed!  Second visit about 25 minutes wait  so we decided to wait because it was too cold to walk around to find something else. Noodles were yummy and their sweet sparkling sake was my favorite. I was a lil surprised we were seated with a bunch of other strangers on a huge island table. So my friend and I couldn't really catch up and talk about our personal business. It was a tad awkward because I didn't want people hearing about her breakup so I couldn't ask how she was handling everything.  I liked the noodles more than Tiger Den so wanted to bring my bf to hear his opinion and rating. It was about a 25 minute wait again.  We sat at the bar to drink sake while waiting. Here comes my second con for the place (first being the long wait). We were given two shot glasses,  and if it wasn't for me always taking Instagram photos of everything I consume (lol) i would have never noticed the red lipstick imprint on my glass. I asked for a second and informed the bartender it was dirty.  He handed me another from their clean pile of shot glasses, and this one too was also dirty.  Instead of red lips, it was a nude with a tint of blush lip imprint. By this time I was appalled at their cleaning process. I'm almost positive they are just quickly rinsing them under water and popping them back on the bar instead of washing it properly.  I've never been a bartender so idk what are the rules, but it seems like their bar sanitary conditions needs to be checked. I'd recommend drinking from the bottle instead or checking your glassware and taking the extra step to wipe down with your napkin i guess? When we finally got seated, I was happy we got a booth  so a lil  more privacy this time. However, because of the crowd you have to speak up a lil and again don't talk about personal matter because i can hear everyone's conversation around me. Our waters arrived,  and just my luck I found something in it. Waiter was quick to replace it, provided good service and recommendations on the menu.  Food was good.  We had the old school,  the black and the chef special noodles. For an appetizer we ordered the salmon and avocado as recommended.
