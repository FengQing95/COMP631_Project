Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My wife and I go here every so often for breakfast.  On our last visit I ordered the BISCUTS AND GRAVY. While they were not bad, they were underwhelming.  The heart of the dish, the biscuits, were above average.  The gravy was bland and there eggs were okay.
