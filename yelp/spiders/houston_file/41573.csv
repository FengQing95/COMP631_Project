Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Came for lunch during the weekday. The place was really cute and clean, and quite busy. My coworker and I ordered a steak and bleu cheese salad and a Caesar salad and the giant chocolate chip walnut cookies on display in the lovely pastry display. The cookies were quite good. The salads however, were terrible. The steak salad didn't have any steak and my friend didn't realise until we were back at the office. He called to let the manager know and the manager said "the steak comes on the side" even though it clearly didn't and my friend didn't get any. They are processing his refund now. My Caesar salad was pathetic. It was wilty romaine, cheese and a crouton or two. Definitely not worth $11 for that, half empty and sad looking salad. The stars are literally only for the nice bakery and space there, not the cafe food.
