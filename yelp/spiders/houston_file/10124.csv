JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My boyfriend and I decided to try out Jinya for lunch earlier this week. It's a small upscale, ramen bar - and freakishly cold inside. Cute place but can get really loud when packed. There is garage, valet and street parking. Not sure if there's a cost for street parking since everywhere in Midtown charges these days.
