The Pit Room////Even if you aren't a huge BBQ snob who debates how perfectly everything needs to be smoked, you'll enjoy Pit Room. What sets them apart is their constant creativity. Take the tacos for example, which get an A+ on both presentation and flavor. The smoked chicken with melted cheese and garlic is killer, and the tender pulled pork with the pickled onion and avocado sauce drizzle is sent over the top. Tortillas are made in-house too.
