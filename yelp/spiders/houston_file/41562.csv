Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////- Chocolate chip cookie - $3.75 probably the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever had! Pricey, yes, but people also pay an absurd amount for a cookie at Levain in New York. Note that this cookie DOES contain nuts, even though it's not stated. This may be an issue if you are allergic.
