Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great drinks, food, and service! We came here for drinks and apps late on a Friday night. The atmosphere was pretty clubby for a restaurant, and it seemed more like a place to be seen. There was a dj and bar in the front, but the back is less loud and crowded. I had the bosslady vol. 2 and my friends had other cocktails from their menu. All were unique and had a nice depth of flavor.
