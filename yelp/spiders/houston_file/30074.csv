The Pit Room////The Pit Room is what I would term decent bbq. I've been multiple times with friends who are also bbq fanatics. On the most recent trip the brisket was good, while the ribs were undercooked, but flavorful and huge. Best part of the meal was their sausage., the Czech sausage we had was pretty good.
