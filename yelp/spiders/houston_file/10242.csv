JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Anyway, we sat down and ordered a couple bowls of ramen and a takoyaki appetizer. The food came out pretty quickly, which was great because I was starvinggg. I thought the takoyaki was okay but I'm no expert on it at all. It was very soft on the inside with a couple pieces of octopus per ball.
