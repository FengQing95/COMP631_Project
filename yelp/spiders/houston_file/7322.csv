JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This was my second time getting ramen, the only other place I have been is Ninja Ramen in the heights. It was really good. I was unsure of what to order and the waitress talked me through my options and what she typically recommends to new people and what is generally popular. I sat at the back bar with my friend and it was fun to watch all the movement in the kitchen area. The food was great, I ate almost all of it (rare for me). So overall this place it great. The hostesses are communicable, the servers are knowledgeable and the food is tasty. What more could you ask for?
