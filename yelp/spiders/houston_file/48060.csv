Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We loved our first experience at Snooze! We happened to be off during the week and decided to check it out. It's super packed on the weekends so we lucked out to get in with no wait. I ordered the shrimp and grits and I was beyond pleased with my choice. I devoured it. I can't wait to go back to try even more items on the menu.
