Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Love this cafe but wish they had a larger food/brunch menu. Every Saturday and Sunday it is packed - be prepared for a crowd!  Highly recommend the smoked salmon toast for breakfast - it's our weekend go-to.  Also have amazing individually steeped teas, specialty coffees, and fresh squeezed orange juice. Can also pick up pretty macaroons for a nice gift!  Caden is a super sweet barista behind the coffee bar and we love seeing him... Keep up the great work
