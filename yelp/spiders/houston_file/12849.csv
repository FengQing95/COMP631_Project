JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Then comes the disappointment.  The crispy chicken was too salty, not as crunchy as I'd like and was just meh.  The pieces are pretty big so get the smaller count if you're not too hungry.  I've had better chicken.  The ramen.. I ordered the tonkotsu black and it wasn't good. The broth was thick and pretty bland.  I had to add garlic, the ramen sauce, and chilli flakes into my bowl.  The noodles were cooked perfectly and the egg was poached correctly so it was runny.. But the flavors were a disappointment.  The pork was soft but again not spectacular.
