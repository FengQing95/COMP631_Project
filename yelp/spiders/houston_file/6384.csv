JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Amy - Thank you for your great review. I'm glad to hear we were your first exposure to authentic Japanese ramen here in Houston, and we appreciate your kind words. We're especially pleased that our ramen stacks up to the ramen you had in Japan. As far as comparisons go, it really doesn't get much better than that. Thank you again, and we hope to serve you again soon.
