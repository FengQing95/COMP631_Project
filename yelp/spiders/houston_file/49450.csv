Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Honestly, I'm so confused why everyone is obsessed with snooze. I've been wanting to try it for ages and finally got to go recently. We waited an insane amount of time for the people in front of us (part of 2) and once seated we were not approached at ALL by a waiter/waitress for about 20 minutes. I was beginning to wonder if I needed to seek someone out because perhaps we weren't assigned a waitress... for a weekday, it took about an hour and a half to be seated and have someone approach our table. The thing is, the line is always long not because it's crowded but because service is horribly slow. Decent food but I likely won't return for the terrible service when there are so many better places in Houston.
