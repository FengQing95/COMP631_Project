The Pit Room////I like this spot.  Good food.  Good service.  Little things make it fall short.  Meats are cold.  When you spend 22.99 on a three meat platter you want it to be hot when you get to the table.  It isn't.  Second time now.  Mac and cheese sub par.  Pretty watery.  Elote corn....just off. Pork ribs were cold in the center which made me wonder if they were fresh or reheated.  Very little beer selection.  Parking is a nightmare.  Flies were bad inside for this visit.  Really wasn't impressed this time around.  Lots of other BBQ spots that do it's better with lower prices. Maybe just an off day....not sure we would be back for a third visit or not.
