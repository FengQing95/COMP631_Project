Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My friend and I did get a stomach ache after eating, idk what it could have been. I probably wouldn't go back.  I swatted away a fly at my table.  And my Benedict was cold when it arrived, hopefully they didn't have it sitting out uncovered before bringing it out to me. Allowing the fly to do his business on it... that's the only thing I could think of why we got sick after eating here.
