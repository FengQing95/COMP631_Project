Local Foods////The food and atmosphere here make this a great spot for a nicer evening out to eat. The patio is expansive and well-decorated, and the inside is comfortable as well. The menu changes with great regularity at Local Foods, so you can come back and get something different nearly every other week or so. I've had both the meatloaf and a steak here and both were truly great. All in all, you won't be disappointed with eating here. Everything is fresh and local! Super impressed with this place. Go!
