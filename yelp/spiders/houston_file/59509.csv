Baby Barnaby's////Green eggs dish - the eggs aren't overcooked and are creamy. The apple sausage is an great complement, with a slightly sweet taste. The potatoes come very crispy with just enough seasoning. This is a fantastic dish that I can't get anywhere else. Good coffee. Good freshly squeezed juice. There are some healthy options as well, but definitely get the green eggs dish if this is your first time here for brunch. Great atmosphere.
