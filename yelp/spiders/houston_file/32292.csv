Local Foods////By the time we were getting into town after leaving a flood ridden San Antonio, we decided to either find somewhere that Guy Fieri had eaten or see what was hot on Yelp. Local Foods popped up on Yelp with excellent reviews and had the two of us excited and expecting greatness. Once we walked in the restaurant we felt very comfortable with the relaxed and easy-going feel of the decor and staff, matched wonderfully by indie music and local craft beer on tap. A sizable location, this place is good for small groups and seems like it could easily accommodate larger parties.
