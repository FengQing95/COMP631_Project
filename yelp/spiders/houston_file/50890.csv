Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place is amazing. We got there just after 9 on a Friday and were seated immediately. We enjoyed every dish, the waitress was super accommodating, my mom was even impressed by how hot the coffee is, and it's usually never hot enough for her. My only complaint was that the order (no special orders) took longer than we expected (typically it wouldn't matter but we were time crunched). Anyway, we all agreed we would definitely go back. Beware the parking! Even with immediate seating, i had to make a few laps to find a spot.
