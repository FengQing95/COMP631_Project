Local Foods////Delicious! I decided to go here after reading other yelp reviews, and I was definitely impressed! It's a Â cute little place with an open kitchen. The decor is adorable. The food is really good. Their sides are very unique and consist of options I probably would have never thought of trying. I had quinoa and orzo. Also love the kale and chips. The DUCK CONFIT sandwich is amazing!!! Everyone should have a taste. The combination of ingredients surprisingly goes together extremely well. Also, Crunchy chicken was a pretty tasty sandwich. I look forward to returning to try their other menu items.
