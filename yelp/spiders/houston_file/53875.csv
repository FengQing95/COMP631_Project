Kata Robata////Uni chawanmushi: Sadly, this is the only thing I was not fond of. I was slightly frustrated that it was on the menu as a starter/appetizer, but came out much much later during the dinner. Very weird consistency for me, in which I had to chase it down with my cocktail... 2/10 (2 points for the tasty shitake mushroom)
