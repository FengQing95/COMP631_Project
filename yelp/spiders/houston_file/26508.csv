The Pit Room////I was raised on Texas Barbecue. This is the best I've ever had. Variety of sausages, all amazing. Ribs perfectly meaty, fatty, bbq crusty on the outside. And the piece de resistance, Texas brisket, was perfect. Falling apart tender. Smoky crust. Their bbq sauce, just slightly sweet, brings it all together. Â I don't believe Texas bbq gets much better than this.
