JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I say come to Jinya if you are looking for an authentic Ramen in Houston. I usually get Cha Cha Cha. I like my Ramen noodles soaked in lots of garlic Â just make sure you take care of that garlic breath before you go to work. Also I ask for my noodles a little on the hard side and lots of dry seaweed on the side to complete my order.
