Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Decor is retro, service was awesome, food was ok! I had the pancake flight. My favorite was the Dutch blueberry one. I have a major sweet tooth but these were too sweet even for me. The hubs had the classic breakfast and he thought it was ok. I liked the hash browns but the hubs didn't. Would I wait a long time for this place? No! Would I go back if no wait time and in area? Probably. Why? Ambiance and service.
