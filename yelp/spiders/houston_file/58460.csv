Baby Barnaby's////I love this place! The service is always, always fantastic and quick and they are happy to accomodate your tastes. The fresh oj is amazing and the potatos for breakfast are delicious. Amazingly, I always find seating here and never have to wait. This place reminds me of something you would find in Venice, CA.
