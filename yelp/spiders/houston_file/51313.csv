Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Quite possibly the BEST tomato soup I have ever eaten!  Not kidding.  It's weird, I know.  Who raves about tomato soup?  But have you ever ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup with the anticipation that the soup would steal the show?!?  I don't think you have, and it was honestly THAT good.  It was light, not too heavy with cream yet smooth, and perfectly acidic and balanced.  The grilled cheese was tasty too, but that SOUP!  I've also had the breakfast pot pie and it was excellent.  The service is perfect...if you go early during the week, treat yourself and sit at the bar with the lovely ThereOnly deducting one star for parking...it's pretty bad even when it isn't busy.
