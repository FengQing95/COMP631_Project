Baby Barnaby's////The green eggs are delicious... the creamy texture of the eggs with the spinach/ artichoke combination works perfectly. The migas have to be my favorite though.  ( only if you add the chorizo - fantastic) perfect blend of flavors,  savory and spicy ( the chorizo adds to this), with nicely done tater tots. Wash it down with delicious, fresh squeezed orange juice (makes you realize just how crappy the boxed juices are) and its the perfect brunch to start your weekend morning. And the prices aren't too bad either. Check it out if you haven't already!
