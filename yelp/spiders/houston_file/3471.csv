JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Regina - Thank you so much for the great review! I'm happy you decided to give ramen a try, and even happier that you enjoyed our fare. When we opened almost two years ago, we weren't sure how Houstonians would respond. But after almost 1,400 Yelp reviews, I think we're officially part of the Houston Foodie Landscape. Thank you again, and we hope to serve you again in the near future.
