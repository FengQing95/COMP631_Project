Uchi////My experience here was pleasant.  My friend invited me to happy hour to try the highlight dishes of the sushi restaurant.  I cannot recall the names of the dishes, however each dish I tried was fantastic!  Each bite was an explosion of flavor in spite of the bite size portions.  The dish that I remember most was a dish with crackers (a fancy cracker not Ritz) and salmon.  The presentation was fantastic.  The pictures speak for itself.  Our waitress was absolutely amazing!  She was kind, eloquent, knowledgeable of every item on the menu, and serviced us with a smile.
