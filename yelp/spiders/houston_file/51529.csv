Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've been to Snooze locations in both Denver and Houston in the past 6 months and tragically neither can properly poach an egg. I'm not sure if this is because they leave food on the counter too long before serving it or they're just over-cooking the eggs, but both times, I've had soft boiled eggs over my hash browns instead of poached (which means the yolk is not really runny).
