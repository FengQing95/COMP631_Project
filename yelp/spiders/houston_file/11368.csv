JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ramen is great, some say it's not as good as other places and it isn't, but it's still good. Parking is horrendous, and when you do find parking, get ready to stand and wait upwards of an hour to be seated. Once you're seated, though, the wait is not bad. Would not recommend for a first date or anything like that but not a bad place to go if you have a day or so to kill, lol.
