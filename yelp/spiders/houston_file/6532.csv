JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Sri P. - Thank you very much for the 5-star review. I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen, and I'm especially pleased that it prompted you to visit Japan! That's amazing. We're big ramen fans, too, and we have a strong suspicion that ramen has become a staple dining option for our fair city. Thank you again, and we hope to serve you again soon.
