Uchi////I work as a salesman and love eating at sushi places all over the US (specifically the West Coast) and this was by far one of the worst experiences.  First, after waiting for over an hour to be seated, the hostess seats us at the sushi bar without even asking. Even the most podunk, hole-in-the-wall sushi place will ask if it is okay to be seated at the sushi bar. Frack, even chain restaurants will ask you if it is okay to be seated at the bar.  So after being seated at the sushi bar and not knowing I could get a table, I wait for five minutes to be asked for a drink.  This is might be okay if I am at a chain restaurant like Chili's on a busy night, but if I am paying over $100 dollars for a meal for two, I expect at least a glass of water from a busboy the minute I sit down. Then, the "drink" waitress finally comes and asks for my drink order and tells me I can only order drinks from her, but I will need to order my food from the sushi bar.  Are you freaking kidding me? In every sushi bar I've been to, you have an actual waitress to take your food order, but you can ask the sushi chef if you just want sushi. In some cases, I have ordered all my food and drinks from the sushi chef, but there was barely anybody at the restaurant and the guy behind the bar probably owned the joint. The other thing that was ridiculous was that this was my first time to eat at the" famous" Uchi restaurant and I had to ask the sushi guy questions about the menu. This guy is not a waiter! He is not expected to know the intricate details of menu items that are not sushi. He is not a trained waiter to provide a high level of customer service to patrons. So after I get my drinks, I ask to be seated at a table. It's already been an hour and a half, and I've already used up half of my babysitting time, the drink waitress says I will have to wait for another 20 minutes. So, I decided to pay my tab and leave.
