Local Foods////The chicken is lightly seasoned allowing for the crunch and the dressing to shine through. The pretzel roll truly is phenomenal. It is served warm and is delightfully soft. I did try it as a salad but don't believe I will be opting for that again. Love the pickles to add a tart bite as well. The atmosphere is relaxed and the outside patio is cozy on a nice day! Looking forward to my next visit!
