JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars and not 5 is bc of the annoying homeless guy that kept ENTERING THE PLACE, asking for money, and then getting pissed when customers at the bar didn't give him enough. The food and service are amazing!! But this is NOT the kind of place where something as bad as a homeless guy coming inside and disturbing your night, should happen. And what upset me more was that NOBODY did or said anything. Not the host, not the bartender, nobody. Â I understand the host was extremely busy, but this guy really annoyed me for the 25 min I had to wait for my table. I was so close to leaving, the only reason I didn't was bc we were called to our table.
