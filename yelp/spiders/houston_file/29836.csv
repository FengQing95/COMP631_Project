The Pit Room////when the line of people waiting to order is all the way across the restaurant and out the back door to the street, you have a rather good idea the bbq is going to be good, and it was. my husband and i got meat trays (pulled pork for me; brisket and sausage for him,) and we shared everything. i am a carolina bbq gal so the pulled pork lacked that flavor, but my husband said he preferred it. the brisket was tasty, and the jalape√±o and cheese sausage was excellent-just the right amount of spice. we each got two sides-mac and cheese and charred green beans for me; elote and charred okra for my husband. the mac and cheese was okay; the green beans were fabulous! the elote was good, and my husband said the okra was great. a good meal for sure.
