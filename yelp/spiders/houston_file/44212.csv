Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////One little side note about the service. I find the service at some other cafe either more friendlier or professional than Common Bond. The people are sort of there, but I don't feel their pride or passion of being part of the organization. Maybe management took away their fedoras, and they become sad pandas...
