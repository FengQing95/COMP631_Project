Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If you are looking for a trendy, hipster place that isn't that intimidating, come here. The decor is simple, but the display of their breads, pastries, fruit tarts, and macaroons is simply stunning. Luckily we came on a weekday around 12pm and snagged the last parking space in their small parking lot. There was no wait and the person behind the counter patiently waited as we pondered what delectable delights we would be ordering.
