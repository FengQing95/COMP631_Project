JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your review of Jinya Ramen Bar.  If ever your ramen isn't to your liking, always send it back and we can either remake it or you have the option to order a different ramen to your liking.  My motto has always been "If not GREAT, REMAKE".  Japanese ramen and appetizers will lean toward the high sodium side as many of our dishes have soy sauce as one of its ingredients.  That being said, you are always welcome to let your server know you want "less salt" in your ramen and we will be glad to accommodate you.  We know here at Jinya, we will never be all things to all people, but we do the best we can to meet each and every customers' expectations.
