The Pit Room////Let me start with this, I got lucky that they opened a fresh pack of ribs and gave me the first cuts...it was like God himself came down and touched those ribs. God was slow burning those ribs for y'all because the flavor was blasting with every bite, seasoning was just right ( btw if yall stole Beavers BBQ seasoning and put it on yalls, I'll name my first born after the pitmaster) , it was tender and the fatty parts were just right...I can't say much more without partially drooling on my phone but take my word, they're amazing!
