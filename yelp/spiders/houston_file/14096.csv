JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Yes, you can say I could have sent back the ramen but I had a waitress who seemed like she was already pissed off so I didn't want to make a scene and risk having a pissed off waitress to mess with my food so I just let it go. All in all I would not recommend this place. I do not understand why it has such a high rating???
