Uchi////This dinner is perfect for a long date night, customer entertainment or reuniting with old friends. I would describe it as "Japanese tapas" and you get to talk with friends while sharing a bite of each dish. Every time I go I tell the waiter what I like and what my guests don't and they just bring out dishes accordingly !
