Kata Robata////Anago and Yuzu Sushi: This piece of sushi needs work on it's presentation. It comes out this pale, lifeless looking piece of sushi. I looked at it and both my husband and I were like "wow, that looks unappetizing." It had this weird mushy and flakey texture, and I chalked it up to that I do not mesh well with anago and will stick with unagi in the future.
