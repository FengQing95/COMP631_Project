Uchi////Incredible presentation and food fusion.  While this is a Japanese sushi house, I recommend you go off the beaten path and order everything but traditional sushi.  We started with a sushi roll, it was good, but everything else we had was a true experience.  Fried sweetpotatoes come out as tempura goodness, a great way to start the meal.  Most everything is served "tapas" style and meant for sharing. Sweet potatoes and a sushi roll is how we started our evening, then...the brie ringo, tempura fried with a sweet apple chutney, followed by  eggplant sashimi- it was sweet and delcious (even for the eggplant haters, this was awesome),  .
