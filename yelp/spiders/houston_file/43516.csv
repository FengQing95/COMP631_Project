Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Note to parents: the space isn't particularly kid friendly. Leave your strollers out in the car as the space is tight. And don't expect any employees or patrons to help you as you run to to every nook and cranny with your stroller. =| high chairs are hidden away so don't be shy to ask for one. If you have one of those clamp-onto-table chairs of baby.. Don't bother. It won't fit onto the tables at this spot. Your best bet is to tote the infant in their car seat.
