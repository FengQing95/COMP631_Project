Baby Barnaby's////We arrived on a Monday with just 2 parties ahead of us, so we only waited about 5 minutes to be seated. The restaurant is VERY small, but the staff turns over tables very quickly. Â If you are looking for a quiet place to have breakfast, this isn't your place. It's loud, but not in an annoying way.
