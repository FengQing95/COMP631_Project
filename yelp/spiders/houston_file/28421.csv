The Pit Room////- Mustard Potato Salad: OK, even though I am not a BBQ fan, I still am very aware of what good potato salad tastes like. THIS WAS THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD. It had just the right amount of potatoes, mustard, veges, and whatever else was in it. It was not dry at all. I'm a huge fan of this! Rating: 5+
