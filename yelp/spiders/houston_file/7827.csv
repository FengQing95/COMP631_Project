JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I tried their "Premium Tonkotsu White" and made it spicy.  Let's just say best decision ever! It was so good that stuffed myself miserably.  On that day, I made it a combo and added the crispy chicken and salad.  The servings were a bit small in my opinion.  If you like chicken karaage then you'll like it.
