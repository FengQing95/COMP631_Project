Baby Barnaby's////Breakfast here is the best start to any day, or for me, everyday.  80's music always jammin'.  Insanely delicious black beans.  Perfect Oatmeal.  Overall, great, healthy food.  And the awesome staff of Scott, Ana, Jose, Marina, Darneezy, etc. sincerely makes this place the best breakfast in town.
