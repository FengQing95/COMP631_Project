Uchi////Best sushi I have ever had - take the waiters/chefs suggestions and try something different.  The flavors  developed on the nigiri are amazing-  not inexpensive so not a weekly sushi stop, but great for special date night or nicer work / customer dinner.  Don't miss it- very festive environment-
