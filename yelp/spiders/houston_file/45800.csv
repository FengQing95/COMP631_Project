Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So my brother was in town last weekend and after a long day of hiking, I decided to take him to Agora to get his late-afternoon coffee-fix. As we were walking up to Agora we saw Common Bond, and as it had been on my list of places to try for a while, we decided to go in here instead.
