Baby Barnaby's////Been several times for weekend brunch. Food is above average but by no means exceptional. Prices are reasonable. The restaurant itself is rather small in area and individual tables are packed tightly together. It would seem to be difficult to seat a party larger than 4. On the weekend, wait times can really start to stack up; if you arrive by 9am you should be ok. Otherwise, be prepared to wait outside for at least 30 minutes. When you arrive, place your name on the legal pad by the door and wait for your name to be called. Parking is all street parking; I've parked within 2 blocks every time.
