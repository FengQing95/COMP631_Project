Baby Barnaby's////Service was good, but we were there on a Tuesday so it wasn't crowded. Places like this are a dime a dozen in New England where I grew up, and I'm not sure why they're such rare finds in Houston. While I really enjoyed the experience, I wouldn't go on a weekend and stand in line just for tasty eggs, hash browns, and toast.
