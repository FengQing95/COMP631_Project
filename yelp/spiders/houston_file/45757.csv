Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The macarons here are my new favorite in town. I was a little turned off by the pricing at $2.25 each, which is a little on the pricey side in comparison to others around town.  As soon as I took my first bite I knew it was worth every penny. The texture, taste, and packaging is perfect.  My personal favorites are pistachio and salted caramel.  The cookies also blew me away with the classic chocolate chip being my favorite.
