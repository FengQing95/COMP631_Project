Uchi////What did stand out was the fried milk dessert. Oh.. my... goodness.... the best ever! Apparently they have a mousse expert they hired, which would explain why the chocolate mousse was so incredible. Then there was a great fried dough ball filled with milk, which apparently they take over 5 hours to make! Lastly, it came with a decadent vanilla ice cream surrounded by cookie crumbles. It was absolutely outstanding, and I would come back just for this.
