JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////There weren't many people at the restaurant when we walked in, but by the time we left, it was packed. We decided to try a couple of appetizers: the crispy chicken and dumplings. The dumplings were super tiny but good. The chicken I got tired of after a couple pieces. Still good, but I wasn't able to finish it. It was a tad salty too.
