Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First time here for brunch. Wait supposedly 30-40 minutes, but we were called after 15.  Food was very good. We had the French toast, excellent, meat loaf, also great, and my husband had the burger which he devoured, so must be great. Their fries are cut and made in house. Very good. Service was a bit slow, so minus 1 star. We waited about 5 minutes before someone came over to give us water.  Parking is valet, street, or garage. Overall I'd revisit.
