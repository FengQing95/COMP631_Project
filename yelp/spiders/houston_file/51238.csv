Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food itself is 4 stars, but the long long brunch/lunch waits (even on a weekday! sheesh) are what knock it down to a 3.5 for me in terms of the overall experience/overall restaurant rating. Â I've been only once -- I love brunch food and crave it regularly, but in my opinion the wait time is no bueno so I haven't become a repeat customer unfortunately.
