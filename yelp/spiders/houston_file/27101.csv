The Pit Room////Took our friend from California to try Texas BBQ and we were surprised that we were able to get a table and did not have to stand in line. We got the beef ribs, pork ribs, brisket, sausage and Â chicken. Typical prices mostly the same as other BBQ places I have been in Texas. The meats were ok. It could use a little more flavor. The sides were actually winners...love the mac and cheese and the potato salad.
