Kata Robata////everything was good, but my favorites were the snapper sashimi, tofu with mushrooms, oxtail ramen, tuna roll, sexy scallop roll, and the kobe beef roll.  kata robata has regular sushi rolls, but to get the full experience, order the specialty rolls, which are very good and average around $17/roll.
