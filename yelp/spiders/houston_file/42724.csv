Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////On this trip we had the almond croissant, so flaky and delicious, the filing is semi-sweet and not overwhelming.  We also enjoyed the Kugelhopf, which is hard to pronounce, but easy to engulf.  It's a bit tart (lemon?), but also sweet.  The sticky bun was like a cinnamon roll covered in a sweet sticky drizzle and nuts.
