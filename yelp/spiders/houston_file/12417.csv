JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The service is incredible. I came in late on a Tuesday night, and while they weren't able to seat me, I was able to get an order for take-out which worked out even better. I came to pick up the place right as the restaurant was closing. The ordered the spicy black tonkatsu ramen and the added garlic was a great touch.
