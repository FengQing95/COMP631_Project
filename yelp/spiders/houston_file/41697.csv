Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Kouign amann is a must get. It's like a cronut - soft and layery, not too sweet, right balance of crunch/flake/softness. The almond croissant was also really good. It's huge and the right balance in texture and sweetness. Finally, got the chocolate cookie, which was very soft. However, I don't recommend eating the cookie with other pastries because it tastes uber sweet. I'd take it back home for a post-dinner dessert.
