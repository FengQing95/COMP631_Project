JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////They serve processed ramen that is too salty, greasy and Texan-Mexican spicy.  The noodles are no different than what you can get from those discount grocery stores.  Service is fairly good.  There are cute, young Asian girls in tight shorts to look at while eating.  Prices are a bit too high.  Crowds are young but some will become more douche-like as the evening progresses.  A lot of patrons including the staff talk too much (drama) so don't expect a quiet, romantic dinner.  Parking is easy and free.  You can get better ramen in Chinatown.  I would avoid drinking the water (was told that it was filtered) because it tastes funny, smells, and puts you in a bad mood.  This place is good if you need a quick bite to eat and need to get on your way.
