JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////(Reply to Owner) Hi Jimmy, I'm glad you read my review and replied with what you thought of it. And I, wholeheartedly understand where you're coming from and why you believe your price is just. I'm not saying that the Ramen wasn't made professionally, nor am I saying the Ramen I had was overpriced in any way. My goal is to provide information for your future customers about what they could expect, as they could come from all sorts of places and some wouldn't know the regular prices for Japanese Cuisine or the range of prices depending on the location. And I, understanding your concern did make some minor adjustments to my review without changing how I thought upon the food and price. Hope you'll see this, and thanks for understanding!
