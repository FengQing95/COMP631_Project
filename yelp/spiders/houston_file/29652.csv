The Pit Room////I'm not a huge meat eater so I decided to order 2 brisket tacos with a side of elote and Mac and cheese. The first taco was really good! The meat had a lot of flavor. But then as I ate the second one, the taco started tasting extremely salty and I wasn't able to finish. I would definitely recommend ordering the brisket taco, but two tacos might be a little bit too repetitive. Get one of the brisket and try another one. The elote was AMAZING I would've ordered two of those in a heartbeat.
