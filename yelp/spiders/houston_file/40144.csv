Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I'm definitely a fan! They have poutine here, salads, 3 items on their lunch menu that you can convert into a wrap or a bowl, one of them is the beef, chicken pho, and this other item that I can't remember. All of them are under $14. I got the spinach salad with pears ($12) and you can add protein (Chicken $4) (Shrimp $6) (Salmon $6).
