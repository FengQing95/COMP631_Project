Local Foods////This place is one of the most awesome places I've ever eaten at! The food was absolutely delicious and the service was great. My group and I went around closing time and the people who worked there were kind enough to give us some free dessert - also reassuring that everything is really made fresh each day!! Also, the cashier was really patient and helpful with the menu.
