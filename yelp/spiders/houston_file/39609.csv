Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I am glad you enjoyed your experience at Bosscat. Chef Peter took great care and effort designing our burger. Â I agree with you, that burger is fantastic and I think of it whenever hunger strikes! The pulled pork hushpuppies and house made pickles and vegetables are also very popular among our guests. Although we wish you enjoyed the pork belly poutine as much as we do, we understand that personal preferences are just that - personal.
