Baby Barnaby's////Food: They only have a couple of things on the menu but they all seem so good. I ordered the breakfast platter and it was SOOO GOOD it came with Two eggs, potato, sausage, and bread. It seems like a little but it was so filling! The eggs were perfect. I usually don't like the potatoes but they were SUPER delicious!
