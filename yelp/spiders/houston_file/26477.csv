The Pit Room////This is a nice Bbq joint by my work, the food here was pretty good. I wouldn't call it the best BBQ but it is decent and close to my office so it makes it easier. The vibe and atmosphere of the place is nice and vibrant, I got the brisket and on either thing I can't rmr, and it was pretty good. Overall good Bbq place if you don't want to drive far.
