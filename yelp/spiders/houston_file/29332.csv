The Pit Room////There are two ways to approach the concept of "Texas BBQ" - either to keep it as strictly traditional as it's been for over a century, or to embrace what Texas has become in the 21st century, a Selena-accented culinary melting pot in which orders for three tacos elicit a shouted "Â¡tres!" to the back kitchen. Unlike any other restaurant in the entire state and beyond, The Pit Room has successfully managed both by re-enacting the Battle of San Jacinto as it plunders the riches of Mexican cuisine to transform the already delicious Texas BBQ into something as uniquely modern and innovative as it is proudly standing among the finest BBQ joints in the state.
