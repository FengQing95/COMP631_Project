Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat kitchen was absolutely amazing! We came for lunch and I immediately loved the atmosphere. The swanky whisky bar reminds me of a flapper era speakeasy. We came on a Saturday around noon so we were able to enjoy options off the brunch menu. I was initially worried about my options as I'm following a ketogenic diet. I decided to go with the boss at burger no bun and I added avocado. I did not miss the bun!! The meat was perfectly seasoned. They sliced my avocado and placed it on a bed of lettuce under the meat patty and shaved a generous portion of high quality cheese over top. The bacon was sweet as well as savory and perfectly crisp! I was very pleased with the presentation of the food as well. Sometimes when you ask for substitutions in a restaurant you get your food thrown on a plate. My burger was beautifully assembled and brought to me even without the bun. We will be coming here often!
