Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The place was packed when we came and rightly deserved they have a bunch of yummy sweets to your liking on display to down with your delicious wired beverage. I personally went with the the lavender latte and it is by far the best I've ever had. **Tip: pop the lid if you're taking it to go to enjoy the beautiful aroma of lavender as you take sips.
