Kata Robata////I chose to sit at the sushi bar since I was alone. I was immediately greeted and was given ample time to figure out which bento box to go with. I placed my order and was amazed with everything! Â The bento box was huge (or maybe other Japanese restaurants are stingy). I could not the whole box especially since I gobbled down 8 California rolls.
