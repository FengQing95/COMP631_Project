Local Foods////Local Foods will forever be one of my favorite restaurants! On paper, it might seem like Local Foods is hardly anything extraordinary - serving sandwiches, salads, soups, and side dishes. Nope...Local Foods is everything but, serving phenomenal meals, pairing flavors from different cuisines creatively, and gathering locally sourced and sustainable ingredients.
