Uchi////One of the best meals I've had in Houston in awhile. I will preface this by saying it is very expensive. If you are a $24.99 all-you-can-eat sushi type person, this place might not be for you. You have to be willing to dole out some money to get full, but if you are looking for delicious flavors, creativity, and clean, fresh tasting food...this is a must try.
