Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////However, today will be my last visit to this establishment. After the order was placed, we waited for our food. Sadly, this time around I settled for the Snooze Classic. Nothing fancy or extravagant. To my dismay it took longer then what I would have expected for eggs, toast, sausage and hash browns. However, what shattered my expectations was the lack of sausage. When the waitress arrived to check on how our food was I mentioned they forgot my chicken sausage. She said ok and went to check. She informs me they are on the grill and will come out when they are ready. While I waited, I finished my entire plate. She refilled my water while I waited. My plate was also removed from the table during this wait time. After a while, I stopped her and informed her that I no longer wanted the sausage especially considering I had finished my meal and no longer felt the need to wait any longer. I also informed her to inform the kitchen manager that I was upset with their level of speediness. I also asked for the check. When she returned she informed me that they had removed the sausage price from my meal. Let me inform you it was $1.75. The total meal was $9.25. So I believe it is say to assume that a piece of wheat toast, hash browns and 3 scrambled eggs cost $7.50. Simple math. What upset me the most is that if I ask you to convey a message to your manager on an oversight left by the team of employees you are managing. Would it not seem only fair to engage that customer to ensure that at least you made an 'attempt' to rectify any negative feedback. Yet, then again maybe u assumed I wanted to save myself $1.75. I will save myself the disappointment of every returning. It is a sad day when great food can be undermined by very poor management and bad customer service. Maybe business has been too good and thus the reason for neglect. For the reader, consider yourself warned. It seems stardom, high reviews, has left this business feeling that customer service is no longer important. I shall opt to 'snooze' when asked if I want to return.
