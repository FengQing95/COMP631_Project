Kata Robata////Came here for lunch.  They have pretty specials, bento boxes, etc. Good portions and quality was good.  I had the sashimi special and tried some of their ramen.  The fish was fresh, got about 7 pieces of sashimi.  Special also came with salad, seaweed salad, chicken teriyaki, tofu, and choice of steamed rice or California roll. I really liked that you were able to get a variety of things with each order and only for $12.  One thing I do have to complain about is the service.  It was so slow!!!  It was close to 3pm so they weren't even that busy.  Lunch should not hate taken over an hour! Especially since the food came out so quickly! Like, we were seriously upset with the service we received and how long it took to get our last course and even the bill.  Anyways, I would still come back because the food was great!  There's still so many things I want to try off their dinner menu! Hopefully we get better service next time.
