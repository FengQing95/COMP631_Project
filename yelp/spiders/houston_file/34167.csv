Under the top pretzel bun, they layered some crispy chicken skin, and that was probably the best part of the sandwich. It was such a nice contrast to the juicy, and succulent chicken underneath. After some vegetables, came the chicken. I can't really tell honestly between good chicken and soso chicken, but it was hella moist. Below that came the nut "crumble", which was almost like a nutty paste smeared onto the bottom bun. Since it got to soak up all those heavenly juices from the chicken, it almost tasted like savory peanut butter. It was a complete package, and everything complimented one another and just worked perfectly. By the way, portion sizes for the sandwich were okay but it filled me up pretty well.
