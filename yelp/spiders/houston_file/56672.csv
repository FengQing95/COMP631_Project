Kata Robata////I read Â a 3 star review from a lady who first started by saying she's a sushi expert because she eats it a lot... Ok bitch. You could have eaten trash your whole life and that could also be what you're used to. I also drink water everyday, that doesn't make me an expert at it. Just say if you like it or not without talking about how dope you are as a sushi expert who's never made sushi before.
