Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Overall food was good, but the service could have been better. We came during a hectic time because Houston was under a boiling water advisory due to a water pipe burst. Â I understand things can get hectic in situations like this (I've worked many years in the service industry) so we gave her the benefit of the doubt. Sadly after we got the food she never came back to check on us and it took us forever to get the check from her. 3 stars for the toast.
