Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////5 stars all the way baby. Thank God I made a wrong turn and spotted this place off of and not readily visible from Westheimer - but in the heart of it all, next to the shops at River Oak. I'm a huge Southern food and Bourbon guy, and the menu for food and booze is off the charts. Great up-scale but (mostly) non-pretentious crowd. Â Enough big screens to watch games. And kudos to Human Resources: thanks for bringing us Chad
