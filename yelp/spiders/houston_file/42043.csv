Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond is a beautiful looking bakery. They have amazing small French dessert. The reason I rate it only for 3 starts is because the price doesn't match the taste. The French style tarts or cakes taste great. But the pastries, especially croissants, is not crispy or flaky at all. Also, they can definitely do a better job at making espresso drinks. There was one time I ordered a latte to have it with goat cheese & fig( which tastes great). And the latter was presented with no foam on the top. Looks like a cup of coffee mixed with milk by yourself at home. When the waiter served it, it split out everywhere on the tray... oh and the breakfast food there... nothing surprising. You can do a better job yourself at home too. But the place does look nice and the food look nice. Just don't go in Sunday morning. It's packed and not enough room in between tables. When the waiters and people walk around looking for seats, they may hit your seat or interrupt your dinning experience.
