The Pit Room////In a city with MANY great barbque places, The Pit Room is a can't miss. The pulled pork tacos are great for a quick lunch and the Mac and cheese is perfect! Even when the place seems full, the line moves quickly and they will seat you in the neighboring restaurant patio area that is just a few feet away!
