Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Whiskey Lovers Unite!! If you are a whiskey lover this place is for you. Ambiance was great, service is amazing and on point. We were able to tour the impressive whiskey room that was made by Leslie "MissBosscat". Everyone on hand came by our table and introduced themselves. Our server, Jeremy was attentive, knowledgeable and helped us with recommendations. We tried the pulled pork hush puppies and parm crusted meat loaf, heirloom spinach salad, and avocado farm chop, BC Burger and the Barbecue porchetta sandwich. All Amazing and Texas portion size!!! Finish it off with the red velvet churros. Â For the libations, we tried BC Lemonade and 38 Special, Irish Mule, Southsider which was my fav. Made with Gin, mint and Cucumber citrus. Overall a great first impression. Lots of other Yummy items on the menu I can't wait to try. We love everything about Bosscat and can't wait to be back for the opening.
