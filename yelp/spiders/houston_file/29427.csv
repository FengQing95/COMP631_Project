The Pit Room////When I drew up my list for essential Houston meals, Tex-Mex came first but barbecue wasn't far behind. I was a Goode Company girl growing up, but my family has recently forbidden the local chain ("so overrated!"). So I plotted for a trip out to Killen's or Tejas Chocolate for real country barbecue.
