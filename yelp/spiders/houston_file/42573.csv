Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I arrived there Sunday at 9am (since they are still in the soft opening phase they open at 9am). There was an hour long line at the bakery. By the time I left I would think the wait was around 30 minutes instead of an hour so try not to get there at opening.
