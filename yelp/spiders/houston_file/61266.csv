Baby Barnaby's////We started out with the OJ which is so fresh that I might as well have ordered the whole orange, and ate the breakfast plate, tacos, waffles, and french toast. The tacos were unbelievably cheesy (so me!) and tasted extra fresh, the french toast is packed with flavor from different spices like nutmeg (you can smell it), making it more than just egg washed toast, and the waffle was beyond words.
