Kata Robata////We continue to go back because overall, the quality and price of the food and service is the best in Houston.  (And it's my 3 year old daughter's favorite restaurant).  Even the "so-so" sushi is probably much better than so-so.  We're really tough graders.  Between the kitchen items and those occasional but unbelievably awesome sushi, what an effective intermittent reinforcement!  We are hooked on Kata Robata.
