Uchi////So good. Melt in your mouth good. Makes your jaws tingle just thinking about it good. My fav here has to be the hotate. Not a fan of brussel sprouts except when it's at Uchi! The fried milk and cookies is delish! Cold, frozen milk in the form of sorbet followed by a bite of the warm fried milk will put you in heaven with each bite. Beware though, prices are steep. Totally worth it though! And usually can get an appetizer comped. Staff is very attentive and friendly. Love it here!
