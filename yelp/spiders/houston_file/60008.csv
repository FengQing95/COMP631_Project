Baby Barnaby's////My favorite breakfast in the city. You can't get these green eggs anywhere else and they're totally worth the wait. Expect long lines on the weekend. Everything I've had here is delicious. The crispy potatoes are so fun to eat. Chicken apple sausage is available for non-pork eaters - thank goodness.
