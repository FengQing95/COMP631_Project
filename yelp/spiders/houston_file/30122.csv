The Pit Room////All of the meats were so tender and fall of the bone. They have great BBQ sauce on the side as well. Even though the were out of several meats like the beef ribs and pulled pork, I still liked everything I had. I'd definitely recommend the port ribs and the brisket. I also got a chicken taco that was delish!
