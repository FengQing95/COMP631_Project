Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Amazing!!! I ordered the "famous" sweet potatoe pancakes, hash brown and an order of soyrizo(vegetarian chorizo). My only complaint was that the soyrizo was too salty, but I guess thats expected with most meat substitutes. Expect to wait and expect to park down the street. The wait is long because the food is just that good.
