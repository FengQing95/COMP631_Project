JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Yoooooo! I don't write many reviews, only when a place really speaks to me. And Jinya came in loud and clear! The spicy chicken ramen was incredible, my fiance had the wonton ramen that was also great. Kristine our server was really nice and chatted with us for a bit. And their in restaurant radio played alot of reggae (Japanese love reggae and Jamaica, so as a Jamaican I felt right at home). 2 thumbs way up for Jinya!
