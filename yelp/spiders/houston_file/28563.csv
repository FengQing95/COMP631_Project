The Pit Room////The Pit Room is exactly what it sounds like - a place for a good meal with no fancy fixings. They have plenty of parking (which is a miracle in this area), a bar next door (where you can also park), a get in line and order your meal system, and plenty of goodness to choose from. Before I get into the food they offer, I have to say I was SUPER pumped that they carried cream soda, Mexican coke and other bottled drinks that are usually hard to come by in restaurants.
