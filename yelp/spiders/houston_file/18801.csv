Uchi////Uchi is pretty much the only restaurant that I don't mind walking out barely full after dropping 100 bucks for dinner. It's that amazing ! I don't even read the menu anymore, I just point randomly at the menu and expect to be blown away in a few minutes when they food comes out. The service is always awesome, the waitstaffs really know their stuff, they tell you in detail all the ingredients and how the food was cooked for all of the items delivered, which makes me feel like a cooking show judge on Food Network haha. Also, FRIED FREAKING MILK , I thought I was getting some fried ice cream type thing at first but of course not ! you're at Uchi so you're getting milk and chocolate in different crazy textures and it blew my mind. Reservation is always weeks ahead but I've walked in on a rainy Saturday night and was seated immediately at the sushi bar.
