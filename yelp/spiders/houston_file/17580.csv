Uchi////This was probably, dare I say, the best dining experience I've ever had in my life!  I hate to hype things up, but I was just so impressed from the moment I sat down at the bar, to wait 2 hours for my seat at the sushi bar.  The bar staff were all so friendly, playful, attentive, hot towels for your hands, and then to hand you a dinner napkin for your lap.
