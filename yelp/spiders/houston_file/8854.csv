JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It was spicy enough for me to not need to put any available on the table's hot sauce. :) I love spicy and I conisder myself to eat a lot of hot items, apparently this one is something that I wouldn't choose the hottest they can offer..(imagine what HOT would taste like... maybe fire??)
