JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is a pretty cool place to go to if you're in the mood for some ramen. The ramen has a great taste and they have a variety of pre-thought of options to choose from. They have a few appetizers and desserts to choose from too. We had the fried shrimp balls that were coated with a crunchy breading and had cream cheese inside along with the shrimp. The reason for the 4 star review is that I felt something was missing from it, like I said it's not bad ramen but it's not the best in town
