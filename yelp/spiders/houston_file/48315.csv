Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I have been to Snooze in Del Mar, CA and in Phoenix, AZ and they have been amazing so I had been tracking the opening of Houston's first location.  I wish they would have made a bigger deal of the Houston opening, like the Austin locations but oh well.   I got my favorite dish the OMG French toast and a latte. I think it was pretty average, which isn't typical of Snooze.  This location may need a little more practice.   I will try again this weekend but hoping they keep improving.  I would also say their coffee needs some work, not too tasty.  They have a story about their coffee but they may need to keep searching for a better blend.
