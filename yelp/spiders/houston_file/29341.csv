The Pit Room////Had Texas BBQ after almost a year and a half of living in Connecticut and was not disappointed at all. Loved every bite of it and I will definitely be going there again! Along with the food, the service was also great and they were doing their best to be sanitary during this pandemic; plexiglass at the counters, condiments were individually bagged and half the tables were marked "No sitting" to keep up with the social distancing.
