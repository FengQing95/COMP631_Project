Kata Robata////The kakuni pork belly with 60 degree egg was another real hit at the table.  The pork belly had a nice texture combination.  The meat was cooked well and crispy while the fatty portion added a nice buttery flavor to the mix.  The sauce was a little sweet, make sure you break the egg to help with the balance of the meal.  4.5/5
