Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The only downfall I can point out is the limited seating inside. There are plenty of tables but during lunch time there pretty much all taken. We were lucky to have spotted someone leaving. The patio would've been awful during the daytime because who wants to sit outside in this Houston heat!!
