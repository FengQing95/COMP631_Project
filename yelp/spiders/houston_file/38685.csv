Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place was SO good! It is a tad bit on the pricy side, but I think it was well worth it. It was my first time here so we asked our server for recommendations. Parker was super polite and attentive, and made fantastic recommendations! We had the hush puppies, the short ribs, and the salmon. The short ribs were so tender!
