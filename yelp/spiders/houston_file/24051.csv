Uchi////We ordered Omakase $100 per person for 10 courses. It was not worth money. Half of the Omakase were basic nigiri or maki. I would recommend doing a la carte if you come to Uchi. Some of the dishes that I highly recommend are short ribs, uni, foil gras, scallop nigiri. The fried milk desert is also a must.
