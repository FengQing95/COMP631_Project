Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This was a hard review for me to write. I wrestle with the fact that it is a place that I would frequent but only for the atmosphere and the drinks. My experience wasn't bad at all. It was just mediocre. First off, our waiter seemed very distracted. He was extremely nice but kept repeating himself and seemed to not know what he was going to say next. The drinks were great albeit expensive. I judge a place by their old fashioned they have a great old-fashioned cocktail (4.5/5). For dinner we ordered the hush puppies, the poutine, and I ordered a salad with the bourbon chicken. The bourbon chicken addition was a recommendation by the waiter. It wasn't great. I would've rather just had the drinks and nothing else. The fries were too intense. There were a little bites that were good but others were just too packed with things (3/5). The hush puppies were decent (4/5). The salad I would not get again. There's too much sauce and dressing and the bourbon chicken was lackluster (1.5/5). My friends ordered the red velvet churros for dessert. I am usually not a fan of churros but I always try a little piece just to see if something is so great it will change my mind. This did not. Currently I'm planning on going there tonight. But I only plan to order drinks. For the drinks I would give them a four only because they're a bit pricey for the food maybe at 2 1/2. I think overall this place is a 3 1/2 but I could not round up and give it a 4. I hope that things get better or I try something else and it impresses me. I was really excited for this place because I'm a big whiskey drinker and I like the whiskey bar feel... oh well.
