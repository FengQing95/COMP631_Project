Kata Robata////I've been here several times, and will say this is one of my solid goto places for nice sushi in Houston! The restaurant is pretty big, with sushi bar seating, and an outdoor patio. Kata will have something just for about everyone. I am a big fan of traditional nigiri and maki, while my friends are into the octopus crudo, fresh ceviche, miso black cod, and green tea souffle cheesecake. Fish was all very fresh and service was solid. Total cost for appetizer, sushi, alcohol, and dessert was about $55 per person. Which is a really solid price point for what you are getting in the fish, ambiance, and service!
