JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Like the ramen a lot, especially the Tonkotsu Black. The Jinya bin is quite good. The chashu pork with both sweet and savory. Enjoy the Sprouting up Ramen and Tonkotsu original. They don't serve it often. Can't eat inside, though, without being harassed over the stupid mask idiocy. You can get togo or eat outside without issue.
