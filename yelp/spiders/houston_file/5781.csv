JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My boyfriend and I are OBSESSED with the Cha-Cha-Cha substituted with chicken.  The egg gives it the perfect touch.  My mom isn't much of a soup person so we ordered Shrimp Toast for her and it was delicious.  We just hoped it would have had a bit more shrimp in it as we mostly tasted bread.  It's a small restaurant so I suggest you come with no more than 4 people max.  They will not seat you unless your full party is present.
