Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food was decent. I had the Green Chile Soup which I enjoyed the most. It comes with a side of cheese quesadillas. Next on the impressive list was their signature Bosscat Fries. Pair them with the soup, you'll have something nice going onto your palate. I also asked them for a fried egg on the side. Â And the fried egg plating that impressed me. Also tried the Bosscat burger and the tuna wraps, which were decent. Would I come back again? Maybe if someone was hosting a party in the private space
