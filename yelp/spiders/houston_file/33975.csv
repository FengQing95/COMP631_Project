Local Foods////I ordered the seafood sandwich and subbed ciabatta bread for their pretzel bun (which was simply off da chain). It was generously packed with clearly fresh plump shrimp and crab. As for sides, I got their housemade potato chips and the Asian slaw. I have to say, I wasn't a huge fan of the Asian slaw but it was still pretty good and I would order it again. I also had their Minty orangade that I drank to my hearts content. It was oh-so-delicious and refreshing.
