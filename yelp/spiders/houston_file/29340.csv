The Pit Room////Had a craving for beef ribs. They are so hard to find! Searched around online and came across this gem. The beef ribs were absolutely delicious being well seasoned and tender. The potato salad and elote were good. The Mac and cheese was my only dislike. Too runny. Other than that highly satisfied with the food and service.
