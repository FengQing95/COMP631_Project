Uchi////Server provided absolutely zero instruction, recommendations etc. of how one should order, and what he recommended. He frankly just kind didn't offer any form of real "service". I don't know if it was my outfit (I wasn't dressed particularly nice that night, I was in town for Ironman Galveston so my race wardrobe was super casual) but I just felt like I was getting the brush off a bit. He kept asking are you done, are you done.
