Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I would give 5 stars because the food and service is absolutely wonderful. Â The parking and the 2 hour wait was not so wonderful. Nonetheless, I absolutely recommend that you try this place. The secret menu item was brought to the table and it was to die for!! How awesome is that.....as you are waiting on your food a nice random complimentary surprise comes to the table. Great service and great food.
