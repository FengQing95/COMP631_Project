Uchi////tbh Uchi is a religious experience. I didn't understand what the hype was about, but now I have been enlightened. For the cool tastings, we got the uchiviche, and the hama chili (Thai chilies + citrus + fish is ALWAYS a perfect combination); perfect from the very beginning. For the sushi, we got the sake and sake toro (salmon and salmon belly), the madai (Japanese sea bream), and a shag roll. Yes, the portions are small, because they are a TAPAS RESTAURANT.
