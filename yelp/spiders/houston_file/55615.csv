Kata Robata////The drinks though pretty much failed to impress.  My moscow mule was not actually a true mule, as it was not served in copper, and it had an overwhelming lime flavor that obscured the ginger beer.  My friend described her lychee martini as "pink rubbing alcohol" and said that the Apple Blossom cocktail didn't taste like anything though it got a little better as the ice melted.  I had a sip of another friend's champagne cocktail and it was ok but nothing exciting to me.  Thus I'd probably not bother trying to order drinks here.
