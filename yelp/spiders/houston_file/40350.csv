Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Food was below average.  I personally didn't like it at all.  The service was super slow.  I was there when the restaurant was just opened and barely any guests there.  Ordered only 2 items and it took almost 45min for the main entree to arrive. The sad thing is the main entree was just a flatbread which shouldn't take that much time.
