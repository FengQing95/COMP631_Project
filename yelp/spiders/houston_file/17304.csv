Uchi////I think coming into Uchi without any sushi experience or knowledge would be a super delight.  For example, taking my parents here would be fun, because they would be amazed with the dishes - because they haven't experienced anything like it anywhere else ever before.  However, having frequented many a sushi restaurant... I thought Uchi's opening effort in Houston was okay.  I wasn't blown away by anything and some things were a little overdone, like every single waiter who brought me sushi telling me how to eat my sushi, "you must flip the fish over so that it hits your tongue and you can really experience the flavor"... Cute, really.  However the sous-vide Wagyu beef appetizer that evening was good... for $10 a piece it should be (I have a sous-vide and with prices like that perhaps I should consider leaving my day job to crank out these apps)!  I think for what Uchi is offering, it is extremely overpriced.  I can get yellowtail sashimi with ponsu, garlic and jalepeno at Zake for $10 compared to $19.   Perhaps they are trying to compensate for the building costs.  What they have done with the old Felix restaurant location is amazing.  Beautiful interiors...it is not super loud in there.  The servers are all very friendly, there are a lot of them!  If you ever look like you need something - anything - they are there right away.  So overall  - cozy atmosphere, great servers, quick valet, food - okay - plated nicely, but expensive, with the prices I thought I was at Nobu or Urasawa in Bev Hills!
