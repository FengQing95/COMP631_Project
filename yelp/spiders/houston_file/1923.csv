JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Simon - I'm sorry to hear you had an upset stomach. Can you tell me which ramen you ordered? Of the few similar claims we have faced since opening, we have learned that some customers' digestive systems may not be fully accustomed to the thick and heavy nature of some of the traditional Japanese ramen broths that we serve, especially the pork broths. That said, I do appreciate that you enjoyed our food, and depending on what type of ramen you had on your first visit, I would like to invite you back and have you try something that might be better suited for you.
