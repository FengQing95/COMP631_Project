Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The service and food was amazing. We have two little ones and though the crowd is young and the place was packed the staff made our experience great. My husband had the Snooze Burrito and I had the OMG French Toast and Sweet Potato Pancake, I gave the Original Pancake to my little one. OMG is right, we never finish our plates..we scraped them here eating everything on every inch of the plates. Phenomenal service and flavor! Leah was the best, not sure if she's the manager but she was so accommodating. She saw us waiting outside with our kids to be seated and she brought us all ice cold water and updated us on our seats. She stopped by our table later to inquire about our experience. Customer service is rare in this day and age, but I'm glad to know that Snooze cares!
