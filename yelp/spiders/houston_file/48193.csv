Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered corn beef hash, scrambled egg, side of chicken sausage and a plain pancake.  My food came out lukewarm however the waiter gladly returned it to the kitchen to have it replaced. It came back hot but looked as if they reheated the hash and actually remade the eggs.  Other than that, everything tasted delicious and it was a huge helping.  I was only able to eat half my food and when I warmed it later at home, it still tasted delicious.
