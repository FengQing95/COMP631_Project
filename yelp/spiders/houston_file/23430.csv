Uchi////My husband and I have gone to Uchi a few times but just this past year I really started to appreciate and love more raw options and nigiri. We came here for our anniversary - booked reservations a few weeks in advance - and were blown away. Knowing it was a special occasion they gave us an awesome table and we put all our trust into our server after telling her what our tastes were when it comes to sushi. She sent out dishes in a specific order and it was all perfection. Hands down one of my all time top dining experiences.
