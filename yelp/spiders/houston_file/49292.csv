Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Overall, the food was great but not great enough to wait over an hour.  I'd come again but only if I anticipated that my wait was less than hour based on the time I was going, and ready to come for longer conversation with friends.  They kind of clean up the tables real quick to turn your table over.  I get it, but I also don't like being rushed after I waited so long to sit down in the first place.
