Local Foods////Crunchy chicken, shrimp and blue crab, and the duck confit are insanely good. Love their use of arugula and cranberry in the duck confit, tastes like a modified turkey dinner in a sandwich...the melting cheese is to die for. You can't go wrong with the crunchy chicken, this sandwich is massive. The shrimp and blue crab is so fresh, but the amount of dressing in the mix is sometimes overwhelming, still good nonetheless. Get the kale, orzo, and the mint lemonade/limeade as extras...very very very good!
