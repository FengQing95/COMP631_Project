Local Foods////Besides the food, the atmosphere and service here is exceptional. The staff is really helpful in decoding the menu, refilling drinks, checking in on guests, etc. While the Kirby location's outside seating and design is a bit more comfortable and open, the Village site provides a more low-key scene and cozy feel, which I prefer.
