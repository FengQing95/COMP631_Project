Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Kugelhopf - 4.0/5.0 - Yet another sugar butter cake that's sure to please. Think a mini Bundt cake that is soaked with an orange water syrup (perhaps melted butter too lol), stuffed with a few golden raisins as prizes, and then rolled in sugar. This was perhaps the most buttery of them all, which made me not enjoy it as much after I had eaten it.
