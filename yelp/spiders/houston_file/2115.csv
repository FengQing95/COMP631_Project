JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the special - Black pork something (asked for thick noodles), and it was the tastiest ramen I have ever had! I will be returning here for all my ramen needs from here on. I've tried a couple of other ramen places in Austin, TX, but was never impressed until I tried Jinya here in Houston, TX. Two thumbs up!!
