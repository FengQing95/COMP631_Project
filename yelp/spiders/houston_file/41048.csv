Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First off, let's talk "libations." I've been on an aperol kick lately, so I sampled the 38 Special 14, a blend of bourbon, amero, aperol, and citrus. I got plenty of the sweet woody bourbon and nutty amaro, but the characteristic bitterness of the aperol was missing and the orange was a bit overpowering. The Old Fashioned was great, no complains whatsoever. We also shared a whiskey flight after our meal which was decent, but we were a little disappointed in the overly judicious half-shot pours (3 varieties for $24).
