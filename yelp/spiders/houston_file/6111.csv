JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I will definitely have to come back here to try the Ramen. I went with a group of friends close to the end of finals a few weeks ago. At the time, I wasn't in the mood for soup, so I ordered the pork gyoza and 5 pc. crispy chicken. The pork gyoza was good, but the crispy chicken didn't really have any flavor, and the sauce was just ok. It lacked a lemon or tangy flavor in the sauce. I used the lemon they gave to squeeze it over the chicken. My friends' ramen soup (Tokyo Yatai Ramen and Tonkotsu Assari) and no soup ramen (Tan Tan Men), on the other hand, looked really good! I like how you could switch out the noodle size even though it may say thin or thick. I've been to a ramen place in San Francisco, so I'm glad there's a great location here in Houston. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice and intimate, and I love the decor. It's great for a date night or a ladies night out with your girlfriends. The bar is up front at the entrance. Restrooms are clean, and the service is great. There's a free parking garage with bike racks around the corner. There's a guy on a golf cart who will stop and ask you what restaurant you're going to be in, though. He's on top of his game patrolling that garage.
