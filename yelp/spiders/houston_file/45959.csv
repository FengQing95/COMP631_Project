Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been to Common Bond Cafe several times and wanted to try something off their brunch menu outside the normal cappachino's that are oh so tasty.  I ended up landing on the Octopus hash.  Yes, that's right, Octopus hash!  I was quite surprised that a bakery and cafe would have such a varied selection of menu dishes that are very innovative and curious.  It was a bit of a ying and yang day, because I offset that dish with their fruit croissant.  Wow, what a nice mixture of taste, but I must say that Octopus hash was really yummy, cause I love those chewy tendrils.  Something to also add, the line moves quite fast so do be turned off by how long it is when you approach this place.
