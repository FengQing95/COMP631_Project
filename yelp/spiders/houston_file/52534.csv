Kata Robata////We haven't ventured off the sushi menu much but I think that is partly due to the staff not being very knowledgeable on the menu?  I dont know, something just doesnt make us WANT to venture out here but with the right people working, I think it could happen.  Hate to keep comparing the two, because they are apples to oranges, but the staff at Uchi are awesome and we always  'trust your server' and let them pick 10 courses of their favorites...never have we been dissapointed.  Those kids know what they're doing over there.
