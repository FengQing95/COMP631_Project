Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place was EXCELLENT.  We went on Saturday a little before 10a (note - if you're going on a weekend and not at the crack of dawn - you will wait about 30-45 minutes for a table).  We were starving by the time we sat down.  Snooze is exactly what you would think of an old school diner circa the Grease era.  We were seated at a round table and the music was a mix of 90s and 2000s (everything I could possibly want early in the morning).
