Baby Barnaby's////Service is HORRIBLE! but I guess they can afford to rush you because their food is great. Not all of the waiters are as rude as this lady that was serving me. She was sooo rude and she kept rushing everyone. She even picked up someone's plate as they were still eating. She forgot and orange juice after I asked her twice and then as my bf was giving his order she left .... Just like that she left.
