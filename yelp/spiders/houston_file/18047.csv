Uchi////The prices here are expensive, but I think well worth it. In the overall scheme of things, I think the prices are decent because you can pop in here for their sake social and spend about $30-$40 and leave with an extraordinary meal, or you can indulge and pay a bit more for an experience that you'll remember for years to come. Uchi has been my favorite restaurant for a few years because of the consistent outstanding food, service, and ambiance.
