Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Food wise: great. We ordered the Bosscat Fries. I like that they actually made mine extra crispy. We also ordered short stack pancake, which was fluffy but not extraordinary. Typical pancake. The chicken fried steak was amazing. Flavor was spot on. The only thing I wish is they put more greens so the steak didn't look dead.
