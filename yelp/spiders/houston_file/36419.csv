Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We ordered the chicken dip which was simply OK...the hush puppies was a NO for me but my friend did like it over the dip. For my entree I ordered the braised chicken which was actually pretty good and super tender. But It had a sweet taste to the sauce over the meat which they also put over the "dirty rice" which I did not care for. The green beans lacked seasoning and could have been cooked a little more.  Service at this place was also OK our waiter never came right back. And the music was SUPER loud I got a headache.  Overall I wont return.
