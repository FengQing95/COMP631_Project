Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Although you usually have an hour's wait, they give your phone a text when you need to head back. In the meantime, you can walk to a local store to shop. If you just want to hangout there, you can help yourself to complimentary coffee, juice or water. The food is delicious, like the amazing pancakes or healthier fair. Â They have a good variety of drinks.
