Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Passed by this place a couple times and made a mental note to myself to check it out. Last Friday, I was in charge of finding a lunch spot with my family and so I  was estatic for the opportunity to try out a nice place. Since my cousin I were the first to arrive,  we decided to snag a table. Unfortunately, we waited... and waited. No table for four was available. It looked like it was about to rain, so sitting outside was not an option for us. We came around 1:30 PM thinking the lunch crowd would have died down on a Friday afternoon, but I was wrong. It's not a big space, so finding a table was a bit difficult. We decided the wait for a table combined with the wait at the line was too much so we left and walked across the street.
