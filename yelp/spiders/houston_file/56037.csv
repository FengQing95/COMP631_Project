Kata Robata////Been here many times recently. Typically was a decent restaurant with decent food and service. Today was a very different experience. Ordered a chefs sashimi for 2 for the table plus 5 other dishes. Asked for a Sauvignon blanc and get a glass with maybe 2 oz. Of wine. After finishing, I ordered another one: which was the same result. At this time, I asked my waiter to see if he can ask the bartender to increase the pour a bit. 3rd glass came in with the same amount. I asked for the manager. The manager informed me that this is the amount that they pour @ $12/glass. Worst service that I've ever received at a restaurant with worst follow up by the manager. Please dont waste your money if you want to have a $50 bottle of sad sauvignon blanc.
