Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I was really excited about this place because for one the name is really catchy and the menu looks amazing. But unfortunately, all of the excitement was diminished within minutes after our arrival. We visited Bosscat on Father's Day for the first time looking forward to this experience. When arriving the host greeted us, and explained that there were some adjustments to our seating request due to the horrible weather. We suggested a high booth table instead but those were all reserved. Soon after we were seated, a guy brought water to our table and walked away. We reviewed the menu but had questions and neither of us wanted water. No one never came back to our table for over 15 minutes. We saw another group that was behind us with the same problem, walk out. We waited to decide if it was worth finding another place to eat without reservations on Father's day at dinner time. My boyfriend calls around to see what the wait was like at places in the area since we drove from Pearland. Cheesecake factory had a 15-minute wait so we left. I would not recommend this place for parties or groups because it was pretty empty and waiters kept walking past our table several times. The only people that seem to be served accordingly was the bar.
