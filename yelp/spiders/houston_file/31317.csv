Local Foods////wow.... i am in love with this place. the sandwiches are mind blowing. they use quality ingredients. everything tastes super fresh and they def dont skimp you on the good stuff. my friend and i got the crunchy chicken and the tuna sandwiches. we split them half and half. i kept going back and forth trying to decide which one i liked better. i feel like i am still torn. like i said the sandwiches were loaded so it got kind of messy as the insides of our sandwiches were busting out from the bread. i love all hte healthy sides too. the cabbage slaw was sweeter than i expected but still tasty. i loved the curry tasting 4 bean medley and the kale was surprisingly delicious. i love how gooooodddd and guilt free the food is here!!!
