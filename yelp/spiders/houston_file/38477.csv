Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My friend and I ate here for brunch on a Sunday. There was no wait to be seated, but upon entering the first thing that is noticed is the loudness of the 90's music blaring across the restaurant. My friend and I were yelling at each other to have a conversation. We were served promptly with my friend having one of the burgers and me having the fruity pebbles French toast. Both were very good! Although the music was loud and made it hard for conversation, we would still go back because the food was very good, as well as the service.
