JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////i got the cha cha cha ramen with the gyoza combo. the gyoza was very bland and forgetful also, almost tasted like they were frozen previously. both of our house salads were over dressed and forgetful. my cha cha cha ramen saved jinya from a 1 star rating Â because the broth was nicely seasoned, and noodles were cooked very well. the meat was EXTREMELY salty though.
