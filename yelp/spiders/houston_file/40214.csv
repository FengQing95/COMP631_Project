Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Next was the appetizer of Pork belly poutine, brought out by PJ, I appreciate the backstory he shared on this dish and could get a sense of the passion behind its creation. Let me just say, you can not go wrong with this! Creole gravy, pork belly, cheese curds and crispy potatoes - it's decadence had me at first bite!
