Local Foods////I have been here twice, once in June and once in July. i loved the first salad I had but  by the second visit, the one-pager menu had changed. I got a salad with shrimp and it was also delicious, large and filling. My friend and I had lots to talk about  and we pretty much closed up the joint, but no one bothered/hurried us or hinted for us to leave. Some time I'll have to try something other than a salad (but why mess with a good thing?)
