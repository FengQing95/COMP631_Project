JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Pretty common for what you'd expect of a ramen place. Trendy ambiance but casual feel. Could be a date place, or some place you swing by after a workout at the 24 hour fitness nearby (which looked like is where most people came from when I dined here on a Monday). No wait line at 8:30pm, though it picked up a little once we sat down.
