Kata Robata////The only thing that really bit ass about my experience was the loud, obnoxious guy who was doing shots with the waitstaff AT LUNCH.  Being flirted with at the counter does not count in my book as a bonus to my my meal, and I think it slowed my service down in addition.  I practically had to flag down my server to get out the door.  As long as Obnoxo-Man isn't a fixture, me and Kata Robata are good.  But I got my eye on you, buddy.  *glares menacingly*
