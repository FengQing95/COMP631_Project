JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The best ramen noodle, that's what my son said.  I surely agreed with him.   We ordered black ramen. The gyoza not bad, a bit oily.   The seaweed salad was so so.  Wish they put more of the seaweed salad more than the rest of the vege, because after all it's a seaweed salad.
