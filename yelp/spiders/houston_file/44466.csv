Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////They're finally keeping up with demand. There was a while when it first opened that you couldn't get anything fancy past 9am. Now they're baking more and their cases are pretty much full all day. Coffee is good and their food is super tasty if you need a bite to eat.
