Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The place is usually super packed. Hostess at the entrance won't even acknowledge you standing in front of them. I had to say "hi" first. One of them keep staring at my husband the whole entire time we were there. Very unprofessional and uncomfortable. Food is a 2. Our server was amazing.
