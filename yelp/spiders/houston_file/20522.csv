Uchi////- Desserts: Fry Milk and Peanut Butter Semifreddo something : the most expected ones for me. Nice garnish and arrangement, The Fry milk had chocolate mouse, chocolate sauce, kinako (soy powder), and fried milk, which is the highlight. The Semifreddo had some moose, raisin and peanut sugar. It's good nut but it's not mind blowing, it's not the best dessert I've ever had, it's not unique or the must-try.
