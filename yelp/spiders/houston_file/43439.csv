Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The croissants, however, are a let down. I waltzed in here expecting a croissant that would rule the world based on the Yelp reviews. Though the portion was huge, the price was very expensive ($4.50 each). I got the Almond Croissant and the Chocolate Croissant. Both were kind of oily, but the chocolate croissant had little to no chocolates in it at all!!! Both were fluffy and okay but honestly, I have had better croissants from HEB that I purchased from the bakery and pop into the oven myself. I could also make it into a "chocolate" croissant if I want to by smearing Nutella over it, which would have been plenty more chocolatey than the one Common Bond had. HEB's croissants would have cost me about $3 for a pack of 8, which are more fluffier, buttery-er, and chocolaty-er. None of which I would have found in a Common Bond's croissants.
