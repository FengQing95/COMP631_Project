Local Foods////With the sandwich, you can either get two sides or a soup. In terms of soup, I've only had the lemongrass chicken, which is pretty good and tastes like something I'd be able to find in a Thai restaurant. The sides, however, are pretty meh. Tuscan Kale - been there, done that. Quinoa - average, but healthy. Couscous - pretty similar to the quinoa, just less healthy. Acorn Squash - was this picked out of indian food, cause i'm definitely leaving with some masala-y breath. It's alright, just wash it down with some mintade - my favorite drink ever!
