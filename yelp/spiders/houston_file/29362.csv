The Pit Room////Man I don't get it, ribs dry dry dry as was the brisket. Overbooked and unsatisfactory. Cold slaw way too much vinegar, potato salad taste like grocery store box. There are so many other places you can go that blow them out of the water. You can go to one of the major chains that's starts with and R and do much much better. Better yet go to one that's starts with a P. Anyhow I always don't rounds and this is my second time here and what a fail. 2 stars because it was edible.
