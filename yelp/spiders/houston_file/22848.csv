Uchi////After about 30 minutes, we were seated at our booth and immediately met our server, Kaitlin (hopefully I spelled that correctly). This girl is bubbly energy on a golden chopstick. Fun, attentive, knowledgeable, and welcoming. My company and I were ready to order but still couldn't make up what was and wasn't vegan. When Kaitlin heard that, she excitedly requested for our menus, disappeared, and immediately returned with a vegetarian/vegan menu. This menu had us in awe of our true options as we saw that there was no lack. After a few recommendations, we settled with the vegetarian six course tasting menu. Can somebody say godsend? Godsend!
