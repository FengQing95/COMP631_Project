Uchi////Cons: The price. You are not merely paying for ingredients, but also the preparation and imagination that goes into the food (as well as your dining experience). Naturally, the wallet hurts after even one visit. That is why I make it a point to go to Uchi only when I am absolutely sure that someone else is paying my bill (birthdays are a nice excuse).
