JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have never had Takoyaki before, but I loved the fluffy light consistency and what I think was egg spread on the bottom of the plate. The sauce tasted a little like BBQ sauce, but it worked well together. There was a total of 6 of these little balls and I had to stop at two because I was getting full and needed space for the ramen.
