JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Seems like ramen is the hit food for the last few years. Â There have been at lest 6 pop up next to us in the area but will hands down say Jinya is the best. The flavor of the broth is always on point, spicy and just salty enough. The meat is at good portion. The only down side I feel as though the restaurant tries to hard to trendy. At times the atmosphere is over bearing with millennials so my advise would be to get take out.
