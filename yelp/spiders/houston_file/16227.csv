JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Over an hour wait for our party. The place was packed but my stomach is empty. I felt that the servers forgot us. Because it was even mentioned by one one of the that they apologize because we had been waiting over an hour. It might have been that our buzzer wasn't even activated by the way were called to be seated.
