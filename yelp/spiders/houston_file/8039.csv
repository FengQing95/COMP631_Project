JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////If you like things spicy, I recommend the Jinya Tonkotsu Black, tell them to make it HOT, add lots of garlic and I prefer the THICK noodles to the THIN - it was so delicious!   We also got the Spicy Miso Ramen, which was good, but not as good as the Tonkotsu  -- the ground pork just wasn't as good as the pork chashu.
