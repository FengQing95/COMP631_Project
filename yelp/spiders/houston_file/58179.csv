Kata Robata////Green Tea Souffle Cheesecake ($8): This dessert was actually a lot better than what I expected. It wasn't too sweet. From my experiences, I've been to some Japanese souffle cheesecake spots where the taste was overbearingly too eggy to the point it tasted like scramble eggs, but this souffle was a nice balance! I love the addition of the red bean ice cream and chestnut cream. On the other hand, I wouldn't say this the star of the meal.
