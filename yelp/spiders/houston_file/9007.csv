JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Megha - Thanks for your review. Did you happen to see the Spicy Vegan Ramen? That's the newest vegetarian ramen option provided to us by our corporate headquarters (we are a franchise concept based out of Los Angeles). However, I can tell you that our HQ are presently working on more vegetarian options. Thanks again, and we hope to earn more stars from you in the future!
