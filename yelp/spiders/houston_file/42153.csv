Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Hello and thank you for your review. We are sorry for the feeling of chaos you experienced. Your feedback is very important to us. What you experienced is something we have been working to remedy for some time. We realize that some guests are in for a full meal - savory, coffee, dessert - and others are in for a simple coffee or baguette to go. We ideally want the customer that wants the simple order to be able to move forward to the cashier to get their items more efficiently. We will continue to work on this and know that if you decide to come back in, you can expedite your order by coming directly up to the cashier and placing your order for simple items such as bread, coffee, etc. Thank you again for your feedback.
