Kata Robata////Very fresh ingredients. Excellent service. We had several rolls along with the pork belly as an appetizer. The Rising Sun, Sexy Scallops, Tropical Spicy Tuna and the Caribbean were very tasty! Parking is easy and free. There is a cute bakery in the same shopping center if you want to go there for dessert.
