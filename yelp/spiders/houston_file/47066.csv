Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My sister and I were on our way to lunch to realize our favorite sandwich place was closed. We were driving by and she mentioned snooze. I'm so glad we stopped here. Staff is friendly and attentive.l, the food is awesome and they have some really good coffee! I am very impressed and totally excited for brunch everyday of the week! I look forward to coming back!!
