Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////2. Pancake Flight: This is where it's at. I usually mix and match the OMG French toast with different pancakes. This last weekend, the "pancake of the day" was a pretzel pancake with chocolate chips and other things. Wowowowow. Absolutely incredible. I like the pancake flight because they are large enough to be filling, but you get three unique pancakes. Chocolate chip is always a solid option, as is the pineapple.
