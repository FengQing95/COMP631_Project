Local Foods////Solid spot that serves "healthy" food options with fresh ingredients. In the era of COVID, the indoor dining area has been transformed into a pop-up market with lots of fresh locally sourced produce and other cool items like alternative meat products. I've always appreciated the atmosphere and overall values of this establishment and they've managed to continue to stay true to that through these unprecedented times.
