Uchi////First of all, Uchi has a BOMB HH if you aren't trying to spend too much for their tastings. It's a short period of time though. It's from 5-6:30pm, but if you want to make it in I would get there at 4:30pm. They don't open their doors until 5pm, but the wait is worth it. We got there at 5:15pm and grabbed the last table.
