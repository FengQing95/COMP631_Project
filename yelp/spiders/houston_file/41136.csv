Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I wish it wasn't so crowded on the weekends, but it's my new favorite place! I love their chai tea lattes and all the pastries I have tried have been delightful. I've tried the sticky buns, almond crossiant, pain a chocolat...the list goes on. My favorite is the STICKY BUN. I was so sad to find out that they are no longer making them. Please bring them back! STICKY BUNS, STICKY BUNS, STICKY BUNS!!!
