Uchi////Went to uchi to celebrate our honeymoon with my wife. Our waitress was Veronica and she was on par with our entire experience: absolutely incredible. We couldn't decide what we wanted so Veronica brought us a few things the chef recommended. Since she knew it was our honeymoon, she brought us a gift from the chef, a plate of something delicious that I can't remember. As we were leaving Veronica sent us home with an Uchi cookbook, signed by all the staff congratulating us. It was a wonderful, touching experience and I can't recommend this place enough.
