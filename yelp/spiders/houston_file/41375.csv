Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I was less impressed with their savory items, which I would give 3 stars.  My grilled-cheese sandwich was fresh and hot but I could find something comparable at most restaurants.  I hated the pea and carrot soup it came with -- too sweet. I guess it's nice that they offer savory food but it's a letdown after bring wowed by the bakery.
