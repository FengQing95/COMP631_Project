Kata Robata////Ahhh. My first experience at Kata Robata (KR) and it was a delightful one. Our group of four ventured in on a Wednesday evening around 8:30. Upon arrival, we were asked by the hostess if we had a reservation. I didn't book one, but luckily for us, there was a table available and no wait was required. We were led to a table that can accommodate 6 people. This was probably a good thing because we were hungry and were ready to order everything off the menu.
