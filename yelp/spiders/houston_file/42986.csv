Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I will say this is a very good bakery with flavorful baked goods. However, in my opinion it is not the best in America! The building is really nice, however there in no ample parking for people and the hours are weird compared to other bakeries in Houston.  I don't like the fact the the co-owner/Chef is abandoning ship too! That's a red flag to me!!!  From previous interviews he wanted to open a bake shop in his hometown and now its the complete opposite of what he wants. Check out the article below.
