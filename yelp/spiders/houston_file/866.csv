JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Usually stop by to have an appetizer or 2.  Ms. Shalon the bartender, has been there most times & I have to say she rocks.  Always a nice smile to greet me, takes order right away follows up after delivery to ensure all is ok...  Keeps my drinks filled, which is a pet peeve of mine.. When I've ventured out from just appetizers she was able to answer my questions about the different broths & the ingredients.
