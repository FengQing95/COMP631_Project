Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Loved this place. I ordered the apple cheesecake waffles and they were phenomenal. My buddy ordered the fruity pebbles French toast and it was fantastic as well!!!! I will definitely be back and I will for sure recommend this place. There was a 30min wait for 2 so I decided to sit at the bar and it was not much of a compromise it was actually pretty comfortable and our food came out quick!
