Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The bartender William was amazing. From the moment we sat down at the bar he was very friendly and welcoming. We felt very comfortable and he talked with us about the different drink options they had. The atmosphere of this place is so cute. I love the vibe and the openness of the location. My boyfriend and I will definitely come back. The drinks and food were amazing!
