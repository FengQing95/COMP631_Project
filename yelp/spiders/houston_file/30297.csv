The Pit Room////I want to give a major shout out to the younger guy that was working near where you order on 2/9. I am from out of town and was asking for recommendations and he piped in with a couple of different options. Unfortunately one was sold out, but while I was sitting eating my meal more of that option was ready and he brought me a sample to be able to try. That was SO ABOVE AND BEYOND. If the manager would like to reach out I would love to try to verify the team member for recognition because I honestly felt so special and would recommend this place based on him alone. I mentioned I was from out of town and he really tried to ensure I got to try the best options.
