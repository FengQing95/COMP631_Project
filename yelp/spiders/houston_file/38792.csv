Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Wow! I read about it online, saw it on yelp, drooled over the menu online and was prepared to be amazed. And I was! Kudos to a restaurant that started in Cali, making their creative and delicious mark on Southern comfort food! Who woulda thunk it?? Yes, it's well-known for it's "libations" but I came for the "kitchen"!
