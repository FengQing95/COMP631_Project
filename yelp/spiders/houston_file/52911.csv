Kata Robata////I usually order squid at a sushi restaurant to determine how fresh their seafood is that usually translates into how well sushi and their sashimi is.  Unfortunately, Kata Robata has NEVER had squid available for all the times I've visited the restaurant.  I have even joked around with the staff about removing it from the menu.  It's a bit disappointing that they never have it in their inventory.
