Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The food was really good and I wanted to take home everything from the bakery ... Few issues we had was the mess we made and coffee we spilled everywhere trying to eat at the flimsy, rocky tables they had outside ... Biggest complaint is that they don't do anything you want them to do ... I wanted my egg on my dish scrambled but they refused ... If the restaurant was more than half full and if there was a line I could understand but the fact that they 'don't do substitutions' is why we won't be back ... Dish Society was busy today and they even offered to cook the eggs differently than the menu suggested .... But this place is always busy so I don't think they'll care. One other thing is that as a first timer it's confusing how you get your coffee- the person who took our order didn't say you needed to wait at your table and they would bring it to you so we stood near the coffee area until one of the staff looked at us like we were stupid and told us we could sit down ...
