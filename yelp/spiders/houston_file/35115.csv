Local Foods////Absolutely love local foods. Whenever friends come into town, I always take them here and there have been zero complaints. I used to order the crunchy chicken religiously, but over the years, I've gravitated towards the garden sammie (sub with pretzel bun, add chicken), and always gotten the Kale salad side and whichever seasonal item looked interesting. Also, the posole soup is really comforting - great if you're feeling sick!
