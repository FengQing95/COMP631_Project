Baby Barnaby's////Baby Barnaby's is great, but I like the other locations better (mostly due to parking availability) For breakfast, I love the french toast and the sausage is really good. My favorite lunch or dinner item is the turkey burger, hands down- it is served with some KICKASS pesto on top, which is fantastic. I also love whatever the magical seasoning is that they sprinkle on top of their fries. Yum.
