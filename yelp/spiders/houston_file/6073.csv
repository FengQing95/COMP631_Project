JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Based on your other reviews, I would consider you something of a ramen expert. But while you are probably more inclined to dine at some of our competitors, please allow me to say that just a few years ago Houstonians did not have so many options when it came to ramen. But today, there are more than a dozen standalone ramen restaurants in our beloved city, and I think we can both agree that is a good thing. Thanks again, and we wish you the best.
