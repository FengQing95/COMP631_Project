Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Great atmosphere and a wide selection of pastries and breakfast items. We took pastries and they were mediocre. I would like to come back and try more of their menu, Â but considering I like pastries for breakfast and I wasn't impressed, it might be a while. Coffee was ok.
