Uchi////The first day I got to Houston, a friend told me to go to Uchi. He said it was his favorite restaurant in all of Houston, and where food's concerned, he's been around the block a few times if you know what I mean. I instantly picked up the phone, made a reservation for that upcoming Friday, and spent the rest of the week in a haze, constantly daydreaming of this food mecca I was about to discover. I scoured all the Yelp, Google, TripAdvisor, and Zomato (come on urbanspoon, really?) reviews, salivating over the pictures and descriptions, while keeping note of what I needed to order.
