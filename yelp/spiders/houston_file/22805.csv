Uchi////So to summarize the difference, I would say Uchi is more of a traditional Japanese place where you would find a lot of good sushi rolls. Actually, that's probably their thing. On the other hand, MF Sushi, despite the name having sushi, is more modern and more of a fusion places. With a lot of other Japanese dishes but definitely not known for their sushi. So if you are looking for good boring plain old sushi, you would like Uchi better. But if you are for better food and more of a unique experience, MF is way better.
