Uchi////Service was fantastic and food was even more fantastic. I ordered the momotsuki cocktail (didnt like it at first but when I got to the bottom, it was a sweet surprise) hama chili (I could eat this every day if I had the $$$$), brussels sprouts (great, tasty filler), jar jar duck (deliciously smokey), foie to kuri (interestingly sweet), madai sushi (so fresh and flavorful), zero sen (simple and tasty), and finally...fried milk (delicious).
