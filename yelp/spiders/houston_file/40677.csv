Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Solid go-to brunch or whiskey lover spot. Their most popular food items are the fruity pebbles french toast and the donut burger! I'm not much of an Instagram foodie anymore, so we ordered the not as cute options: short rib chilaquiles (pictured in front), shrimp and grits (not pictured) and smokehouse Benedict (pictured in back).
