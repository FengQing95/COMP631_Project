Kata Robata////Kata has a happy hour, even on the weekend. Love it. And the happy hour menu does change. Try the kobe beef. Delicious. The rolls are ok and good size. Favorite roll was the spicy tuna. Order the sashimi platter. Not bad. Firm texture. No fishy smell. Other places, I can smell and can taste old fish. Here, Kata keeps fresh or semi fresh fish.
