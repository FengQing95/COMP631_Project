JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Update: I've now eaten here about 15 times. I LOVE this place. I've eaten ramen at all the "it" places in NYC and Vancouver. And Jinya is in my top 3. I could eat here at least once a week. It's my daughters' fave restaurant. I had to drag a few 8 year olds here and they all loved it (Jinya buns and chicken ramen are big hits with the kids).
