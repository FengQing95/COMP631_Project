Kata Robata////Picked up an order to-go. The rolls and sashimi were deceivingly small compared to the pictures and menu. Intended to order  for a group of five but when we started removing everything from the bag it seemed like we were shorted. Everything was there but like i said- the portions were tiny. It made for a very expensive meal/appetizer. They also didn't include chopsticks, soy sauce, or wasabi which further soured  the experience.
