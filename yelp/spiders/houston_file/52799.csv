Kata Robata////It gets crowded and loud on weekend evenings, so despite the dim lighting it is not the most intimate dining spot.  That being said, I think it's a great place for a group getting the night started.  It's also a great lunch spot for business, with prompt service that has been virtually error free the numerous times I've eaten here.
