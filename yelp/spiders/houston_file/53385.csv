Kata Robata////Server was on us and although he seemed new and nervous, he knew the menu upside down and backwards since we had asked what he had suggested.  Needless to say, after reading ALL of the reviews about the lobster mac and cheese...that was the first thing out of our mouth.  Yeah, I understand why now.  Crazy amazing.  Don't worry, though....The lobster they put on top is only a shell.  We were confused as one could get and even went so far as to ask how we were supposed to break into the lobster.  Rookie move!  Server simply pulled it off the top and was polite about it.  We also ordered sushi and nothing outside of what we had at any other restaurant despite his highly recommended items on the first page which I questioned myself why I didn't order as well....
