The Pit Room////Was on mission to eat some good TX BBQ and this place nailed it. Ordered the beef ribs and 3 meat plate along with daily side of okra and beef and pork sausage. It was lot of food but wanted to try variety. Meats were cooked with perfection and moist. Couldnt stop eating. Their sausages were super delicious too. I truly loved the pickle bar. Picked onion, fresh onion, picked peppers and green onion. It was the best pickled vegetables I've encountered. If I lived in the area...I be a regular there. Lunch time was quite packed. Honestly I can't say anything negative about the place. Decor was simple but so appropriate with the joint. Clean and kept well. If I visit Houston again...will return for another round.
