Uchi////After my last visit to Uchi, I voiced my concerns to their GM, Steven. Steven was sincere, understanding, and apologetic of my last visit. He showed nothing but respect and professionalism of my concerns. Additionally, he promised that my next visit would be worth my time, so here I am updating my review!
