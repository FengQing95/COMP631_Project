Local Foods////I'm a HUGE fan of Benji's crunchy chicken dish, so turning it into a sandwich on a pretzel bun for lunch is a HUGE plus for me! My sides were the Tuscan kale and homemade chips. Both delish. My hubby ordered the Gulf Shrimp and Blue Crab sandwich. To me, it was okay, but he enjoyed it. The wild rice side was rather bland and dry. "Mintade" is a must get! .... and the carrot cupcake was super moist, my hubby was just "mmmmmmm......"
