JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The broth is 10/10 amazing. Very thick and flavorful. The noodles (I got the thick noodles) were tasty and chewy (in the good way). The toppings on the ramen are great and each add a new element to the bowl. The fried onions are a nice treat and add a sweet element to the ramen.
