Uchi////My date and I started with the hama chili. Get it, it's delicious, sweet, salty and spicy. Next were the brussel sprouts, also a very big hit. Then came the Walu Walu, and this was by far my most favorite. It's escolar but tastes so beautifully smoked and the consistency is perfectly flaky. Afterwards, another plate landed in front of us, it was sashimi but I honestly couldn't remember what it was, but still, wonderful. Jar Jar duck followed. I had been dying to try this and wanted to like it so much but it just wasn't as flavorful as the others. Uchi salad, very good with machi cure to accompany. Amazing. Finally, we had the pleasure to have the ham & eggs. It's sushi but with pork belly paired with sauce that resembles the yolk and white of an egg. Clever and delicious. Dessert was the peanut butter semifreddo and as a gift from the chef we also had the lime ash sorbet which was key lime pie in a sense. The lime was overbearing but the peanut butter semifreddo was a hit.
