Uchi////1. Let's face it that this is Fusion Japanese Restaurant. So, we shouldn't expect to eat something authentic Japanese food here. Don't order Sushi or Sashimi if you in love with original style preparing that you custom too. I don't do that here. When you come here order Fusion Raw Fish menu and Cook food menu, you will not disappointing walking out from here.
