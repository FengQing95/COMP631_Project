JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The broth was very good.  I'd give it 4.5 stars.  *Now this is where service went down to a 1-2 star :(.  **My waitress disappeared.  I had some questions that were not addressed even though I snagged down three other servers who happily said they would take care of my questions or problems.  *This is where it got annoying and not relaxing!  The servers just all seemed to go on break and left the dining area.  I was basically abandoned in the dining area.
