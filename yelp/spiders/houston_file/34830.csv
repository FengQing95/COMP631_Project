Local Foods////I've got my eye on some of the vegetarian soups I've seen rotating through the menu, like the vegan chili and the avocado and leek. I've also seen rumors of a jalape√±o hummus, which you know is gonna bring its A game. I'm a big fan of when delicious restaurants change up the menu, so you know I'll be back to try anything this kitchen dishes out.
