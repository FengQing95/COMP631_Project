Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food at Snooze is worth five stars, hands down. The waiting procedure is so awful, however, that I've decided to stop coming here. First of all, they don't take reservations. Expect to wait at least an hour on weekend days. Second, they don't have a clear cut waiting area, so you wind up milling around, consistently in the way of other customers and yelling to be heard over the din in the main dining room. I love the food here, but waiting so long and in such an uncomfortable setting just kills it for me. I'm generally grouchy by the time I get my meal. If you want to experience the magic that is Snooze brunch, chose an off day (Tuesday morning?) and bring some reading material.
