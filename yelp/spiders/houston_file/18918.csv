Uchi////Like Arnel S said, if yelp reviewed JUST the food, I would've given Uchi 5 stars. However, that's not the case. On the brightside, the food is amazing. It's in a class of its own. The waitstaff for the seating inside and outside were amazingly helpful. The hostess, however, was a complete and blithering idiot. My party was forced to wait 3 hours for her mistake that she would not admit to. According to the people who work there, she's the manager of the hostesses and from the Uchi located in Austin and was working at the Houston location temporarily. Complete idiot, words cannot express. She was condescending and pretentious. How does she have a job at all? What are the standards these days?
