JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Brett - Thank you very much for the awesome, comprehensive review. I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen and that you received good service while you were here. Every day we are learning a new lesson in running our business, and trying to find the optimal method for seating an influx of guests is one of our top priorities. In short, there is no perfect method, but we try our best. Thank you for your constructive feedback, though. We greatly appreciate it.
