Uchi////Yes, it is a very good restaurant. A high end with a well matched price. Because of the complex menu, it may be better to ask omakse, Chef to just take care of you. Sushi is excellent. May be one of the best in Houston? I like Kubo's but it is more flavorful because they add touch of fruit juice. Typical technique used in some high-end sushi place in Japan.
