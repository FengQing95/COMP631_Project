The Pit Room////Visited Houston for the weekend and had to try this place out. I was happy I did. The place is big. They have lots of seating inside and out on the patio. We came in at noon on a Sunday and I was scared to find a huge line out the door but I was pleasantly surprised when there was only one person ahead of us. Food was great. Loved the bbq sauce and the ribs were tender. I wish we were closer so I could come here more often. Definitely will have to come back next time I'm in town.
