Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food was good, but definitely  not worth the hour + wait. Next time I will have brunch else where due to poor customer service, unadjustafiable wait time, and ineadequate management. The server got my order wrong and  I had to wait an additional 30 minutes to get what I ordered in the first place. If I am going to wait over an hour for food when there are many alertnatives available, the waiter/waitress should get my order right the first time and not make me wait an additional 30 minutes to get what I had originally ordered.
