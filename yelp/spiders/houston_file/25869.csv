The Pit Room////Brisket was awesome. Mac, potato salad, corn, and cherry pie were all delish. The beans were a bit spicy and the house BBQ sauce was just okay. I loved that the executive chef stopped by our table. We will definitely be back and hope to see this place continue to get better and better.
