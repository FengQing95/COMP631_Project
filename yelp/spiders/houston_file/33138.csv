Local Foods////Soups and salads are also available, as well as Dr. Pepper in a bottle :) Overall a great date place for lunch/dinner, friends, or even for sitting outside on the shaded patio and reading a book while you sip on local draft rootbeer. Plenty of seating inside too. The restroom was also clean, which is always a huge plus in my book.
