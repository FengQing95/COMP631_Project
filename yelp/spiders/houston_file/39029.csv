Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Their service was great. They were quick, and we had two different servers check up on us every 20-30min! The restaurant had a great playlist - mix of house and hip hop, and the music wasnt too loud. I loved their whiskey wall. The wood, red velvet chairs, all the bottles of whiskey floor to ceiling!
