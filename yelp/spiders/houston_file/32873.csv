Local Foods////My friend and I decided to split different sandwiches so we can try different ones. With each sandwich you can get a soup or 2 sides. I ordered the Crunchy Chicken and opted for the 2 sides. I chose the orzo and the quinoa. The quinoa did not disappoint, I wish I had more! As for the sandwich, it was delicious and had the added benefit of being served on a pretzel bun. My friend picked the crab sandwich and it was amazing as well.
