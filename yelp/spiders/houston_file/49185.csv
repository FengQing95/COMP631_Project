Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So when I say good I mean like you hear the hype, you see the line, you roll your eyes and think, I'm no sucker, it's breakfast, how different can it be from that average place down the street that serves bomb mimosas??!! I mean after a couple of those you can't tell a difference, right?! WRONG. This place will make you want to set your alarm and enroll in college classes classes again just so you can beat the crowd ( or stay up and never go to sleep depending on how you roll, no judgement)
