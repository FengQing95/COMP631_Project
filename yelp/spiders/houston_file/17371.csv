Uchi////Give Uchi credit. It is a propaganda money making machine..Great marketing! An American making sushi. It's brilliant!  is the food great? Yes! Is it with the price? Hell no! Jar jar duck! Awesome! Worth$28? Hell no! 4 bites of duck for that. I don't care if it's infused with marijuana smoke, it's not worth it. All their dishes are great, just vastly over priced.  Service is good and well trained. Go there 2 times a year for special occasions. Go to Michiru or or Kata for the rest of the year!
