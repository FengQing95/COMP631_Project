JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Putri - Thank you very much for taking the time to write such an excellent review for us. We greatly appreciate it. I'm not sure why you didn't receive Truffle Ketchup with your order of French Fries -- that sounds like a mistake on the part of our tapas chef. I regret that occurrence. But hopefully you'll come back, and if so, please be sure you get the Truffle Ketchup.
