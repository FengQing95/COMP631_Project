Uchi////We made reservations here for Sunday evening happy hour, which is every day 5-6:30pm. HOLLA HOUSTON! I think this is the best happy hour in Houston because their happy hour menu is ridiculously cheap-ish for being such great quality items. Everything on the happy hour menu is a must-get. The things we ordered that were not on the happy hour menu paled in comparison to the cheap-ish stuff. Yes, stick with the cheap stuff! I loved all the HH sushi rolls, service was sublime, presentation was Michelin worthy, and flavors presented in each bite was just a non-stop journey of "I can't believe this tastes so good!"
