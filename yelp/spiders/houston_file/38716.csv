Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We went for brunch on Saturday, the decor and ambience is lovely and portrays the rustic vibe similar to a whiskey saloon. There was live music which was a nice touch and probably the best part of the experience while dining, although quite loud and difficult to hear the server. We received service from multiple servers, which was confusing and caused miscommunication in our orders. We had to remind them of items we ordered and did not receive, as well as send back food that we did not order.
