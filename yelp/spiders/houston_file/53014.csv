Kata Robata////My friend and I were searching for sushi hh and came here. The restaurant is nice, and we felt out of place with our shorts and t-shirt attire. Oh well. We tried a few dishes on their hh that were pretty good. Had a drink, that was decently strong, and were on our way. I'd come back for hh.
