Local Foods////I'm very big on a wholistic approach to diet; I believe in eating foods that are not or minimally processed because that's what we were designed to eat - none of this refined/processed crap that stocks 90% of our grocery stores.  So, naturally, I was stoked when my friend suggested Local Foods after a couple months of moving to Houston.  As always, I researched a bit on the restaurant and Yelped for reviews.
