Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Mimosas were good. I ordered the shrimp and grits which lacked flavor and seasoning. The Tomato sauce over powers the grits. And the grits themselves weren't seasoned and I couldn't really tell if they had cheese in them. The egg is not really needed nor is the toast on the side. Too much sauce in comparison to the grits.
