Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Excellent food nice atmosphere and great service lead by our nice waiter Cam!   We shared the BP Press which appeared to be a Cuban sandwich.  Also order Bosscat fries.  I was actually disappointed in those.  Sounded like they would be really good but at end of day their were just potato wedges with a little spicy ketchup.  I expected more from this place quite honestly.  What was unique and amazing was the cornbread Madeline's.   Love sweet cornbread and the berry butter it came with was so excellent!
