Uchi////Each of the dishes I had the chance to try (once we got in) were a perfectly crafted bite. I had the chance to try hot sake, gyutan (beef tongue), avo maki, negi hama futomaki, machi cure, social short rib, (among a few other great dishes), and finished off the evening with a foie gras candy bar (which was a unique dessert experience; it was sort of savory and I really liked it).
