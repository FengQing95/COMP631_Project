JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm sorry to hear that your experience with Jinya's authenticity is "lacking."  Jinya was founded by our CEO Tomonori Takahashi.  He owns several restaurants in Ebisu, Japan and brought the concept to the US several years ago.  We try make the taste of our ramen as authentic as possible.  Perhaps you just got a bowl that wasn't good.  Should you visit again in the near future, please message me and I will make sure I am there to cook you a bowl of ramen that meets your every expectation.
