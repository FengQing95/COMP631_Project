JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Teylor - Thank you for your great review. Yes, the cost of living in Midtown is a little bit on the high side, though we stand by our product, and we believe we are offering something new and somewhat different to the area. We thank you for your support, and we hope to serve you again soon.
