Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Does Snooze have good breakfast? Yes. Is Snooze worth the wait? No. On the positive side, I live close enough to Snooze where I don't have to brave the hour-plus wait on Saturday/Sunday mornings in the parking lot. Also on the positive side, they have text notification when your place in line is up. One can take advantage of this service by running errands nearby instead of waiting in the crowded lobby or sweltering parking lot in the dead of summer.
