JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I tried the Cha Cha Cha and it was great. Ramen wasn't really the big hit there. As others have said, it's the broth. What I really loved about the Cha Cha Cha was the taste of the egg it gave it a special touch. Overall, great service. Didn't have trouble finding parking there's a garage right on Elgin. I got there around 4:30pm on a Sunday and it wasn't crowded as I had expected but I did see people arriving later on. Pretty place btw.
