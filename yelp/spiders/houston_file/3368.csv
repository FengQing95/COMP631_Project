JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the Tonkotsu Black without mushrooms or seaweed. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because my ramen came with the mushrooms and seaweed in it. The waitress noticed the seaweed as soon as she arrived with our order and offered to take it back, but I declined. If I had known the mushrooms were also present then I would have allowed her to fix my order.
