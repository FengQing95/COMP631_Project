JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Best ramen I have had in Houston.  The main downside of this place is that there is usually a wait, so be ready for that.  I think the food was worth it though.  So far I've only tried to Tonkatsu black and the tempura brussel sprouts, both of which were delicious.  Will be back for more!
