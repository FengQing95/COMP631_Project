The Pit Room////Visiting Houston for the first time, we sought places popular with the locals.  I'm a huge BBQ fanatic - been to joints in Chicago, Kansas City, Memphis and elsewhere - and The Pit Room was high on my bucket list.  Here as elsewhere, we observed the classic faux-rustic 'rib shack' ambience, a long line, and burly diners happily gnawing huge bones over metal trays.  Well, the brisket absolutely blew me away.  It was competition quality; best I ever tasted.  Among the beef and pork ribs I've sampled at various BBQs, I would rank theirs in the top 5%.  Meats are so juicy and bursting with balanced smoky/spice-rub flavor that you don't really need sauce, but the house sauce (thankfully not sweet), used sparingly, worked quite well with the meats.  Sides?  Some of these could use refinement - the charro beans were watery and lukewarm, and the mac & cheese was too 'loose' - but the potato salad was delish and the tart coleslaw was crisp and refreshing.  We loved the garnish bar with its pickled goodies and appreciated the selection of local craft beers.
