Uchi////Everything tasted perfect and delicious. I would recommend 1 sake set if you're just drinking casually because it was actually hard to finish 2. And we are hard hitters when it comes to sushi, sake bombs and hh. They gave us free stir fried Brussels sprouts because our order was taking a bit. Now I have a new found love for fried Brussels sprouts. But honestly anything on the menu was great and didn't feel like I was just eating rice and raw fish.
