Baby Barnaby's////Went in on a Sunday, got seated quickly but the waitress was forceful and then forgot to put our order in and kept blaming it on the pancake we ordered saying that that was the reason everything was delayed and then both my husbands meal and mine came out wrong but was eventually everything arrived and tasted good but it took close to an hour and a half for us to eat once we were seated and after food was dropped she pretty much ignored us so 2 stars for overall experience
