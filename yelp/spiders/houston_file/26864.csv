The Pit Room////While spending a few days visiting my brother, I couldn't pass up an opportunity to get Ribs. The Brisket Taco was amazing, my only regret is that I didn't order more. I've never had Texan Ribs before and let me tell you being from the North Issas to say my life feels incomplete. I ordered the 1/2 LB of Ribs as well and by the time I left I got a 1 LB to go. The Mac and Cheese and Potato Salad were also delicious. Huge fan of the condiments bar, unlimited pickles, pickled green unions, jalape√±os and many more. Until next time Pit Room.
