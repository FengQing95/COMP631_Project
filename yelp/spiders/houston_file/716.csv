JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your review of Jinya Ramen Bar.  Would you mind specifying what you didn't enjoy about your visit so that I know what we need to improve on?  Yes, the design of our establishment is focused on "trendy" and our ramen varies from the traditional (Tonkotsu Black) to the fusion (Cha Cha Cha).  We carry 12 different kinds of ramen on our menu and it usually takes a couple of bowls for guests to find the one best suited to them.  Should you ever return, please ask for me, or my managers Wynne or Keith.  We will gladly assist you in helping you select the best ramen based on your personal preferences.
