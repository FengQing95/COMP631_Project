Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was looking forward to this as I had read the reviews and looked like a great early Saturday breakfast place. I arrived at 07:20 and the parking is difficult to figure out. There are signs at nearly every spot (they are all numbered for some reason) and some signs are turned around but others say parking for some other business only. Having watched the wrecker game across Lovett at Starbucks you have to be careful. Found a spot surrounded by signs but with no sign and parked but checked when I went in.
