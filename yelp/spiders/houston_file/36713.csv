Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Terry is the bomb dot com. Helped a party of 13 through a smooth dinner. Drinks were great, I had the southsider which was super refreshing and the Moscow mules are great too. Shared apps and my fave was the pig candy. Had the bosscat burger the chef's way and it was huge! Overall great experience.
