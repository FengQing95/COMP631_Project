Uchi////Ok you guys - this is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Houston so I had to write a review for them because it's just too good for potential diners not to check this place out! The freshness and quality that Uchi delivers is exquisite! If you like Japanese cuisine (and I'm not talking sushi rolls loaded with creme cheese and grocery store crab meat) I'm talking innovative and uniquely developed sushi and Asian inspired dishes - you must give them a try! My personal favorites are the Machi Cure, the bluefin Otoro sashimi, and THE FOIE GRAS!
