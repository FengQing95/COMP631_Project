JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have been here several times and I'm not even from TX! I've always had a good experience. The food is fantastic. A nice bowl of pork ramen with a bottle of hot sake makes the night even better. The staff was always really friendly and to the point (some may take that as being rude but I think it's necessary to be helpful and quick in such a busy environment).
