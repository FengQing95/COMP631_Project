Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I had their Korean BBQ sandwich (at this coffee/bakery cafe) even though I am Korean (because I'm a premed student that needs to study and I miss Korean food so much). I was pleasantly surprised. The seasoning on the bulgogi was right on. Never had bulgogi in a baguette with arugula before, but it was good!
