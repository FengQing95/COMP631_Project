Kata Robata////Wow. That's all I have to say. Went there for the first time for lunch today and ordered the Chirashi (Sushi rice topped with 8 types of raw sashimi, 3 types of cooked sashimi). I particularly enjoyed the tamago (egg omelet), sake (salmon), and Toro (Tuna). I've had sushi from a lot of places in the US but this meal was something else: every single cut of fish was precisely cut and very fresh. It was very similar to sushi that I've had traveling in Japan, which says a lot. Maybe I got lucky and I got lunch right after they received a fresh shipment of fish.
