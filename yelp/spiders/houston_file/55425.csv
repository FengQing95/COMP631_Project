Kata Robata////The quality of the fish here is amazing. I came here for a double date and we had the melt in your mouth kobe beef skewers as well as multiple simple sushi pieces, topped off my the lobster mac and cheese. It was an amazing and decadent meal. My only complaint is that I wish the wine by the glass prices were better. We opted to get a bottle for around $50 as the glass prices were $14-$16, which is just silly. There should be a $10 option, sorry guys but it's not THAT fancy in there.
