Kata Robata////Kata Robata was by far the best food I had while in Houston. I came here with my coworker with reservations from open table. When the waiter came to the table I asked if they could put together a chef's tasting, and luckily for us, the Chef de Cuisine was there to give us a phenomenal 8 course tasting menu. Particular highlights include the seared amberjack with green onion puree, scallops with foie gras and cabernet-blueberry gastrique and the ebi nigiri topped with a whole uni.
