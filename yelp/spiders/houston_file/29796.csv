The Pit Room////Since moving to Houston, I've tried around 5-6 well-known brisket/bbq joints. The Pit Room is my pick for the best brisket in town so far. It's tender to the point you barely even need a knife (the way a good brisket should be) and has a nice seasoned taste. They also offer a nice range of sides alongside selections of brisket, turkey, chicken, sausage, pork, and ribs.
