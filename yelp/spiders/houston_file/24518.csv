Uchi////Great restaurant! Have been coming here for special occasions for the past 4 years. My husband and I sat at the sushi bar and Tri (in training) was our chef which did a terrific job in choosing dishes that best suited our palate! He introduced dishes that allowed us to explore new flavors, textures and profiles of food. Sohan was wonderful as well in attending to us as he also surprised us with a variety of drinks which we would have never thought of ordering. Thank you for one all your help and guidance Kaleb in helping steer out courses. Hope to back soon!
