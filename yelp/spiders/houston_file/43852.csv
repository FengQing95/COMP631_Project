Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Almond Croissant: extremely flaky crisp crust that kinda shatters when you bite into it, and then you are greeted to a cloud of feather-light layers of deliciousness: buttery, almondy, and a hint of sweetness. Â I especially love their sugar because it is crystallized and kinda reminds me of crushed up pieces of rock candy!
