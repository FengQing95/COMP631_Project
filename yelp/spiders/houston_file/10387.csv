JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Honestly I would say best ramen place in Houston however, I think the broth is a hit and miss thing every time I go. The first time it was very delicious and savory then the second time it was kind of bland. The noodles are great. It is always crowded so much sure to go early especially during the weekends.
