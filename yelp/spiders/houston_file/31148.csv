Local Foods////Very vegetarian friendly and really delicious.  All the side salads and soups I've tried have been great (especially the kale salad), and the falafal sandwich is amazing.  It gets crowded during the lunch rush, but they move the line along pretty efficiently, and if you are there on the later side (after about 1:30), there's rarely a line at all.
