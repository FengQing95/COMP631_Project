Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Everyone has those moments when they feel like they are as happy as they could ever possibly be. For me, that moment was when I was eating the pain perdu (french toast) and sipping my caramel latte this morning at Common Bond. The line was very long, yes, but the wait was so worth it. The weekend brunch menu is spectacular and so are all the pastries displayed on the counter. I ordered a kugelhopf and a recommended mysterious sticky bun type dessert to-go (the boxes are very nicely designed, by the way) and sat down for brunch with my friend. It was packed because it was Sunday, but people left regularly and seats were not that hard to find. We shared a monte cristo and a pain perdu. The monte cristo was a perfect mix of savory and just a touch of sweet, and the pain perdu was just heavenly. I love that they made it with croissant bread. Be warned - the portions are HUGE (the pain perdu came in a bowl the size of my head) and we had to pack everything to-go because we could not finish any of it. I love the decor, the food, and the service. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys eating.
