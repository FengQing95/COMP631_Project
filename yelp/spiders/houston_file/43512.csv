Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My favorite here is probably the kugelhopf. Fruit tarts are pretty good, and the scone is all right. They also serve brunch, which I haven't had a chance to try but looks pretty good from what I've seen. Coffee is good, but you can easily find several places with good coffee in Montrose without coming here for just that.
