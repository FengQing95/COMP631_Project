Baby Barnaby's////I went to Baby Barnaby's for the first time a few weeks ago. They only serve breakfast-brunch food which is my favorite meal of the day. It's right next to Barnaby's which serves lunch and dinner. I went on a week day around 11 am, and it wasn't crowded, so that was great. I tried the apple pecan filled pancake and the apple sausage. They were both really good. The pancake was the size of the plate, and it was very filling. The apple sausage was a great complement to the pancake. The next time I go I will definitely have to try the fresh squeezed orange juice. It's made right in front of you.
