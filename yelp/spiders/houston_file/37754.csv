Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Coming into the establishment I noticed the music was very loud and it was hard to make conversation. It took 40 min to get a table which is understandable because of the brunch rush. Our server was Terry M. And wasn't the greatest. First off he wasn't very friendly, just asked what we wanted and left, I understand it was busy, but he was chatting and making jokes with the table next to us, even dancing a bit too. He hardly came by and checked up on us, but he would check up on the table next to us frequently. The mediocre service really brought down the whole experience and Couldn't really enjoy the food because of it.
