Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Packed with pastries from croissants to rugelach, it was difficult to make a decision! They have a breakfast menu as well, so I opted for croissant egg on a roll without the ham and the friend had soft eggs with a baguette. The employees were cute and helpful and quite hipster.
