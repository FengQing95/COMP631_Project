Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////There are some minor struggles, because it seems that everyone else in Houston is a fan, so the line often goes out the door in the morning, and a lot of the best goods are sold out by the afternoon. But the staff is certainly attentive and efficient, so the experience is still pleasant overall! And they have their own parking lot. Thank goodness.
