Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My wife and I have been waiting for this place to open for weeks. We arrived opening day at 11:30 AM to find a huge line which we both expected. What we did not expect was a rude server taking our order. When we arrived we saw no croissants in the case but a bunch of people in the back placing croissants on cooling racks. After waiting in line for 45 minutes, it was our turn, I asked for a croissant the lady said they was out. I said can I have one of whatever is cooling on the rack. I assumed they weren't croissants but some other pastry. The lady in a very abusive tone yelled "all we have is what's in the case sir nothing else".
