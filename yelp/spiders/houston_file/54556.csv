Kata Robata////The sushi was excellent (we had the Caribbean, longhorn, and soft shell crab and salmon rolls), and we also enjoyed the duck dumpling ramen.  BUT, the wait was forever!!  Without reservations, our wait was about an hour, and it took them another 30 minutes after we were seated to bring us our first sushi roll.  While the quality of the food was great, I wouldn't return without reservations again--the wait wasn't worth it.
