The Pit Room////This place has some pretty good BBQ. I have to admit that I wasnt a fan of their house Sauce. It was too vinegary for my liking. But the meat was delicious. We had the 3 meat plate: pulled pork, chicken, and brisket 2 sides: potato salad and Mac n cheese. My favorite of the meats was the pulled pork. The potato salad is awesome and the Mac n cheese is good too. We also had chicarrones with house hot sauce and those were awesome too. I'll definitely be back. I've heard good things about their beans...
