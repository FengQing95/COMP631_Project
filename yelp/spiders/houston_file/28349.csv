The Pit Room////Within a few miles of my house, I have Jackson Street, Drew's, Brookstreet, Brisket House, Killen's, Gatlin's and my sales route takes me down to Dickinson BBQ quite a bit. All of these establishments are super fine in their own ways, and I'm super spoiled to be able to bounce between them all. *Fuck Demeris, by the way...
