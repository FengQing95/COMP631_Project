JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Kimberly - Thanks for your great review. I'm grateful you gave us your best shot, as well as a fair assessment. We haven't been so lucky with other patrons who have decided they just don't enjoy ramen. But like I have said many times here on Yelp, we're never going to be all things to all people. But we do work hard and try our best to provide the best ramen we are capable of producing.
