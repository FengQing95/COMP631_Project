JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Not infrequently there's a wait at peak hours. This place will still be really busy very late at night right up till close on the weekends. It's a great spot to take a lot of friends, but not necessarily a quiet location for an intimate, conversation-filled date. There's additional parking around the corner if you don't find any street parking.
