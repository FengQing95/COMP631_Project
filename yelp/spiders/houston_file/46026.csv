Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Unfortunately when I made it to the register, the girl overcharged me. If I hadn't asked her why ONE cookie, ONE macaroon, and ONE $5 box of cookies equalled $15.50, she wouldn't have said a thing. I started in on the cookies as soon as we got back to the car. The macaroon was good. Crisp, not to chewy inside, and didn't have an overpowering marzipan flavor. It wasn't worth the price, but it was good. The triple chocolate brown butter cookie was okay. It was cold and hard, as I'd suspected, but didn't taste burnt despite the darkened edges. More than likely it was the brown butter that caused to cookie to darkened as much as it did. The most disappointing this was the little $5 3x3 box of thin snickerdoodle cookies. My friend said they tasted like eggs and I don't 100% disagree with her. Snickerdoodles are supposed to be sugar cookies rolled in cinnamon and sugar before being backed but their was a lack of sugar and vanilla in the recipe because the cookies tasted like unflavored batter rolled in cinnamon. For $11 and some change, I was highly disappointed. I could have gotten a better batch of cookies from the local H-E-B for $5 cheaper.
