Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Now that we're past that portion of the wait, you need to realize you will wait a long time before your server appears.  You should also order everything you plan to eat the first time you see the server because who knows when they'll be back. It will also take forever to get your order, even drinks.  If you order a beer it will come about 20 minute later, as though they had to make it. All it takes is walking to a cooler and taking out a can, but somehow takes 20 minutes. Also on the beer, once we ordered beers and 20 minute later they arrive with it and ask if we want mugs. "Sure!" then the woman puts two piping hot glasses.  "Thank you for the Scorching hot mug for my cold beer!"
