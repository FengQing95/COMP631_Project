JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Gonna keep this short and simple: this is hands down the best ramen in Houston.  Since moving from Austin, I've been trying to find something that rivaled Tatsu-Ya here-- people talked about Tiger Den, but meh--don't get me wrong, it's good, but just doesn't quite measure up.  This, however, does.
