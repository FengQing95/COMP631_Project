JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the $23 chef's special ramen for the week that included brisket and I personally don't think it was worth it. Check out the picture I posted. It wasn't melt in your mouth like I had expected for such a pricey bowl. Instead it was dry and really tough to bite through. I didn't even finish it so I ordered meatballs to get full off that. Meatballs on the other hand was delicious. I wouldn't come back but if I ever get outnumbered again, I know I can't go wrong with meatballs.
