JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Y'all.... their tonkatsu black is so amazing!!!!!! Not to mention the Brussels sprouts appetizer. ALWAYS good service and ALWAYS a good meal when I come here. I love the environment too. I really highly recommend this location- all of my friends at UH rave about it constantly too.
