Kata Robata////Regarding our bartender Vincent, he was a nice man with some tatto on his right hand.I didn't read his tatto.I was guessing It was saying" Drink my beer and sleep". He was from Seattle. Starbucks coffee might be better in such a cold city, Seattle. But here in Texas, we have to drink beer. He served great beer.Next time, i will bring my pillow and blanket in order to drink a lot of his beer and sleep at his bar!
