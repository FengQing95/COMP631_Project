JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Horrible service , staff can not handle busy lunch crowd . When you are in service industry , learn to calm your atmosphere. Hopefully you do not get Darcy as your server at the bar . No customer service skills at all . She did change her tune after she realized I will not be intimidated by her behavior . Ruin your appetite completely
