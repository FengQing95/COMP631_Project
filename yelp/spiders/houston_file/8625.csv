JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Luke - Thanks for your review. While we respectfully disagree with your opinion ;) I'm sure we can both agree on this: Houston is fast becoming the Ramen Capital of Texas, and the restaurants that do it well will continue to do it well. As far as which ramen is best, as my general manager Keith likes to say, it's like asking "Which diamond is the prettiest?" Choice is good, and in the coming months, Houstonians will have a bevy of choices for ramen, which is vastly different from the ramen landscape just a year ago.
