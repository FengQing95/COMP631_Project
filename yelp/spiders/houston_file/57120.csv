Kata Robata////My absolute favorite sushi/ Restaurant ever!! This place tops Nobu and any other sushi place in houston. Prices are very affordable. Everything we ordered was AMAZING! I recommend the kobe beef skewers, lobster mac and cheese, Texas waygyu katsu sandwhich and EVERYTHING! Great service and the bathroom was my favorite part
