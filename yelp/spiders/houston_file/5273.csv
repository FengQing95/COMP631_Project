JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Coming from NY, I often go to Ippudo for the best authentic ramen. But now I can honestly say the Spicy Chicken ramen here at JINYA is the best ramen I've ever had. The broth is SO flavorful, the noodles are perfect, and the chicken is tender and absolutely delicious. The portion was also very generous, my brother and I could barely finish our bowls. I wish I lived in Houston so I could come here all the time!
