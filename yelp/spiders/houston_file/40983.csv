Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////For Entrees we ordered the Crispy Fried Chicken sandwich, 12 hour beef short rib, and the Cornmeal Crusted Catfish. We also ordered a side of the Mac & Cheese and the Bosscat fries. Let me say this food was amazing.... Literally everything! The Chicken sandwich was fresh, crispy, the coleslaw was pretty good. The Mac & Cheese was very gooey... a very gooey stringy cheese was used. It complemented the Short rib very well. And the Catfish was crispy, well flavored, and real fish... not that frozen stuff. You can tell this is fresh Catfish because it is not slimy!
