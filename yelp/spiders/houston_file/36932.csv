Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Checked this place out because of all the great things I've heard about and because of the great reviews. If there is one word I can use to summarize my experience it would be EVENTFUL. As a first timer there we were unaware of the great selections of whiskeys and our waiter was so nice and took us into the whiskey room and gave us a great tour. The food tasted great, the sides we got were underwhelming as 1 was too greasy and 1 was under seasoned. The whiskey choices though are numerous and if you come wanting a fine glass of whiskey maker sure your ready to spend some cash. The atmosphere was amazing during dinner with dimmed lights, nice space, and design. I have to say that the music was really loud so we were practically screaming, but we were sitting under the speakers to take it for what you will. I would come here again though but I would just hold off on the whiskey and dive in on the food.
