Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////After ordering a little of everything and paying our $70 dollar bill, we went home to taste, we was going to eat there but the cafe was full. We only live 7 blocks away so no big deal, the real problem is when we started tasting. The chocolate chip cookie was raw in the middle and tasted like it. The eclair was filled with a bland chocolate cream that left a dirty feeling on my tongue. The chocolate cupcake was overly bitter like a teen girl rebelling against her parents, this cupcake was out to prove it ain't no milk chocolate cupcake. The macarons were awful the few that had taste, tasted like someone baked them to punish someone. (Macarons by Patisse are so much better)
