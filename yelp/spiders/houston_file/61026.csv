Baby Barnaby's////The best place to get breakfast. The dishes are very simple but delicious. Plus the portions are huge! You won't leave here hungry. The food always comes out super quick, and I've never been disappointed by any of the dishes. The pancakes are very large, I like the banana walnut the most.
