The Pit Room////Small BBQ joint serving some of the best BBQ in all of Houston! The two meat platter is the way to go. The vinegar cole slaw and potato salad or beans are excellent sides. Yes, the parking lot is small and there can be lines at times, but this BBQ has some of the best flavor that you can find. Next time I am in Houston, I am making it a point to visit The Pit Room and get some more BBQ.
