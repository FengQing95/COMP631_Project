Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I really enjoyed this place.  They take great pride in making cocktails absolutely correct with the highest level of ingredients.  That alone is reason enough to have your drinks here.  I went here for a business meeting and the menu looked so good we ended up not going to our dinner place but eating here.  I am happy we did.  Everything we tried was outstanding, hot chicken, pork candy, spare ribs, and the snapper.  The snapper was recommended by the waiter and the description did not seem appealing at all of a rye whiskey snapper something.   The result was a incredibly delicious snapper on a grain mixed with spinach.  It was perfectly done and the flavor was amazing.
