Uchi////Amagara Kanpachi: listed on the daily special menu, our waiter Mike insisted that this was even better than the hama chili.  We looked doubtful but curious so he insisted on giving it to us for free.  HOLY COW HE WAS RIGHT.  The chef included carefully trimmed spice plus Yuzu honey with the amber jack (a fish I don't usually love otherwise) to deliver a magical combination.  I literally pounded the table it was so good and when the waiter came back, I did something a little crazy that I've never done before.  I hugged him, and asked him to pass it on to the chef.  (He said he did and that the chef was appreciative but that this dish was still unlikely to make it on to the regular menu.  :( I'm not sure what that will take... fellow Yelpers order it while you can!)
