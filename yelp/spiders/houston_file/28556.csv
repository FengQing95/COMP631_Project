The Pit Room////I loved it! I got waaay too much food, big surprise, but that means I can tell you my faves: the turkey was moist the brisket was amazing, the pork rib fell off the bone. Great flavor! I also got the Mac and cheese and the green beans as sides, asked the folks behind the counter for their opinions and they gave me the best choices! I also enjoyed the sausages, but the brisket was the star. Would def go back, service was super nice.
