Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food/drinks: Both times i had the pork candy and the bosscat burger.  My only complaint is how aggressively they push "no modifications" getting the burger chefs way. I love the chefs way, but tomato's are a no go for me.  I'd prefer having them left off instead of having them on and removing them when i receive the food.  The specialty cocktails are very tasty and one of my favorite parts of the menu.
