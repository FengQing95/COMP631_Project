Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////4 of us decided to do some scotch tasting on a Tuesday afternoon around 4pm. The place was pretty dead when we got there so we sat at the bar. The atmosphere is pretty cool, so we stayed for a bit. At one point one of my buddies asks a bartender if he can take our picture with our scotch flights, and his response was "no, but maybe the hostess can." Wow! I could maybe understand if it was a Saturday night and the bar was slammed, but this was a Tuesday afternoon. We closed out pretty quickly after that, I guess a $300 tab between 4 friends isn't enough to get your picture taken (which would've provided free advertisement on social media).
