Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Ugh, the bakery and coffee are easily five stars.  The brunch and lunch menus are unique, but it just falls short for me.  You line up at the counter, and they will go down the line to take everyone's order.  The line really does not take very long.  What is a pain, and almost ruined the visit for me is basically everything else.
