Uchi////The restaurant is nicely dimmed and a nice, mature environment. We were seated at a nice round table by the bar and our waitstaff was very nice and very knowledgeable. We ordered everything off the happy hour menu (food wise) and everything came out with perfect timing. I tried the chenin blanc white wine and loved it.
