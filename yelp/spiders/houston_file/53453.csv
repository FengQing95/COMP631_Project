Kata Robata////Fois Gras sushi: if you've never had this, you should be sad because it is really good. I first had Fois Gras sushi at Uchi in austin and never thought I'd see the likes of it again. And yet kata robata has not only replicated the tasty treat, but IMPROVED it. It melts in your mouth like the giant piece of fat that it is. mmmmmmmmmm
