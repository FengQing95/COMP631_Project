Uchi////We arrived at around 5:30pm on a Monday night, and the place was packed.  Luckily, there were two spots for us at the sushi bar.  It was also refreshing to see a female sushi chef behind the bar... Nicki was excellent by the way!  She and Pam, our server, made an excellent combination and service was spot on!
