Local Foods////The patio is nice with plenty of seating and larger indoor venue then before. The food is good but your paying more for the location and the ambiance then the taste of the food. Had the avocado toast which sounded good but was more like a pile of salty guacamole on toast. Would not recommend. Have had the sandwiches and I would stick with them if I was to return.
