The Pit Room////Wow this place is a gem! When we visited there for dinner during the week. It is clear this place does get very busy! We had the two meat meal, sausage and brisket with a beef rib. Wow! the beef rib is a meal in itself for one and a half people. It was outstanding. The brisket melts in your mouth. For our sides we had mac and cheese and green beans. This was plenty of food for two people and it was all outstanding. I do recommend and will visit again. The restaurant itself is not very big so plan to sit in and eat.
