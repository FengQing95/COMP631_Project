Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We split the texas club sandwich, shrimp and grits, and some truffle fries and everything was basically great. I think the ratios on the club involved a bit too much turkey and not enough tomato/mayo but the overall experience is a good one. The shrimp and grits are very solid as well. Would love to come back and try the french dip and those levain like cookies that were calling to me through the counter.
