Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I really wanted to like this place. The vibe is cool and the drinks are great. We walked in not long after they opened (no reservation) and got seated right away. I ordered a chorizo/potato/egg bake thing. It was cold when I ordered it and lacked flavor. I'm not one to send food back, so I asked for hot sauce and covered the dang thing with it which made it better. As I kept eating, I found a small egg shell piece and just stared at my husbands but off put. I set it aside and kept eating. Then, I found more eggshell. Like, a LOT of eggshell. I told the man who had been refilling our waters about it. He apologized and said he'd put a rush on a new order. I wish he'd given me an option to order something else, or nothing at all because I wouldn't have ordered the chorizo thing again. It took about 25 minutes until I realized the replacement was never coming so I asked our actual waitress to just cancel the replacement order. She said she was never told about the issue at all and had no idea that I had found eggshell in my meal. The manager came over with two mimosas on the house and apologized profusely. The meal was taken off our bill and we left.
