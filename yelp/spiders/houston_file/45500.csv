Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////AMBIANCE: The more people, the more noise. Aside from that, nice. However, you start feeling rushed when people start to stand around, searching for tables so they could enjoy themselves as well. I mean, we didn't budge, but it would be nice to be able to catch up and dine guilt-free.
