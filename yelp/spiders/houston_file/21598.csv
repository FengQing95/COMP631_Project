Uchi////Great HH place!!! Do come early as a line forms for the HH. The food is excellent and would recommend for a GNO or date night. I believe the update their HH menu from time to time, but would recommend getting everything on their HH, and then order more of the items you love. The plates are pretty small and not shareable if your party is greater than 2.
