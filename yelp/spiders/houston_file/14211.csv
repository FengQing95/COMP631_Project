JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Ra L. - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry you did not enjoy your meal with us. May I ask what your server recommended to you, and what in particular you found unappealing? We don't often receive one-star reviews based on the quality of our food, so I would like to investigate further. I look forward to hearing from you, and thank you in advance.
