The Pit Room////My co-workers and I were in Houston for business and looking for a place to grab some southern comfort after a long day. What better than a BBQ pit in Texas, right? Unfortunately, I think the Pit Room was off its game that night. I hate leaving a bad review, especially when this spot has so many great reviews from a ton of reviewers on Yelp, but we had a bad time.
