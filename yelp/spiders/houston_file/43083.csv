Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place was really great to visit for me. The employees here were very nice. However, it wasn't very easy to access for a first time visitor since everyone seemed very busy and I was kind of confused of what to order/where to go when I walked into the door. I only ordered a matcha lychee macaron which was delicious. However, the price for it was a little over than what I wanted to pay but the macaron itself tasted amazing. They are really cool and hip and I would definitely visit or come back again with friends.
