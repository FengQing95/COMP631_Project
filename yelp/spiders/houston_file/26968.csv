The Pit Room////Smells emanating from this place are to die for! Take care when parking, cause you may end up at wrong door. Surrounding area is a nice looking neighborhood. Food is amazing, bbq sauce is great and Mac and cheese is creamy. Service was friendly and the whole place was incredibly clean.
