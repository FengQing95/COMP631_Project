Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've tried mostly of the croissants/pastries! Kouign amann, chocolate chip walnut cookie, and the chocolate croissant are my favorites!! One of the only drawbacks in this place is that everything sells out so fast - if you really wanna see/try everything they have, just show up as soon as they open. (Mind you, at noon, some pastries are sold out already. You would think they'd bake more in the morning to increase their sales).
