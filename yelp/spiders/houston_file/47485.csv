Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////HIGHLY overrated. I was one of the SUCKERS who waited for their overpriced and overrated food. There are MANY way better breakfast options out there. I don't know if it just me, but the name of the restaurant is EXTREMELY IRRITATING. Snooze. Stupid name. The place is clean and the service is good. It's just the food and the name that suck.
