Kata Robata////Mains: I got the Miso Marinated Black Cod.  Again (my bad luck?)... while this was good I would call it largely forgettable. But my husband's Texas Hamachi roll ~~  wow!!!!  Love that they made it so tart with the yuzu juice, and spicy with the raw jalapeno.  V original roll I thought.  Gf got a crab roll which was forgotten by the bevy of servers we had (cute waitress took our order and checked on us, but we had many others come by with the plates). This was fine actually since we were all stuffed.
