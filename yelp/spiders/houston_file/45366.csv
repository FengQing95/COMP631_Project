Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is a pretty run of the mill coffee shop when it comes to the selection they have available for drinks (coffee, tea, juice etc). They have an extensive selection of pastries and other baked goods which was nice to see since many coffee shops can't boast such an extensive selection. There is ample natural lighting due to the huge windows that flank 3 walls of the establishment - this makes it an ideal study or remote working location!
