The Pit Room////First off BBQ in Houston and Texas is a pretty high bar. But for neighborhood location and a short wait it is good BBQ, the tri-meats where good, sides beans & potato salad were tasty but so what - the meat was smoked tender and moist, ribs were done correctly. Will go back again so don't let 3 starts turn you off of a good BBQ joint. Cool atmosphere (not big) and good beverage selection
