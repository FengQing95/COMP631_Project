Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been wanting to come to common bond for years, but finally came here recently! I think the venue deserves the credit it gets! The line was kinda long, and I saw I could place the order online, but I really wanted to see the whole line and pastry assortment. I got the ham and cheese sandwich, we got a few assorted pastries and croissants (best in the city in my opinion), and my wife got the egg scramble. We loved everything we got, and will definitely come by here again in the short future! The parking was a bit atrocious, the lot is TINY, literally enough spots to fill maybe a third of the restaurant, the rest is park at your own risk / run across the street if you're brave enough.
