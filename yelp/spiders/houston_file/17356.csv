Uchi////I went in after seeing all the yelp reviews but maybe my expectations were too high. It was not worthy of 4.5 stars to me. My best friend who came in from California and who knows good sushi agreed. The pieces were tiny which is consistent with high quality sushi but the taste and texture of high quality, fresh sushi was just not there. I liked that they put the wasabi inside the nigiri between the rice and the fish as they do in Japan but still... Overrated. Subpar at best.
