Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Okay, I know that this place does not need anymore reviews so I'm just going to leave some suggestions here. The food is incredible whether you like a sweet or savory breakfast and there are even healthy options, so there's something for everyone. There is a reason for 2 hr. wait times, their food is spectacular and if you go on Sunday after 10 you will probably be in that 2 hr waiting list. This isn't one of those places where they tell you it's a 2hr wait and then your table is ready in 1- it might even take longer than the estimated time. Basically just go early orrr on a weekday orrr go to half price books which is walking distance/grocery shopping at Kroger until they text that your table is ready. You will probably have to park 2 or 3 blocks away because the parking lot fills up pretty quickly. I recommend you go with a couple of friends so you can try a little of everyone's dish. The OMG French toast is perhaps the best French toast I have ever had. They put toasted coconut on top which adds the crunch you never knew you needed. The pancakes are good, but if you're ever deciding between the French toast and the pancakes... go for the French toast. If you're looking for something savory the burrito is absolutely divine and they give you two sauces the red and the green which are both excellent!
