Local Foods////Even though Local Foods can get pretty busy at lunch and dinner time, I have never been unable to find a seat. There are those really longggg tables you can sit at and share with other parties, as well as booths upon tables upon booths. Everyone on staff is extremely friendly, and the food comes relatively quickly.
