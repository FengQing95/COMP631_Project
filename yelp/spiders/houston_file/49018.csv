Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We ordered the Monkey Banana Bread french toast and it was awesome, especially if you love breakfast breads with a good cup of joe.  This meal was huge and very satisfying.  I especially like the caramelized banana.  The wife had the B.E.A.T. sammy and it has a great slice of bacon and the egg over easy on top is a perfect topper.  Both meals were very satisfying and we had plenty to take home.
