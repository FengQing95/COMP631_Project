Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Finally there's proof that "when you snooze, you (don't) lose!" Came here on a beautiful Saturday morning, and was surprised to see how busy it actually was. Despite having a large dining area, every seat was full and we were told our wait time would be between 1-1.5 hours long. They do text you when a table is ready so we were free to leave and walk around, and considering the weather was fantastic we took a cup of complimentary coffee to go as we strolled around Montrose.
