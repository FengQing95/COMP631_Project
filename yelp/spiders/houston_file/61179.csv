Baby Barnaby's////The food is insanely good and fresh! I mean fresh like you can watch your orange juice squeezed freshly. The Green Eggs are absolutely my favorite! The prices are very reasonable too. Lastly, coffee and water are served in carafes, so you can refill yourself. How can you not love the charm of this place?!
