Kata Robata////Great sashimi and good service. We came here on Saturday night and our reservation was honored in a timely manner. It's definitely a little louder than average inside here but nothing unbearable. We ordered the hamachi and tuna jalape√±o sashimi which was an absolute citrus delight. The Yuzu juice covered salmon sashimi is pretty good too but the cauliflower mousse is a little off putting. Their ocean picante sushi roll is good and not overdone with rice. The house specials on the nigiri were buttery and skillfully trimmed and based on those I suggest trying some of their daily specials, which are two pieces of nigiri each per order. All in all good eats.
