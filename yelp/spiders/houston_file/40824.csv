Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I always see this place on Yelp but pass it up & today I decided to stop in. I started off with The Good Life cocktail & it was pretty tasty! I know this is a whiskey bar but I'm a vodka girl so this was perfect! I also decided on the burger to eat & was not disappointed it was cooked & season to perfection! Unfortunately fries don't come with this so I ordered a side of fries yummmm!! Sooo good! The hostess & wait staff were all super friendly & welcoming. I think I'd give them another shot :)
