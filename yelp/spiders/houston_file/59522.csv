Baby Barnaby's////Loved it!  Finally, exactly what I've been looking for in breakfast spots!  Showed up at 9:30 on Sunday morning and there was already a decent-sized line outside.  Luckily, I had done my research and knew to go straight to the clipboard and told my boyfriend to grab some coffee.  We're not picky, so we didn't have to wait at all since we took the bar on the patio, it's really not that awkward because your view is more of the street rather than the people in front of you at their table.
