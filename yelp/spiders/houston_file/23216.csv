Uchi////I've always heard a lot of good things about Uchi from all of my friends so I finally decided to take my parents there on my dad's birthday. We weren't able to make a reservation but when we arrived around 7pm, it wasn't as crowded as I thought it'd be. They told us the wait was going to be 45 min to an hour and offered us to sit at the patio and get drinks while we wait. Someone walked around with sushi samples while we waited so I thought it was nice to have something to snack on while we sip on our drinks. Soon they came by and told us three seats at the sushi bar opened up and we decided to take those seats instead of waiting for a table.
