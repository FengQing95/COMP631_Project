Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My to go items was a fruit tart and 6 pieces of macaroons all the flavor they offered that day.  I always determine the quality of macaroons on the pistachio flavor and the crunch factor.  I prefer macaroons to have a slight airy crunch and pillowy middle. This had more of a chewy middle than pillowy.  I always compare the pistachio macaroons to that of the Laduree pistachio macaroons and unfortunately this was a fail for me.  I have 5 other flavors to try  that I hope will change my mind. ( I have found that even if  the pistachio flavor doesn't blow me away another flavor will keep me coming back)  Now for the fruit tart.  The crust was buttery and flavorful but wish it was more flaky.  It was a bit tough and the custard was dry.  I wanted a velvety custard and this was disappointing for me. The fruit on top was good with the exception of the strawberries which had an off sour taste ( A little to old or maybe over ripe).
