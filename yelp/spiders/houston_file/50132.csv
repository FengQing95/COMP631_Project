Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The wait time was as predicted, an hr & change and to some that might be too much. You can mingle and have drinks so it didn't feel long at all! For it being the peak of brunch hours this was extremely reasonable, we went to 2 other spots before this one and the wait was 2hrs+! Someone told us the trick is to go a little closer to their closing time to avoid the wait lol
