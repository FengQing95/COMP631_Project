Baby Barnaby's////Baby Barnaby's (and the other Barnaby's restaurants) is a great brunch spot if you're looking for no fuss, classic brunch options. There can be a wait, especially if you come on the weekends, but if you have the time, it's a great place to grab a meal. I tried the chicken fried steak with scrambled eggs and potatoes and shared the apple pancake with my girlfriend. The chicken fried steak was nice and crispy on the outside with a juicy middle, and the scrambled eggs were soft and creamy. I do think the potatoes were probably fried or baked from a frozen batch as my college cafeteria had these exact potatoes (lol). The apple pancake was nice and fluffy and not too sweet. I would have appreciated more apple pieces, but it was a good treat. This location doesn't have much parking, so you'll most likely end up parking on the street and walking over.
