Uchi////Why?  A waiter's tasting menu is NOT the same as the chef's tasting menu.  I trust Uchi's chef taste buds, but no offense but I do not trust my newly trained waiter's taste buds.  My coworker came here the night before, let her waitress provide the tasting menu according to her suggestions, and went away hungry and highly disappointed in her experience.
