Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Fresh, clean, organized staff, and great customer service. I've ordered to go right before work, and they pack everything perfectly and as needed individually so that it doesn't mix or spoil. Their orange juice is fresh which is even sweeter in person. This place is a popular brunch spot but, parking is decent. The service is fast we're usually in and out unless we're drinking for Sunday Funday.
