JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Sunny - Thanks for your great review. We appreciate your feedback, as well as your wise advice. A few years ago, Japanese ramen wasn't really an option for dining out, but just a few years later, we feel we are helping introduce this cuisine -- and Japanese dining culture -- to Houston in a big way. Thanks for being a part of it with us!
