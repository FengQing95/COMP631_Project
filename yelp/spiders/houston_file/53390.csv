Kata Robata////Just got up and walked out from lunch (tired of waiting).  Obviously the manager is not around.  Waited for 15 minutes while 3 other groups were seated before us (6 tables were empty).  Atrocious service (but the food is good if you can get it).  I hope they turn it around (and get better trained staff).
