Baby Barnaby's////This is my favorite place to eat! The service, flavor, and freshness of the food are consistent. My favorite thing to eat is the waffle with berries, green eggs and bacon. They also have really yummy pancakes, potatoes, grits orange juice. Be prepared to wait in line but it is definitely worth it.
