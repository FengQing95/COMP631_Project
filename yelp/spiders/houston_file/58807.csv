Baby Barnaby's////According to my husband, the biscuits were the best he's ever had. The restaurant only opens for breakfast during the week. There was a waiting time but tolerable. Our server was by himself but he was very attentive. Definitely recommend the pancakes. I had a banana-pecan-blueberry pancake.
