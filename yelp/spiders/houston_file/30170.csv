The Pit Room////Smokey meats, good eats.  We enjoy the beef and chicken fajita combo, and here's a tip:  order the queso plus a quarter pound of chopped brisket on the side.  Now with a little fine dining magic - dump the beef right into that hot cheese for your table to enjoy. Give advance notice to your server for more chips, they'll go quickly with this flavor boost.  Get the house margarita, large size.  It will be plenty although it will try to order another for you all by itself.  Don't yield to temptation if you're driving....but if you're not, then dive in.
