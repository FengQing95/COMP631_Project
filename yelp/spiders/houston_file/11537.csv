JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////About 15 min after our apps we got the ramen bowls. The bowls were quite large and filled almost to the top. I knew right away I'd like this ramen better than the ones in Tampa because there are 2 slices of pork chashu (vs 1) and a whole egg (vs 1/2). The broth is silky thick and fatty = so much flavor. I couldn't stop slurping when I first got served. The noodles were cooked on the firm side, which is exactly how I like my noodles. Jinya just got another fan.
