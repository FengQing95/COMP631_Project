Local Foods////The only downside of the place is the price. Being in Rice Village, it is somewhat pricey (about 13 bucks per meal) for a normal college kid (like me). I only come here for "special occasions" (like birthdays) and when people really want fancy food. Take your date or family here to show them that you are cultured :)
