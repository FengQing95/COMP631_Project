Kata Robata////I love sitting at the sushi bar since the chefs are so kind and they pay more attention to me than most of the servers; I get to order my sushi directly from them so they come up superfast. I have had two bad experiences with the servers here before when I sat at the table. They either ignored me for 40 mins or completely messed up my order. I don't think "busy" could be an excuse here because everybody knows that Kata Robata is always busy. You need a reservation here even on Monday night. Besides, I would not recommend this place for a romantic date night. Their music is way too loud, despite its semi-upscale/classy decor. One time I had to repeat my order three times to my server because of the blaring background music (and he still made mistakes afterwards). So I am taking off one star.
