Uchi////This meal was one of the best thing I've ever eaten! We dined on the sake social (happy hour) but I can't say anything other than amazing things!!!! First of all, our waiter Stephen (sp?) was amazing and he brought us a hama chili dish on the house! What an amazing plate with such complexity of flavors. We were enamored with the flavor profile in such small plates. This restaurant was the best bang for your buck I've ever been to. What an amazing experience and I was so happy to share this with my mom for her birthday.
