Kata Robata////I'd have to say, the spicy soy ramen was very good, very flavorful! The egg was perfect. I almost didn't want to eat it but that's crazy talk because I loooove soft boiled egg. It was a lot for me to eat so I split it with my boyfriend. What else are boyfriends for, you know? lol jk.
