JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I loved the ramen. The salmon sashimi was excellent. The tofu dessert was da bomb. The waitress was pleasant and great. They are very busy but you can see that the customers like their food. Can't beat Oahu though. But excellent if you want to eat good Ramen away from home. I didn't give 5 stars because the little wooden stool was hard on the butt. I saw the little chair and was afraid for a moment that it wouldn't be able to take my weight, but I was pleasantly surprised that although small, it was very sturdy. lol! A little padding on the small wooden stool would be nice. Maybe they should offer a little futon cushion at the door before you enter. But I guess if you get too comfortable you might stay longer than you should. It appears to be a busy place so we need to think of others. Overall, I highly recommend JINYA.
