Local Foods////1. Service - Not much for service as this is somewhat a self serve restaurant. The concept is that you order and pay for it up front, get a number, get your own drink, grab your own table, and they bring you your plate. They come to check up on you afterwards. If you need a refill, do it yourself. If you need more food, go up and order some more. Nevertheless, the cashier up front is friendly. It's a fast pace concept, eat and go.
