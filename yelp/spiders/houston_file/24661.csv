Uchi////The most amazing sushi ever. The staff, atmosphere, service, food was amazing. I have another favorite that I measure all sushi by, and this one was better in some ways. The only downside was not as much of a sushi roll selection (just a personal opinion). The waiter made great suggestions. The dessert was absolutely amazing. Quite pricey I must say.
