JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Vy - Thanks for the great review. I think you bring up a good point -- I have noticed my carrier, AT&T Wireless, does not provide the best reception inside our restaurant, though the tons of metal gym equipment upstairs from us may have something to do with that, as well. More importantly, though, I'm glad you enjoyed our tapas and ramen dishes, and we hope you come back and try some more of our options. Thanks again, and we look forward to serving you again soon!
