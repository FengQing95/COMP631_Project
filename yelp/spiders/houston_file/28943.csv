The Pit Room////Gotta admit I was skeptical....growing up in the Texas Hill country I know what good brisket is. This place blew me away! Order the two meat plate with brisket and smoked turkey, it'll change your life. Best brisket I've EVER had. Stay away from the potato salad.... I had the pinto beans and coleslaw. Excellent meal, even at almost $17 dollars! If you don't want to stand in line, don't get there at peak lunch/dinner times....we got there Saturday at 3:30 and didn't have to wait. Have also had the frito pie and it's crazy filling for $11!! Would definitely recommend this option if your saving dough and super hungry!
