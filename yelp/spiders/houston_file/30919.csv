The Pit Room////Apparently the place to eat when you're in town and it did not disappoint. I was not a fan of the chewy too red for me brisket but it was not a deal breaker. The pulled pork and sausage was pretty flavorful. The line was out the door and it was well worth it. Great atmosphere, wonderful crew of polite people. Side dishes were packed with flavor and I highly recommend those in the picture as well as the corn. $70 for two combos, a 3 piece ribs and two sodas.
