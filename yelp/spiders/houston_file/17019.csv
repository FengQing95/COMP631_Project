JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Stopped by Houston for a couple of days and decided to try this place out due to all the extremely high ratings. My wife and I love a good bowl of Ramen and we were excited to be in a city with some shops that have good reviews (San Antonio lacks on the ramen options). We went with the Tonkatsu black since it was was mentioned multiple times in the reviews and the waiter also recommended it. It wasn't bad but the garlic oil, garlic, and spicy sauce that's mentioned were almost missing when we tasted the broth. Perhaps a little more of each and some salt would have elevated it, but we're no chefs. On a side note, we were very happy to see a place in the mainland finally sell Japanese curry, plus it was pretty good. If we came back this would definitely be the option we would get.
