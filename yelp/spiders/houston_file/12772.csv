JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Bou - Thank you for the great review. I'm glad we satisfied your quest for ramen. In the past year, several more ramen shops have sprouted up in Houston, and it is our firm belief that the ones that do ramen well, will continue to do well. Those that do not -- or cannot -- will fall away. Thank you again for your business, and we hope to serve you again soon.
