Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Once we (finally) we're seated the food was great! I got the breakfast pot pie which was so delicious! I recommend for any savory breakfasters! The spicy Bloody Mary was too spicy for my tastes and I ended up not finishing it but I think that was a personal thing. My S.O. was unimpressed with his omelet but he was attempting to be healthy and didn't exactly order with "delicious" in mind so I think he's partly to blame.
