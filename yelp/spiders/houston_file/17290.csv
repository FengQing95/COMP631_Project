Uchi////i must admit that i am spoiled with restaurants in my hometown of chicago so while i had somewhat high expecatations for Uchi given the reviews and word of mouth, i was indeed satisfied and quite impressed with the service, the quality, and the overall execution of each dish we had. we gave our waiter (a fabulous guy from new zealand) a price point and had him choose our menu. everything was a stand out. ...our favorites were the bacon tataki, hama chili and machi cure (the machi cure was just ridiculous!). the sashimi pieces were extremely fresh but my only complaint was that a few of the pieces, namely the flounder and mackerel, was seasoned a bit much with a strong cracked pepper.
