JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Elizabeth - Thanks for your great review. Please be sure to ask for no green onions or "less green onions" in the future. We're always happy to modify our ramen bowls within our mandated limitations. But if you're ever dissatisfied with your meal for any reason, we will always work to make things right. We appreciate your business, and we hope to see you again soon.
