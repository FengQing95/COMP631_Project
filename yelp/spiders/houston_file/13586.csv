JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Best ramen bar I've ever been to and now I can't find a place in Dallas that is comparable to Jinya! I decided to try their Sprout Up Ramen because I've never had Brussels sprouts with my ramen before and let me tell you...it was the best decision. The added Brussels sprouts really makes the dish stand out with each crunch. In addition to the sprouts, the pork chasu and kikurage were really delicious too!
