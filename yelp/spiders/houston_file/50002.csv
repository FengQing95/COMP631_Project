Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So, worked all night and it's the A.M on Tuesday. I want to try this new place. I drive all the way from Clear Lake to find this, hopefully, perfect breakfast. I've been to Denver, but never got to visit the ones up there. I definitely should have, but we can always fix that later.
