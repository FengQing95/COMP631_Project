Uchi////Bacon Otoshi - I find it hard to resist the seafood dishes, so I often have to remind myself that Uchi has some exceptional meat options as well. Case in point, this astonishing savory mix of fatty pork belly, onions, and jalape√±os drizzled in an orange kimchi sauce. Normally kimchi is not my cup of tea, but this version was tart and piquant. Doesn't hurt when the pork melts in your mouth either.
