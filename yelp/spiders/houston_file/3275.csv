JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm sorry to hear of your experience at Jinya Ramen tonight. First and foremost, tonight was the busiest night ever since we opened. In the 545 days that we have been open, we've never had a night quite like this. Nevertheless, you should have had a better experience than what you had tonight.
