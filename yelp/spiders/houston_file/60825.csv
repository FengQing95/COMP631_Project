Baby Barnaby's////This is one of my favorite places for brunch! Heads up, you have to put your name on a list oustide if there's a wait, so don't stand around and wait to be seated. They go off of the list. I got their Migas plate with chorizo. First of all, their potatoes are the best potatoes ever! Super crispy, flavorful, and the perfect size. The eggs, bell peppers, and chorizo were cooked to perfection. The service is wonderful, the servers are very friendly and check on you often. You get a pitcher of water on your table so theres no reason your cup will be empty.
