Uchi////DO NOT GET THE 10-COURSE CHEF'S TASTING MENU.  It was billed as a "carefully considered progression, designed for two to share".  Actually, it was "what do we have around the kitchen, and let's just serve it willy-nilly".  Some courses arrived before we had finished the previous one, and we waited 15 minutes for others.  Also, the cost breaks down to $20. per course, and most are as small as the first knuckle of your thumb.  One course was excellent--dashi grits with poached egg and baby corn.  The fish was all very fresh, but one course, striped bass I believe, was bland.  A "carefully considered" tasting menu should gradually build to a crescendo, but this one started on a promising note, lost its place in the music, faltered and finished flat.  The server tried to help us out, bringing some extras and a round of sake, but when all was said and done we were out $300. plus tip and not very satisfied.  The server helpfully suggested, "Next time you come in, you can order off the menu and sort of create a tasting that way and it will be a better experience".  THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US THAT TO BEGIN WITH?  I basically like Uchi and support what it has done for our community, but we will definitely celebrate our anniversary somewhere else next year.
