Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We came all the way from Belgium and Spain to try the amazing chocolate chip walnoot cookies.. only 1 word to describe these: yummmmm. All the other stuff is pretty amazing too. We had a chocolate croissant and the great avocado toast with bacon and egg.. again yum :)
