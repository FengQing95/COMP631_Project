Kata Robata////Nigiri:  Hotate, Wagyu beef, Kampachi, Chutoro and Otoro, 1 piece each.  The scallop was fine, chewy  and not gritty. The wagyu beef was nice, a good flavor of beef, not the best, but a good contender.  (*the best is reserved for Inyo in Vegas*)  The Kampachi was excellent. Both tuna nigiri were alright, but it didn't seem all that fatty.  It didn't have the same melty softness that I am used to.  In fact, I felt the otoro piece was less than the chutoro.  In fact, it may have both been otoro, but definitely the fish lacked a usual softness.
