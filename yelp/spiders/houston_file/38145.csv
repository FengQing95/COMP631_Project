Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat was amazing! From the service to the meatloaf to the mimosas! Went for a friend's birthday and they were accommodating of our big group. The manager stopped by a couple times and the chef even randomly sent my friend some pancakes. Definitely on my list of "omg you have to go there!"
