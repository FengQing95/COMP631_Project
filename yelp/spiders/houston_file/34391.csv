Local Foods////Listen!!!! Just go! Eat the food everything I had was absolutely delicious! I'm not even vegan and the vegan friendly stuff that I ordered was fkin amazing. I took recommendations based on the guy who helped me (ugh I forgot his name) and he clearly loves the food of a place where he works cuz he was on the money! QUINOA burger!!! Get it it's so good oh my god! I live an hour away and I really hate that I'm so far but other than that great food looking forward to try other things but as a first time customer ... it's a WOW from me.
