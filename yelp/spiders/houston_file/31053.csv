The Pit Room////The Chopped Brisket Sandwich: I enjoyed this thoroughly. The bread is soft yet firm enough to hold the meat in the sandwich. the meat is cut small so your bites aren't a fight to chew. the BBQ sauce has a rich flavor with a subtle tanginess to it that compliments the brisket accordingly.
