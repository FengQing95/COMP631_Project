JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The portion was just enough to fill you up. There are plenty of noodles, but the noodle to meat ratio is off. There are plenty of noodles, but only 2 pork chashu and 1 egg. The broth is not too heavy, but does have a meaty/porky flavor. I like that the broth is soupy and not too thick. The garlic oil and garlic chips didn't serve much purpose because I didn't taste any. The best part of the whole bowl was the egg. It was perfectly cooked, juicy and runny and so flavorful. Most of the ingredients worked well together and was so filling and delicious.
