Uchi////Anniversary dinner -- so we picked our favorite restaurant in town even though less formal than we usually would go to for this occasion. As much as we love Uchi, this meal was even better. Every course was perfectly prepared and flavorful. We went with some well known staples (brus. sprouts, hamache nabe, walu walu and hana) , but ventured into some new fish specials, including the amber jack and branzino. All delicious. The staff made us feel special too with a few surprises to celebrate our special day.
