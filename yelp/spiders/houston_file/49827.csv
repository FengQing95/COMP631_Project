Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Awesome atmosphere. The music is great and the decor is very colorful and youthful. The only thing is the wait but it's worth it of course! There is street parking because Peking in the lot isn't enough. The complimentary coffee while you wait is a plus so you can get the juices flowing.lol I ordered the benny duo with the chilaquiles Benedict, and the chili verde Benedict and it comes with amazing hash browns! My roommate ordered the pancake flight with the pineapple upside down pancake,blueberry danish,and opted for French toast for the last one(perfect choice) and got the drunken monkey French toast. We split everything and that was the best choice! We only spent $27.33 on all the food and was well worth it.
