Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I also got the Oatmeal Creme Pie and Hazelnut Brioche. Both were good, nothing super special or out of the ordinary. The creme, in the creme pie is not as sweet as I would've liked it to be. It tasted pretty fresh though. The Hazelnut Brioche is like a huge Ferrero Rocher, literally. My first impression was: nutella! It was slightly less sweet than nutella, which was nice, but again, nothing too special.
