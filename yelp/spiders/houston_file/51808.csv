Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Edit: I returned on a Saturday and got pancake flights, this time trying the cannoli and French toast. I didn't particularly like these. I also got a half portion of the Snooze Spuds deluxe and while it was tasty, I recommend the Chile Verde eggs Benedict as it has more for the same price.
