Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Waited almost 40 minutes for food. Tables seated after ours received their food quickly. We had to flag down another server to go get ours to check on our food - he came & said he would check on it and never came back! Food came out cold about 10 minutes later. Needless to say, service was extremely slow & we were dissatisfied with the food. We will not visit this location again.
