Local Foods////I love this place! Definitely one of my favorite spots for lunch. It's laid back and fast, but you always get quality, delicious food. I personally love the crab and shrimp sandwich, as well as the truffled egg sandwich. UNBELIEVABLE. I was so excited about their sides because I love healthy antioxidant-protein-whole grain-packed food, but the mixtures of the sides seem to be a little off and have strange taste to them. I almost wish it was just a simple kale or beet salad... but they aren't bad by any means, just not my taste. If you're in the mood for something sweet, their carrot cupcakes are unreal. I'm not a big cupcake person but these are seriously to die for!
