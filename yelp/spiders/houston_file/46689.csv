Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond lunches cannot be beat!!! I always stop in for a sandwich being a nursing student is very stressful it's awesome to have common bond so close to campus so I can treat myself between classes and indulge in the amazing sandwiches they have!!! Definitely a musttttt the bread is delicious and the ingredients and quality super fresh! My nursing study buddies and I always stop in and grab coffee and sandwiches we love common bond!!!
