Uchi////Used to be a huge fan, but recently very disappointed by the long wait I had to endure despite being told it would be only 1h. It turned out to be 1.5h, no apologies offered, borderline rude. Either accept walk-ins or make it reservation only, but the dual system does simply not work. A real shame because the food is awesome and service, outside the front staff, very good.
