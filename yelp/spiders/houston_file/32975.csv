Local Foods////My go-to sandwiches are the Truffled Egg Salad and House Smoked Salmon. You really can't go wrong with either one as they are delicious and filling. Instead of the 2 sides that sandwiches come with, I always choose a soup. They used to have a pozole soup, but it's currently not on the menu, so now I get the Vegan Chili. If I the name didn't state it was vegan, I would honestly think it's real chili. It's that good.
