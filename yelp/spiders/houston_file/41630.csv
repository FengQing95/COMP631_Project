Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I haven't had time to make it to lunch (otherwise, they still have bread and desserts), but honestly I am not excited and could care less. I have to fit my schedule to get to you. Outside of your desserts/pastries (which are pricey but good) I just don't think you are reaching out to as many people as you could be. I do wish you good luck and sure that you are doing well, but as a whole--and I understand you are still in your infancy--I would highly recommend that you address sentiments as described from reviewers with 3 stars or less.
