Uchi////Our reservation was for 9:30pm on Saturday, Â we arrived 30 minutes early for cocktails. The hostesses were all very accommodating and attentive, I ordered the Kara Kuyuri cocktail which was very refreshing with cucumber and Thai chili (yum) love spicy. We had our cocktails outside along with grilled edamame, I have never had it grilled before and it was great! Now I am even more excited to explore the menu.
