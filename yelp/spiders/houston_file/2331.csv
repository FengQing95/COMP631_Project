JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great Food and a Wonderful Atmosphere. Quick service even for a major holiday! Went here on Valentines Day expecting there to be a wait, there was none! We were seated quickly and the staff was very nice. Loved it the food so much we brought a friend here to celebrate his birthday a month later! Cant wait to go back again!
