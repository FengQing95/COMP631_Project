Uchi////I've been here before, but last night was the reason why I'm writing this review. Hanh (I think that's his name, at the bar) was great! He took our order and he was polite. We got the hot sake from the HH menu. When he put two tiny cups in front of us, I thought that's it? $3 for that tiny cup? But then he brought out the bottle. Woah! Not bad at all! We started with the sake toro, those were good. Rich and tasty just like a salmon belly should be. The machi cure was refreshing because it had fruits in it. I tried the bacon otoshi, that one was alright. The pieces of pork weren't very proportional. One of the meat had only fat and some was only meat, it would have been nice for it to be proportional. The walu walu, was good. I loved the soup. I also tried the taraba to mikan. Everyone needs to try this!! The crab meat was delicious! Oh the buttery, milky flavor... yummm. I also tried the yaki niku maki.That roll was only alright in my opinion. While waiting for the roll, Hanh gave us a dish on the house because it was taking too long. It was really good! While waiting for our ham and egg rolls, he gave us some more fishes to try. The whole I was sitting there with my girlfriend, we couldn't figure out why everyone kept ordering avocado nigiri, but then Hanh brought it by and oh my goodness, the flavor was amazing! It's everything you would want in a toro but better! The rich, creamyness and flavor were so great! The ham and egg rolls were amazing! We ordered two of those! Lastly, we got the fried milk. It was a great way to finish off dinner since it wasn't too heavy and just right!
