JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had the pork ramen bowl and fried pork dumplings. The food all tasted good...it was clear the dumplings are homemade and you get a good amount (8) for the price ($5.50). The reason I give them four stars is because, though the dumplings taste good, the two times I've been they have had significant problems. The first time the dough wasn't all the way cooked, it was raw in some of the dumpling folds (the table next to me also ordered the dumplings and they looked perfect). I've included a picture of my dish. The second time, the dumplings looked as though they hadn't been friend. None of the skins were crisp or bubbly, they were just drenched in oil and sticking together.
