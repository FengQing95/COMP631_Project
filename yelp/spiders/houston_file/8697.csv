JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Been here twice now, first time was to celebrate my getting a big girl job so it was around fall of this past year. That experience was just okay. The ramen here is nothing special... got the tonkotsu spicy which comes with pork and stuff :P. I like eggs with my noodles so I requested for one with mine. With my luck, it came out without one, sigh. They were quick to bring one out though so I guess that's okay. Boo enjoyed his ramen as he does most food, I didn't wish to return. The pricing is on par with most other ramen shops but for the taste of it, meh.
