JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I order the JINYA Ramen NO.1 which came with thin noodles, pork chasu, seaweed, and black mushrooms. The broth was flavorful and full of garlic. The pork was not too fatty but still very filling. I didn't get to try the takoyaki appetizer so I would like to come back for that.
