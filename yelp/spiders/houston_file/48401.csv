Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I had to check out Snooze Houston after having an awesome experience in Austin. I had the same meal I had in Austin the Benny Goodman and it was just as good if not better!! I also has the hot chocolate which has to be one of the best hot chocolates I've ever had at a brunch spot. Queen V and Mae are so super sweet and the service is top notch. I was impressed. As with any good brunch spot there is a wait but it was well worth it!
