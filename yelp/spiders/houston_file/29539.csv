The Pit Room////Due to the limited time I had in Houston, I did some research ahead of time to see which BBQ house is worth paying a visit.  The Pit Room came up in several articles I read so The Pit Room it is.  Without a car, I relied on getting there by Lyft.  Upon arrival at noon, the place is already crowded and I was the last one in line inside the door and the customers behind me started lining up outside the door.
