Kata Robata////I can't grant this place a fifth star without properly trying their regular menu, so you'll just have to wait with bated breath until that day comes. In the meantime, Kata Robata is a decent happy hour option. It's pricier than your average sushi HH menu, but the quality of the food and quickness of service is worth the premium.
