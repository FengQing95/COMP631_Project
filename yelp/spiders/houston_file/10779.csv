JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I went for a dine in for the first time and I was disappointed to find a group of people more than 6 which is the limit of a group of people set in the guideline now. What's more disturbing is that the group was talking very loudly which could more easily spread the germ...putting other people at risk. They should not be allowed to dine in in the first place and if there is a group talking very loud I wish the restaurant staff warn the people to quite down to be considerate to other people. I also saw a staff wearing mask but not covering nose...
