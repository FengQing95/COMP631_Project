JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Thad - Thanks for your 5-star review! I'm very glad you liked our ramen, though I would like to make a point of clarification: You probably ordered the Tonkotsu Spicy or the Spicy Chicken Ramen, as we don't carry any beef broths currently. That said, I am pleased to know your server was able to assist with your ordering, and that everything was met with your satisfaction. Thank you again.
