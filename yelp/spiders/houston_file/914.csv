JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Terry - Thanks for the review. I'm sorry to hear of the missteps with your order. Today we introduced our new menu, which includes several new items such as the Shrimp Toast. This particular tapas dish takes a little bit more time to prepare than our others tapas dishes; moreover, this was the first time our line chefs were preparing the dish "under the gun," as it were. Regardless, your server should have informed you at the time of the mistake, so for that I do apologize. I do hope you give us another chance to earn back some more stars, but I thank you all the same for your patronage.
