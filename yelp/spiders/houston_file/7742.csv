JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Noodalicious!! We were seated right away. The restaurant is very clean and had a good vibe into it. Our waitress was very nice and on point. Okay let's rate the food....It's a ramen fanatic dream come true...Really I Â pretty much inhaled my ramen bowl. I ordered the Premium Tonkatsu White and hubby ordered Tokyo Yatai ramen. Ordered the TAKOYAKI or squid balls Ummm yeah - DELICIOUS! Ordered the Jinya buns as well. I left satisfied and happy.
