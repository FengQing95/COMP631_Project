Kata Robata////Kobe Beef Yakiniku Don - the kobe beef was tender, perfect fatty/lean consistency. The rest of the dish was great (rice, onions, super hot peppers I almost choked to death on) was good but the star, as it should, was the kobe. It came topped with a runny egg, yuck! had to be removed. But I'll take just the meat next time...and lots of it.
