Kata Robata////Wow. Easily some of the best sushi I've had in town in a while. I'm usually pretty wary of trendy sushi joints because sushi tends to translate to "small portions for big money", so if a restaurant's sushi isn't up to par, you end up disappointed AND losing out on a lot of cash. Going to a bad sushi joint is kinda like going to Vegas, visiting what's supposed to be the hottest strip club in town, and then having a fat and ugly stripper take all your money...but I digress.
