Local Foods////My partners sandwich was good, but the meat/cheese/bread ratio was way off. Too bready, not enough meat and not enough cheese. My falafel sandwich was soggy and bland. I could make a better one, with frozen falafel. One of the best things about falafel is the cruncy exterior and fluffy interior. Seriously lack luster.
