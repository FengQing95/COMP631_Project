Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is one of my favorite restaurants in Houston. They have several locations, but the one on Westheimer is the best! The desserts are gorgeous, but they are OK.  I rather have savory than sweet!  I ordered the Tomato Basil Soup with a Grilled Cheese Sandwich and Poutine. Poutine is a Canadian dish with fries, gravy, and cheese curds.
