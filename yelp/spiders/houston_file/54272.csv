Kata Robata////Did I miss something? I was expecting some incredible sushi, but I must admit that the quality of fish was pretty average. My friend and I visited for the first night of Restaurant Week, so maybe they are still trying to work out some kinks? The biggest problem I had was the timing of the delivery of food - the second course was brought to the table about 2 minutes after the first course. We were not finished eating our soups, so our second courses just sat there... Maybe I should have just ordered off the regular menu.
