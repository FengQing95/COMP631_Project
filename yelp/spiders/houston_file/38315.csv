Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Our waitress was nice and explained things pretty well since we were all first-timers. It was cool that they have a whiskey room that looked really interesting for whiskey lovers. We ordered "The King" pancake which consisted of a very blue pancake, banana cream and peanut butter glaze over it. When it came out, it smelled sooooo sweet, but it actually wasn't which was a lot more pleasant. The dish was really tasty and loved the texture of the pancake. It seems like there's some kind of ingredient that makes the pancake blue, but it's just dye... so "blue suede pancake" is just fancy naming.
