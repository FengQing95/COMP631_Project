Uchi////Uchi....I have said it before and Im saying it again. You are my #1 always and forever. I have dined here at least 1/month for the last 5 years...Im not even kidding. I bring every friend and family member here to witness the magic of your omakase. I am sad COVID has separated us for the time being but as soon as this pandemic slows down I am coming for you! My favorite is EVERYTHING. I am not even kidding. I dont think I have had one thing that I disliked. I trust you and I love you and you have never led me astray. Thank you for the good times and best times. See you soon....
