Uchi////The most egregious error that I have experienced at Uchi was burnt Unagi. I was truly shocked as the quality of the other fish was largely impeccable. The waiter was quick to apologize and replaced it with some very good Unagi. However it still appeared on the bill, despite the waiter's pledge that it would be removed.
