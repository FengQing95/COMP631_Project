The Pit Room////The corn dish and Mac and cheese off the wall delicious! We are from Montana and know good meat ! We really enjoyed the food ... the ambience etc.. UNTIL we went to our car which was parked just by the front door to find a window smashed out and my bag stolen. I carried a smaller purse in with my wallet etc... coming from the hospital it was filled with odds and ends... nothing that couldn't be replaced . Our passports were in the bag.
