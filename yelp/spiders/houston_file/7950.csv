JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I only have one complaint about this place, I felt rushed. We sat down ordered a drink and went over the menu, the waiter came back and we gave him our order.  Food was great, service was great and didn't have that long of a wait considering how busy it was. We finished our drink just after our meals, we were ready for another one but instead came our check. He didn't give us enough time to  get a word out and request a second round.  So we paid our bill and left. Food was on point and so was the drink.
