Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The lady in front of us waited in line just for 2 chocolate chip walnut cookies! So we definitely had to try it. We ordered that, the health nut scone, brussel sprouts, a vanilla latte, and an iced coffee. We cleared the table- it was good! The cookie was delicious and it had a lot of walnuts. The scone was so good and I loved its dough! The brussel sprouts were my partner's favorite. It was crispy and sweet. I LOVED the vanilla latte. I got it with a single shot only and it was so smooth and the latte art was impressive. My partner said his iced coffee was perfect and he has high standards for it.
