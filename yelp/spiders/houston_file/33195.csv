Local Foods////Their Famous Market Veggie Sandwich is so yummy and filling that you would just assume there was some sort of meat protein involved.. nope... just brussel sprouts, curried cauliflower, local sprouts, tomato, hummus and avocado spread. I always roll with my own whole avocado in my purse, so that's a little extra sumthin' sumthin'. Splash a little of their Sambal Hot Sauce (cute little self-serve bottles near the beverages) on there and it's all OVER! I ended up taking half of my "sammi" with me. All sandwiches are served with 2 sides, I went with the housemade chips and the cabbage slaw. Now, those CHIPS.. honey.. will get you slapped for reaching over in my area trying to "snatch & grab".. so don't even look over here, and the slaw was 3 out of 5 stars. The sesame oil is a little to "loud" for my palette and a little sweetness would have been a nice touch, but my little bowl was empty so who really cares!
