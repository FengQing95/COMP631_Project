Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Aesthetically pleasing and clean! I will say that it does get crowded here during breakfast/brunch time. They have windows all around and it has very nice natural lighting for pictures. I got a latte and it was delicious and a few other pastries. The service is great here and it was fast. The silverware is clean and there's employees circulating to pickup dishes/cups. When it gets crowded it gets bad. People are pushy and possessive when it comes to seats.
