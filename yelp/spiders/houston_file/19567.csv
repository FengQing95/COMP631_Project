Uchi////Her first winning suggestion of the night was the Suishin sake, which was absolutely "fresh and light" as the menu said. Note to those who are not regular sake drinkers: They serve it in a small glass which is placed in a square wooden containers. The sake overflows the glass and there is some in the wooden container (thanks to the bartender's "generous pour"), so be careful with the glass otherwise you will have sake drips all over your clothes like I did. And make sure to drink everything from the wooden container at the end!
