Uchi////I've had sushi before, this is NOT just sushi... it's an experience! Sush Delish! My friend invited us when we were visiting Houston, and he did not disappoint. Don't expect to be full afterwards, this is not a place to go if you're really hungry. This is a great impress-a-date kinda place. Prepare to pay a little extra... ok, A LOT extra... but totally worth it.
