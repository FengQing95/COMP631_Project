Local Foods////THE SIDES. I decided to get the Tuscan kale after a ton of recommendations from Yelpers. I'm not a big fan of this whole kale fad, but it was tasty for a meat lover like me. They tossed in some Parmesan cheese and raisins, which gave it a sweet, salty taste and it really worked out. It was really refreshing. The couscous was recommended by the employee. If you haven't had couscous, I want to say it tastes like rice, but it's made from pasta haha. They have the shape of mini-M&M chocolates. It was soft and almost had a nutty flavor. The small beads were fun to eat and different from sides you'd normally find at restaurants. The couscous was complimented with strips of zucchini and pepper, which gave the side the contrast against the softness of the couscous.
