Uchi////We had 10 courses overall and the highlight was definitely the walu walu. It just melts in your mouth and the first bite was the best single bite of my life. We actually liked it so much we ordered a second one. Other highlights included the marbled beef tongue sushi and seared foie gras sushi.
