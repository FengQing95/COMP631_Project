The Pit Room////I love brisket.  This was average.  The pulled pork they gave me was cold. Tell me what self respecting BBQ joint dishes out cold pulled pork?  On top of this, I ordered an Old Fashioned from the bar and received a drink so incredibly bad I didn't bother to finish half of it. I quickly followed with a Woodford Reserve, something he couldn't screw up.
