Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////A retro but by no means dated decor and an interesting take on breakfast mainstays. The serving size is just right - not too heavy and not too light - and the atmosphere is more upbeat and hip than your grandpa's breakfast joint. I had the Lox-N-Latke which was served on a hash brown "biscuit" with a side of Calvin Harris played at a reasonable volume.
