Baby Barnaby's////They don't have the greatest food, but I always thoroughly enjoy myself at Barnaby's when I go to the one in Montrose.  Service is slow but I like the crowd and the vibe.  The wine is good, and they have a mean burger.  Breakfast specials are great also, although the mimosas need some work.  I don't really go to Barnaby's when I want great food.  It's two blocks over and a neighborhood staple which I enjoy stopping into once in a while.
