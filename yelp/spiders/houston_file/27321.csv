The Pit Room////Just ok. As it stands now this place has a 4.5 star rating which is equal to franklins/LA in Austin which is clearly not the case. I will say the brisket meat quality is okay considering the area it's in, but I actually worked in a bbq restaurant in Austin and was a bit disappointed.
