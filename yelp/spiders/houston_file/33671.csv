Local Foods////Shrimp and Crab - This is probably one of my favorite sandwiches when I'm in the mood for something light and refreshing. Still chock full of flavor but it won't weigh you down like the other three sandwiches above. Perfect for a lunch that won't leave you comatosed afterwards. The sandwich, like most of their sandwiches, is very large and filled with fresh shrimp and real crab.
