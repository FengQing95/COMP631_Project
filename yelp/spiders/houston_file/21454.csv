Uchi////I decided on the Social Hour because of the smaller price of some items.  However, I still feel a bit let down and somewhat jipped: while the Machi Cure was great, it was presented to me at the very beginning of my meal, without me ordering it.  It seemed to be presented to everyone at the onset of their meal.  Under such circumstances, I felt it was complimentary--NOT.  When I pointed it out on my bill, to my very nice server, she explained that it was the first item I was presented with.  At least give me a choice of what I would like to pay for.  Other Yelpers are correct, the Ham & Eggs is very interesting.  However, I would have to disagree about the Walu Walu.  It wasn't the melt-in-my-mouth experience I was hoping for.  It was more like a dry baked piece of fish that was served atop Ponzu.  To end, the Bacon Tatki and Chocolate dessert were also ok.
