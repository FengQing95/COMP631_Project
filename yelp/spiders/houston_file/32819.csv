Local Foods////It was such a nice surprise! They were so concerned that I waited for my food, felt that they failed me with their service and wanted to make up for it next time! I couldn't believe how hospitable this place could be, especially because it's so popular and doesn't need to worry about its service. I guess that's just the kind of restaurant Local Foods is :) I will make sure to come back many more times!
