Uchi////Service was perfect, our waitress Ella was so great. The waitstaff totally acts as a cohesive team, and they don't spread servers too thin. It made the whole evening great. Before we were ever seated, staff was coming around with complimentary lite bites. I tried the cucumber, and even though I don't typically like cucumber, this was good. Be aware that they only serve beer, wine, and sake. I love that because it allows them to be more expert in those areas.
