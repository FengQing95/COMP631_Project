JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The decor of this establishment was top-notch, and my wife and I felt that our money was well spent.  Although the interior was somewhat upscale and well done, it wasn't overly pretentious feeling, and we felt quite comfortable in our very casual attire.  The staff was kind and attentive.  It is in a classy part of town, and attached to a free parking garage. (free.. now there's a shocker)  Since we're moving to Orlando soon, we may never have a chance to eat here again, but if we are ever in Houston again, I guarantee we'll be eating at this place.
