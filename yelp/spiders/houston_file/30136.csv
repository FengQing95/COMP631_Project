The Pit Room////We were craving barbecue and saw the reviews for this place and had to stop by for lunch. Me and my friends got 1lb brisket and 1lb of beef ribs. We got potato salad, macaroni and cheese and bread. This came out to be ~$60, divided by 3 of us, so $20 not bad for a TON of meat, sides and drinks!
