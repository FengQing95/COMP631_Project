Uchi////The food here is very good. I enjoyed it thoroughly and would highly recommend it to anyone. That being said, across several dishes -- including cold and hot small plates, sushi, sashimi, and maki -- I thought many of the secondary and tertiary flavors overpowered the flavor of the protein (the wagyu hot rock excluded). These flavors weren't bad. In fact, they were very tasty. But as someone who tends to be a purist when it comes to things like sushi, I found some of these flavors masked or altered the natural nuances of the fish. The fish should speak for itself, not be silenced by preparations that are trying too hard -- even if those preparations are enjoyable. Nevertheless, I'll definitely return to Uchi and would recommend it to anyone who asks.
