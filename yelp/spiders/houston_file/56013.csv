Kata Robata////This restaurant has a trendy atmosphere. It was quite busy but had a pleasant atmosphere. After being seated, we were quickly greeted and started ordering from their happy hour menu. We ordered many dishes so it would be hard to list them all or post all the pics. The only thing I can tell you is that all of it was DELICIOUS!!! Loved the service and how quickly everything came out. This is absolutely a must go to restaurant.
