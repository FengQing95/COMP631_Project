Kata Robata////I should have written this review sooner.   I have been to this place many times.  I highly recommend their happy hour menu, however, even outside happy hour, I think their price is very reasonable, especially when you compare it with Uchi.   Their sashimi or sushi are very fresh.  I have tried some of the specials or just normal Hamachi or Salmon... they are all consistently very good.  I haven't tried a lot of the 'special rolls' but I am not a big roll person.  Their special hot or cold plates are also very good (e.g. Kobe beef, scallop/uni cream special, pork belly etc).  Their Ramen is ok but  I think Nippon is better (and for those of you from NY or CA, don't bother with Ramen in Houston).
