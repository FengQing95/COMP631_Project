Kata Robata////--Ama Ebi - (3/5) Bf ordered this, as always he just says "it's good", i don't like raw shrimp much because it has a fishy taste to it.  The fried head shrimp came out at the end of our meal, I guess because it was super packed, but it wasn't even warm or hot.  I felt like it was just sitting in the back forgotten.
