Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is a cute little place tucked in Montrose, and I went here with a few friends twice over the past year. For starters, their lattes are sooooo cute--I got the lavender latte both times, and latte art aside, it tasted wonderful. The service was also wonderful, as the workers were friendly and cracked a few jokes with us.
