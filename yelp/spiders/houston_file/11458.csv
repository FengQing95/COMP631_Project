JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is pretty much the best ramen in Houston. Compared to Tiger Den and Samurai, Jinya's main ramen-specialized competitors, the broth and noodles here are just ahead of the curve. Karaage (Japanese fried chicken) and the Spicy Umami Miso Ramen are must eats. The Tonkotsu Black and White are damn good, too...I have always wanted to try the butter add-on to the ramen, so if you have, drop me a line and let me know how it is. Seems pretty decadent, so I stick with the fresh garlic (which comes with its own garlic press, as noted in other reviews).
