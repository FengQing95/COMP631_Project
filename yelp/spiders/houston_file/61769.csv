Baby Barnaby's////We eat at Barnaby's frequently. Although we've actually never ate in, we always get takeout. Food is always well packed and usually pretty good. I can't remember having an experience there where I was like this was disappointing. I drive by them all the time and they always look like people are enjoying themselves, at least from the outside patios. I would definitely suggest giving this place a try
