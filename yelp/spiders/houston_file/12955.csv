JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was surprised by the number of people outside when we walked up, but took that to mean that the food had to be outstanding. We waited 35-40 min for a table on a Friday night and grabbed a syrupy cocktail at the bar after 30 minutes outside. There were 4 of us and it was disappointing to be seated all in a row at a long communal table. It's already really loud inside and this made it even harder to talk to each other.
