Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We got in around 1:30 (eating at an A.M. Eatery in the afternoon, reveling in the rebel) so the service was a bit slow and unattentive, but that was also perhaps we requested to switch seats and therefore had to rezone into another waiter's section. Whatever the miscommunication, it wasn't that bad of a mishap. When she finally showed up she was really pleasant and quick in taking our orders.
