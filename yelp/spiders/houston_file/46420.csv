Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've ordered the club sandwich here, which was unfulfilling, one of the least satisfying club sandwiches I've ever had. Hard to say what it was about that sandwich... The bread was dry and the filling was lacking in flavor and it was overpriced. Club sandwich is hard to mess up, so I don't know what happened there. I've also tried the various cakes, including a chocolate cherry cheesecake, which looked so gorgeous but it tasted not as great as it looked, although the couple of dark candied cherries they included in that cake were delicious.
