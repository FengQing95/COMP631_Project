The Pit Room////Aside from the giant line in the middle of the restaurant, the ambiance was very clean and modern feeling. Definitely not a classic hole-in-the wall/order through a window kind of barbecue, but not high end by any means. I did like how, when getting to the front, you order and they cut up your meat and weight it right in front of you, which was a fun part of the experience!
