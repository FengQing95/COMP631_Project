Uchi////"Interesting bar", and definitely overrated restaurant, the owner/chef pay too much attention to the presentation or form of the cuisine than the food itself. The seasoning for most dishes are way too salty (wakyu on hot rock, sasami yaks), eel tempura was poorly handled to the freshwater fishy smell, and the Brie ringo (Brie fried, apple slice and sweet potato chips) is a lost balance combination. Hamachi chili could be a worth try. Also ordered "Hanna to Yuzu" grilled cauliflower with Yuzu sauce, it must have been wait on counter too long to keep the cauliflower in shape, and leave a bitterness taste. Luckily, bar chef tried hard to keep us entertained with the crews, that gives the two stars. Long way to go...
