Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is not a place for you if you come with young children who are not patient enough to wait in line. The line is always long and seems not moving. We were asked to leave the table when my husband was waiting in-line and my son and I sat down to wait. This is per their "common courtesy". Â We left eventually.
