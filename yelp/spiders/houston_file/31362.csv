Local Foods////Cute interior. A little too hipstery for my taste. The food is normal sandwich type things but hipstered up with fancy combination some of them work some don't.  Ordered egg salad sandwich, quinoa and beets. Sandwich was good not your typical egg salad. I love beets in general but these weren't great. Quinoa was good. Overall not bad but not great. Love the concept of eating local just think the food is meh.  Good place to try when your looking for something a little different. Hate the parking situation since spaces are for like 4 restaurants count on parking on the street.
