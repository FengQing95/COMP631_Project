JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Alyssa - Thanks for the awesome review. We do wish parking were a little more convenient, but for Midtown, you must admit a free-parking garage is pretty convenient. In terms of our service, we are always working to improve, and I will be the first to admit that we can always do better in numerous areas.
