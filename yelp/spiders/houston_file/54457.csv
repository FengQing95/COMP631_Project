Kata Robata////The only time I ever go to Kata Robata is when taking Greenway Plaza business clients for lunch, because I am very poor and unable to eat there with my own money. The lunch time at this place is pretty good. The hostess moves pretty fast and assigning the seating for the customers. At the front, there's the special for the day displayed there. Both time visiting here for lunch, we were seated promptly and as soon as we sat, the server dropped by, introduce him or herself and took our drink order.
