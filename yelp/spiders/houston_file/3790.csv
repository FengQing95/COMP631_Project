JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We do apologize for the inconvenience. Having been open for 1.5 years at this location, this is just the second time where we were forced to delay our opening due to forces that are out of our control.  Centerpoint located a major gas leak in the entire center and as a result shut off the gas to the whole building as they search and repair the leak.  As you my already know, a gas leak is very serious.  We were notified of this at 10:45am and were told Centerpoint should have it resolved by 1pm.  Having our staff already inside the restaurant, we put everyone on standby and will open the second the gas is turned on.
