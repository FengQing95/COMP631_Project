Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This would probably be voted as my favorite breakfast spot for 2018.  I have tryed to get into this place two times prior and failed. I decided to change it up and come on a saturday at 10am. (Major success!)  The wait tune was one hour. While you wait there is a area near the hostess area that provides free coffee while you wait. My wait turned out to be around 45 mins.  You can come with a group but I wouldn't recommend over six.  They dont seem to have larger tables available. The menu has lots of healthy options.  My server was very friendly the food was so damn good!  I ordered the Sam I Am sandwich and substituted the sausage for bacon and opted for lightly scrambled eggs with light cheddar cheese.  The hashbrowns were the perfect size and seasoned well. I didnt even need ketchup but may I suggest adding the Basil hot sauce.  I gave the hashbrowns a very unique flavor. My friend ordered the Sweet Potatoe Pancakes with Chicken sausage.   I liked her food better than mine. The chicken sauce is flavored and a lil spicy. I plan to only order that as a healthier option.  In additiom we each ordered drinks O think she had the Pomegranate Mimosa and I ordered the Grapefruit mimosa.  It was great and well worth $8. Overall great place to eat if you have time to wait and I assume they have Wi Fi as I saw a few people with laptops at tge bar. The only downfall would be the lack of parking available, wait times, and tge fact that they close at 2:30pm each day. I think they should have at least one day the are open later.  This is a must try!!!!!!!!
