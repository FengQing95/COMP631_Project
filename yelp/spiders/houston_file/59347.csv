Baby Barnaby's////We were at the Hilton of the Americas for our cruise today and wanted a great breakfast. Our Uber driver recommended Baby Barnaby's and we couldn't have asked for a better recommendation! Service was top notch, thanks Christie! And the food? Mmmmmm! If there is a wait, a coffee station awaits you just outside. Highly suggest you check this place out!
