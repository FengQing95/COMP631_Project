Uchi////The quality of the fish is stellar, and the interpretations of each creation are so unique and delicious. As always, we had so many dishes, but the hands-down favorites are the foie gras (mind-blowing and even better than the seared foie gras I've had at French restaurants,) and the bluefin otoro. But every single thing we had was wonderful and exceptional, from start to finish.
