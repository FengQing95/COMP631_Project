The Pit Room////In town for the otc show and looking for bbq. Went to yelp for ideas and the reviews. Spotted Pit Room and figured it was worth a shot. Turned out to be incredible. Brisket, chicken, turkey, beef ribs, pork ribs, pulled pork, and two or three sausage choices. Went for the three meat meal with two sides, couldn't go wrong. Everything was excellent, brisket chicken, sausage all done with just the right amount of smoke and very juicy. Well worth the trip to check out.
