JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////And lastly, I regret that you were served a Takoyaki whose temperature did not taste like it came directly from the fryer. We do try to send out our food as quickly as possible, but sometimes we miss the mark. Please know you can always send back any item for any reason whatsoever and we will replace it or offer you something else from the menu.
