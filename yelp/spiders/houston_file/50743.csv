Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My favorite thing to get here is the Spuds Deluxe or The Benedict Duo because it's always possible to mix up your choices with every visit! The Spuds is probably the best bang for your buck if you want to stuff yourself with protein and carbs. To finish it off, the variety of pancakes as well as the OMG French toast will put you into a food coma until next week Â
