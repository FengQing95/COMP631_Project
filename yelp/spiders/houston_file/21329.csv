Uchi////It was such a great experience for all the food. For example the scallop rock, the server bring out a super HOT rock... don't touch it. Place the scallop on the rock to cook it and eat it. The scallop was season perfectly and when cooked on the rock to give it the scallop a nice seared. Its pretty pricey, but its the experience and the company that is joining you that you're paying for. Since we ordered a lot, our bill was pretty high, but its not like I come here everyday so its okay. I did notice that they have happy hour, so if you never been and want to give it a try without breaking the bank come during happy hour. Of course happy hour menu is limited.
