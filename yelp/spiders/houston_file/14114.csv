JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The Ramen noodles were fresh and tasty, although I kept wondering if there were workers in the back tearing open those instant Ramen bricks. The pork meat in my soup was tender, and I liked the soft boiled egg that was included. The spicy pork I ordered on the side was also delicious. A friend offered me some of his cauliflower side dish and it was OK...nothing special.
