Kata Robata////The place was extremely loud. And we ordered the spicy ramen, regular duck dumpling ramen, and some sushi. The scallop sushi was great and the other sushi like salmon was average. And the regular duck ramen was ok. But the spicy ramen that I ordered had a sweet milky taste! I prefer my ramen to be on the salty side but not sweet and milky. My friend and I both agreed that this place was average. On the other side, the waiter was extremely attentive and provided great service! If you are used to getting really great quality food, this is not the place.
