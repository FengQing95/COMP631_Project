Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////1. This restaurant is an odd mix of taking your food from the counter and table service. We took our own pastries after we paid, but then our coffee (!!) was brought to us a good 15 minutes later (no refills, by the way- a $3 coffee and no refills) at the table, as was the parfait. Also, if they aren't going to let us get our own coffee, then cream, sugar, etc. should be at the table. Instead, after you wait forever to get your coffee (it can be dangerous to keep those with serious caffeine addictions waiting for their coffee), you then have to get up and take your coffee with you to go get cream and sugar. Really, just give us our mugs when we order and let us take care of our own coffee. And give us refills for christ's sake.
