Local Foods////The menu is mainly soups, salads, and sandwiches... but they're the most creative and mouth-water soups, salads, and sandwiches I've ever had. So far, my husband and I have tried the the BLT, tuna salad sandwich, falafel sandwich, lemongrass soup, potato salad, kale salad, butternut squash salad, cous cous, and the fizzy grapefruit/orange/mint juice. Everything has been spectacular. Not a single dish is lacking in amazing combinations of flavors and colors. And to top it off, they try to buy everything from local farms and such, so you end up feeling really good about what you're eating.
