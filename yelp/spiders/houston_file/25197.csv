Uchi////I decided to check out this place and Kata Robata, 'cos I was really missing sushi. Uchi was recommended to me by another Angeleno and he was spot on. This is definitely the best sushi place in Houston. Kata Robata was very, like... I dunno... like maybe somewhere around Wokano quality? This was definitely more like a legit sushi place so it's not for sushi tourists but rather people who genuinely enjoy good quality fish and have a nicely refined palate. 10/10 would absolutely fucking eat here again. I'd eat here every day if the bill wasn't $100 a pop by the time I left lol.
