Uchi////Third time going to Uchi. Got there at 7:15 PM and was seated with a group of 5 by 8:15 PM. Edamame and peppers are two appetizers that I always order when waiting for a table, and they were good this time too. Went with the vegetarian tasting, which never disappoints. Brussels sprouts are always delicious. The Uchi salad is probably the worst part of the tasting. Uchi can sometimes feel like not enough food, and the food was coming out very slowly tonight, so that was frustrating. Best vegetarian sushi I've ever had, however, has always been at Uchi. Peanut butter dessert was on point too.
