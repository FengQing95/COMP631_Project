Uchi////Fried Milk: Again, wasn't sure if I would like it but ordered anyway because we were celebrating two birthdays. LOVE. I don't like desserts (I really just don't like sweets that much), but this was fantastic. It felt like some culinary work of art. Beautifully done with a brilliant mixture of tastes and textures.
