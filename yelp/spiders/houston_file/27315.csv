The Pit Room////The pork ribs were alright but super small for the price you pay, and the brisket was really dry. I'm not sure why people would consider this place good unless they like super lean/dry BBQ and/or has never made the trek out to Killens or even Rudy's. If the BBQ sauce is the saving grace, you're not eating BBQ correctly...
