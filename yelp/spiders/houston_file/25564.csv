Uchi////Our favorite spot to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries or something very special. We always go at 4pm and have a great time. We order the majority of items on the happy hour menu and of course anything the waiter recommends. My personal favorites are Brussels sprouts, ham & egg roll & gyutoro sushi. The gyutoro, 72 hour short rib is absolutely, hands down, the best item. I ordered 6 the last time I was there. We also got the Waygu Tataki and that was cooked to perfection. All the dishes were incredible, including the king crab sushi.
