Kata Robata////Horrible service by the hostess . We were told there were not any tables available to walk-in  and find the restaurant empty .  The hostess proceeded to whisper about us to the staff . We had several different people bring us out our food , it was pretty much whoever cared  to wait on us . I have never been discriminated like this in all my time in Houston. I called the next day to talk to manager and the same hostess forgot to put me on hold and spoke very improperly about us again . I got hung up , and again was told to call back later . I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone . There are far better places in Houston with quality service to go with the price tag .   We were  very polite and considerate but I'm assuming our skin color or how we were dressed was not up to standards for the hostess .
