Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////You can't go wrong with this place; it's worth all of the hype and the long wait you're sure to have regardless of what day or time you go. The pancake flight is a must. Their breakfast cocktails are awesome. I've tried 3 different versions of their eggs Benedict and they were all fantastic. My husband got the hashbrown bowl and it was awesome as well. I recommend getting the pancake flight to share and each ordering their own entree, keeping in mind that you'll have leftovers to take home!
