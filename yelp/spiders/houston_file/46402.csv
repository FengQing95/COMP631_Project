Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Okay so this place is delicious. It was recommended by my sister who currently lives in Houston. From the flaky croissants to the savory dishes. I was in awe of the flavors in the flatbreads and the salad.. but I feel my favorite dish was the shrimp and grits and the red velvet croissant. Not too sweet... Just the perfect flavor. If your in the area definitely check this place out. My husband also chose to get a slice of there fresh baked and oh was if delicious with some goat cheese. Topped off the amazing dishes we had.
