JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Got the spicy umami and Tokyo tonkatsu ramen, they were ok. Had a lot of flavor and good portion. Â If you like to eat meat, request for more as they give you a lot of noodles. The broth is super thick, and the pork chaschu had abit too much flavor, could be toned down a bit. Wait time was about 5 minutes on a Monday night, so wasn't too bad. If you like broth that isn't too thick, Tiger Den is a good place to go.
