Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I wish I would have opened this place, they are going to clean up. I have been thinking about how great it would be to have a true European Cafe in that area of town. The food is good, although they left the string on my porchetta sandwich, but they were slammed and I believe still working out the kinks of opening up. Overall the sandwich was ok, the porchetta could have used some spicing up. The eggplant is my new favorite side.  The coffee is actually really good. I got the iced Mocha, which of course has a fancier name at the cafe. Since moving down here from NY years ago, I can't tell you how many places have let me down with their Ice Coffee. This was fantastic, it was not too watery and not too creamy. Just well balanced. The fruit tart is different from what their local competitors serve in Houston, but it works. It is one of my two favorite fruit tarts in the city. I am not a huge fan of their cheesecake. The first bite is interesting, but I did not have the desire to eat any more after the first bite. Right now they are serving lunch from 11 to 3 and the menu offers up some interesting choices.  Do yourself a favor and check it out, but take note that it will be very busy during lunch time. Given time, I think they will move up to five stars. I truly hope they are considering expanding to a dinner service.
