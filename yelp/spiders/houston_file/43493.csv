Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So good. We came for breakfast during our stay in Houston. The pistachio croissant were so good! They are ginormous and the inside glaze/filling taste like macaron filling! We also tried the boston cream kugelhopf! Super sweet! We ended up leaving with bags of the pistachio croissant to take back home!
