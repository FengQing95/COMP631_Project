Kata Robata////This place was so delicious. The sushi was extremely fresh and creative. The sauces were very complimenting and everything was fused together perfectly. Their truffle oil was everything, do you hear me, lol. I enjoyed every single item I ordered and also reordered a couple. The staff was also delightful, which I loved.
