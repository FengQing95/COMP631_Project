Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I had high expectations about this place since most of my friends were talking so much about how great it was. I was not impressed at all by their coffee or bakery. The place is standard. It does not even have an original ambience. It is boring, small and can be crowded. I went twice thinking that maybe the first day was too crowded and I just got in a bad day. But the second time was the same: pretty average quality and overall experience.
