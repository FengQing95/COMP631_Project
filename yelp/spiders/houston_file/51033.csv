Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Really great food, very popular, and interesting drink menu. I was also really impressed with the advanced waiting software they used to keep track of people waiting for seats (the hostess was able to quote me exactly how long it'd been since I was quoted a wait time and what that exact time was).
