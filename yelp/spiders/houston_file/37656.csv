Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went here with another couple this weekend.  We had a 7:15 reservation, wasn't too crowded and we were seated quickly.  Server was good, and the items on the menu were well prepared.  The meatloaf cubes were absolutely delicious, and the pulled pork Hushpuppies were ok.  The Bosscat burger, however, was absolutely fantastic.  Probably the best burger I have ever had in a restaurant.  Wife had the beef short rib, which she enjoyed.
