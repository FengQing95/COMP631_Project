Local Foods////My boyfriend convinced me to strike out of our usual rut a few Friday's ago.  We were hungry at an unusually early hour and he suggested this spot - he's a total sandwich guy and me, notsomuch.  So it took a little convincing but I'm glad he was persistant.  We parked along the street at 24 hour fitness & made the short walk over.  It was love at first sight.  The space is brilliant - open and airy, modern but not cold.  Like walking into a beautiful market.
