JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Ivy - Thank you for your kind review. I agree that during peak dining hours, the clustering in the front can be trying, so I greatly appreciate your patience and resolve for sticking it out! To be honest, when we initially built JINYA-Midtown, we had some qualms that it might be too big, especially given that our NASA location, which was built first, seats about 65 versus 90 seats at Midtown. However, I am very pleased to hear our service and food meet your satisfaction. Thank you for your patronage and we look forward to seeing you soon!
