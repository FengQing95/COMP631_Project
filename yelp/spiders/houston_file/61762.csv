Baby Barnaby's////The wait was long (approx. an hour) but well worth it! My husband and I had a fabulous brunch! The orange juice was fresh squeezed moments before it arrived to the table. The salsa was very fresh. The food was fantastic. Eggs were cooked to perfection. Next time we will probably bring a small snack to eat while we wait as my husband became very hungry waiting. They were kind and accommodating to sit us in a booth. It was a wonderful experience and some of the best breakfast food I have had!
