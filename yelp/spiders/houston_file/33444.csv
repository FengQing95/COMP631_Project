Local Foods////This is my go to food in Houston. I'm never not in the mood for Local Foods. I always get the Crunchy Chicken, pasta and kale. The thing that always wins me over about this place is the pretzel bun. It's the perfect touch to the perfect sandwhich. The people who work here are always the friendliest.
