Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The only bad thing about this place is the parking! Well I guess there is always a long wait here too for brunch, but all good things come with time and the wait is worth it! But as far as parking goes, I've never gotten lucky and had a parking spot inside their tiny lot. 9 times out of 10 you're gonna have to find street parking in the neighborhood, but be wary of all parking signs! I've seen many people get towed here if you aren't careful. And wherever you do find parking, you're probably gonna have to walk a bit to get to the restaurant.
