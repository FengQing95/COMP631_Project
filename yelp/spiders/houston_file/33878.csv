Local Foods////In other updates: some sandwiches are slightly more expensive than they used to be (the duck and salmon are perhaps a dollar more). It is still well worth it. Service continues to be stellar. I am always amazed at how fast the food comes out of the kitchen and how consistently high quality everything is. Their menu is not extensive by any means but each item is well curated and well loved. Local Foods is sandwich nirvana and I hope they continue to make their delicious creations for years to come!
