Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Today was me and my family's first time at Snooze and the host at the front was just not as polite as everyone else. They did give us a wait time but we saw in two occasions that he sat table for 3 before us... (we too were table for 3) we had been here before those other parties. When I walked up to the other host she pointed out it was his mistake and when it was brought to his attention he brushed it off like he did not care. I believe first impressions count... I don't have interest coming here anymore and will be pointing out to all of our friends and families .... Â we didn't feel welcomed.
