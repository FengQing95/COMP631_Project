Local Foods////My personal Go-to at the restaurant is the crunchy chicken sandwich, and my favorite sides are the cabbage slaw, kale, and the quinoa. I don't really like beats because I think it taste kind of funny and has a strange texture to it, but that's just me. The sandwiches here are very well made and don't leave you with a feeling of disgust after you meal... which is very rare for sandwich/burger places!
