Uchi////By far my favorite restaurant in Houston the shag roll is to die for. They have social hour from 5-7 which is pretty cool because it allows you to try a lot of different things on the menu without breaking the bank and the alcohol specials during this time are defiantly a plus. You will need to make a reservation though but really not a big deal. This is a must try place seriously like Nike just do it!
