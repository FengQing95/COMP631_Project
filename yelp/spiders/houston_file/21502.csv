Uchi////Walu Walu- oak-grilled escolar, candied citrus, yuzupon, myoga, When you grill the escolar, just like searing it--it brings out a nice buttery flavor and with the candied citrus it just cuts down the rich flavor but does not mask it.  I think this gives a very different taste to escolar and if you're a big fan do not pass on it.  The only thing is that the texture is slightly tougher but not terribly.  This is because escolar itself is not as flakey as other fish.  My favorite dish that i think could compare to this is Kata Robata's miso cod.  Very soft and buttery, even though they are different fish. Those who appreciate that buttery rich flavor would enjoy it.
