JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen are very solid in that the broth, the food, and the noodles are all pretty good. There are a range of toppings to choose from, you can add extra noodles and extra soup at a cheap price. This is a great option since some ramen shops do offer refills, this caters very well to customers of varying appetites. I usually get the seasoned egg topping, which reminds me of childhood food memories and the egg also complements the ramen quite well.
