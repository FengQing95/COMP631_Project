Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Benny Duo - one word, heavenly! So very fulfilling with a good serving of perfectly cooked hash brown and healthy side of arugula. Smashed Avocado tasted fresh and nicely seasoned with smoked cheddar hollandaise. The balsamic glaze was a nice touch on the Bella Bella with cream cheese hollandaise. Eggs were perfectly poached.
