Kata Robata////First, the beef rice bowl with beef and onion, this is not your typical beef don. I am not sure what's the secret ingredient that makes it so tasty, but it's definitely good cooking. In fact, it was so good that I cleaned it up without feeling embarrassed in front of the client. The 2nd time was when I ordered the ramen. You can never find good ramen in Houston other than a handful of restaurant. Knowing that I am paying for such a price already, it did not disappoint. The broth is light but full of flavor, and the portion was good enough to last through the day until dinner time. Besides, I'm also trying to cut back on the portions of food I'm eating as I need to watch my weight. But enough about my diet as this is a review about Kata Robata.
