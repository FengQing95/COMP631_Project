Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////So management was great, and the waitress was cool. The food was a little bit under ok. I ordered the breakfast burrito but they ran out and it's understandable cause we came a little late for brunch. I then ordered the chicken fried steak which was a good portion size but lacked taste. My friend who was so excited about eating shrimp and grits ordered this but the appearance was different from normal shrimp and grits. I hope they had a different spin on the item but it just seems like it was tomato sauce on grits. Not appetizing at all. When different wait staff checked on us they saw the displeasure on our face but just asked to take the plate. The icing on the cake was my friend was still hungry and she asked for a slice of toast, she received the toast no butter just dry toast for two dollars. For a little service recovery they could have added butter and for the razzle dazzle some garlic. Nice atmosphere though.
