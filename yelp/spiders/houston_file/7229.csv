JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The restaurant is very clean. Clean lines, modern, and hip. The food is pretty good! So why 3 stars? Â It's a little pricy. You can get a bare bones ramen bowl for a reasonable price. But to add additional flavors it really adds up quickly. To a price for a dinner mean, at lunch.
