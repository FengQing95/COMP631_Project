The Pit Room////Overpriced and meh. What kind of bbq place doesn't have loaded potatoes? After hearing about this let down, I ordered a chopped brisket sandwich. Just a sandwich. It cost me $9. I would have probably paid $9 to just not be in such an anxiety ridden, busy line that I was herded through like the cow I was about to eat. You'd think for the price we'd be talking about a high quality sandwich. I've had much better, and have also had worse. Keep your expectations low and you'll feel better about the whole experience.
