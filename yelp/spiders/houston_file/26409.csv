The Pit Room////Best BBQ place in Houston! I've been to several BBQ joints around town and this is my new favorite. I live out of town but I will definitely try to make this a stop every time i'm here! We got "Feast No. 1" and 3lbs of crawfish. Brisket, turkey, sausage, pulled pork, and ribs were all perfect. The fact that they had crawfish was icing on the cake! You get 3lbs of crawfish (tossed in garlic butter), sausage, potatoes, mushrooms, and corn for $20! The ambiance of the place was great too.. There is tons of seating- we sat outside under a fan and were totally comfortable. Bar tenders were super friendly and helpful as it was our first time here. Patio is dog friendly too! Don't hesitate to check this place out!
