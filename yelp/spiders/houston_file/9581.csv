JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////You are correct that our broth is perhaps the most important aspect of our ramen. As such, we use a Refractometer to check the thickness and consistency of the broth with every preparation. If the broth clarity doesn't meet a certain grade, we don't serve it. Furthermore, we do receive occasional critiques regarding saltiness and oiliness of the broths. Please know our chefs can adjust the level of salt and oil at the customer's request.
