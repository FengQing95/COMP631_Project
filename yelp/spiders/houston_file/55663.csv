Kata Robata////Probably my favorite sushi spot on the road. Yes in Houston. Add to the awesomeness the ramen at lunch that is out of this world with the best broth I've ever tasted in a Ramen. Give the waiter and waitresses freedom to do whatever the chef thinks is best. Had a barracuda that was flash-fried that I would have never had before and was amazing. Tuna was out of this world. Legitimately the best sushi spot I have been to
