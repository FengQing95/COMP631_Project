Baby Barnaby's////This is place is normally pack on a Saturday or Sunday morning. It's location on Westheimer is pretty central, but the parking is pretty horrendous and there's no indoor waiting area for the sweltering heat of summer. Last time I was there, I tried the ham steak. It wasn't the greatest, but it wasn't bad either. My friend tried the chicken and waffles and seemed much more pleased.
