Kata Robata////I love, love, love Kata Robata and I'm surprised I haven't reviewed them before. We've ordered to-go several times since Covid started and they knock it out of the part every time! Sushi doesn't travel that well, but they do an amazing job packaging it. The quality of their fish is top-notch and it's worth the price. I prefer to eat on on their patio, but in the meantime, I'll keep ordering to-go when the craving hits!
