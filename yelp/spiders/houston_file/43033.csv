Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Awesome for amazing latte and cup cakes, other coffee deserts. One of the most popular coffee shops in Houston and montrose area. It has a nice young vibe to it. You'll see people studying/working on their laptops or just chilling and chatting here on the weekdays/ends. It's packed on the weekends. It's closed on Mondays which is a bummer but they are open on sat and sun which is kinda good.
