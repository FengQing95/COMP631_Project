Local Foods////Our go to place for sandwiches and yummy sides. Particularly dangerous that its also near the cloud 10 creamery. Every time we go there, the food is as good as the previous time. My favorite is the crab and shrimp sandwich with orzo salad. I've managed to take my son (who loves the orzo) but can't say I've seen any high chairs. Not that he ever stays in those though ! I usually wolf down my food these days. Sad fact. Anyway love their sandwiches and they probably taste better eaten slowly.
