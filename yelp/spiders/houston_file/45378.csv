Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is undoubtably the best bakery & breakfast spot in Houston. We pull out all the stops every time we visit--as in two breakfast orders, multiple pastries, and a latte or two. The chef's scramble is our go to-everything included is a 10/10. We got the French toast as well today, and while it was pretty sweet (lots of syrup included) it was absolutely delicious and the Chantilly cream and bacon were great additions. Our favorite pastries: almond croissant, kouign amann, and macarons. Make sure to visit earlier in the morning, the line gets long and they run out of popular pastries!
