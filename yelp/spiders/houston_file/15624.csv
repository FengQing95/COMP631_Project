JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for replying, that in itself is appreciated. For the example you asked for, I would say the worst experience happened just last month, the last time we went. Was an obscure weekday, no wait, later in the eve, not a lot of people there. We were immediately seated and then we waited, and waited, and waited. It was almost unbelievable, but sadly not surprising as we always seem to get stuck with a bad server/service, but not ONE person came to our table. We didn't even have anyone bring us water, our table was bare. For over 12 minutes.
