Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We went here with a party of 8 to celebrate a birthday dinner and it was one of the best dinner experiences we had with our wonderful waitress Kristina.She was very professional and friendly and made sure our group was well taken care of throughout the night.. Food was delicious and the drinks were awesome.. Chicken and the steak(fillet mignon) were cooked to perfection..
