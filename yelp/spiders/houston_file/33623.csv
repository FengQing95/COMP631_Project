Local Foods////If you're looking for fast food timing and farm to plate dishes this is the spot. Call ahead for lunch and the order is normally ready w/n ten minutes. I've had the shrimp and crab sandwich, and the famous crunchy chicken sandwich. I'm not a fan of kale but the kale salad is delicious. They have the best home made potato chips. They also offer desert options, and have some vegan choices. Very quaint space if you prefer to dine in. I will definitely be returning.
