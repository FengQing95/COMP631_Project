JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Perfect place for the ideal comfort ramen you would want on a cold rainy day. I love spice and HOT food! I ordered the Spicy Pork Ramen and I ordered the spice one notch up and it was almost perfect. Meat was tender and melts in the mouth. Great warm service. Very busy place.. so make sure to go early. Two thumbs up!
