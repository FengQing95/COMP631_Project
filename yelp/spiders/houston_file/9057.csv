JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////But if your preference is pho, and you're still keen to try our ramen, I would recommend ordering an "off-menu" item called Tokyo Yatai Ramen. It is prepared with a light, clear soup made from chicken, pork and vegetable broth. The broth is not cooked as long as our other broths.
