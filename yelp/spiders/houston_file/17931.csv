Uchi////Went to Uchi again, this time for my birthday.  The second time was just as wonderful as the first.  We went for happy hour on a Monday and arrived at 5:30.  The restaurant was nearly empty.  Happy hour ends at 6:30, so we had plenty of time to drink and peruse the menu before ordering.  The waiter gave us great recommendations on portions, as well as the daily specials.  Their raw items are so fresh and tasty.  I do think their pork belly products (roll and appetizer) could both use some improvement.
