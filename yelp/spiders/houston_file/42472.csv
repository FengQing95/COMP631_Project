Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have only ever tried their pastries, coffee, and orange juice. During my second visit there, I tried to order a salad but when I asked to swap the dressing for another dressing on the menu I was told no substitutions, so I left. I haven't been tempted to order anything off of their menu since, so I don't know if this policy has changed.
