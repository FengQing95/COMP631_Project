Uchi////The AMBIENCE is definitely romantic.  On a Wednesday night, mostly large groups occupied the tables, surprisingly, though there were a few couples at the bar.  Great place to take a date if you're willing to spend, which will be in the ballpark of $100/person. Perfect lighting and a perfect blend of Japanese and American cultures in the interiors.
