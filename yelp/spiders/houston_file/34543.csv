The fresh vegetables inside of the sandwich were crisp and refreshing, providing a nice contrast to the sambal hot sauce. The French bread was perfect, and hugged the delicious sandwich innards flawlessly. It's been about half an hour since I finished every bite of this sandwich, but I can't stop thinking about it. I have honestly NEVER had a sandwich this good. My mom ordered this sandwich as well, and she shared the same emotions as me. Yes. Eating this amazing sandwich was an emotional experience.
