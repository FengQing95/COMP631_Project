Uchi////Sushi chef Paolo rocked our world tonight in his headband with a cast of delicate mouth teasers. 50 shades of sushi doesn't begin to cover it. Forced to eat things I generally do not explore certain creatures like salmon, sea bream or skip jack but this was the exception to all of my rules and tonight there were none.....I took a break to explore the environment and discovered thoughtful touches in the powder room. Hair pins and sexy red tissue wrapped toilet paper adorned a quiet subway of relaxation from the crowd for a chance at dabbing the condensation off my brow from eating soooooooo hard.
