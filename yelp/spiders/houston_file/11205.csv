JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have been wanting to try this place and finally did it yesterday. The restaurant is very trendy, service is good. And the ramen is also pretty good. Parking is horrible though since the restaurant shares the same garage with 24 hours fitness and some other restaurants.
