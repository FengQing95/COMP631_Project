JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My first time eating in (I usually get to go) and the experience was so much better. I went around 11:30pm and it was crowded, the atmosphere was nice and the food was even better. I got the flying vegan harvest and it tastes so much better eating inside. The broth was nice and flavorful and creamy, the noodles werent too soft, had a nice bite too it, and all of the toppings really complimented it. I will definitely be going back to eat inside.
