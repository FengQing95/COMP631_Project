Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Most people will argue that the common bond is between mother and child. I will disagree. The most common (and strongest) bond is between man and food. It is written that man cannot live on bread alone. I propose we can, especially if the breads are offerings from Common Bond Bakery and Cafe.
