Uchi////Our waiter was nice that he offered our birthday girl's favorite dish as a special treat for her birthday from one of the 16 dishes, the disappointing part to me was there was no candles, no happy birthday words on the dessert plate, not even a small tiny touch on the plate that we could sing happy birthday to our friend's 50's birthday, very nice offered but nothing could compare with personal touch that could give a customer memorable moment.
