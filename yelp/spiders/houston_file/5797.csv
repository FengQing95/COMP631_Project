JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I came here around 9 pm on a weeknight, so there was not a wait. We ordered the takoyaki which was unique from other places because it had egg yolk on the bottom which made it delicious. We also ordered the fries with truffle ketchup. Eh, not very amazing or wow. I wouldn't order it unless I was really craving fries.
