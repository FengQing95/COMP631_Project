Kata Robata////Bad front desk  sevice and normal shushi/sashimi. I feel suck to get there at 6:30pm and was informed waiting time is around 20 mins. It is Tuesday!!! But I was already there, not necessary go.for somewhere else. After 20 mins waitting, I figured a couple came 5 mins  after me was led to a table but I did not! Then I asked front desk why. She told me the couple had resveration and came here for group party. But the couple just had a conversation exactly beside me, they said they did not make reservation and.worried about there is no.seat and wanted to leave. Also they  was just sitting at a seperate table without joining any body"s party!  I told the.front desk she was making a story.and.asked why? Then she told me to get a table for two, I need my friend  show.up together with me, then I will.have a table. Are you kidding me?? ??After I waited for 20 mins, you told me that policy?  If all people need to.show up to get a table, how come the first front desk did not tell me that? How come she said just wait for 20 mins? She could forsee the future and forcast  my friend would show up in 20 mins?  I will never come
