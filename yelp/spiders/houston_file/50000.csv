Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Ok, so I choose this place off reviews. When I came it was busy, but we didn't have trouble being seated. The parking lot is small, but I guess depending on the day you'll be able to find good parking. I liked the vibe of the place, lot of the workers seemed to be in the same age range as me, so that's cool.
