Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I have had one of their breakfast sandwiches before and it was a somewhat overwhelming amount of food. I am also NOT a fan of their hash browns. It comes in this perfect, short cylindrical mass of potatoes, and it looks all nice and crispy on the outside, but when you poke your fork into it, you get mush. All the ketchup in the world wouldn't be able to save their hash browns. Just... forget about the shape or however they're cooked to look like that cylinder. Just spread them on the griddle and make 'em crispy!
