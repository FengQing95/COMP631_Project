Kata Robata////Awesome food and awesome service!!! We had the hamachi jalape√±o dish and that was amazing. We also did the 11pc sushi combo and we loved the selection. The BEST dish we got was the Texas Beef skewers (robata), the meat was very tender and flavorful. We also had the dessert: green tea cake and the strawberry cake. All of our dishes was delicious. The prices were a bit high but definitely worth every penny!
