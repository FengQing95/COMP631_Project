JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Fun atmosphere - very urban. Probably not very kid friendly. The ramen was tasty and the small plates were very good - especially the pork belly bao. We did however order the chicken wing special that supposedly had a dry rub of sorts. The wings were flavorless. The rest of the small plates were good.
