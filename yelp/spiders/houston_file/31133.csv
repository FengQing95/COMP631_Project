Local Foods////There's a comical blog poking fun at generically named places in which their titles literally describe the service offered such as "Dentist" or "Dry Cleaning" - in that sense, Local Foods could make the cut because they literally deliver "local foods". Being a foreigner to the area I noticed this place had some great reviews. I sat in the dimly-lit ultra chill hipster lounge littered by the urban youth of Houston only to be greeted by a server with my order... wait... I just orded that. How did they whip that up so fast? This isn't freakin Jimmy Johns, I assure you. I don't even remember the name of my order, nor does it matter. What was happening in my mouth was nothing short of magic. Sandwich - vietnamese pulled pork - amazing. Rice, holy shit, how does rice taste that good. Salad - what kind of dressing is that you witchcraft chef, I didn't know my taste buds could react in such a violently pleasurable manner. After 20 minutes of awesome in my mouth I felt like I had spoiled myself to an over-priced meal, HOWEVER their prices are also insanely cheap. Why, God, can't all places be like this? I'll never know. What I do know is that if you've got a palate for foods hand-crafted by the gods then Local Foods is just for you. Rock on, Local Foods.
