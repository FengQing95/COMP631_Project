Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The Pistachio Almond, bright in its appearance, and in its flavor. Inside that flaky exterior is a wonderful surprise! Pistachio AND almond paste fills the center of the croissant, and is enough to not be overbearing, but enough to give extra flavors of pistachio to the croissant. The Almond Croissant is the bakery's real winner, and I am willing to bet that anybody who can appreciate a good croissant will agree. I have never had a better croissant, and I find myself thinking about this particular one every once in a while since I've had it.
