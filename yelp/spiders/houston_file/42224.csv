Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////1 star for the cute feel that his bakery had, but my partner & I were very unhappy with the food we had. Besides the fries, which were amazing & another reason why I gave another star. As an entree, I got the turkey sandwich, he got the fried chicken sandwich, & I also got a side of the fruit tart. My sandwich was overpriced as heck, & I could've made it at home! His sandwich was nothing special, yeah the chicken was cooked well but it was just chicken & bread & nothing else to it to justify the price or anything. He also find lots of tiny bones in it. What kind of chicken sandwich has bones in it? Don't even get me started on the fruit tart, it was hard as rock. They must freeze their fruit tarts for some odd reason then sell them. The fruits were hard & frozen, the tart itself was like cement, & not to mention, the fruit tart was HOT GLUED to the plastic thing at the bottom & you couldn't even eat the whole thing without eating glue? Wtf? What is the reason for this? If you're looking for a great fruit tart that's less expensive- La Madeleine is the place.
