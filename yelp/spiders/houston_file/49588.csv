Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I'm only putting 4 stars because if they get bad reviews they pay to push them to the bottom.  The food IS really great, but expect a 3 hour dining experience. You will always wait.  We even came once on a Monday and still had to wait an hour for a table.  I wouldn't mind it so much if it was just because they were that busy. It's actually because there bussing and service is unbelievable slow. Every time I have put my name in for the hour long wait, I've walked through the restaurant and counted 12-13 open tables.  Half haven't been bussed and half have. The problem is that these tables usual sit unoccupied for a about 10 minutes.
