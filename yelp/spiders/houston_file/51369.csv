Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The prices at Snooze are amazing compared to other aesthetic pleasing and upscale brunch joints in town that serve bland, sub-par food. I usually share with a friend and pay about $15 for myself every time and always leave with leftovers because the portions are huge. Parking and the wait sucks, but the food is so worth it. I highly recommend!
