Kata Robata////While the food was OK (I came for lunch) the service was HORRIBLE.  I sat at my table for over 20  minutes before I gave up and went to look for a server!  No one even said hello !   Three waiters looked at us and walked away before I gave up and took matters into my own hands.  When someone finally showed up there where no apologies.  She took our order and left.  From that point forward we saw a stream of other people who put things on our table. But our waitress was gone.   Now I realize that lunch can be busy but not all the tables are full inside (we were on patio) but people around us were receiving decent service.   Not sure I will go back or recommend it to others.  In Houston the competition is stiff.  Why eat here when I can have just as good one block up the road?  Sad thing is I over tipped simply because I don't want to wait on anyone to bring me change!!!!
