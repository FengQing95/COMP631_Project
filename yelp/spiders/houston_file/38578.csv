Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Food was good. Got the chilaquiles and the fruity pebble French toast. Nothing wrong with the food but the service was horrible. Waitress took about 10 minutes to take our drink order then after the food came out only checked on us once and only one refill The server in the maroon shirt with the Dr. Martens was very rude and when we asked for a bigger to go box he asked "do you really need all that" Â food does not make up for the horrible service
