The Pit Room////Lets start with the fact that I typically do not eat BBQ. This place is FANTASTIC. EVERYTHING here is awesome, ribs, brisket, sauce, okra, Mac and cheese, LITERALLY everything. I would recommend this place in a heart beat. When friends come to town I always take them here. Great atmosphere, amazing food, and you can take your food next door to the bar!
