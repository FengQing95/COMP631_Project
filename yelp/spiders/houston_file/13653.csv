JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We came here after escape room. We we're seated in less Â than 5 mins on Sunday lunch. Good service, small portion, average broth. My friend ordered the large beef but thought it was too small. Think this is good for a snack but will need two bowls to make it a full meal.
