Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////So, I wanted to give this place another try after a bad experience a few months ago. Â Once we were seated, it took about 10 minutes for someone to bring us water/ask if we wanted something else to drink. After about another 15 minutes after ordering two drinks from the bar, we were served our drinks. My sister and I split an appetizer, which was OK -- not great but not terrible. After a few sips of her bar drink, my sister noticed that her glass had lipstick on it (she wasn't wearing any, nor even chapstick for that matter). She sent it back and our waiter brought her another, clean glass at no charge. As we were getting ready to leave, we noticed that our appetizer plates that were already at the table when we sat down were filthy (we did not use them for our appetizer). Very disappointed as the vibe here is really cool. I will not be coming back.
