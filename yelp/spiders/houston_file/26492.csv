The Pit Room////The sides I ordered where the mac & cheese and the okra. The mac and cheese could've been salted a little more, but the saut√©ed okra was really good; cooked perfectly and I really enjoyed the flavor. It wasn't too salty or too bland. I do wish they would've done something with the bread. It was basically just a piece of slices bread placed on top of the meat. Maybe toasting it a bit would've helped give it a place within the whole tray instead of just using it as a meat garnish.
