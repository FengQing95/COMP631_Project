Uchi////This next one was where we diverged for a bit. She had the veggie mushi (tom kha, brocollini, mushroom, black garlic) while I had the walu walu (oak-grilled escolar, candied citrus, yuzupon, myoga). Her's was in this coconut broth that was just warm and sweet but had some kick to it. It went down really well. Mine was another one of those complex flavor mixes. I love escolar sushi and have never had it cooked. I definitely tasted the same flavor I did in the fish as sushi but the combination with the bright yuzupon, sweet/bitter candied citrus and crunchy salty myoga just put it over the top for me. Each component was great but when combined it was this delightful mix of flavors in my mouth.
