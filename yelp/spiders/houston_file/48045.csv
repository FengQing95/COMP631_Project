Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is a guilty pleasure. I only go for brunch on Fridays, and there is still a wait! Just understand thete will be a wait, once You accept it than you will be fine. Staff is always friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. Parking can also be a bit of a drag, but I've lucked out each time so it hasn't been too bad. I've ordered the snooze classic and the Bella! Bella! Benny. The eggs are cooked perfectly, bacon is tasty. If you come to snooze you have to order the pancakes. I order a regular old pancake...they are anything but regular. Pancakes at snooze are yummy. My friend ordered the pancake flight, pineapple upside down, sweet potato, and pancake of the day which was Smores. I always order the cold brew, it is so delicious. I've ordered cold brew from other restaraunts and get annoyed because it does not taste like Snooze's cold brew. Overall you will wait, but they serve coffee in the front while you wait or you can play a game outside...the food is worth the wait.
