The Pit Room////Looked up a nearby bbq place to downtown and this came up as a super popular place, so thought about giving it a try. I was worried that it'd be super busy, but it was 2:30 so the line wasn't bad at all! There were also a lot of seating options. Maybe not the best for super large parties, but groups of 4 is good. There were so many options on the menu, and I was very overwhelmed because everything looked good. I wasn't too hungry, so I just got one taco and two sides, which was plenty! The tacos are huge! I was super satisfied with my brisket taco and the Mac n cheese was heavenly. The cole slaw was a good addition to balance the meat. Would love to come back if I get the chance! (Also there is limited parking, so keep that in mind)
