JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Norma - Thank you for your great review. I regret that you found the Crispy Shrimp Balls too salty. I have spoken with the tapas chef and the kitchen-prep team to trace back the preparation and plating of this dish. I will post an update once I can get additional information. That said, please know that our standing policy at JINYA is this: If it's not great, remake! We hope everything on offer is met with the same appeal as you had for the Salmon Cilantro Sashimi. Thanks again, and we hope to serve you in the near future.
