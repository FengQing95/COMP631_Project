Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I'm also sorry that our brunch wasn't what you were expecting. I'll admit, our brunch isn't for everyone. We like to keep the energy level high with the DJ. We do have quieter seating towards the back of the restaurant. However, it's still pretty energetic there as well.
