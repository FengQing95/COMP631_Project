Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////When we came on Saturday, they had run out of most of the brunch items by 11am. We ended up getting the pain perdu and grilled cheese with tomato soup. I would rate both items 3 out of 5. Pain perdu was exceptionally sweet and one note. The syrup was starting to solidity before our eyes. The grilled cheese sandwich is large in portion but limited in originality and flavor.
