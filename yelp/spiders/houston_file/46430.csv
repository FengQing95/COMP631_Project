Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Besides all of the beautiful pastries that you see while standing in line to order at the counter, they have several menu items to order. I got the chef's scramble - 3 eggs with daily ingredients (that day they had mushrooms, spinach, and cheese), potatoes, choice of sausage or bacon, and choice of biscuit or toast. Wow was it delicious, and a lot of food. Get this only if you are really hungry...I wish I had been hungry enough to finish it all! Would recommend getting the toast because it's a nice thick lightly toasted piece of bread. I don't like things overly toasted, so this was perfect for me. I will definitely come back to try more meals and more yummy looking desserts and pastries soon!
