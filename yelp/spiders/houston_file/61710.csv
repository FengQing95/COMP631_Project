Baby Barnaby's////We recently went to Baby Barnaby's for brunch on a Sunday. The first tip I can give is to account for a long wait time. It's a rustic style diner, which is fine if the food is great, but the rancheros and omelette we got was just below average. The service was sloppy as well as we had to wait for a long time to order our food and they forgot to bring an item as well. We were not impressed at all and won't go back.
