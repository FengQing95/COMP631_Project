Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Right when I stepped in, I felt as if I'd walked into a cafe in Europe. The bustling lines and tables extremely close to each other, combined with the modern decor and architecture of the place, gave me the nostalgic feeling that I was back in London or Paris- I LOVED it. This cafe smells like heaven, and the pastries looked beautiful. Arrive expecting to wait in line, but grab a menu while you wait because it seems as though the items offered for brunch can vary.
