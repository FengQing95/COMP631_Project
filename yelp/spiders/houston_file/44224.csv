Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is my favorite bakery!!!.. I fell in love with this place the moment I walked in! The atmosphere was amazing and industrial chic! The staff was wonderful and very helpful! I loved every pastry! Wide variety of desserts as well as lunch! Bringing mom for her birthday!
