JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Man I feel really bad as I write this review but first, let me say the food was good but the service was questionable. My and my girlfriend got there around 12 got sat quickly which was perfect and it Â took about 10 minutes give or take to order because we were first timers. Our server was great with the detail of the menu and helping us order. We order 2 bowl of ramen and the shrimp toast. It came out around 12:50 almost 30-40 minutes for it to come out and it was kinda warm (still pretty good). We were told at the end of our meal that the kitchen had cut the pieces wrong and they had to redo it, if that was true I would have understand I just wanted to be informed.Then our ramen came out about 5-10 minutes after the shrimp toast (ramen had mushrooms after ordering no mushrooms). The food was great but I don't know if I would come back again. I probably would anyways because I like to try places twice before I cross them out
