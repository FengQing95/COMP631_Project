Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have given Common Bond a few tries, but only based on a few pastries. I'd love to try their food menu but they are always overcrowded, and outside seating isn't always ideal in the summer. I'm not rating it for that because they have so much space they can work with. The first time I went I liked it a lot. The macarons are really good. The pastry I had was the sticky bun. It was delicious. But the second time I got it it had a metallic, oily taste to it. The service is counter service, and it's so busy that employees can't see to customer needs. I ordered drip coffee to go and I thought it was coming from the coffee bar. So I stood there for ten minutes watching customers that ordered after me get their drinks. I then asked a barista about my drip coffee order and they said I needed a number which I wasn't given. Instead of helping me out, I was told I needed a number to receive what I paid for. It rubbed me the wrong way. The employee could have explained that my drip coffee was self serve by the window. There is a bit of a lack of consistency with some of the baked goods, too.
