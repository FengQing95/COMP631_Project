Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I watched one of those tv shows about food and it was about croissants so the next morning I had a massive craving for one.  I went to Common Bond.  It was OK, nothing to rave about. The ones at Whole Foods were about same if not a little tastier (not that those are gold standard either).  I tried a few other pasties too, same verdict. They are ok, certainly not worth waiting 15 mins for a latte for, and I visited on a weekday mid morning, after breakfast/before lunch!
