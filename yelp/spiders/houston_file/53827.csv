Kata Robata////However, I was saving room for the food. $45 for four courses. I went with the edamame hummus, octopus and arugula salad, kobe beef, beignets & root beer floats. The hummus was really good and spicy. Do they sell it for home consumption? Because they should! The octopus was grilled to perfection and wasn't rubbery or fishy at all. The kobe beef melted in my mouth and was beautifully seasoned and prepared. The beignets were a little too heavy for my liking and the root beer floats were yummy and adorable.
