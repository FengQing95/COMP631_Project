JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The bowl itself looked kind of small but as I progressed through my meal I realized that the portion was much bigger than anticipated. Â (Also be careful not to tip your bowl over -- their center of balance is not very grounded) I finished the noodles totally stuffed! If you order extra noodles for $1.50 and keep enough broth it's essentially another bowl, holla!
