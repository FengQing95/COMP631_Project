Uchi////Just go. Savor every bite. It's all delicious. We have had the six course chefs choice and also two other items (sake toro and the smoked yellow tail). The staff are all helpful and kind. Our waiter made great recommendations. We enjoyed every course. The chefs know what they're doing. The flavors they put together are amazing. The fried milk dessert is fantastic! It's recommended to make reservations. We went on a Sunday and the line was already 20 people deep when we arrived ten minutes before opening. There is complementary valet parking behind the restaurant. We didn't have cash for tip so we parked a couple blocks away on the street because there isn't a plethora of parking spaces close by. Also, this is a pricey place so save your pennies before going.
