JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Atmosphere: jinya is great for groups, dates, lunch, dinner, and late night food! It's very versatile. There are booths for two people, half booths for groups, a ramen bar at the back, and the middle has two giant communal tables for groups of varying sizes. Â The lighting is kind of dim, which is fine but sometimes at night the lightbulb above the booths get a little too dim and you can't quite read your menu. The servers are generally friendly, polite, helpful, and understanding. They do get busy maybe around 7pm especially on weekend nights, so go early or call ahead and ask!
