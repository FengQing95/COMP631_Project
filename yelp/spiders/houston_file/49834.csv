Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Stopped in on a Friday morning and parking was non existent. I ended up parking a few blocks away then a minimal wait inside. I had the Snooze Classic, it was a decent breakfest, but not really worth the hassle of the parking and wait time. Service was lacking as there was another wait to get service at the table, and then when I did recieve my food they left the bacon off my plate. Although they did quickly remedy the issue, it was yet another inconvience.
