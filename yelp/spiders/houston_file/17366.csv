Uchi////I know, hubby and I are probably the last know ITL's to go here but we finally made it on Saturday night.  Well worth it!  Everything we ate (we ordered a lot of different dishes) was awesome.  I especially loved the Spicy Crunch Tuna Rolls, the Tempura Ebi, the WaluWalu and the Tempura Onion Rings.  Everything just fabulous.  We had to try the Fried Milk based on recommendations--just okay, not great.  Can't wait to come back here again.  P.S.  Our waiter, Matt, extremely good and not bad to look at either!
