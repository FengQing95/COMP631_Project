Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have heard good things so I wanted to try this out.   I am a bread snob in rehab and this place heart my heart.  I will give a few stars for presentation - its pretty but...  I asked for a pistachio croissant and got almond.  Hello, this has happened before - ask for something and if you don't watch them they bag something else.  Annoying much.   Some of the breads are too sweet but that is by recipe and not but mistake.  Some people like overly sweet but darling you miss the nuances of the baker's skills.   I prefer another place near the Galleria but thats a personal choice.  The "icing" for me is the poor croissants looked so sad...artsy....but sad and overcooked.  I know the maillard reaction brings out flavor but overcooked is overcooked.  Whoa on the oven time cowboy.
