The Pit Room////Wait was worth it! We arrived to the restaurant with a line out the door. The staff was very friendly. The smell of smoke bbq was delightful! Since we didn't know what to get we ordered a little bit of everything. Everything was great! Must stop place in Houston! Definitely understand why this restaurant as on Texas Monthly Magazine.
