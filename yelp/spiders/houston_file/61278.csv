Baby Barnaby's////Place is fire. the wings and waffles are realllllly good. the chicken is super crispy and the waffles are thick!! the wait was about 30 minutes but it ended up being worth it because the food was good. the place is kinda small but that's apart of the aesthetic lol and service was amazing Â I recommend.
