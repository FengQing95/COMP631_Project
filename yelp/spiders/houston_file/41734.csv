Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Best Bakery in central Houston ! Excellent quality, my only reason for not giving it 5 stars, line moves slowly. If I want a loaf of bread I have to stand in a 20 minute line? Outstanding croissants, good coffee, very good sandwiches, bring money. You you haven't been here it's a must go!
