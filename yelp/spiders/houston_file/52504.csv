Kata Robata////We had the smoked duck salad - perfect ratio of tender duck breast, avocado and sushi.  We also had some robata items - the beef & asparagus was killer; again perfect ratio of meat to vegetable to sauce.  The sushi was divine as well, the yellowtail practically melted in my mouth.  The beef carpaccio is one of those dishes that if done improperly will be disgusting and probably leave you with a stomach ache for a a day or so.  I'm happy to report the beef was sliced perfectly and seasoned just right with the perfect amount of sea salt to add that crunch and saltiness.
