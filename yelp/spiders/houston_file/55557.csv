Kata Robata////I've been a member of Yelp since 2011, and I can't believe this is my first review! I love Kata and I love it so much that I sometimes enjoy coming here by myself. It's definitely my go to sushi restaurant. Kata has a great selection for happy hour and I enjoy everything on their menu as well as their full menu that include a daily selection menu as well.
