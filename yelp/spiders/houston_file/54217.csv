Kata Robata////Oh Kata, with over 20visits I can def say you have some amazing food. Go here for some REAL RAMEN! Coming for lunch? Better not leave without ordering the Kobe Beef bento box, a $teal for the amount of food. Their sashimi variety is extensive and delicious! Ambience is nice and you HAVE TO try the Plumification drink. Please fix your service so I can give you 5 stars!!
