Baby Barnaby's////For breakfast we had the Green Eggs and Huevos Rancheros.  I opted to make my Green Eggs vegetarian by trading out the real sausage with veggie sausage.  I also ordered a side of cilantro and salsa to add onto mine after stealing some from my man.  That salsa is smoky and delish!  I love this dish!  I felt good inside that I was getting so many veggies in my belly at breakfast.  While the huevos were not how I usually see them, my man loved them.  And that coffee - I never have two cups - but I did that day!
