JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////But it is what it is, it's just OK to me and I probably wouldn't come back unless someone really wanted it. I understand the prep of food is done prior, I.E. eggs, chasu. But my chasu was so cold, and I think it's because the soup might not have been hot enough to heat it fast it enough before it reached the table. Just to clarify, chasu, is pork belly, the fat on the pork belly? It's cold, it's really not appetizing.
