Uchi////Our waiter was great - very informative, but casual and not annoyingly pushy. Definitely gave more of an Austin vibe than Houston. He gave us the options of the tasting menus, he could suggest a diverse menu, or we could pick through and he'd help guide. We went with the latter and tried the Uchi Salad (super delicious and creative presentation, Hama Chili (yellowtail/orange/chili/ponzu deliciousness), Machi Cure (their version of "nachos"), Bacon Tataki, Spicy Crunchy Tuna roll, and Pitchfork roll. Yes, it was lots of food, but every single bite was amazing, the flavor profiles were so diverse and perfect, and the meal was very memorable. And we couldn't skip dessert - we had the "Fried Milk", which is a MUST. They describe the flavors as tasting like a chocolate chip cookie dipped in milk, and that was spot on. But it was so much more delicious than just a choc chip cookie & milk. The milk sorbet, the milk and dark chocolate layers - it was awesome.
