Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is definitely at the top of my list for breakfast places in Houston now. I have been a few times and gotten something different every time. Everything has been awesome, but their pancakes (any of them) are definitely a must-try. Be prepared to wait unless you get there super early.
