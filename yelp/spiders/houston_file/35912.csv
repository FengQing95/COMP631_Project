Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place is AMAZING! My boyfriend and I went for a Friday night dinner! Drinks were top notch and the food was AMAZING! He got the BC Lemonade, and the Fall Fashioned, with the Bosscat Burger! I got the Irish Rose and the Bosscat, with the 12 hour short rib with the Brussels sprouts! Â also, on top of the great food and drinks our waiter was fantastic! Victor was very helpful and was super friendly! 10/10 for sure!
