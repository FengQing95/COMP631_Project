Uchi////Sushi at a whole other level. The chefs special 6 course meal was perfect for two people to share. Bar was exquisite! The selection of wines and sake were amazing. The food was to die for. I don't even know what all we ate but it was amazing. The pork rib sushi was delicious as well. Fish was fresh from Japan! The atmosphere was great and perfect for date nights and groups.
