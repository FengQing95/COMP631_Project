Uchi////I ordered tasting menu of 6 courses after waiter strongly recommended it. I specifically asked waiter if tasting menu is adequate in amount for two people. He's confident we wouldn't be hungry. Tasting menu includes 2 cold appetizer dishes, 2 hot dishes, one roll, and one dessert. All are pretty tiny. Each dish is , in my opinion, overspiced. Not like an authentic Japanese good. If you look to party, this is a right place. If you hope to taste a real Japanese food, try it elsewhere.
