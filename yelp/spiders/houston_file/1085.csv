JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Closest ramen shop near the house.  I'm a fan of the Tan Tan Mien with a side of chicken or pork soup.  I press some fresh garlic into the Tan Tan Mien and some extra spicy bean sprouts and that is a meal for 2!  I like a little side soup, because the fatty in me feels like it's 2 different meals. The thick chewy noodles is where it's at.  The tonkatsu broth is delicious.  Haven't had anything bad in all my visits.
