Baby Barnaby's////The servers were friendly with the exception of mine who seemed to not want to wait on me.  It took a while to get me coffee, and then she seemed in a rush while taking my order.  The food was very quickly cooked and out to me.  It was very quick and good.  The waitress never ever stopped by, until I got another waiter to bring her over so I could get my check.  So overall good with poor marks for my server.
