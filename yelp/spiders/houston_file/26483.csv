The Pit Room////I'm pretty convinced this is the best BBQ in Houston. I've slowly made my way through most of the menu. You can't go wrong with the brisket and Mac & cheese. The brisket is so tender, you don't even really have to chew. My fianc√© also loves the frito pie. My nieces really enjoyed the tacos too! We've been here a handful of times, including a group of 12 for Sunday brunch-- it's never been anything less than amazing!
