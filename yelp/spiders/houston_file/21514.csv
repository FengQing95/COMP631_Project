Uchi////Okay, fatty tuna is great, salmon is great..Waygu beef is great, but just the source is a bit not that great...it's more like A one source which I never liked...duck is okay..last but not least is the fried milk. It's great but it can be better if the shell is not that thick, I was expecting something more crispy and thin instead of a "nutshell"...but inside is warm and tasty milky cream...yumyum! Overall good place for dating, small portion you can eat without losing style.
