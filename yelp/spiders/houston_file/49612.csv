Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////In addition to my cold brew coffee (absolutely hit the spot), I decided to get the Benny Duo (2 different half orders of benedicts).  I got the classic ham and then the chilaquiles.  Both were absolutely delicious and the hash browns were spot on in terms of flavor.  The portion sizes were also really normal, which I appreciated, and the benedicts were not doused in hollandaise sauce, which I also appreciated.
