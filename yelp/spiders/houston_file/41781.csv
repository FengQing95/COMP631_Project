Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Coffee was ok but the scones were cold. We heard them tell the people ahead of us that their stove/microwave was not working. We really wanted to like the place and be wowed by it but it was just another coffee shop. I will say that the decor and people watching was the highlight of the visit. May be we will try them one day when they can heat food.
