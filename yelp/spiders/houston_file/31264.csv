Local Foods//// They try to buy all of the food served here "fresh" and "local". Â This was the best BLT ever. Not just the the Bacon was so flavorful but the Panini style bread ....wonderful. I loved the Kale salad with pine nuts and some kind of private recipe dressing. It may have been healthy even but I DON'T"T CARE... it was fabulous.
