JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////When you're in Midtown and crave for some yummy ramen, I highly recommend Jinya Ramen Bar. It's a Â twist on traditional japanese noodle soup. I've eaten at this establishment twice now and I've always walked out with a happy belly. If you're visiting on a weekday, you won't have issues finding a table.
