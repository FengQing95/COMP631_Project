Local Foods////We go here often, and every single time it's fantastic. Last night we had the vegetable soup with matzo balls, which sounds less than exciting - but it was fantastic! All of the best elements of French onion soup, minestrone, and matzo -- a brothy, hearty soup with the ONLY matzo you should ever have. Most matzo soup is designed for the person with a cold: comforting and nutritious but assuming you have no sense of taste. The dough is usually just squishy. The taste and texture of Local's matzo is fabulous: slightly crusty and plenty of personality.
