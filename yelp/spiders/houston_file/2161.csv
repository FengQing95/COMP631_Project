JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First time here. Food was very tasty. BUT the restaurant was excessively cold. Almost freezing. It's was VERY uncomfortable. I saw other people around me that were obviously cold as well. I get that Houston is a hot city but there's is no reason to have it that cold in there. The service was not the best. We had three different waiters ask for our drinks and took quite some time to get our drinks. Then our food took a LONG time to come out. However, I noticed several people that were seated after us got their food before we did which was frustrating to see.
