Local Foods////$11 for a sandwich sent from the Sandwich Gods themselves and my choice of not one, but TWO sides?? I don't know about you, but to me, that's a steal. I got the potato salad and chips. They were good but not amazing, which makes me question why I'm giving them 5 stars now... but I'm so blown away by the sandwich that nothing else really even matters. I've heard only good things about the quinoa and kale, so I'll definitely be back soon and try those next time!
