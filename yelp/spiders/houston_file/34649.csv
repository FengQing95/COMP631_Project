Local Foods////I really and truly adore Local Foods. At first, I'll admit it wasn't what I was expecting. It caters to the mainstream without being mainstream at all- I think that is a hard business model to develop and I really admire Local Foods for it. My up-tight father and my hippie bffs all enjoy this place, which to me is a tell-tale indicator of success. If you don't believe me; try to find parking at lunch ;)
