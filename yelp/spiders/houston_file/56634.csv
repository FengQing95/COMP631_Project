Kata Robata////I've heard mixed reviews about this place, but in my personal opinion, this was an absolutely amazing experience with delicious food. This may also be attributed to the fact that I got to try the "Omakase", which is the Chef's choice of menu, and the fact that I got to sit at the sushi bar and watch them create everything in front of me and serve it to me as well.
