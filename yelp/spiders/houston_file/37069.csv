Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////If you are looking for a hip new brunch place, try this place out! As soon as I walked in the door I felt like the Ambiance was very trendy and hipster. The music was great but a little loud for me, I definitely would not want to go on a date here because of how loud it is. We got the carofe mimosa which gave us about two to three drinks each for three people.I got the divorced eggs which had the two poached eggs red and green salsa and black beans and chips. Everything was made well and the flavors were wonderful. My friend had the hash and it was delicious! The potatoes were cooked well and the flavors were on point. My other girlfriend had the tots with cheese and jalapenos and the fried egg on top. It was a bite that was more than enough, it was more like a meal actually! I think that was my least favorite just because the amount of cheese was overwhelming for me. The service was wonderful and the whole atmosphere was great.
