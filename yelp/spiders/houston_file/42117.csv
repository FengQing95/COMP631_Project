Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I ended up ordering a croissant (which is definitely Texas-sized) and a Vanilla Latte. The croissant was delicious, very flaky and easily the size of 2 regular croissants you'd get at a grocery store. I enjoyed my Latte, but it took quite some time for my coffee order to arrive at my table.
