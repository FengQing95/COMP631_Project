JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My only criticism, the "seasoned egg" sounded appealing to me as I love deviled eggs and thought it might be something like that. No, it's just a large hard boiled egg for an extra $1. So yeah, don't bother with that unless you're really craving a plain old hard boiled egg.
