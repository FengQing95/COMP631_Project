JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Zoe - Thanks for your review. Our "Irrashai" greeting can be a little overwhelming, but it's an integral part of our corporate culture here at JINYA. As a Japanese company that came to the U.S. several years ago, JINYA added several service customs that you will find in Japan today, namely, and in almost every business, staff are trained to yell the "Irrashai" greetings to show their enthusiasm and genki spirit. Genki (元気) is a common Japanese word that means "energetic, lively and healthy." Thanks again for your business, and we look forward to serving you again soon.
