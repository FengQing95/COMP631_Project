The Pit Room////Definitely some of the best BBQ in Houston.  It's seasoned and smoked very well.  I'm not even a ribs person, but I ate the mess out of the ribs.  I would certainly skip the potato salad.  they need to hire someone's grandma to whip up the tater salad, because it lacks seasoning and the potato chunks are not soft enough.  The beans are spicy and AWESOME!!  The white bread is blah.  They should sell the jalapeno cheese bread like Goode Co.  The brisket taco is very large, but it should be for the price.  The homemade tortilla is a nice touch, but aside from the meat, there is some essential flavor missing.  I can't name it, but I know it's missing.  All of the fixin's are PERFECT!!  You can't go wrong with homemade pickles, scotch bonnet pepper sauce, and that awesome bbq sauce (that you really don't even need, because the meat is so good by itself)!
