Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////FOOD: shrimp and grits are outstanding.  I order this dish often at other places, and they do a great job of it here.  Very flavorful.  Salmon salad was tasty; fish was fresh.  We tried the burgers as well. First time, they were great.  One other time the meat seemed undercooked or older, but there is definitely some inconsistency.  Generally, I think their burgers are a solid choice; however, they are really missing a regular French fry side.  Their wedge fries are underwhelming: overcooked, too big, no flavor.   We tried their fried potato salad as a side - solid.  But you really need fries with a burger.... just saying.
