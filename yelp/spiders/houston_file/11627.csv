JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Wow this place has changed a lot... sad face..  the menus totally different and they took off my favorite  ramen.  When I went in by myself and ask for a seat they suggested I sit at the bar but it was a freezing wind tunnel... so I asked to sit in side the restaurant.. looking for comfort food and to do some reading..  but now when you walk in they shout at the top of there lungs then all the employees shout back ... extremely unnerving and it pretty much ruined my meal. Sorry don't think I'll be back ....
