Kata Robata////Food - excellent. We ordered the Madai with Truffle and the Lobster and Crab Ramen off of the daily specials and the Spicy Tuna Roll, Texas Himachi Roll and Miso glazed Black Cod offbof the dinner menu. All of the sushi was fresh. The cod was my favorite - prepared to perfection. Nice and moist and flaky with crispy skin. The Lobster and Crab ramen was creamy and decadent with big pieces of lobster. The Texas Himachi Roll was the only dish that could have used some additional flavor. The waiter brought us a blueberry cake for desssert for our anniversary. Very nice of him. I thought I was full but we devoured the dessert. Not too sweet and was perfect with the Earl Gray ice cream.
