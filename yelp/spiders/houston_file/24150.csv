Uchi////Service was really good! Our server did a great job explaining the menu and ways to eat certain dishes. I will say very high quality fishes and meat. I can see the chef puts in a lot of attention and details in each slice of fish/nigiri.The hot rock wagyu was a tad disappointment as i was expecting more from it but it taste only a bit better than your average slice of beef. Favorite dishes and I highly recommend to give them a try is the wagyu beef nigiri, hirame cold dish and the foie gras nigiri! DEFINITELY THE FOIE GRAS
