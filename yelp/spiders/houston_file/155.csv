JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We got the bao (ok, but you can skip it and get better elseswhere in Houston), and takoyaki (not crazy about these). What saved the meal was the ramen, of course. I had the Tonkotsu black, everything in that bowl was gone, very flavorful. Next time I will skip the apps and dive into ramen. Very cozy spot too, we went late on Saturday night and were immediately greeted and seated. Would recommend.
