The Pit Room////Food:  We ordered 1/2lb beef brisket, half chicken, mac and cheese and the potatoes salad.  The beef brisket was very flavorful, tender and not overly salty.  The half chicken was flavorful, but the white meat was fairly dry.  The mac and cheese was mediocre, thin and runny.  The potato salad was better, flavorful, but nothing earth shattering.  I'd definitely come back to try some of the other meats.
