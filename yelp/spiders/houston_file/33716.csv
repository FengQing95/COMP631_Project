Local Foods////It is refreshing to see so many vendors represented in their ingredient's list.  Some of my favorites, too!  Bee Wilde Honey, Hatterman's, Texas Hill Country Olive Oil, Slow Dough, to name a few.  The space is industrial, but refined.  It's open and bright.  Oh, and they have a counter full of salads and a menu of soups, salads, and sandwiches.  It's the perfect lunch spot.
