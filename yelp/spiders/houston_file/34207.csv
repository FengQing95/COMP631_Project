Local Foods////Loved the crunchy chicken!  The flavors in this are amazing.  Definitely a little on the pricier side of gourmet sandwiches though.  The sides are good but they should change it up once in awhile.  I've tried all the sides multiple times and wish there was a bigger selection.  Not the best kale salad I've had though.  But the line moves quickly and you get your food fairly quickly.  Just ridiculous to pay $30-40 for sandwiches for 2 people.
