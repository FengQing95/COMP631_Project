Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love desserts and patisserie treats. Before this opened, Houston was lacking in the gourmet patisserie division. I've been here a couple of times and ordered a variety of items. I have no complaints to any of the treats I've eaten. The desserts here are great. It's definitely good for Houston's standards. The treats are not overbearingly sweet, they are just right. May be a bit pricey for some, but patisserie treats take a lot of labor.
