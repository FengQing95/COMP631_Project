Kata Robata////The amberjack and foie gras is something I ALWAYS get when I go because the foie gras wrapped in the amberjack just melts in your mouth. The oil brings out the sauce, and if you add some of the greens on the side, it gives it a light crunch which is superb and definitely recommended.
