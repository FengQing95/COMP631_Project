Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I must say I was shocked by our experience here. We went for my husband's 30th birthday dinner on a Tuesday night which was not busy at all. The waiter took about 15 minutes just to greet us. And then another 10 just to bring us water....Never were we asked if it was our first time here or anything. The food was okay but nothing too crazy and the same for the drinks we ordered. We were told that our fries would take a while because they were made but the cook did not like how they came out. Which we appreciated but they didn't even come out until after we were already basically don't with our meals. Although I would possibly try it again here for brunch as the reviews for brunch seem better than dinner here. They had a whiskey room which was cool to check out, but I guess we were expecting more. I would've loved to try a special drink made with whiskey or hear about a popular item on their menu something to have made our experience a little better.
