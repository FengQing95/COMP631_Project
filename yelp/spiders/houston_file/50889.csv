Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////EDIT:  I am a little too slow to post this but i just realized now that i never followed up, and that aint right!  the good folks at snooze more than made up for the mistake.  they comped me a free one, and got the order perfect.  it was delicious!  i asked them about the possibility of running out of soyrizo, and evidently, it CAN happen because they get their stock in every day.  given that this is one of the few places you can get a vegan breakfast ... aaaand ... yes, it is possible to run out of soyrizo!
