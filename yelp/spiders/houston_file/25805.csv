The Pit Room////Love The Pit Room! Best bbq in town! I always get the three tacos special. The brisket is divine and the chicken is yum-yum! The pulled pork is good, too, but I stick to brisket and chicken tacos. I looked up "best bbq joints near me" and The Pit Room was the third one I tried. The other two places were not good at all. The Pit Room restored by faith in Houston eateries!
