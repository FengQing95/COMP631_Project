Uchi////* I say "probably" because there are some people who are entirely trapped inside their own (mis)conceptions of what a "Japanese" restaurant should be.  You'll notice in the reviews that many, not all, of the lower star ratings are from those disappointed by the unconventional food offerings, above average cost, or long wait to get in.  You've been warned: it's unconventional, expensive (but totally worth it) food, and you'll have to wait if you plan poorly.  If any of those are things you don't like or you are closed-minded about food, then don't bother taking up table space.
