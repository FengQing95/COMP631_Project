Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I would recommend not getting coffee here. We got an iced lavender latte to share, and it wasn't mixed well at all. The flavoring was just off. I've actually had several people tell me they don't ever get coffee at Common Bond, so next time I'll stay away from that.
