The Pit Room////To start, I do think this is the best bbq in Houston. Delicious brisket, pork and beef ribs. Mustard potato salad, beans, turkey EVERYTHING!! Unfortunately we had a negative experience on Father's Day. Placed an order ahead of time (days before) for food to be ready at 12. Then sat in the parking lot for over an hour and a half for the food to be ready. I understand they were busy but an hour and a half wait time when I ordered ahead is extreme. They need a more organized system for pick up- maybe cutting off orders at some point? It was hectic to say the least. Additionally the woman who appeared to be in charge of the drive thru was being rude to the other staff who were working SO HARD for the customers. She also was wearing a mask under her chin or not on at all.
