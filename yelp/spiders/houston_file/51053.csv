Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Honestly the wait here is long lol but it's well worth it . I had the avocado benefit and I shared a pancake flight with my cousin. We had to take so much food to go because it was so much! The mimosas were great very light and refreshing and the coffee was phenomenal!!! Our waitress was so sweet and bubbly, I remember she had colored hair but she was the sweetest .
