JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The spicy chicken ramen (SCR) is a crowd favorite as one of the most accessible offerings since most people are generally familiar with - and a fan of - at least one of those things. Just like how Dave Attell wanted to name his child Pizza Pussy Santa since everyone likes at least one of those things and the leader of the free world likes grabbing at least one of them. I like this way of thinking because it is true and transparently honest. For example everyone likes at least one of the following: gay porn, kindness from others, and free money. Everyone also likes at least one of the following: kittens, the Bolshevik Revolution, and clean water.
