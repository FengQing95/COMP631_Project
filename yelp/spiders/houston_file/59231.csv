Baby Barnaby's////I had the migas - scrambled eggs with chiles, onions, tomatoes, cheese, and tortilla strips.  Tasty, although I was hoping the tortilla strips would be a bit more crispy.  Came with potatoes - fried crispy little things I dunked in the salsa.  The light of my life got the green eggs - eggs scrambled up with spinach, artichoke hearts, and cheese.  Had a bit of that and it was excellent.  Coffee was fine - nothing remarkable.  Freshly squeezed orange juice very tasty.
