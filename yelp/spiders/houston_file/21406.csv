Uchi////And right before this one I was afraid that we were going to be hungry because A LOT of people said that the portions would be small and you'd be left hungry. However this omakase was perfect as is. But I didn't know we would have another dish coming and so I ordered some sushi and that definitely pushed me over. So to those complaining about portion size, I don't think were ordering the right things. Or maybe do the tasting because it guides you through a whole coursed meal.
