JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Came here on a Friday night and the place was popping. Our wait was about an hour, so by the time we sat down, we were ready to order and inhale our food! The food came quick! Ordered the Tempura Shrimp, which tasted more Chinese (think honey walnut shrimp with a touch of BBQ) than Japanese. Now, I have to say I'm usually not big on ramen, but I was a fan of their Tonkotsu Black Ramen. The egg was soft boiled (but not runny) and perfectly seasoned, the noodles were perfectly cooked, the pork was tender and tasty, and the texture of those black (mushrooms?) added a nice crunch to my meal. I've been cutting down on sodium so my only complaint is that the broth was a little salty... but that's not uncommon for ramen.
