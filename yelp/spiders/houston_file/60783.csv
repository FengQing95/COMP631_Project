Baby Barnaby's////For those who've never been to Baby B's, here are a few pointers: Do pay attention to street parking signs; tow trucks lurk on any given corner. Head straight to the clip board and sign in for a table--don't wait for a host to approach you ... and don't be too turned off by the size of the crowd on weekends. Tables turn faster than you think. While you wait, grab some complimentary coffee that's stationed outside, and just enjoy the peaceful views of Montrose.
