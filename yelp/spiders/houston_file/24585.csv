Uchi////My girlfriend and I came to Uchi to celebrate an exciting promotion. WOW were we impressed! We ordered a bottle of sake and split the 10 course omakase chefs tasting menu. Every dish was incredible and took us on a culinary journey through all tastes of the palate. Our server, Boothe, provided an astounding amount of information about our courses and was able to recommend specific dishes when we wanted to try something new. A wonderful experience... would highly recommend for any special occasion!
