Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is the real deal! The food is incredible and the staff is super friendly! Everything we've had here was delicious. My favorite so far is the soft scrambled eggs. My husband loves the beef and grits and says their grits are some of the best he's ever had. This place has quickly moved to the top of our breakfast places in Houston!
