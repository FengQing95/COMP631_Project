Local Foods////Went in around lunch time on a Tuesday (today) and was decently busy. Ordered the crunchy chicken sandwhich with chips and fruit, was absolutely amazing. So fresh and delicious and filing. Two people could've split it. Was probably the best lunch I've ever had, and will be coming back again this week!
