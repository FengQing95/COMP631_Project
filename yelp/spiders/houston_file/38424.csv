Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We ordered our entrees next. I got the beef short rib which just fell apart when eating (no knife needed) it was so good!!! The other people in my party got the shrimp & grits, cajun brick chicken, and the barbecue porchetta sandwich. We also got a side of fries for the table. As far as I know, everything tasted great. I didn't taste them myself though.
