Uchi////I have been to Uchi and Uchiko in Austin for their sake socials but wanted the full dinner dining experience and boy did Uchi Houston deliver! I brought my boyfriend for his birthday and we were both really pleased with our amazing food and the incredibly attentive waitstaff. For a busy Sat night, the staff made it a priority to go above and beyond to meet our needs. They even surprised my boyfriend with a delicious dessert on the house. My only complaint is I made the reservation over month in advance and we still had to wait 25-30 min but gratefully, the rest of the night more than made up for that.
