Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If this is your first time at Common Bond get ready for a long line, but let me tell you it is time well spent because their vanilla latte and pastries are amazingly delicious! We ordered the Blackforest Cheesecake and Espresso Mascarpone and they tasted freshly made and just so good overall.
