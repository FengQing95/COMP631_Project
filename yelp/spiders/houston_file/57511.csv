Kata Robata////The food is fantastic; however, my last visit for my birthday, I do have some health and sanitary concerns. On my last trip (two days ago), I decided to come here for dinner. I didn't make reservations so I had to sit at the bar. I honestly hate sitting at the bar because I watch closely at what all the chefs do. For some reason, people have this notion that when they wear gloves, then that is sanitary. It's not when you are literally touching everything with the same pair of gloves. For example, I watch one of the sushi chefs do many tasks with the same pair of gloves on. He cut clams, he used the cleaning towel for the counter, he touched containers below and above the counters, he used the same gloves to pick up/clean scraps from the counter, he touch different kinds of raw fish, one point he also touched his face (only once though), and he also used the same gloves to slide his fingers over/across the salmon sashimi so that the juice can soak in it. Never at any point did I see him wash his gloves or switch gloves. Watching all of that is disgusting. I'm the "don't see it, don't care" type of person, but when I saw that I don't know if I'll order some of the dishes I've seen. What if there was bacteria from the cleaning towel that you used and transferred it onto my salmon when you touched it?! This is just one example from one of the sushi chefs. For such a fine dining restaurant, there should be a better protocol to prevent cross contamination and for health/sanitary concerns.
