Uchi////What I absolutely loved was the walu walu AKA the butterfish. It comes in a bowl of liquid gold and you just don't want to stop eating it. The yuzu flavor is just enough to the point where it's not overwhelming. The citric notes really do wonders to the buttery fish which has a melt in your mouth consistency. The duck tom yum is very yum yum. They prepare the broth separately and is poured table side upon the delivery of your soup. I mean it's just not another duck, it is duck confit after all.
