Kata Robata////In any event, our table was ready in about 15 minutes, and I of course couldn't resist ordering a calamari appetizer. The portion size was good, but the batter was a bit too thick; I like to know I'm still eating squid, but it was lost in the midst of its crispy shell. The Asian dipping sauces that it came with (no marinara in sight) were excellent, as were those that were served with our sushi order. Tons of fresh sashimi and traditional rolls adorn the menu, as well as specialty rolls like the Caribbean Roll we ordered: Lobster, spicy tuna, mango, and avocado, sprinkled with roe and drizzled in unagi sauce. Exquisite. We also got a couple of standards like the Crazy Roll with shrimp tempura and the Spicy Salmon Roll, which were great in the tangy mustard blend, the spicy sambal chili sauce with a hint of ginger, or a thin ponzu with scallions.
