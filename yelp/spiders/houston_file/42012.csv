Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Favorite place for pastries in Houston. Order the fruit croissant, which changes on a daily basis (Choc cherry, strawberry pistachio, etc) and never disappoints. The place is usually crowded and tables are close together/communal. I've met some nice people there! Usually as I gaze at their food contemplating if I should ask to try a bite...
