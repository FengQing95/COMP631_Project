Kata Robata////As another reviewer mentioned, a price of a night here could vary widely, depending on if you come during happy hour and how many things you buy/drink, so it could be a good place to meet with coworkers after work (there were people dressed down, including in scrubs when we got there) or to celebrate (there were several people dressed up as well).
