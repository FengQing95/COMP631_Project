Local Foods////the menu here is pretty small but that's probably a good thing for me because i'm so indecisive. they mainly have a selection of sandwiches and a few salads, along with sides and two choices of soup. they also have a couple desserts and a good selection of unique bottled drinks like strawberry basil kombucha.
