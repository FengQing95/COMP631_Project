Kata Robata////For the robata, we went with the ribeye kushiyaki was actually my biggest disappointment.  Not because the food wasn't delicious--it was.  Actually, it may have been the best tasting thing we ordered.  However, it was almost stone cold by the time we got it.  Okay, that's an exaggeration, but it just doesn't make sense for the robata to not be piping hot.  We ordered it almost as an afterthought when we received our appetizer, so I'm wondering if our waitress just forgot about it and it sat in the kitchen for a while.  Nevertheless, that was the only major disappointment in the evening.
