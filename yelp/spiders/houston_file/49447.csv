Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food took almost an hour and a half which is crazy ridiculous. Turns out the waitress had forgotten to put in our order. So we finally got our food which I can't even remember what we ordered because by the time we got it we were ready to leave. She comped our food and we still paid for the drinks, but wasn't impressed.
