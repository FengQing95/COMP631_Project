JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went here around midnight on a Friday night for a ramen craving and was not disappointed. We were told that there was a 20-30 minute wait but we got a table in no time. Our server was very nice and attended to us accordingly. We ordered Brussels sprout tempura for an appetizer then we got the spicy miso and Tonkotsu black ramen.
