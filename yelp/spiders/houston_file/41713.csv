Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My favorite pastry is the kouign amann. It's a pastry that looks upside down with caramelized sugar on top. The sugar will stick to your teeth. The kouign amann is about $4. There is not enough parking space for everyone so you have to find street parking. Be ready to wait in line outside that will continue whenever you get inside. The store closes on Mondays. And try to get there early bc some of the pastries will run out.
