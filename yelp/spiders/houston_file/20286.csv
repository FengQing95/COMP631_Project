Uchi////A couple of my favorite things was a cold sake that I ordered. Interesting because it came in a glass in a little wooden box and the box was filled with the overflow of the sake. Wasn't sure how to drink it but ended up drinking from the glass and then poured the content of the box into the glass to finish. I like feeling like I got "extra" sake, lol. As for food, one dish that sticks out is the one where they bring out an incredibly hot stone with slices of top quality rare beef for you to sear on the stone to your liking. I felt like the meat just melted in my mouth...sooooo good!
