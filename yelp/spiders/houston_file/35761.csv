Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Their menu is full of great Southern favorites. Pimento cheese, shrimp and grits, and all tweaked to modern day perfection. I opted for the Bosscat burger which was great. I am a foodie that cooks almost everyday and I recognized that they don't over-handle the hamburger after it has been ground. I prefer this. It makes for much juicier home-style burger. So pieces of the burger did fall off, but That's just part of the juiciest burger experience. (At an 11th St. Heights restaurant, the burgers were pressed into hockey pucks. Very hard to swallow or enjoy. That place is now closed. I wonder why.)
