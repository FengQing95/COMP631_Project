Uchi////I was expecting this place to be good, but not great due to the hype; however, it was as good as everyone described. The food was fantastic, unique, beautifully presented. The service was good, but not stellar. Our group of 5 was seated just after 5:30pm and left around 8:30pm. There were a few lags in serving of dishes, but each new one that came out left us wanting more. Try as much as you can, then come again and try some more.
