Uchi////My man and I arrived and were soon seated at a table of 10 with other diners that we did not know. All pairs sat across from each other and we soon made friends with our dining companions surrounding us. We ordered some wine from our wonderful servers and then we were then served one of the most amazing meals. The theme was local, fresh, light and summery.
