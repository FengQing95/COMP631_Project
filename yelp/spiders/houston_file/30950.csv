The Pit Room////Actually one of the best places we've been to since we've been in Houston. The barbecue was SOLID! Love the meat it was very filling as well and an inexpensive. The corn was a favorite for my husband along with the barbecue sauce we both love their barbecue sauce!!! Potato salad was very good to me well seasoned. There was a line when we arrived but it moved fairly quickly. The macaroni and cheese just wasn't a favorite for us! The only thing we didn't love so much. We also got brisket tacos, they were about a seven out of 10 but we understand that tacos aren't their specialty barbecue is and that's what's amazing!!!
