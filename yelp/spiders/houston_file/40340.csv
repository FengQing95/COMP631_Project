Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Made reservations for brunch and was sat immediately. Wasn't aware of the 1.5 time limit at the table but we were out in about an hour. Could be important to know depending on who you're going with! Parking was difficulty. We had to go claim our table so we were not late while the other half of our party joined us 10 mins later and ended up parking 2 blocks over. I'm curious if this was due to people waiting without reservations. Food and drinks were amazing! Will be back!
