JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi HH - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry you did not enjoy your meal with us. We realize our ramen isn't for everyone, but if you're ever dissatisfied with any of our offerings, we would truly appreciate the chance to offer you something else, or remove the items from your tab. Customer service is our number one priority, and we take great pride in our work. Otherwise, could you offer more specifics regarding our servers who "don't appear friendly." Can you provide the name of your server, or his or her description, and how he or she behaved, according to your observations?
