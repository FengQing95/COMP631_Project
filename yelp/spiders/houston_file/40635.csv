Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We went one Saturday for brunch with out a reservation and unfortunately we were turned away. We made a reservation for the following Saturday, and when we came back, we were able to be seated. The kitchen manager came out and told us that there was a note on our reservation, that we were there the previous week, and that we had travelled from Hockley, and he brought out the most delicious waffle, saying thank you for coming back. This place is awesome. The food is great and we had a great brunch
