Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We went here before covid.  I guess it's not their fault that it's so crowded, but I wish parking were better and we didn't feel so crowded inside.  The place was packed.  Servers were great, though, and so was the food.  I think it's just a symptom of the Heights being overcrowded.
