Uchi////Uchi's Desserts are as expected from any high end resturant. I tried the foie gras candy bar and fried milk, and can definitely only reccomend the latter. The foie gras candy bar, while not bad, is akin to an icecream bar with a layer of cake on the bottom (maybe slightly reminicient of foie if you try really hard to recall the taste when biting into it). The fried milk is more unique, and has several components including a delicious salted fudge and fried condensed milk balls that all work well together for a few delicious final bites to your meal.
