Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We wanted to give Snooze another shot to impress! Today we got there at 8:30 to beat the rush... And still waited 20 min before we grabbed a seat at the bar. I had the classic breakfast and a blueberry pancake and hubby had the breakfast pot pie. We had to send his food back because it wasn't warm, and my food was cool. We are big foodies, but decided this place isn't really worth our money and time. We won't be returning. I would much rather go someplace with amazing food, service, and not so long of a wait. Peace out Snooze! You are overrated
