Afterall it is covered in some buttermilk ranch sauce. The sandwich has nut encrusted chicken cut into pieces, covered in buttermilk ranch, topped with tomatoes, lettuce, and this amazing semi sweet pretzel bun, which gives this satisfying soft bite with an added crunch factor. Sweet and salty lovers must try this.
