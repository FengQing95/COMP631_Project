Local Foods////I remember trying Local Foods for the first time years ago and strongly disliking it (think I had a Garden Sammie). My friend convinced me to try their Crunchy Chicken with their hot sauce and it changed my life. I'm addicted to it now along with the yummy pretzel bun it is served on.
