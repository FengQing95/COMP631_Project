JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Mind you, I was hungover and sick to my stomach. Usually when this happens I am very mindful of what I eat so I mean ramen should be ok. Well it turned out it was way better than I expected. Not only did I manage to eat I was able to finish the entire thing! Definitely proved me wrong to assume ramen was just a hippy tread. Definitely recommend any nonbelievers!
