The Pit Room////As far as the atmosphere, it's about what I would hope for in a barbecue place - lots of country & western music playing on the sound system (which should be required at every BBQ place, especially Johnny Cash!), wooden seats and tables, and a wood porch that opens to the ice house next door. For some odd reason, they thought a flat-screen TV in the main dining area would be good. Fine.
