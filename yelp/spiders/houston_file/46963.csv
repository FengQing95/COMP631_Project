Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I never want to queue up for a table at a restaurant but heard so many good things I kept trying to get in....never less than 45 minutes which made me turn around and leave. I was lucky on Friday afternoon to walk straight in and get a spot at the bar. The food was superb and well priced. Worth all the hype but unfortunately not worth a 45 minute wait....
