Baby Barnaby's////Yum!! Such a great brunch spot...I love coming here. I've been enough times to have the menu memorized, which means I've come to settle on getting the Bob's healthy plate every single time now since it's my favorite thing. I usually sub veggie sausage in for the chicken apple in order to make it veg, and it's delish! And yes I can eat six full egg whites...honestly I could probably eat eight of those super fluffy perfect things!! Everything else I've tried is good too...including pancakes, green eggs (with egg whites like I like 'em!), and the potatoes!!
