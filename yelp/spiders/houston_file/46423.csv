Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is SO GOOD! Very expensive but absolutely worth it. I recommend the coffee. My husband and I drive about 35 miles from home just to come here to get coffee and a pastry. The cookies are incredible and the breakfast is our favorite. There's no other place like this. I recommend giving them a try despite the prices. Will always be a regular customer!
