Uchi////Amazing! Probably one of the most interesting and stylish restaurants I've been to In Houston. Here food is all about the experience, and each piece is artfully done. I've heard reservations can be very hard to come by, definitely plan on reserving a couple of days in advance. The kitchen is an open are where you can watch the chefs concoct completely unexpected favors. They have the option of ordering in your own, or getting the tasting menu and letting them choose your dinner. It's sort of sushi tapas, and is great fun to go with a large group and try everything you can on the menu. The uchiviche, their take on ceviche, and the daily specials were an incredible mix of eclectic flavors. The service was fun and informational, as the menu takes awhile to get used to. Then we got to dessert! They put together very fresh ingredients to make an unusual like dessert that tasted exactly like key lime. Very cool, great for a light meal before heading out for the night.
