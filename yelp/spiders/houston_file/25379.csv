Uchi////I called and asked if there was room at the bar. The hostess told me there were three spots currently available. Within 5 minutes I was at the valet. The valet asked me if I had a reservation. I told him I didn't and that I had just spoke with the hostess. He called the hostess, who told him there was no seating available for at least 1.5 hours. I tried to explain the conversation I had just had with a hostess but he wouldn't listen or park my car. I left and called the restaurant again, but they didn't care or apologize.
