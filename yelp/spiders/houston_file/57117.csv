Kata Robata////Kata Robata is my all time favorite restaurant in Houston. Everything I've had here, ranging from their yuzu salmon sashimi to lobster mac and cheese, has been good if not great. They also have my favorite dessert of all time: green tea souffle cheesecake. I wish I could come here more but it is a bit pricey (but definitely worth it).
