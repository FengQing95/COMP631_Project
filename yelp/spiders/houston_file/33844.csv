Local Foods////Holy balls, lunch here is crazy mad crowded!  I should have known, but thankfully my friend and I were enjoying a leisure "OMG, let's catch up on gossip" afternoon, so tears were shed, no lives were lost.  Although I did manage to splash half of glass of water onto myself while attempting to refill my water because that's just how Ellen C. does it.  No but seriously y'all, when I was a mere kiddo and out with my family and relatives, they would all jokingly take bets on when I would spill my drink.  Not whether I would, but WHEN.  Yeah . . . what jerks!
