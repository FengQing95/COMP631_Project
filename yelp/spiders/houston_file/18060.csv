Uchi////General Manager was completely rude...on a casual outing of professional black women we had one moment of outburst of celebration and he chose to come to the table to ask us to be "MINDFUL" of other guest!!!! Mind you we had the largest party, the largest ticket of the night and the best waiters... The food was great - atmosphere was amazing and the staff was very accommodating... He ruined it for many more to come .... Will Never Return!
