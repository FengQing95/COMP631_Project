Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I got the chicken fried steak, my boyfriend got the flap jacked, and a pitcher of mimosa because what's brunch without mimosas?! My chicken fried steak was indeed MASSIVE! It was very flavorful, crispy at the edges and nicely covered in gravy. I think I've had better chicken fried steak but I wasn't mad at this one. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his, licked his plate clean.
