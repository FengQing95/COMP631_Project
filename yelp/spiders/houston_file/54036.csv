Kata Robata////Kata has always been our sushi go-to (especially for the amazing happy hour) but the past few visits have unfortunately been lacking greatly in customer service and food quality. In the past service has been attentive with the adequate delivery speed for sushi, ingredient quality and freshness has been above-par, and overall great experience. But visits since August have been flawed by servers who have seemed very distracted and slightly bitter. Not to mention food has been coming out all at once which is a big faux pas for a sushi establishment. This last visit was the tipping point. I have a gluten allergy which has never been an issue (Kata supplies tamari and denotes gf items). I wanted to try a new roll and simply asked to have the fried shrimp omitted due to my allergy. The server told me they would need to charge me for the adjustment which I pushed back on. When he returned from the kitchen, I was told it was my "lucky day" because the chef would do me that favor. Shitty comment to say the least. Needless to say, we will not be returning anytime soon. Hoping management uses these comments constructively to get the restaurant back to where it was a year ago.
