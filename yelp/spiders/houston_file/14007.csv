JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The wait was ~45 minutes after we told them we would split our party of 5 up into 2 and 3. Luckily they were able to seat the 5 of us in the same area. Our groups of 2 and 3 were seated across from each other at one of the large tables. The tables have a large band white rocks down the center. The rocks add to the overall trendy decor of the restaurant, but they made it difficult to talk to each other. If you get seated at one of these tables, you will likely be sitting right next to a group of strangers.
