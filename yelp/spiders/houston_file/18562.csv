Uchi////We walked in without reservations, had about an hour wait - but it was absolutely worth it! As soon as we were seated, our waiter, Jason, took great care of us. As we were trying to decide which tastings to order, Jason offered to customize a menu for our party. We took him up on his offer and were served 10 amazing courses. All absolutely stellar - timing of the courses was excellent, suggested sake recommendations were on point, presentation was top notch, and service was exceptional.
