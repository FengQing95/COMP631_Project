JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Kathy - Wow, what a review! And we're equally impressed with how the number of visits you've made -- if we had an entire restaurant of patrons like you, we could all retire early. In all seriousness, though, on behalf of my entire staff, thank you for your kind words. It's always a morale booster to read a review like yours.
