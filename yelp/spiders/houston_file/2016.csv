JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been to this place twice and I honestly don't understand the hype. The host was not friendly and seemed annoyed considering that it was 10 pm on a Saturday night and most likely he didn't want to be there but at least act like it. The place was not as packed as I had expected it to be. I tried the brussel sprouts as an appetizer once and it lacked flavor. I had high hopes for the pork buns but it was really nothing memorable. I order the spicy umami miso ramen and my thick noodles were undercooked by a lot. It was extremely chewy and I couldn't finish my bowl which is sad considering that this bowl of ramen costed about $10+. The lychee cocktail was watered down. Despite the less than pleasant food experience, my server was great and friendly. I think it's the type of place people likes to go because it has a nice ambiance and social scene but I don't think I can return due to both of my food experience was less than I had expected.... bummer....
