Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Lavender Latte - Your nice latte with a hint of the floral lavender in the steam milk. I'm one to like the overwhelming flavor of lavender in my drinks/food so it wasn't enough to really satisfy me. I might have to ask if they can make it stronger next time.
