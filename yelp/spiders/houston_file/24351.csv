Uchi////The patio has heaters and some low tables and chairs. We order wine and their deep fried broccoli while we waited. The wine arrived and right after that they offered us two seats in a long shared table and we accepted it! The wait ended up being not even 20min. They sent the broccoli (amazing btw!) straight to our table.
