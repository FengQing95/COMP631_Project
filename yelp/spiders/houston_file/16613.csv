JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Miscellaneous appetizers and rice bowls - Knowing the size of a ramen bowl here, I tend to avoid ordering any extras (so I can save room for dessert elsewhere!) But if appetizers float your boat, the pork gyoza and takoyaki are pretty good and easy to share. The caramelized cauliflower was just okay; I think the brussels sprouts would be a better vegetarian option. Chashu bowls have a high rice-to-topping ratio and don't impress me that much, nor does the Tokyo Curry (which is much better done at Nippon or Go Go Curry.)
