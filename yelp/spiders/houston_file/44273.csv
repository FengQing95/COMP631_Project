Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Oh Wow! This is the most delicious spot for breakfast, brunch, lunch, cookies and bread in Houston! The Caprese sandwich and croque madame are divine!! Definitely get the amazingly crunchy and fluffy fries! We pick up a loaf of the sprouted sourdough every week for sandwiches at home which takes them to the next level. My one and only complaint is that they recently stopped making the oatmeal cream pie and my heart is broken. The walnut chocolate chip cookie is fantastic but just not the same as the cream pie!
