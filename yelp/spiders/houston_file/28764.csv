The Pit Room////Meh! It was a place I could tell from looking at it wouldn't be on any of my top lists. It was t bad but it isn't a place I'll go back to. Had the brisket sandwich and my husband had a plate with sausage/brisket and a double side of Mac n' cheese (because it was highly recommended by sever). Nothing worth remembering, but that doesn't mean others won't thoroughly enjoy. I just like better tasting bbq. If I can compete with a restaurant it isn't worth paying for.
