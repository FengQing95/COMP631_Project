JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The front space of the restaurant includes a bar and veeeeery little standing space, particularly when there is a 30-45 minute wait for a table in the dining room. No matter, the to go order wasn't all that difficult to place with the bartender and didn't take all that long to get. While we were standing there watching Sunday Night Football over the heads of those sitting at the bar, I decided this was a perfect date night spot for a day when I wasn't requiring 2 hour coma-like naps and endless supplies of Sudafed and Emergen-C.
