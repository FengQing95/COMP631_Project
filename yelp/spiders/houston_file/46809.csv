Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Sooooooooo!!!!! It took me 2 hours to be seated which is fine if the food is worth it. That was definitely not the case. All I ordered was French Toast and a sausage patty. Seems easy enough but I guess not. I received my French toast which was cold coming to the table, no sausage. I had to ask someone passing by the table (not our waitress) for the sausage. He tells me that he has to go and ask my waitress about the sausage. That was an additional 15 minutes. Finally the waitress comes to the table to tell me how it was all her fault yada yada. So they gave me the sausage links (I ordered a patty) Â undercooked "on them". With that being said if you have time and money to waste by all means try this place.
