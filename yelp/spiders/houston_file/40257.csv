Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We came here for the Saturday brunch and we were NOT disappointed! It makes sense now why the brunch reservations were completely booked days in advance. We were thankful to get a table as walk ins. Every member of our party of 4 cleaned their plates. Every one of our meals got a rave review. I had the shrimp & grits and my husband had the breakfast burrito. Our plates were both spotless as they were carried away! The cocktails were also delicious and the service impeccable. Sam was our waiter; he was very attentive and took great care of us! Would definitely recommend this brunch spot!
