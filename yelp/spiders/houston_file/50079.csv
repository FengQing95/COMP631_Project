Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Conclusion - Snooze is a fun place to grab breakfast/lunch but make sure you don't have any subsequent plans because the wait is unpredictable (about an hour perhaps). In terms of other brunch places around Houston, I don't think this place particularly stands out but it has good food and good service, so I don't find a need for originality that important. They have a large and diverse menu (and vegetarian options) which means everyone will find something they enjoy.
