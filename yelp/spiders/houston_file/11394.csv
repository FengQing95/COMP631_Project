JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place was pretty good. It's different from Pho or any other soup dishes that I normally get. The broth was kinda on the salty side. The noodles didn't take like it was hand made like the authentic Ramen served in Japan. I got the spicy chicken ramen with seasoned egg and tofu. I got the mild as I knew I could make it spicer. Tofu was just plain tofu cut into cubes straight from the container and the seasoned egg was actually perfection! The slow braised chicken was so so, kinda flavorless. I also got the spicy fried shrimp app and that was bomb! It was fresh, savory and crunchy. Great sauce as well on the shrimp
