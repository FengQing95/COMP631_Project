Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////For dinner, we got the Cornbread Madeleines, the Pulled Pork Hush Puppies, and the Pig Candy to start. All awesome; the cornbread come with this delicious purple butter that I dream about. For my entree, I went with the Cajun Brick Chicken. It was a little bit more bland than I expected, but still great. My friend got a side of mac and cheese which was TDF!!!! The brussels were also a win.
