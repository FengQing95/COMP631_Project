Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat was good - don't get me wrong.  We were visiting from out of town, and found this restaurant to be recommended here on Yelp.  We called for dinner reservations and were told they were booked solid, but if we wanted to wait for 1.5 hours, we could get on a waitlist.  Well, when we got there, we were seated immediately at a tiny table in the back near the glassed off area for super-cool kids.  It was really distracting as the people in that room stood with their backs & arses directly to my table taking pictures and visiting for 30 minutes.  The restaurant was too loud for conversation, and it seems as though the menu was put together by someone trying too hard to be hip.  I kept reading reviews here on Yelp advising about the how I needed to be sure to order certain menu items, as they saved or made the meal for so many.  So, I did.   Even then, nothing just wowed me, and the hype seems to be just that.  The bathrooms are interesting, though.  Not sure why there's a dressing mirror in the corner behind the toilet?  It's a bit disturbing, honestly.  Glad to have  gone, but pass on a repeat.
