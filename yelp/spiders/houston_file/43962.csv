Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Kouign Amann is pronounced "Queen Ah-mahn."  It was probably one of my favorite pastries.  Super dense, sweet, and the bottom is encrusted with a layer of caramelized sugar that cracks with each heavenly bite.  However, the sugar layer was a little much for me; it got stuck on my teeth too easily.. wahhh  D:  *sissy*
