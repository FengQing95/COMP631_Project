Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bumped into Bosscat Kitchen & Libitations by accident, and what a lovely accident it was! They have a wonderful selection of beers. I was there after lunch and before dinner time so I decided to have a starter to accompany my beer: Pulled Pork Hush Puppies served with a Carolina barbecue mustard, WOW!!!! So tasty!! Cannot wait to try the rest of the menu! But for sure I'll be back for more of those delicious hush puppies
