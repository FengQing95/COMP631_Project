Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Came here for dessert and the pastries were great.  Just wish the 2 ladies working the registers were more pleasant.  The one in glasses could smile when asked about about the self serve coffee and it's not my fault the register's space isn't larger to accommodate more customers.
