Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We also shared the Nashville Hot Frog's Legs. We're Asians. Frog legs don't scare us. Most of the frog's legs we have tried in other restaurants were served French style with butter and garlic but this Nashville hot style was delightful! Definitely a must try even if you are not very adventurous.
