The Pit Room////Always great food! There isn't a ton of sitting available, but we always seem to find a spot. Normally will get Â it to-go and then sit down if something opens! Only thing, is they don't have any extra BBQ sauce on table or near condiment buffet. Only get a little bit with your food. Meat is amazing. We've tried about everything here. Tasteful, fall off the bone. This is our favorite BBQ place in Houston area.
