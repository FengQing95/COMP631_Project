The Pit Room////Back to the topic of food, if I'm ever in Houston and get to go again, I'll definitely get a beef rib.  One of the people I was with got one.  The bark was pitch black, it was super smoky and delicious, plus extremely tender.  Also, it weighed in at over a pound!  I'm still full an hour and a half later!
