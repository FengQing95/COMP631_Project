Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////It was sooo delicious!!!!! Went on a weekday around lunch time and the wait was around 10-15 min. Service was good, food was delicious! Â I got the Bella Bella bunny with the harsh brown, really good! Alittle messy to eat so ask for extra napkins lol. The Omg French toast was really good, but it was really sweet. Ask for extra fresh fruit if you're a fruit person. The fruit goes very well with the sweetness of the French toast.
