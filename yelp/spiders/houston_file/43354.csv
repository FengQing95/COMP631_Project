Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Lined up on a long plate, the desserts look like brightly colored flowers on the plate. Each one tasted freshly made and delicate. No one flavor overpowered the other. The pistachio pastry was a layered sponge cake with cream and dusted with pistachios. The dish of lemon creme was like a pudding with the right amount of tartness. Both were very light and perfect on such a hot day. I love Earl Grey, so I thought that pastry would be wonderful; while I did taste the tea flavor, the pastry dough was too dense.
