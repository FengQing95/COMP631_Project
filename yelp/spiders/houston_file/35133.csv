Local Foods////Nice little posh spot to stop in for a quick bite, lunch, brunch, and a to go.  I've always gotten the gulf seafood sandwich with chips and potato salad or soba noodles.  Service is always good and the restaurant is always very clean.  Never had a bad experience here after 4 years and will continue to support them.
