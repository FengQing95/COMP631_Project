Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Anyways.  I went for lunch last Friday.  We shared the fried oysters and I had the Hot Brown, an homage to the Louisville tradition. The fried Oyster were weird, all of the oysters were attached and kind of clumped together. The comeback sauce was decent.  Then I had the Hot Brown.  It came on a plate that was very hard to eat it on, but this was not the largest problem.  This was gross.  There was fat or skin or something that made it very difficult to eat and honestly half way through I just stopped eating it.  I ended having to spit out a several bites as they were inedible. The bread was overdone so hard to cut.  The sauce was okay, but that is all I can say that I liked.
