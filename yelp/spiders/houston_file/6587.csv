JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////There's usually a long wait, and they seem to be very slow at seating people- you'll see huge groups leaving but they won't fill their spots for fifteen or twenty minutes when there are plenty of people standing inside and outside the tiny restaurant to eat. I've also seen the hostesses seating their friends as they arrive while many people have waited their fair share but I guess that's understandable.
