JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been hearing about JINYA for a very long time and I was always afraid of the long waits/parking/etc so I have been putting off going until this past Saturday. My boyfriend and I decided to try the place out for lunch. I was happy that there was a free parking garage around the corner, and for a Saturday afternoon, it was not at all packed. We quickly parked, walked inside and saw several groups. We knew we would have to wait a bit so we first went up to the hostess to check in. To our luck, everyone waiting were big groups and there was no wait for a two person booth! Hooray!
