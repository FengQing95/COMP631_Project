Uchi////Worth every penny. The experience was amazing! My group and I did a little informal omakase that we let our server curate for us. I'm usually a creature of habit but he made some amazing choices! I loved everything. He definitely got us things I would've never even thought of ordering. Everything was so good, I didn't even get any pictures besides this amazing dessert! I can't remember what it was called but it was amazing.
