Kata Robata////We ordered the chef's mix of sashimi, as well as a few rolls. Sushi is either really good, or really bad in my opinion. I haven't had just ok sushi. Maybe that's a good thing, but the sushi here is above average. Is it the best I've ever had? No. Is it the best I've had in Houston? Yup.
