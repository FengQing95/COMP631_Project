Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Started off as a pristine caf√© with the biggest croissants in town, but is now an overcrowded sweatshop that has the tenacity to sell a two-day-old lemon custard cake that weighs under three ounces for $7... and makes you stand in a long line to order it (not because they are so popular!... but because they serve their customers so slowly and inefficiently).
