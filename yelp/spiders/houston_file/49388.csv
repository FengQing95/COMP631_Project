Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is easily in the conversation for Houston's top brunch spot -- a compliment that speaks for itself. The waiting time could range from half an hour to even a couple hours if you visit during peak timings on weekends but both my visits have proven to be well worth the wait. On my first visit, I enjoyed the uniqueness of Benny Goodman as it combines eggs with Lox salmon very well but my second visit was even better! Their scrambled eggs/egg whites and omelettes are a terrific way to customize your three-egg brunch with up to three toppings, including meats and seafood. I was thankfully able to take advantage of this great option by adding shrimps, salmon, and poblano peppers to my scrambled eggs. I added ciabatta for bread and got to enjoy hash browns and Soyrizo on the side, resulting in a delicious high protein meal (with a kick to it) that I absolutely devoured. Their soyrizo might just be the most delectable vegetarian breakfast meat out there as it's got just the right amount of flavor and seasoning. The service here is friendly and on-point, while the ambience is very relaxing as well. The freshness of their ingredients is so evident that the food reflects top notch quality across the menu. If you haven't been here yet and are looking for a new go-to brunch spot, do not hesitate to visit and while you're there, you might as well try their extremely popular OMG French toast too -- certainly a signature item!
