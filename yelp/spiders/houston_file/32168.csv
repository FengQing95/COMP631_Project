Local Foods////Definitely a popular place in the area. The interior of the restaurant was nice, service was good as well. However, I was not super impressed with the crunchy chicken sandwich nor pretzel bun. It was ok but not great. The Kale side was so so. I ate half not because I couldn't resist but because I hadn't eaten all day and knew I needed some nutrients. It was not terrible but it was not terribly tasty either.
