Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Place looks, as my gf put it "industrial vintage restorative"? Anyway, looks nice and clean. Staff are pleasant and service as expected, cordial. It was on the way home from dinner so this review is based on the brioche sucre only. I'll have to try the meal time stuff on a later date.
