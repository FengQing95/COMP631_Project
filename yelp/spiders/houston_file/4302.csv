JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Daphne - Thank you for your review and the constructive feedback. We greatly appreciate your kind words and your understanding of some of our shortcomings. As a franchise concept, we didn't get any say in terms of the layout of our restaurant(s). The community tables are hit-or-miss with most of our guests, to be honest. Though I will say there have been occasions when complete strangers have struck up conversations and have even offered each other samples of their food when they were trying to decide what to order. And in this day and age, that type of human interaction seems few and far between.
