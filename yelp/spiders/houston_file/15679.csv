JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The noodles were cooked to my favorite al dente consistency, and they were flavorful and chewy. The tofu was also perfectly cooked, and were of the style that I prefer, being not-fried as they usually are when I get tofu in soup. The veggies were all cooked well, in that I didn't notice anything terrible about them in particular while consuming the dish. Honestly I didn't pay much attention, as the stars of the show were definitely the broth and the noodles, as should be the case with ramen.
