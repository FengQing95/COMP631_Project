Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We came for breakfast on a Sunday with our laptops to do some work (free wifi!).  We ordered breakfast sandwiches.  They were good but expensive $12 each.  The bread/roll was disappointing considering they have some great looking breads on display.  Coffee was pretty good.  Did not taste the pastries, but we were already over $30 so we passed.  We sat on the two comfortable chairs near the coffee bar, but we needed to charge our laptops, and there are limited outlets, so we had to move to the less comfortable stools by the windows.  We would have stayed a lot longer if we had been able to charge and sit in the comfy seats.  Maybe worth it for the pastries?
