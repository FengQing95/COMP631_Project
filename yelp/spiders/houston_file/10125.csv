JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////On to the food... we had a jinya bun (porky bun) to start. It's definitely bigger than the ones at Fat Bao (to help with comparison). The bun was perfect and the pork belly was insanely thick and tender. It was really good - although it doesn't beat Ippudo. My one suggestion would be that they slice the pork belly in half to make it easier to eat.
