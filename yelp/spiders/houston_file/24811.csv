Uchi////Girlfriend tried the Anago (Sea Eel) and was in love! She said it had the perfect crisp sear. I didn't care for the Katsuo Bonito or the Masu (Ocean Trout)... The Masu was very similar to the Salmon Belly we ordered, so it wasn't really worth it or special. Sushi Chef threw in a special torched rockfish for us that was really good as well.
