Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////1) Operating hours. CB--I don't understand you. I don't think you know it, but you are at a high traffic, super popular corner in a super popular area. Right now you are participating in the resurgence of the area and you are a key player in making this city semi-cool. Your clients consist of not only hipsters, but working professionals. (LOL, hipsters work too, I know). I already partially forgave you for publishing initial opening hours and and not even going through with your soft opening (as I arrived and to my despair that same day you changed the date on us). Sure, ok, you need time to get ready, fine. But now here you are, you big shot--and yet, you now close at 7pm?!? I'm sorry but did you not hear that you are on what street corner? Fine, you need time to bake your food? Got it. You need time off or whatever to have your top notch chefs relax or bake in patience? Maybe ok...but at least consider opening later on weekends.
