Uchi////Thank you for taking the time to leave us this feedback. I am very sorry for the table you got sat in. I deeply apologize for that, this is no way to enjoy dinner. Our guest typically enjoy our course pace, our menu is large so at this pace you can enjoy most if not all the menu. However I see that this style is not for you, I totally understand. My name is Jesse Regalado, I am a manager here at Uchi. I would like to leave you my number (832) 797-2199. Please let me make your next reservation so I can tailor a meal for you. I can make sure the pace is slowed down and you have a warm table to sit at! I will also make a few course recommendations that I am sure will be amazing for y'all.
