Baby Barnaby's////Very cool and quaint place with outdoor and indoor seating. Very friendly staff. Great place for regulars. They have a very different menu. A lot of healthy options and interesting dishes like apple sausage, fruit cups and egg whites. Not a very large place so usually has a wait. Fun location inside montrose.
