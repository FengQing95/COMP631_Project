Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////You can definitely almost always expect a long wait here, but that's how you know this place is GOOD! It's honestly a little pricey too, but this is one of my favorite brunch places that I don't mind splurging on every once in a while. This environment has a very busy and social vibe. It's great for catching up with friends.
