Uchi////Staff member again goes MIA for 40 minutes and I am definitely still hungry and regretful.  As we leave, I am told I have stuff on my behind because someone just wiped desert off the table and onto the bench seating before.  Ok - I just want to go home.  I still tip the "waiter" because he seems to be a bit of a dumbo and I feel bad for him and his outlook, but maybe I shouldn't have so he can learn.
