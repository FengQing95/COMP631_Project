Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////There are so many unanswered questions.  For one, the parking lot is way too small to handle the traffic the cafe sees.  On one visit, we arrived at 9 am (their opening time on weekends) to discover a line out the door.  I went down to stand in line while my sister parked, on a side street as the lot was full.  Yay for walking adventures in Houston's heat.  For another, everyone stands in a single line to place orders, regardless of whether one is there simply to buy pastries to go, or is actually sitting down to eat.  This makes the wait unnecessarily long for both groups, and reduces the business the cafe could conceivably handle. It would make more sense to have two separate lines.  Third, I really do not understand the extravagant boxes used to hold the pastries.  Many of the best patisseries in France are fine with the recyclable brown paper bag.  I see no reason why a place whose motto is "only for all" sees a need to use containers that take 10X more time to fill and cost 10X more money, to hold their viennoiseries.
