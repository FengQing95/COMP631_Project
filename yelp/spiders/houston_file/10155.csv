JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Tonkatsu Black - it's definitely heavier as others have mentioned, but I liked it. Got tired of it halfway through though (so maybe too think/creamy?) but it's a great dish to share. The egg was cooked to perfection - the yolk creamy but not dripping. The pork belly was very tender and melts right in your mouth - but on the average side for me (didn't feel it had any real interesting flavor) and a little more fatty than I like. Overall as a whole, still pretty good and I'd order it again to share with maybe 3 people just to have a few bites of it.
