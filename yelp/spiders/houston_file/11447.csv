JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I went on a Sunday evening and the place was packed -- a good sign?  After a 30 minute wait we were seated.  We waited another 20 minutes for someone to come take our drink order. After another 20 minutes (we've now been seated 40 minutes) our waiter shows up and apologizes for the delay and takes our order.  We ordered the Kale Lollipop, Seaweed salad, Tonkotsu Black and the Cha Cha Cha.  After another 20 minutes (we've now been here an hour) our soups show up - only they're the wrong soups.  Our waiter apologizes, and my dining partner asks about the appetizers. While the waiter goes to check on it, the table next to us leans over and says they think they mistakenly got our appetizers -- a different waiter had brought it to them and left it before they could say anything to him.  Meanwhile our soups show up again:  this time the soups are correct, although my Tonkotsu is missing the seasoned egg.   So I asked the lady who brought the soup about the egg, and she takes my chopstick and pushes around the pork in my soup to see if the egg is hiding beneath it -- no egg.   In the interim our waiter shows up with an order of tempura cauliflower -- which wasn't ours.  I asked for an seasoned egg to replace the one left out of my soup - it never arrived.
