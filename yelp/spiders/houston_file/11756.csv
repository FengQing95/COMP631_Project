JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've always been the skeptical type of person when it comes to vegan food. I have never had anything so delightful as the vegan ramen, that never once made me miss non-vegan related food. My friend ordered the classic chicken ramen and it was so basic compared to this. This is, without a doubt, my new favorite place to unwind and relax with a hot bowl of hearty ramen. What else do you need in life?
