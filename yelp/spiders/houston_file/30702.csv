The Pit Room////I ordered a two-meat plate of pork ribs and Czech-style beef sausage (other options are venison and jalapeno cheddar) along with sides of potato salad and charro beans. The true test of barbecue is whether the meat's flavor stands on its own without any sauce, and that is definitely the case here. The ribs had the right amount of moisture, and the sausage was on point as well. I do realize I prefer the jalapeno cheddar sausage over the Czech-style beef, but that's my personal preference as opposed to any kind of flaw.
