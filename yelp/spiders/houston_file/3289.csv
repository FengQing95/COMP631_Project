JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm very sad that we had a very upsetting experience. The minute we were seated, the waiter didn't even introduce himself so we don't even know his name, we were given water and then the waiter took our order. Once our order came out I noticed my ramen didn't have eggs, so I asked if the spicy tonkotsu comes with eggs. The waitress said yes and went to get an egg for me. No apology there but I was patient. We were done eating but nobody came by to ask if we needed anything or came by with our checks or over 30 minutes. I had to call for a waitress to ask for our check - which took additional ten minutes to get. Once I got it I noticed I was charged for an egg and asked for it to be taken off. Another waitress tried to justify why I was charged but at this point I was very mad. I told her what the waitress earlier told me, she goes off and we don't get our check for another ten to fifteen minutes. They gave us a discount on our check but STILL NO APOLOGY. Very unprofessional and unfriendly establishment.
