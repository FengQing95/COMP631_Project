JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was surprised at how long we had to wait in line to get in. The place is nice and I like the family style tables they have going on. It was just regular noodles at a high price. However, I liked that you could ask for seconds and the portion was big enough to ask for a to go bowl. I don't know if I will go back anytime soon because we wanted for over an hour.
