Kata Robata////I came on Thursday last week and could have sworn I scheduled a reservation, they weren't able to find it but they were still able to accommodate us which I was very grateful for. We sat at the sushi bar and received wonderful service from everyone we encountered. Calvin waited on us and made great recommendations. He was not only knowledgeable but very kind and patient. He made a great selection of nigiri and sashimi for us. I'm always blown away by the service and quality of the food.
