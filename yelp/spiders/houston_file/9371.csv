JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Thao - Thank you for the great review. I'm glad to know you enjoyed your visit with us. I especially appreciate your understanding that we are high-volume, high-turnover, establishment, which means we do our best to keep the tables turning WITHOUT making anyone feel overly rushed. It's never easy, and it's a particular balance that we struggle with daily. We hope you will visit us again the next time you're in town, and as the great Lyle Lovett sings: "That's right, you're not from Texas, but Texas wants you anyway!"
