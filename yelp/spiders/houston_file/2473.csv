JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Eli, Thanks for your review. Unfortunately I must disagree with your recollection of events. First and foremost, I never said: "We are not holding you here to wait, you can leave anytime," nor did I say anything that might have been construed as such. You had asked the hostess to speak to a manager. I introduced myself and listened to your complaint. I then turned to our hostess Kathy to explain. She told me (and you) aloud that you had mistaken another pager number on the waiting list for your own. She did not remove your name and add it back as you claim. Furthermore, we did not seat any special "friend" parties that were not on the list, as you also claim.The party that sat before yours had been waiting longer than you, and more importantly, that party was complete. This is our seating policy: We cannot seat your party unless -- or, more importantly, until -- you are complete. That means if your entire party is not present, we will seat other group(s) ahead of you. This is the only way to keep it fair. I tried explaining this to you, but you interrupted me several times by saying, "I don't care." Then you said you didn't want to wait any more and that you were going eat elsewhere. I considered the conversation to be over.
