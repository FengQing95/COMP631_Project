JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Along those lines service is terrible.   The waitresses don't yet know the menu fully and the people who bring the food out can't figure out what bowl they have in their hand or who to even give it to.  My bowl was the premium white but the server said it was an Asari so guess what... someone got my bowl and I sat their for another 20 minutes waiting for a bowl that wasn't coming.   The naming/numbering system needs to be fixed or training just needs to be better on all levels.   Sides like extra eggs or meat should be brought out with the soup not 5 to 10 minutes after.  Hopefully they correct all this.   Minus 1 star.
