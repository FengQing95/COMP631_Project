JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have been going all over the city trying to find good ramen places. So obviously, I had to give this place a try. The reason I love this place, is the atmosphere. It is a perfect place to have date night or to have a group of friend's go out for Friday night dinner. There is usually always a wait, but not too long.  I always get the Tonkotsu  Black ramen with an extra egg. The broth is thick and creamy, and the pork belly is fresh and the noodles are decent. Honestly, my favorite thing to order, is not ramen, it's their Takoyaki! It is fried to perfection, with the perfect amount of octopus in every bite.If you have never had this dish, get it! Venture out, try something new! I feel like since this restaurant is a chain, it loses that mom and pop feel that you get from going to other ramen joints around the city.  Other than that, I love this place! Happy Eating! :)
