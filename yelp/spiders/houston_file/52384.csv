Kata Robata////I went here for my girlfriend's birthday with a party of 10 people. Ordered the lobster mac n cheese which was delicious and the tofu appetizer. My other friends weren't as lucky because they ran out of the dish they wanted to order...how does this happen??? Also they charged $20 to just keep the cake we brought in for my gf Â in the fridge...ridiculous. Bottom line is food=great price=high service=meh
