The Pit Room////I had high hopes after the brisket and the sausage. But alas, the pork ribs were just okay. I was expecting some tender, fall off the bone meat. However, the pork ribs that I had were kind of tough to eat. It wasn't tender, it didn't fall of the one, even when I bit into it, I still had to pull it off the bone. They just didn't impress me at all. I'm not sure if it was a fluke or something because both my boss thought that his pork ribs were amazeballs. But then again, he hasn't been to many of the top BBQ joints in Houston.
