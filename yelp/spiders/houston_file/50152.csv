Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I have a few reasons for only giving 4 stars (and if the food wasn't so good, I would give it three stars). The parking situation isn't great. There is a small lot next to the restaurant but I've never been able to park there. Street parking is available so you'll just have to walk a little. Next, the food doesn't come out so quickly. Both times I've been here, I waited close to half an hour for food just going with a couple other people. Also, unless you come at an off time and not on the weekend, there is always a long line. I've tried coming a couple times Fridays at lunch and would have had to wait almost an hour (but instead went somewhere else). Best times for minimal wait are probably 9:30-10:30am and after 1pm during the week.
