JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This was actually my very first time eating ramen, so I am no means the authority on what is the standard in ramen. However, I really enjoyed this place! The atmosphere is FANTASTIC! And the decor is tastefully done, I cannot praise it enough. It has a classy vibe on a casual feel.
