JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great ramen.. Probably the best in Houston. They had other unique options as well for appetizers and main courses which was nice. There isn't a lot of room to wait before being seated and it was very busy when we visited so this wasn't ideal but overall our experience was great.
