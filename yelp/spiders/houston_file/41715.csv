Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Went there on a Tuesday morning and asked for their breakfast sandwich. I asked the cashier if the egg was fried well and she said, "oh, we boil the egg and then we fry it it". I said okay and when I got my breakfast sandwich it did not have the egg. I never said no egg. I asked if they could have the cook fry the egg well? "She said, no we cannot do that.". Â What kind of place is this? The "general Manager" just stood there, no apologies or explanations. Asked for my money back. The least they can do is tell people ahead of time how they cook the egg. Forget this place. Overpriced and they don't care about your business. The Manager should be replaced with someone that at least talks.
