Local Foods////I'm not vegan but am seriously considering it after having their quinoa burger... I'm only half joking.  But I do want the krabby patty (quinoa burger) secret formula!! I believe the patty was made of black beans, quinoa, and different spices. It was served between a  pretzel bun, avocado, tomatoes (& various veggies), avocado, and a secret sauce. You get to pick 2 sides- I chose watermelon and a kale salad. The whole meal was flavorful and had a 'sensual' texture. It came out in about 10 minutes. Would definitely recommend this restaurant if you want local food,  a cool industrial-chic vibe, and a tasty meal.
