Uchi////In terms of the dinner, we let the Chef order our food.  This was one of my best experiences when it comes to a sushi place. The presentation and delicacy of the plates were impressive.  It's definitely not your typical sushi restaurant and the foods were delicious!  Some of the rare fish names on the menu we had to Google it to find its origin.
