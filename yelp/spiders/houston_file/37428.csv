Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We had a birthday celebration at Bosscat on Saturday morning. I was a little disappointed to find out that their brunch menu is ONLY served on Sunday. On Saturday, they offer a "Treat Yo'self" menu. It's very small and doesn't have many options. They won't allow anyone to order off of their regular lunch menu either. We ordered the frittata and totchos. The Bellini was also delicious! We had great service and were able to make a reservation. I would go back on a Sunday or during the week for their dinner menu.
