The Pit Room////Loved this spot. The meat was cooked to perfection, the sides were great, they also have a great selection of pickled onions, pickles and peppers to go with anything you get. Service was fast and friendly. Great Patio where you can chow down have a drink and enjoy the game with friends. Definitely will be back , go check them out. Parking can be tricky when busy, yet people are coming and going pretty regularly. Check street signs if you street park and don't be afraid to ask the CVS aroubd the corner if you need to park a large vehicle, it worked for our friends and their camper passing through H-Town.
