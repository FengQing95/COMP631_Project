Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The service was great and food was outstanding. We ordered various dishes and each one was thoroughly enjoyed. I had the barbacoa chile verde eggs benedict and the frittata. Both were delicious, but if I had to pick, I'd go with the frittata since it is lighter on the palate and stomach.
