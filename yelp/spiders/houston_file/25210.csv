Uchi////Everything they brought was beautifully crafted and delicious. There was a balance of entree type dishes and nigiri. Omakase came out to be $113 each for 10+ tastings. Well worth it. We found a new one to add to our favorite fish list: Sawara (Japanese Spanish mackerel). The otoro lived up to all our standard and even the dessert was outstanding. From the social hour, must get walu walu, eggplant nigiri and oysters.
