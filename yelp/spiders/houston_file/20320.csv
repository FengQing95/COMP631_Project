Uchi////We stood waiting for an hour and 15 minutes because the outside tables were full, the bar was full, everything was full and there was no place to sit.  After standing that long, I decided to order our food to go.  We finally got a table outside and were hoping we could eat our dinner there since by now it was an hour and 40 minutes that we had waited, but they said we couldn't.  We ate our dinner in the car, in the parking lot.  For the drive over there, and the time we stood waiting, the food wasn't good enough to be worth doing again.
