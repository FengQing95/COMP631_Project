Uchi////Been going to Uchi every year for my birthday for 3 years now and it is hands down the best restaurant I have ever been to. John our waiter takes incredible care of us and goes above and beyond to make sure each time we go its an experience. Highly recommend to any and everyone. Especially first time sushi goers.
