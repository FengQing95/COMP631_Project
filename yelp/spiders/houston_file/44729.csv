Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Came here for Restaurant Week and overall pretty happy with our meal. My boyfriend and I did corn bisque and thought was good but almost borderline on too sweet. I had the Hot and Crunchy Salmon which I thought was excellent. My boyfriend had Beef Bourgogne and it was a little too salty.. We might be too picky but it that's only reason we didn't give a 5 star
