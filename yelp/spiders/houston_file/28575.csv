The Pit Room////I was about to give up on trying to find great slow smoked bbq that wasn't sold out of a truck or made in my own back yard. I knew we were in for something special when the parking lot was filled with trucks and the parking spaces were large enough to accommodate more than a Mini Cooper or a Smart Car. Portion sizes were great, while the seating inside was limited, there was plenty of seating outside. Staff was super friendly and came out to see how the customers were and chat a little.
