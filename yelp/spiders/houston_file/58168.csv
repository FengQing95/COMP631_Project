Kata Robata////This place was absolutely phenomenal with its fresh fish selection, diverse menu, expansive bar, and great service! I ate lunch here and got an amazing deal for the chirashi lunch. I assumed it would be smaller because it was on the lunch menu but I left absolutely stuffed with fresh fish and feeling super happy!
