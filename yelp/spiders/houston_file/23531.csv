Uchi////Goat Milk Custard ($7): 4/5 Strong goat milk flavor. Refreshing and mild honeydew sorbet, but it doesn't complement the custard at all, if anything the custard masks the flavor. An odd combination. Fruits and nuts were a good idea though. Disappointed with the lack of care put into plating this and the other dishes, definitely felt more thrown together.
