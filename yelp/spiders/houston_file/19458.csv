Uchi////Going during happy hour is great! But I recommend if you're a first timer, to get the chef's tasting or signature tastings. The tastings are all market price so it ranges from $150-200 but it's so great! The tastings are great for a first timer because you get introduced to the concept of Uchi and how their dishes are prepared and meant to eat (sometimes they make you stuff that isn't on the menu), and the tastings change every day. Everything is meant to be shared and although it is pricey for such "small servings", it is a tapas styled restaurant and it's so worth it. Uchi will always have a special place in my heart, I've never tried anything there that I didn't like.
