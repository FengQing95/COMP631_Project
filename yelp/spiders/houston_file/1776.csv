JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The decor is the type of bland, corporate "modern Asian" style you see in all these places. My waiter was fine, if not anything to write home about. In short, if you've got a craving for ramen and cash to spare, Jinya isn't a bad choice. I, however, will probably be taking my business elsewhere from hereon out.
