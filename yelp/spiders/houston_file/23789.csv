Uchi////Nothing to write home about! We opted for the 10 course chef's special but requested to stop at the 6th course because we weren't satisfied with any of the dishes we were given. We literally only somewhat liked the complimentary brussels sprouts we were given. The waitress though was very accommodating and wanted to try to make things right, so she brought us out two rolls in exchange for two items we didn't like, but they were just ordinary sushi rolls. Giving this place 3 stars for them trying but one for the food.
