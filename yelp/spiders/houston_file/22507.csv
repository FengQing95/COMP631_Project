Uchi////Not child friendly. Party of 6 ("large" group according to them)- we were told- they had a disclaimer that large parties are not easily accommodated and there would be a waiting period. Reservations made almost a month in advance, specifically mentioned to them we were a party with 2 kids below age of 2- still made to wait despite the entire party being there on time. I will be thinking twice now before taking visiting friends or family there-
