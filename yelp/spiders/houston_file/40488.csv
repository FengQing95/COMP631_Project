Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First time visiting and I will definitely be back! The joined the waiting list at 12:12pm and was seated at 1:11pm. Totally worth the wait! The food was delicious, staff was so friendly, one of the kitchen staff took our order which was super nice because I was able to order his recommended which was the fruity pebbles French toast with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It wasn't too sweet either!!!
