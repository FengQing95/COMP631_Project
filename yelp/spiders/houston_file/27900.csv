The Pit Room////It just bums me out. I'm 100% sure it was a employee because when we pulled up there were several in the parking lot and I asked my friend who owned the vehicle if it was safe to leave it in there. Lucky for my son the didn't notice the bag of prescription drugs on the seat next to his discharge papers. Sad... we live in Montana and more than likely saw us coming. Crystal the manager was amazing . Thank you.
