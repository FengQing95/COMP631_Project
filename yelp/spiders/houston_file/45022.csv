Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Last time we were here, we got the Ni√ßoise salad and it was to die for, along with some pastries, which were what we stuck with today. The oatmeal cream cookie is massive and filling; we've tried a couple different croissants and breads as well, and they're fresh with the just the right amount of crispiness to them.They make good iced coffees too.
