JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Mandy - Thanks for your review. Upon reading it, I immediately spoke to my manager-on-duty, the waiter who served you, and the bartender who prepared the drink. I have since discovered through them that the orange juice had gone bad. That is to say, the orange juice had begun early fermentation wherein it tasted sour and had slight carbonation. The bartender, who has worked with me at JINYA and my other restaurants for years, swears that she did not prepare a Bellini or a mimosa accidentally. She recalls very clearly pouring the OJ from the quick-pour container into a clear to-go cup, since the ticket noted that she should use a "Kid's Cup." Also, mimosas (we don't actually serve Bellinis as we don't carry peach puree) are only served in glass flutes, and since we don't very often get requests for mimosas, when those particular orders come in, the bartender knows they must open a small bottle of prosecco, which costs approximately $10.
