JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I really like this place!!! I got the tonkotsu black ramen. I was not disappointed. The broth was excellent. The noodles not too thick and not too thin. The pork just melted on my mouth, and this is coming from a guy who is not even that huge of a fan of pork. To add to the good experience, the waiting staff is really nice. In addition, the spoons they give you have a slight notch at the ends of the handles to rest on the rim of the bowl that presents your spoon from becoming completely submerged in the soup! I need one of those spoons for my home! I definitely will come back to this place when I'm craving some ramen after watching some Naruto!
