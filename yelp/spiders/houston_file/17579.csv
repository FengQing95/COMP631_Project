Uchi////Ok, so i fell off the wagon of keeping up with writing reviews for all the places i love, but I JUST HAD to take my hat off for UCHI. AMAZING. Pretty much have had everything and haven't had a bad plate.  The waiters and waitress' are all so very helpful and accommodating, please use their guidance. I recommend getting either of the two tastings and asking the waiter for suggestions on supplemental plates---depending on how many people are eating.  MACHI CURE--- make sure that is one of the plates you try there. SOOOO GOOOD!!! of course fried milk for dessert is always crowd pleasing.
