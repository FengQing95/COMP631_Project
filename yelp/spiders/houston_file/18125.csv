Uchi////Not even going to waste time writing much of a review. It's one of the best and most enjoyable meals in Houston. Food is out of this world. Happy hour is fantastic, but come for dinner anyway so you get off the happy hour menu. I typically like a traditional cocktail or whiskey on the rocks, but even their cocktails are good enough to make me change it up. A cucumber cocktail!? Who could have imagined. There are over 900 reviews and almost all are 5 stars. Just go. There are no questions you need answered.
