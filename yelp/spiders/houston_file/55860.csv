Kata Robata////We each ordered 2 lemon drops, and they were delicious - fresh and not too sweet.  The server was very attentive and kept us informed on when our drinks/food would be ready and consistently checked to make sure we were OK throughout the night. Drinks and hot tea were always refilled without asking.  Perfect girls night out.
