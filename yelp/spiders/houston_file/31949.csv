Local Foods////This place has the best sandwiches and salads of any restaurant I know of in Houston. Â  Everything is extremely high quality, made from excellent ingredients, and they have a lot of unusual things in their menu. The sides also are excellent. Try the crab and shrimp sandwich, it's terrific. The service also is great, and the people who work there are always really nice. I get takeout from them routinely, and it is always fast and delicious.
