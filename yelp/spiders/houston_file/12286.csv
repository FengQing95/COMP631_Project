JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////THE SCENE: Its very quaint and urban with a Benihana kinda vibe. The booths are made for 2 but there is a long table in the center of the restaurant with chairs all around it. The hostess gave us a vibrating thingy and told us was going to be a 20min wait. After 5 min my booty was vibrating to let us know we were up LOL(NICE). We opted for the bar, which was right in front of the cooks :), and was greeted by Sarah P. who was very sweet and kind.
