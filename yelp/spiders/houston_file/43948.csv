Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Other pastries served are sticky buns, assortment of cookies, macarons, fresh breads, cheesecakes, chocolate cupcakes, chocolate & fruit tarts, verrines, and SO much more.  They also serve food daily until 3:00 including Pain Perdue, yogurt, soft scramble eggs and much more.  I must try their grilled cheese with soup next because it looks and smells divine!  They serve an assortment of drinks including espresso, Mexican cokes, fresh squeezed orange juice and more.  Their espresso drinks are deep, smooth, full of body and flavor and pack a nice punch.  Their Flat White is my fave so far and goes great with my Kouign Amman.
