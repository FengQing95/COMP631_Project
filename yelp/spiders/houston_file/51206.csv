Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////If you love brunch, this is another option in the area to try! Snooze is a chain that originated from Denver and made its way here to serve Houstonians some great breakfast. Warning, this place is really busy on the weekend so there is most likely a wait. I went with another friend on a Saturday morning and we waited about an hour before we got seatings. In the meantime, you can sip on some free coffee outside (but it gets really hot when the sun is shining straight on your face).
