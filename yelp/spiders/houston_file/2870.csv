JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ramen noodle soup didn't cure my post game sickness. Yeah my team lost by an extra point...Seriously an extra point...I digress...so yes the food was delicious and had that extra kick of spice. Highly recommend adding the egg and ground pork. Great place for a group and they are open late
