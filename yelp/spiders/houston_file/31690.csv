Local Foods////I would comment on the seven layer brownie they hyped up and persuaded me to get, but they failed to place it in my to go bag. Unfortunately I was passing through and it wouldn't have made since for me to travel all the way back through Houston traffic for a brownie. I feel kinda bad giving a three star rating but I just couldn't push myself to give a full four star rating. If I could give half stars I would have given a 3.5 rating.
