JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We usually come to Jinya for Sunday lunch.  Don't compare it to NYC or Tokyo, but It's still one of the better ramen in Houston.  I would give Jinya a 4 star at previous visits. But yesterday, it's a no more than 2 star rating.  Both tonkatsu broth and the chicken broth base were really sallty and lacked any depth; tasted like  salt water with MSG (?).  We were all extremely thirsty after the meal, my tongue felt raw for hours, I think from the salt and or MSG.  Asian eateries sometimes cut corner by adding MSG to their cooking to "enhance" flavor. I hope this is not the case and hope that it's just because the kitchen was off today. We all noticed it was off, from grown-ups to kids!
