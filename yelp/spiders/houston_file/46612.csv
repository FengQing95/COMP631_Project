Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond is definitely my favorite pastry spot in Houston! I love the deal they're running where their pastries are all 50% in the hour before they close everyday. The pistachio croissant is definitely my favorite. I also like the chocolate walnut cookie.
