JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Beautiful place, the ambiance was great. Perfect lighting and the attention to detail is on point. My first time experience was over all great, sweet staff and the food was phenomenal. I ordered the #2 spicy chicken which was delicious, pricing is very affordable. Great place to eat with a group of friends!
