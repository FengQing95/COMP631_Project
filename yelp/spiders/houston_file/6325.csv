JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had only tried Ramen soup one other time in Seattle and let's just say that I was hesitant about trying it again. Well I am glad I did! Their Spicy Chicken Ramen was delicious. I got their "medium" level of spicy and it was still really spicy (I love spicy food and my tolerance is pretty high), but good.
