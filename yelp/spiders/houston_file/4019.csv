JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Aisha - Thanks for your review. I happen to agree that loud music in our dining room isn't for everyone. In fact, I prefer dinner over soft music; however, JINYA's restaurant concept is geared towards a trendy, loud atmosphere. And this is, unfortunately, one of the many guidelines we are legally bound to follow as a JINYA franchise. Nevertheless, I am very happy to know you enjoyed our fare and other aspects of our house. And we hope to serve you again in the near future.
