Kata Robata////Caveat emptor:  I'm a nigiri eater and a picky one at that when it comes to freshness.  But their fish was fresh and the rice well prepared, and they have good rolls here, too.  Oh, and they can sear their nigiri - try the saba seared.  And if they have golden snapper, get that seared as well.
