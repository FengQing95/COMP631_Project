JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the "cha cha cha garlic lovers" ramen, hmm maybe my buzzed kicked in, but i don't remember even tasting garlic in it, but I love garlic. So a little bit ain't going to hype my taste buds. It's not super garlicky, but it was freaking delicious. I wish they would let me sub the thick noodles for some thin ones, bc I'm not about the "getting full off noodles" life. I like to eat multiple different things. The meat in the ramen was not as tender as it normally is this time around.
