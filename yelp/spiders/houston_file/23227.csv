Uchi////As for the food, my girlfriend and I tried the omakase, which came out to be $150 per person with tax. We were fed about 11 dishes including dessert, but in all honesty, only 2 of the dishes really stuck with me (one of them being the impeccable dessert). While I understand that Uchi is innovated in trying new dishes that combines Japanese elements with western ones, the overall quality and quantity of the omakase fell short of spectacular. Considering the price tag, the sushi tasted less than amazing compared to similar priced omakase at MF sushi, which definitely blew me away. The freshness of the fish, the portion size, and the choice of dishes presented in the omakase just fell short of what I expected to be the best sushi experience in Houston.
