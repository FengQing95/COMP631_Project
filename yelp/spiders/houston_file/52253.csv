Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is tough. I gave 3 stars because overall the food is honestly fire but it is my duty as a single bro to let fellow SB's know that this place is crawling with couples. Not dope. Lost my appetite feeling out of place (lonely). I thought my waitress was single at first because I thought she was into me but she wasn't. Obviously never coming back here when dennys full of single babes. Not Vance approved. Also this me looking fly.
