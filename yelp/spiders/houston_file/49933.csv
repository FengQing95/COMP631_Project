Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is totally the new hot spot for brunch in Houston.  Be warned that if you come here on the weekend be prepared to spend half your day here.  The wait is quite long (we waited 2 hours on a Sunday morning) and service is a bit slow because it's so busy.  In total we spent nearly 4 hours brunching!
