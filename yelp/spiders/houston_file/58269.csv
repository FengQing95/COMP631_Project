Kata Robata////1. Bone Marrow (4/5; pickled mustard seeds, pickled onions, panko, red miso, bonito flakes): Three huge bone marrow pieces with plenty to share. The bone marrow, itself, is a bit plain and buttery. I recommend you combine the mustard seeds, pickled onions, and lime juice to fully enjoy the flavors and textures.
