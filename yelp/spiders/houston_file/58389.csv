Baby Barnaby's////i love baby barnaby's and barnaby's!!! the brunch is great. i got the french toast and a side of bacon. my husband got the breakfast plate that has eggs and meat and bread. i didn't taste his food but it was eggs and bacon and he ate it all very quick so i'm guessing it was good. the bacon i got was perfect. nice and thick but also crispy (just the way i like it). the french toast was a lot. my only problem with is was that it was a little cold. i think it's because of our waiter.
