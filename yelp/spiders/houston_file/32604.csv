Local Foods////My friend and fellow Yelper suggested we try Local Foods for our Friday lunch and all week long I was looking forward to ordering the Asian Chicken Salad and boy it was worth the wait! Â I have been on a salad kick lately and always on the hunt for a good salad - this was not just a good salad - it was SCRUMPTIOUS!
