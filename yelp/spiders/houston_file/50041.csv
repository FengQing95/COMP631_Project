Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Chile Benny Verde: This Benedict twist had delicious pulled pork and Hollandaise and is practically a breakfast enchilada. It's better with one of their special hot sauces. I'd get it again, but the hashbrown cake falls flat. Good hashbrowns aren't pretty; they have a high surface area so they get all buttery on all the sides.
