Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I generally hate giving 1-star reviews, unless it is really deserved, hence my two star rating. To start off, the wait is WAY too long for what it offers. Not the restaurant's fault, but man, y'all are overhyping this place. I think we waited about 90 minutes for a table, which is our fault for sleeping in, but after that long of a wait, the food better SMACK. When we finally got our table, our waitress was very kind and attentive to our needs, so I appreciated that. She helped us with the menu, since my girlfriend and I had never been before. We wanted to branch out of our comfort zone in terms of food. I wasn't going to just have your typical 2-egg breakfast after a 90 minute wait. My gf had the smashed avocado eggs Benedict and I had the sweet potato mashup. The Benedict dish was not great; the tomato was perhaps not fresh? Not sure but it had an awful taste, so we picked around it. Besides that, it was just ok. The hash browns were the only redeeming aspect of that plate. The sweet potato mashup was very disappointing; I guess I didn't understand what this dish was before ordering it, but what I got was an undercooked sweet potato sliced in half with a few avocado slices and 1/4 strip of diced bacon on top. I think we would have been better off going to Denny's and getting a Grand Slam...
