Uchi////lets start with the service.  the front of house is literally the best thing about the restaurant.  the guest service is impeccable, they really have not left any detail out from seating to valet to wait-staff, this place is run like a 5 star restaurant.  it gets a little too loud in there (might be the layout) and i dont like how there really isnt any privacy for the guests (shortback booths, very open-air), but restrooms are sanitary and they use the good paper towels.
