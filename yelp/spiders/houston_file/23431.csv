Uchi////Based on the review I read, three of us went to Uchi around 5:30pm on Friday night. But the host told us need one and half an hour. Then we put our name and walk around. You know, we are raving for food. Do you think it will a good idea try some other food before go to Uchi? Then we went to Aladdin, finished two plates of food and came back. Our reservation was ready!
