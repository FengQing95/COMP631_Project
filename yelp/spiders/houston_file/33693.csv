Local Foods////Came here after an appointment at the vet . The outside deck/ sitting area is dog friendly. The building is pretty big and the layout is great. Ordering was easy and so is choosing your beverages. I ordered the green pozole and turkey sandwich. Both were amazing. Will definitely come back.
