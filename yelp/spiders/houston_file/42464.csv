Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I sit and have the chocolate croissant...amazing!  So flakey, delicious, and the chocolate was off the charts good!  The salted caramel macaroon I ordered wasn't in my take away box...hm.  I do stay till lunch and order the grilled cheese and soup.  O...M...G...the grilled cheese sandwich is amazing!  The bread, the cheese...wow!  The food really makes up for all the kinks...wow...the bread is out of this world!  I mean it's all very simple tasting, but the quality is amazing.  I'm really impressed.  I can't remember the last time I had so much bread...that bread...and I can't remember the last time I had an entire sandwich in one sitting...that bread...mm mm mm...
