Kata Robata////Wow, what a lunch! I am ashamed that it took me this long to get here after all of the solid reviews I've read, but I'm here to tell ya - it's no hype! I have found a new favorite lunch place. Their lunch menu has a great variety - sushi/sashimi, bento boxes with fish or kobe beef, ramen and other noodle dishes. My friend got the bento box (which was huge!) and I got the Tokontsu Ramen (only available on their lunch menu). Both were amazing. I loved the ramen - especially amazing were the eggs. They had the perfect texture and awesome flavor.
