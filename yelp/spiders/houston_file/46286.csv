Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Oh my goodness! This place was delicious. We came here on a recommendation. Brunch on a Saturday for 3 people and a baby. The line was long, but moved at a good pace. Be prepared to have some patience. The parking lot was pretty full (naturally) so be prepared to have patience here as well. But, once you're in, that's when it all becomes worth it!
