JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your review. I'm sorry for your negative experience today at our Midtown location. We do our best to accommodate all of our guests quickly; however, there are some days, especially during lunch or dinner rush, when more than 20 or 30 guests arrive simultaneously, which happened today.
