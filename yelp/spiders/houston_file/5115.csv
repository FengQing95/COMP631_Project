JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Food was extremely delicious!! We haven't been this excited about food in awhile and I was thrilled to know that my boyfriend and little sister enjoyed their food. Even the ginger dressing was a nice addition, which we hesitated and felt disappointed they did not have other options, but try it! It's different than what you expect from ginger dressing.
