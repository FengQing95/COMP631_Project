Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went to Bosscat for the first time this evening and was served by the most amazing server waiter named Terry! All of his recommendations were on point! As far as cocktails went,I started off with the Bosscat Vol.2,and then moved to the Kerouac. Seeing as how there were three of us he suggested that we start off with the meatloaf,the pig candy and the hush puppies,all were amazing! For dinner I ordered the Bosscat burger and it was divine! Amazing flavor profile! Can't wait to come back again and dine with this awesome server! Great establishment and Terry rawks!!
