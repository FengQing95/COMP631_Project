Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I came here recently with a friend for Sunday brunch. We had been wanting to check it out for a while - he had been before for drinks and appetizers but never brunch and this was my first time altogether. We made a reservation for 11:30am because it was Father's Day (the hostess told me they were heavily booked but had a cancellation and could squeeze us in). I think on any other Sunday it'd be okay to walk-in. It's a nice place with a casual, laid back vibe.
