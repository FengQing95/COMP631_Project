Uchi////The restaurant is dimly lit with a nice ambience that can suit romantic, corporate or group dinners. The servers are all extremely knowledgeable about the food and can recommend anything on the menu based on your tastes. What Uchi does extremely well is their cooked and raw fish plates. I personally would not recommend ordering any of the hand rolls. This isn't because they aren't great, but there are so many other more delicious things vying for the space in your stomach. The hamachi nabe, which is yellowtail tuna and rice with an egg is the best thing that I had during that dinner-I still dream about it! Even the dessert (the fried milk) was really good, and I usually don't like desserts at Japanese restaurants.
