Baby Barnaby's////Luckily, we beat the rush when we arrived, and there was only one person ahead of us waiting for a table. Even so, we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated, in the FREEZING outside. There's one heat lamp for the whole patio area, and my girlfriends and I crowded around it. Still, it barely kept the tops of our heads warm. And we were in the way of all the service staff that, for whatever reason, needed to walk into the closed Barnaby's next door every couple of minutes. So really, I don't know why they had the heat lamp out there at all, but if they are going to bother using it, it should be in a better location.
