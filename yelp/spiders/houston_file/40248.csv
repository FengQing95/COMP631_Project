Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////They are a whiskey bar, with a proud and handsome display of whiskey bottles that lines one of the walls in a glass-walled room in the center of the restaurant. As such, they have a lengthy cocktail list with a lot of whiskey-based drinks (see attached pictures). I ordered a cocktail (a gin-based one), and it came flourished with a strawberry candy belt, which I found particularly fun and a delicious addition to the drink.
