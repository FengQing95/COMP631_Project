Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place is the sh*t. The food is incredible, the whiskey selection is a dream come true, and the service is always spot on. For my latest visit, we had Terry as a server, and he was awesome and made the best recommendations. If you come here and do not get the Pulled Pork Hush Puppies, your life is not complete. Haha. Seriously though, they are heaven in your mouth. I also ordered the Chef's burger, and it easily competes as one of the best burgers I've ever had. Two thumbs way way up for all things this place delivers. And now, home to slip into a sweet and beautiful food coma.
