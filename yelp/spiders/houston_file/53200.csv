Kata Robata////The current happy hour menu is pretty bare, 4 rolls (California, other blah ones I can't remember), edamame, and calamari. We ordered edamame and calamari to start with. Edamame- standard. The calamari was coated in something besides standard bread crumbs or panko, it was crunchy and very good. All the pieces were huge too, so we filled up a bit on that. Their dinner menu is pretty long, with different rolls, dinner entrees, and a set of hot rock dishes that the restaurant is named after. We only ordered rolls and seaweed salads, they were pretty standard but I liked that the seaweed salad was served on a long plate instead of in a bowl.
