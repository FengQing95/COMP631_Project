Local Foods////Local Foods is my all time favorite sandwich place in Houston! Their sandwiches are relatively healthy and you can taste the quality and freshness of all the ingredients. My top 3 sandwiches are the crunchy chicken, quinoa burger, and the shrimp & crab.  The sides change seasonally but I always look forward to seeing the chicken lemongrass soup on the menu. For any Thai food lovers, this soup is to die for.  It has creaminess from the coconut milk and the tangy from the lemongrass making it a winning combo. I also like the beet sides as well. Next time you are near a Local Foods it is worth trying.
