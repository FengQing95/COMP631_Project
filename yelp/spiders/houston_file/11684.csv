JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered Jinya's Tonkatsu Black and replaced their noodles with thick noodles as recommended by the waitress and fellow yelpers and after trying it, I can see why. The broth was great, not too salty like other places I have been to. Although I liked their marinated egg, Austin's Ramen Tatsuya takes the lead on that one. We also ordered their Takoyaki for the appetizer. Although I'm typically not a fan of Takoyaki, there's was the best I have tried. My one complaint about this was that the appetizer came out the same time our ramen did so it wasn't much of an appetizer. Will definitely come here again next time I'm in Houston.
