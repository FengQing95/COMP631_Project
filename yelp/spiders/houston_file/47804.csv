Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So after waiting which seemed like 30ish min, the couple next to us seated at the bar said we can have their seats since they were done. Awesome! The wait time definitely was still like another hr or more. So as we are trying to sit down I can clearly see MARIAH have this look on her face like she didn't want us to sit there. Even the person I was with was like "what's her problem, I'm not feeling her vibe". MARIAH, again in that "sh*tty tone" told us to take our name of the wait list. Now at this point I was gonna hit her with "no sh;t bish" but I don't even care because I'm hungry and can finally sit and look at a menu. So MARIAH proceeds to ask if we wanted another drink while handing out menus. I order a water and my friend orders another pineapple mimosa. Now I'm seated literally right next to the area where you order drinks at the bar. So people are coming up every now and then. We are still browsing the menu (again we're 1st timers) when MARIAH asks if we're ready, like don't rush me, chill out. We finally order and wait for the food. Another 35min.
