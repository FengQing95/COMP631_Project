Baby Barnaby's////My husband ordered the Annie's low carb low far burrito. I had this last time and loved it so I recommended it to him. It's egg whites, chicken breast, and black beans wrapped in whole wheat tortilla and it comes w salsa, guacamole, and fresh sliced tomatoes on the side. Indeed super healthy! The tomatoes are very fresh as well, not mushy.
