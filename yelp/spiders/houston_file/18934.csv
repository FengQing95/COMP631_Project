Uchi////- Uchi Salad - it amazes me how such a simple dish as this could be so refreshingly delicious and flavorful.  As the Japanese version of chips and dip, the Uchi salad reinvents my perception of salads.  Hydroponic baby romaine lettuce leaves sprinkled with sea salt pairs so well with the lightly sweet edamame-jalapeno dip.  Each bite has you craving for more.
