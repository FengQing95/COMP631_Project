Uchi////I had been to Uchi back in 2012 when it first opened and it was good but it didn't leave me feeling like I needed to come back. I came back after almost 8 years and this time the experience was unbelievable. We had reservations but we still ended up having to wait a little. The staff was so courteous and apologetic about the wait. It was a Wednesday night but it was packed even after being open for so long and coronavirus looming on people's minds. Once we sat down the staff brought us some free appetizers to makeup for the wait which was so sweet. We ordered a ton of food since there was six of us. I can't even remember all the names but everything was a gastronomical epiphany. My favorites were Brussel sprouts, walu walu, octopus, zero sen roll, and the fried milk dessert. The walu walu was out of this world. The food, the ambience and the service makes this place stand out over most of the Japanese restaurants in town and they have some stiff competition with Kata Robata and MF sushi but i think they have an edge over them. Even though they have expanded and been around for a decade now, they haven't lost their touch
