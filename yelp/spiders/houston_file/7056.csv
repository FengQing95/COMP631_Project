JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I typically start off with the shishito peppers (not spicy at all but I have gotten a killer once in a while) then the tonkatsu spicy ramen with the thick noodles. Make it a combo with the Pork chashu bowl & salad, you will NOT be disappointed. The Pork chashu is a small portion served with rice and an egg. LITERALLY my favorite, I enjoy that little bowl even more than I enjoy their ramen.
