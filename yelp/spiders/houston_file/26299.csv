The Pit Room////Dang this place is expensive.  My bad for not checking the board on the prices.  I walked up and said I'll have two beef ribs.  Beef ribs have a lot of bone so you're paying a hefty price for the meat AND the bone.  Maybe that's okay if you have a dog but if not, ouch.  I ordered two beef ribs and an order of potato salad with water.  The price was $44.  Good grief.  No two beef ribs and potato salad are worth $44.  I won't be back.
