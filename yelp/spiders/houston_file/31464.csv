Local Foods////To me- the name of this restaurant and the ambiance that they go for would lead me to believe that this place would be more vegetarian/vegan friendly and would have a lot of vegetable based dishes in addition to meat based dishes- but I must say that in this regard this place was disappointing. Â I did not actually try the food- so perhaps it isn't even fair for me to review it- but my experience was upsetting as a vegan who wanted at least a couple of good vegan options from a place called "local" and whose first menu item listed on Yelp is "Vegan Chili".... If you are a carnivore- this place might be wonderful.
