Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Visited Houston from Baltimore last week for 5 days. 3 of those days was spent eating breakfast/brunch at Snooze. We ordered the flight pancakes. Blueberry, pineapple upside down, sweet potato and an extra cinnamon roll. Not sure which one was better because I ate them all at the same time. I ate them so fast that I didn't even get to snap a pic (sorry yelp). I will say that they could also serve as dessert with a side of ice cream.
