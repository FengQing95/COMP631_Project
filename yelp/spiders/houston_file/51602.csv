Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Wait is a pain in the *ss.  I was here over a year ago and waited 2 hours so it took me a while to come back.  This time it was a 45-1 hour, which was what they quoted me on the two hour wait but actually this time it was fulfilled.  Parking is pretty much street curb unless you get lucky to park on their half of the parking lot.
