JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////However, we would like to respectfully disagree with you about Houston as "not much of a ramen city." In terms of choices for ramen, where Houston is today and where it was just a few years ago is vastly different, which should be cause for celebration. And given the demand we've seen for our ramen, I can only expect the supply to increase in the years to come.
