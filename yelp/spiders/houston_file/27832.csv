The Pit Room////We were so happy that we added this stop to our trip to Houston.  Number one it was delicious but the atmosphere was great and the service was awesome too.  We sampled a ton off the menu and each dish was fantastic.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and it's one of the best I've ever had.
