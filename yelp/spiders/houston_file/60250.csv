Baby Barnaby's////One of the best breakfast places I've been too!  I had their green eggs dish and it was the best I ever had.  The spinach artichoke in the eggs gave it a good creamy texture, like it melted in my mouth!  The apple sausage had a good combination of sweet and savory and it had a good smokiness to it!  What I notice about the toast and bacon was that it was really thick!  They didn't give me any thin slices of bacon and toast.  The potatoes were ok as well.  Overall Rating, very satisfied and if I had my last breakfast meal on earth, I would come here!  I highly recommend this place!
