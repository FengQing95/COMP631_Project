JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Belly G, Thank you for providing our 750th review. We appreciate it! I also want to thank you for the fair and accurate description of a typical wait-time here at JINYA. Sunday lunch service can get pretty busy, sometimes filling to capacity in less than 15 mins. This usually happens right after church lets out, and unfortunately it can also make seating a party of 6 or more a little challenging.
