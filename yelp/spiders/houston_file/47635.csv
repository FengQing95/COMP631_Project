Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Thursday morning brunch with a friend: arrived 9:15 and the two of us were seated at 9:50. Waiting on noisy Montrose Blvd wasn't fun and it was a bit too noisy inside also for me. We tried Eggs Benedict, Burrito, French Toast, and all the food was pretty good. Coffee was free refills. Service was excellent. The atmosphere was lacking a bit though... I like that they hadn't squeezed other tables into the open areas so it felt roomy, but the seating areas were a bit cramped, and there was a lack of character about the place. Overall if you have time to wait in line, definitely put your name on the waiting list and run some errands locally... They'll text you when your table is ready.
