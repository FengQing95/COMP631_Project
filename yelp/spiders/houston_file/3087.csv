JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love the atmosphere Â and location. Located in great looking part of Downtown (with lots of light ). My wife and I ate here 3 times in one week. Each time was better than the last. Noodles are great and broth was amazing! Probably won't eat Ramen for rest of year. But if we do, we're coming to Jinya.
