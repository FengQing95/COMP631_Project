Kata Robata////Inferiority, thy name is Kata Robata. We tried the "omakase"  or chef's choice and to put it simply, it sucked octopus balls.  Usually, omakase entails some creative/whimsical offerings from the chef accompanied by some items that are on the menu.  Instead, we only got items from the menu which is not a terrible thing, but the dishes bordered from mildly pleasant to inedible.
