Kata Robata////Outside of sushi though, their oxtail ramen is also enough reason to come. The broth is strong, but not because it's very salty or heavy in flavoring. It's that depth of flavor you get from hours of simmering. At peak hours parking here does get annoying though so I'd recommend carpooling if possible.
