Uchi////-Walu Walu (escolar w/ candied citrus)- This is the only hot tasting we actually had and it really was great. The crisp on the outside of the fish was perfect. They must marinate this fish forever because the white part of fish was a flavor explosion, which I feel is pretty rare. I'm not sure what the candied citrus was, but it looked like mango, which doesn't make sense, but I don't care, it was amazing.
