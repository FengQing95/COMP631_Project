Kata Robata////Love love love this place. Every time I come to Houston I drop in. We had the hamachi and yellow tail sashimi in ponzu sauce,  ocean picante roll, tropical tuna roll, and the toro roll. I think the toro roll can be skipped because it doesn't taste like much but everything else was fresh and crisp perfection. I had never had their green tea soufflé cheesecake with red bean ice cream and sad that I missed out on this yummy dessert before. If you are wanting great sushi then check out KAta robata.
