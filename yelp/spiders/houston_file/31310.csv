Local Foods////Been wanting to try this place for a while and was not disappointed.  I got the roast beef sandwich with harseradish aoili. It was, hands down, the best sandwich I have ever had. I had to use like 10 or 12 napkins as the horseradish aoili dribbled down my hands. The beef tasted like beef tenderloin - so, so tender. Bright red perfect tomato slices, a layer of the kale salad and a curried cauliflower finished off the sandwich between toasted wheat bread in an indescribably perfect way. Unfortunately the Texas Tomato Soup i got as my side was so oversalted it rendered the soup completely inedible. My husband also got the soup and we agreed we couldn't eat it. We walked it back up to the counter and the guy offered us other options in lieu of the tomato soup and offered us a free dessert. Our free butterscotch brownie was amazing! Yum! Hopefully the tomato soup was an aberration.  I look forward to tryiing more! I am not exaggerating when I say that the sandwich was the best sandwich I've ever had.
