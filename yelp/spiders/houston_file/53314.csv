Kata Robata////I've been here quite a few times strictly for lobster mac'n'cheese.  Took quite awhile to strip my wife away from Kubo's to give this place a chance.  Of course with Chef Horiuchi's previous employer at our favorite joint, didn't take long before we became enamored with this lovely restaurant.  Kata is a great place to people-watch!  However, I go to restaurants to eat, not stare at people.  Eating here on the weekends can often get frustrating having to wait long to get a table.  I've learned just to either eat here on Wednesday nights or enjoy a Sunday brunch like we did today where you can kick back, have a bite of uni and drink of sake, and relax.  For those who have never been, it's very trendy-looking inside.  The wait-staff are dressed well enough to go clubbing.  The design is modern/contemporary.  There's no dress-code per se, but you'll feel underdressed walking in with shorts, tanktops, and sand-filled sandals (as I had done before straight from a beach trip).
