Uchi////Then next up was machi cure (smoked yellowtail, yuca crisp, marcona almond, asian pear) Â for me. The awesome part was that Jose picked the vegetarian version for my girlfriend which was the veggie cure (yuca crisp, avocado, marcona almond, asian pear). This dish was the one where we basically realized this was not your normal food affair. The flavors were perfectly balanced. There was some salty, some sweet. Not only that but the textures were also great contrasts with the crispy and the soft. It was just everything a complex dish should be.
