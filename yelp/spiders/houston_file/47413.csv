Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Big portions, a creative brunch menu with a Â daily pancake special, and a nice mix of hearty and healthy options makes Snooze great for brunch with a large or small group. The Havana Dreaming sandwich (an open faced cuban sandwich with an egg on top) was delicious, as was the eggs benny duo (two takes on eggs Benedict). The pancakes we had were HUGE, but fluffy and light. If you're going on a weekend, book off lots of time because the wait will be insane. Loss of a star for the long waits and weak coffee.
