JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My waitress was very kind though, along with everyone else in the restaurant. All the girls do a very good job at greeting the patrons as they enter and being accommodating. I especially appreciated that my server gladly took my ramen back to the kitchen to reduce the spiciness!
