Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place is absolutely amazing. The personable service is what really gets me. I'm not just another costumer eating out. Literally within the 30 mins I was here 3 different people asked us how we were and made us laugh. Terry took us on wonderful little whiskey tour which had us laughing and brightened our day! The food is just as amazing as the service. I recommend the mimosas and the donut burger.
