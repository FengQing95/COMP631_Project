Uchi////Uchi Houston was kind of a let down in comparison to Uchi Dallas. My husband and I used to live in Dallas and seriously that location was absolutely amazing. We were blown away by the variety of unique dishes on the menu and the large selection they offered. One of our favorites there was the Kamo Nabe (Duck confit over crispy rice and kale topped with an egg yolk, with a Korean chili-black pepper sauce added tableside). Unfortunately, they do not offer this dish at this location in Houston and we felt like we didn't have much to choose from. At least they still offer the classics and my personal favorites 1) Hot Rock (Wagyu beef and ponzu) 2) Hokkaido & Santa Barbara Uni 3) Sake Toro (Salmon belly) and 4) Foie Gras.
