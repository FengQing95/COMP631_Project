Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Brunch on a Sat, got there right at 2:30pm and I was still seated, never rushed and the staff were all very friendly still! I loveddd the hashbrowns! Gravy was so yummy N made just right. Lots of items to chose from.. I will def be back. Parking is just not the best. I wish they served bottled water!
