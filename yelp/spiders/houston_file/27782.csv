The Pit Room////Earlier in the pandemic, we pulled up to the drive through to order. Prior to pulling up we called multiple times and no one answered so we decided to go and order. And as we were getting ready to order, the girl working the drive through told us in a very rude tone "it works better if you call ahead" and made us pull out of the drive through, go call and then come back. Here's the issue, we called literally more than 10 times and no one was answering when we left the drive through. So we pulled back up into the drive through, told her the issue, and she reluctantly and rudely took our order without even apologizing for the whole inconvenience she caused us. What's the point of a drive through if you aren't willing to take an order! It wasn't even busy and If people are calling ahead, that's just curbside pickup and you need to answer your phone. she was extremely rude and made a couple comments in an unfriendly tone and manner. Customer service is key and they have greatly disappointed me and lost our business.
