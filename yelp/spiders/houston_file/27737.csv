The Pit Room////Once you exit your car in the parking lot and walk to the building, you can already smell the great fresh BBQ smoked smell. We were quickly greeted by the friendly staff upon arrival, the menu is posted up on the wall or you can grab a menu while waiting in line. I ended up ordering the Pork sausage (jalapeno cheddar) and had mustard potato salad and mac Â n cheese for my sides.
