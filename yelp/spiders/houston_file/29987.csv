The Pit Room////Highly recommend this spot if visiting Houston! It's def some authentic Texas bbq for sure! It has a restaurant portion and also a bar portion as well, you can take your food to the bar area and sit down and have some drinks. I got a one meat dinner with two sides. The brisket is so tender and juicy! Barbecue sauce is on the tangy side but very good! My boyfriend got the pork ribs as well and was amazed! We will be returning when we come back to Houston
