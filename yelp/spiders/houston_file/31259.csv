Local Foods////i would give up fast food forever if i could eat here everyday! their crunchy chicken sandwich is amazing as most of the side dishes. Of course you can't go wrong with the kale salad. Another favorite of mine is the four bean salad and I am not a beans fan at all. It is refreshingly light for having four kinds of beans in it. The cucumber salad and cabbage slaw are also delicious. Service was good as everyone was super friendly and helpful. Usually there is a line around lunch time but it dwindles down pretty quickly. def a go to place for a healthy meal.
