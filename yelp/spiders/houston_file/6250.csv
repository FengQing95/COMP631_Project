JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////No shortage of ramen/pho places in Houston but there is a shortage of fully VEGETARIAN broth! This place has just that! They have a Vegan and Vegetarian Ramen option which was great because for once, I had a choice to choose between just one option. I went with vegeterian, it was fresh, flavorful (add hot sauce) and was cheap! for $10 you get a huge bowl of ramen with essentially a salad on top. My first time having ramen as well, and I'd give the experience a thumbs up. Beware, on a weekend this place is crowded. For a party of 2, I waited 30mins on a Saturday night at 9pm.
