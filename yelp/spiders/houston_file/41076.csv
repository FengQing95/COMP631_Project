Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////fantastic european pastry shop. oh boy, do i crave these delicious goodies all the time. fresh squeezed OJ and delicious coffee. if i had anything negative to say it would only be their choice of annoying music does not fit the atmosphere and i wish their chocolate chip cookies didn't have walnuts...lol
