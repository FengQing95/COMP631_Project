Uchi////Kara Kyuri ($6): 2/5 Ah, if a mixed drink could taste like a shoe department store, it would be this one. Also no hint of thai chillies, although I imagine it would've helped. I also noticed the description for this drink excludes "yuzu" on the sake social menu, but "yuzu" is included on the description in the main drink menu. Thought it might've been a typo, but I tasted no yuzu. Interesting...
