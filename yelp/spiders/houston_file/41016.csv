Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The music is so overpowering that you will not be able to carry on a conversation with your tablemates. I just don't understand why management would want to create such an unpleasant dining experience. Sure, I love Jimi Hendrix, but when I go out for brunch, I want to hear my friends and not Jimi's astounding cover of "All Along the Watchtower" (for the millionth time). Keep the music low and ambient. Â
