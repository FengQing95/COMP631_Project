Kata Robata////There are a number of excellent sushi restaurants in and around Houston and Kata Robata should certainly be considered amongst those that are an at least once visited. Firstly let's start with the diversity of the sushi menu which is prpobably the best way to judge the volume of the best sushi bars. Kata Robata has both the predictable standby's such as Hamachi (yellowtail) and Sake (salmon not rice wine) but likewise seasonal favorites such as Uni (urchin is always best with a quail egg BTW) and Fresh Amaebo (should be ordered in multiples hence Amebi) quite sweet and when the heads are deveined and fried correctly (as they were in this case) an absolute balance...a shrimp Yin Yang.
