JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Sam - Thank you very much for the 5-star review. We greatly appreciate it! And I'm very pleased to know you enjoyed our Spicy Chicken Ramen, which is definitely a fan favorite around here. I am grateful as well that you are so understanding when it comes to our extended wait times during peak hours. We are soon opening a third location in Katy, which may alleviate some of the crowds at Midtown.
