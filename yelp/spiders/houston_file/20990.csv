Uchi////HAPPY. HOUR. And yes, you can make reservations. Otherwise, you will be waiting an hour and half (which, honestly the wait is still worth it). Fried milk was even better than I imagined. Foie gras at ten bucks a pop just melts in your mouth. Machi cure is soo good. We ordered two. Brussels sprouts were delicious. I can't wait to go back.
