Haven't had a better "sandwich" anywhere here in Houston. They are right to call them gourmet sandwiches, because that's what they really are. If you order a sandwich you also get to choose two sides or a cup of soup. I chose the couscous and the cabbage slaw. Both tasted very unique and like nothing I ever had so far. The couscous was perfect and went well with those pickled carrots. And the slaw was pretty damn good too.
