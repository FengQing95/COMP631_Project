Kata Robata////My current favorite place for sushi in Houston.  We ordered a little of everything, with focus on nigiri to get an idea of how fresh the fish was.  The yellowtail, mackerel and salmon were some of the best we've ever had.  KR focuses on simple dishes with fresh fish imo.  We sat at the sushi bar during happy hour and the chefs and waiter were very friendly the entire time.  Our meal was about $60 but we enjoyed everything we ordered.
