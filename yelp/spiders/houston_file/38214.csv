Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came here for brunch and thought it was great decided to come back after few months to try dinner. I didn't get the Houston restaurant week dishes since it had mixed reviews for the fish and the steak. We got the poutine and the pig candy and it was pretty good for bar food. For entrees we got the short rib which is pretty much the same meat that was on top of the poutine. So it was pretty but repeated. The burger was ok even though we did the chefs way. The service was just ok. Â The waiter needed to be reminded severAl times for refills and the dirty plates were not all cleared at once even though we were all done with our meal.
