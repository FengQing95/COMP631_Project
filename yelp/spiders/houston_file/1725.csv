JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Modern and trendy atmosphere, average service and pretty good food! The broth was rich and creamy and tasted delicious, and the egg was cooked to perfection! The ramen noodles were also cooked well and had a great consistency and texture. Although our waitress forgot a part of our order and we were not checked up on that often, it wasn't an unpleasant experience. Would recommend to others! Above average ramen in the Houston area!
