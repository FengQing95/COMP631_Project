JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////After hearing about JINYA for some time, I was finally willing to give it a try since its location is prime for anyone that works downtown. I have to say I was not blown away. My favorite part of the whole meal was the JINYA bun, which is probably the only thing I would reorder. For ramen, I had the Tonkotsu White (with no spicy sauce). I felt like the broth just didn't have as much taste as I was expecting, especially since it was both chicken and beef brother. The chasu was really good and made the ramen enjoyable but none of the other ingredients really stood out to me.
