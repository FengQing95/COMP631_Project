JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Best ramen I've ever had. Stopped by chance when visiting Houston for work. Had the pork bun and garlic ramen. Bun was out of this world and ramen was just as good. For $2 more you can add additional noodles once you've run out - do it!!! Also a great beer selection. Will definitely go again if I'm in Houston.
