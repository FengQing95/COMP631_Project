Uchi////There's not much you can go wrong with when ordering the sashimi/sushi bc their ingredients are always fresh. Omakase is a good experience if you like their daily specials of the day. I noticed that the chef omakase was basically just whatever was on that menu so if you don't like what that looks like, don't get it and wait for another day because it is always changing.
