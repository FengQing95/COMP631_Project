Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////While the savory dishes at Common Bond are always delicious, the pastries are just okay in my opinion. Went for coffee with some girlfriends and the lavender latte was delicious (the coffee is always top-notch), but the pistachio croissant was mediocre. It comes with this pistachio marzipan type filling and its an overkill of sweetness. The coffee is already sweet then you add an overly sweet croissant, there's a lack of balance and I personally could only eat a couple of bites before feeling sick. If lots of sugar is your thing, go for it, but I'll stick to a plain croissant next time!
