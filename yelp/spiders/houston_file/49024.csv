Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place sucks. Honestly, the food here are things I could have easily made at home. Everyone was telling me how good this place was. Well, after waiting an hour and a half before even getting to sit down, we ordered different plates which were all unimpressive. Food was average. There's no way in hell this place is worth waiting for. Save your money and your time and go somewhere else. Also, service sucked. The waiter treated us as if we were a bother. Screw this place. I will be sure and tell everyone how much this place sucks.
