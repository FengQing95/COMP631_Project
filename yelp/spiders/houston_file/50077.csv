Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food - I think the sweet potato hash was the best dish out of the 4 we ordered. It was simple and tasty; it was a little spicy due to the Korean Gochujang, but this added a nice additional taste. Perhaps I am biased in this sense as I mostly prefer the simpler items so that I can taste whatever the dish is centered around and not just sauce or extra filling. It was also the most portioned size as in not too large or too small. The huevos rancheros came out much larger than expected (3 eggs) but overall they were good. We asked for less cheese. I was not impressed by the sweet potato pancakes because they tasted like pure butter to me. It came covered in caramel syrup, which was a little overpowering, and you couldn't really taste any sweet potato. However, the side blueberry pancake was nice. It was covered with a little powered sugar and came with a side of maple syrup. I could actually taste pancake and blueberry, unlike the previous dish.
