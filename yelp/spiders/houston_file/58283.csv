Baby Barnaby's////The food was simple but outstanding. The Green Eggs are fantastic. The "fresh squeezed" OJ is literally made minutes after you order it. The staff is extremely friendly and very attentive without being intrusive. Seems to often be a bit of a wait (word's getting around) but they have a quick turnover and coffee while you wait. Highly recommended.
