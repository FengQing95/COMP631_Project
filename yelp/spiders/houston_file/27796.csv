The Pit Room////I recently went back to The Pit Room for lunch and I was most disappointed than before. Maybe they were just having an off day, but the brisket was fatty and chewy. The sausage did not blow my mind and pork rib was not as fall of the bone. Maybe the food had been sitting out too long. I was just expecting a bit better. I will give cudos to the turkey. It was great!
