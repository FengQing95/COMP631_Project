Uchi////Have loved Austin Uchi over the years; this was our first visit to Houston Uchi, in former Felix's building where I first fell in love with Tex-Mex in the 70's. We arrived early, sat outside in very comfortable setting with a bottle of the reasonable and medium-bodied Altos Tempranillo. We did not wait too long, love the layout of the restaurant, much more conducive to conversation than Uchi Austin. Rihanna took great care of us, working carefully around my wife's IBS-D dietary limitations: hot rock wagyu beef, walu walu, hamas chili, sea bream sushi (best clean taste sushi ever), salmon sushi, and wagyu beef sushi (a real surprise). Banana sorbet and honeydew sorbet were perfect ending with French press coffee. Tab was $180 before tip. EASILY the best meal we had in 3 nights and 4 days in Houston.
