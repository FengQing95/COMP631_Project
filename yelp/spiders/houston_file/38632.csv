Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My boyfriend and I went here with high expectations since we had seen and heard a lot of good things. We went during brunch and got the tatchos and the shrimp and grits and a couple drinks. The tatchos were not as advertised, they had no cheese on them and basically tasted like extremely salty chili tots with an egg. Nothing special. The shrimp and grits just tastes like it a can of salsa was poured on it. No interesting flavors or seasoning. very small portion of the grits.
