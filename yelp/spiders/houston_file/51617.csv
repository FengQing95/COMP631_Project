Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the Snooze Classic with over easy eggs, pulled pork, hash browns and sour dough toast.  The toast was good... wished I had another piece. The eggs were a little too easy... when I cut the first bite a bunch of clear liquid ran out from the eggs all over my plate.  The pork was tender but I needed a little salsa or hot sauce.  I loved the hash browns... very flavorful.
