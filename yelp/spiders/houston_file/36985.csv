Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Just came for brunch and had one of the most delicious meals I've ever had! I'm a huge burger and chocolate fan, their Bosscat burger is one of the best in Houston and their Nutella Chocolate S'mores pancakes are any chocolate lover's dream. We sat at the bar, but all of the bartenders (especially Brooke!) made our experience even more fun! We will absolutely be coming back!
