Kata Robata////My friend insist that we go here because the Ramen place we wanted to go to was too far of a drive. We had Ramen here and it was decent.  My husband love their broth (it was his first Ramen in houston)  but it wasn't my favorite. Our waitress was great and the atmosphere was decent. I wish we had try other stuff on the menus but definitely next time we'll  be back to try the sushi.
