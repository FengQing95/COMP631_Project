Uchi////1.) Heated cocktail patio, and shorter-than-anticipated wait times - Whether you have a reservation or not (they only accept a limited number per night), you can spend your time waiting for your table drinking sake on their heated 'cocktail patio'. Â Both times I've gone, I've shown up on Friday between 5:45 and 6 without a reservation, and have still been seated with half an hour to make the happy hour cutoff.
