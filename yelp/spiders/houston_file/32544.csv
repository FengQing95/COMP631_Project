Local Foods////This little place is absolutely delightful. The ingredients here are always so fresh and the breads are scrumptious. The homemade chips are a must with whatever combo you order. The menu must change because they had a Reuben to die for! The Banh Mi is another fave of mine. The soups are AMAZING. This little place does good business, its packed for lunch with difficult to find parking but its a good lunch spot. A little pricey but you will get quality you can see and taste . I think you will have to check it out at least once.
