JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Angela - Thanks for your review. I sincerely apologize for your having received a dirty sake cup. My staff have been reprimanded for the mistake and new policies have been enacted to ensure this error doesn't happen again. I presume you pointed this out to your server at the time, and that you received clean sake cups. Furthermore, I hope my staff fulfilled the rest of your parties' needs. Understandably, you posted that you don't intend to visit us again, but if on the off chance that you do, please ask for me or any of my managers (Darcie, Kathy, Keith, Raul, Sara or Wynne), and we will take care of you.
