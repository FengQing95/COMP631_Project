Uchi////Long overdue review. I love Uchi and I could not recommend it more. I have been to this location three times and once to the Dallas location. The quality of the food and service is always excellent without being overly fussy. It is a great place for a special occasion and can definitely be on the expensive side, but well worth it. I definitely recommend just letting the servers guide you through a tasting menu.
