Baby Barnaby's////Our last meal in Houston was most similar to the breakfast experience we're accustomed to in Sacramento, CA. Â From the "Out" magazines displayed prominently in the corner, to the kitschy interior and framed homage to San Francisco adorning every wall, Baby Barnaby's is a not-so-subtle spurning of the everything-is-bigger, butter- and gravy-covered cuisine and culture that, it seems, can only be escaped by cooking at home, or heading West.
