The Pit Room////First time in Texas. BBQ is a must for any first one visitor! This shop is about a fifteen minute drive outside of the center of Houston, situated around more residential neighborhoods. Suggestion would be to come and be prepared to wait. I came around 7:15 and there was a line that never ended the entire time that I was there (around 1 hour).
