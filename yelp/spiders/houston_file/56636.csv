Kata Robata////They give you a range of pricing from $130-170 per person, and then from there, you can continue adding on dishes that are about $5/dish extra. My boyfriend and I decided to try 1 more dish outside of the menu the executive chef created for that night's omakase, and got to watch him think about a dish on the spot, create it, and personally serve it to us. It was such an honor to meet Hori san and have him explain the dish. I would definitely suggest trying an extra dish just to have the chance of seeing a master at work!
