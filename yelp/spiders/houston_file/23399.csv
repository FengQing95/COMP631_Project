Uchi////Some work colleagues and I headed to Uchi while in town for a conference.  SO LUCKY to have had this incredible culinary haven recommended!   Uchi was beyond amazing!  The variety in tastes ran a spectrum from a typical but still excellent sashimi salmon, to a rather unusual flounder, to a PHENOMENAL wagyu beef suvseared on a hot rock was like nothing I've really experienced anywhere else, even above similar menued restaurants on the West Coast.  Can't wait to take my wife downtown as soon as possible so we can share the experience together!  Sincerely WOWED!
