Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond is my neighborhood bakery Â and there are many things to love about this spot. However, in the age of covid when waiting around is not only irritating but dangerous, they need to step up their staff. I waited half and hour for an iced coffee and the bar was a mess. Please get a clorox wipe going and invest in a few more employees.
