Local Foods////This is my go-to spot for a chicken sandwich! I absolutely love this place. I always order the "CRUNCHY" CHICKEN, which has nut "crumble", crushed chips, pickles, tomato, romaine, provolone, buttermilk ranch, and pretzel bun. It hasn't changed at all since I first tried it. The consistency is on point. I love the crunchiness. Everything is seasoned perfectly and there are so many different textures in each bite.
