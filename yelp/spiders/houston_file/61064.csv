Baby Barnaby's////First off, how the hell have I lived in Houston for over 5 years and have yet to set foot in Baby Barnaby's?  I've been to its big brother multiple times, but never popped into the little side show.  I think it was because every time we've ever been by the line was out the door.  Well, lucky me - we were in the area for the first day of school for the little one and we both had off work that day!  So we popped over to BB around 8:30AM on a Monday and got a table right away.  However, by 9AM there was a small wait.  Now one thing I think Houston is deficient on is breakfast spots and this place is a shining star against a dark sky!
