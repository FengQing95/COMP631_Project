JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This has been my favorite restaurant in Houston for years. I have gone 2-3 times per month for a few years now. The ramen is still the best in Houston, but I've gotten so disappointed these last few months. Prices have ticked up over time (normal) but they are giving you less food for the higher price. They stopped giving spinach as an add on and while they used to give 3 sheets of seaweed now they only give 1 - for a higher price!! I just can't swallow paying $23 for the same bowl of ramen I used to pay $16 for and I'm getting less food. Currently searching for other ramen places in Houston.
