Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Our waiter kind of had the same energy. His demeanor was cold. We would say thank you and receive no response or acknowledgement. It was weird. Other locations are always amazing. I won't be back to this location ever again. The food was amazing though so I'll give them credit for that.
