Kata Robata////We ordered the Miso Gyoza, Lobster Mac N Cheese, and the Kobe Beef Roll.  As you may have noticed, we weren't in the mood for "raw" on this occasion.  The gyoza was outstanding and the yuzu sauce was some of the best I've had.  Lobster mac rocked!  Chunks of lobster swimming with noodles in a creamy cheese array.  Mmm mmm.  The Kobe beef roll was a bit different.  I think the avocado threw me off.  I'm not saying it wasn't good, cause it was amazing!  That beef was just like butter.
