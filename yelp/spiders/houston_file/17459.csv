Uchi////so i came here on a wednesday night with 3 other girls. place is still packed on a wednesday! we had reservations so we really didn't have to wait that long, but during our short wait, a waitress came around with a plate of sushi... it was all veggies inside of it and were pretty small and bite size... and offered it to us while we were waiting. so they try and compensate for having to wait with giving you some free food. how nice :)
