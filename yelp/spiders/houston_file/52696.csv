Kata Robata////Kata Robata is located where Hue used to be, and besides the cuisine shift from Vietnamese to Japanese, it doesn't look like much else has changed. The ambiance is similar, the menu is expensive, and the staff is still friendly and all smiles. The menu, while not quite as ambitious as Uchi, had quite a few dishes that caught my eye. Unfortunately, we came during happy hour, and my wallet is price-conscious. I considered waiting until I actually had a proper meal here, but who knows when that will be. So this review will be for their HAPPY HOUR ONLY.
