JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Must have the Black Ramen, I have never left any in the bowl.  I always add an extra egg and mushrooms, and being gluten free I enjoy mine with Rice that can be added at no charge.  The happy hour is great that you can add several appetizers or add a salad to your ramen for around 5 bucks.  There are current two more locations being built and I can't wait until they are open.  Always get great service and there is never a long wait on food that is ordered.
