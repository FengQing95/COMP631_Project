The Pit Room////Rated as one of the Top 50 BBQ joints in Texas, but not sure if it deserves it. Maybe because it was dinner; I've learned the best BBQ is served at high noon. Pork rib is a little tough, brisket fat is not adequately rendered, and turkey is not moist (after counter guy said it was one of the best things they serve). Corn Elote was overcooked. The best cue doesn't need sauce, but this does and I didn't care for it as it was too vinegary. Traditional dill pickles and white bread were non-traditional, but were fine.
