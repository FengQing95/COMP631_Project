Baby Barnaby's////I'm really not impressed by the menu selections at the regular Barnaby's, but it's all good for breakfast at Baby Barnaby's. (I should also mention that regular Barnaby's serves the same breakfast menu until 11am). Hands down, my favorite is the green eggs plate, which I always substitute the toast for honey biscuits. The coffee is great too and do try their fresh-squeezed orange juice. Make sure to write your name down on the clipboard by the door when you get in to get in line to be seated. It's typically no longer than a 10-15 minute wait on the weekends, with there being virtually no wait at all the closer you get to 2pm (when they close).
