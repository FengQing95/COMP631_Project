Baby Barnaby's////NOM! We waited here for about 30m in the hot humid weather, and then got sat in the patio on which it started to rain. It was covered, but we were still getting wet from a small leak in the metal patio roof, but nothing could distract me from the tastiness of the food. My green eggs breakfast plate was delicious, biscuits were flaky and yummy, hello golden perfectly cooked potatoes! And to top it off, the buttermilk waffle of glory! I'd go back. The menu is small but perfect, and if it's hot, prepare to sweat a bit since the waiting area is outdoors. The food came out fast and hot. Looking forward to going back!
