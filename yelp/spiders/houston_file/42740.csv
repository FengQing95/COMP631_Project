Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I bookmarked this place with no true intention of visiting as I'm not usually big on bakeries or coffee shops.  However, I stayed in town this weekend & needed a small something to eat before driving to the Woodlands.  I have also resigned myself to removing some of my bookmarks.  All those factors involved led me to my arrival here.
