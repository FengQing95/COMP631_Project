Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We've always loved coming here.  The ambience & decor inside is very airy & light.  The food is always delicious!  We are currently under the stay-at-home order & although we mostly cook at home, we support a restaurant or 2 on the weekends & this one hit the spot!  We ordered a breakfast sandwich, avocado toast, bread basket, & French toast for our kids.  Although it was takeout, the presentation was still gorgeous!  Can't wait to be able to dine out properly again!
