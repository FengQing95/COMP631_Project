Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I love breakfast food and willing to wait for breakfast food. My gf and I decided to wake up early and grab breakfast here and typically the wait is well over an hour but thankfully the day we came it was freezing cold outside so we only waited about 20-30 min! We had a cute little orange booth, so much space for just the 2 of us.
