Local Foods////Local foods serves up great salads and sandwiches.  They'll make any sandwich into a salad which I think is pretty cool.  The food is fresh and consistent, every bite leaves you wanting more.  It's counter service, you order it and they'll bring it to you.  The decor is modern and clean.  I recommend the crunchy chicken sandwich.  The pricing is fair for the quality of food you're getting.
