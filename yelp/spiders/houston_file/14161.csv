JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Service was quick, My server Alex was great with constant check ins to make sure I had everything. I did not encounter any trouble with parking on my Wednesday visit, but I may have arrived after the lunch rush (1:PM), so street parking for .50 cents for the hour wasn't breaking the bank.
