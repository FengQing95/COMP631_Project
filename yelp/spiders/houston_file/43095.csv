Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Believe the hype, and go!  Best pastries and perfectly made macarons. Thier baguettes with butter is so addicting.  Their egg sandwich was tasty but if they put a hint of truffle - it would be amazing!  I would recommend their almond croissant with a latte. Although their chocolate walnut cookie was very good, it was a bit on the overly sweet side for my taste.  I would have enjoyed it more with a tall glass of cold milk.  We will return, as often as we can  .
