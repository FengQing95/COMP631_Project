Uchi////I've been wanting to try Uchi Houston since I moved to Houston 4 years ago. I've been to Uchi in Austin (5 stars), which was spectacular. Not the case with the Houston location. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. He has a pretty thick Columbian accent and he asked our waiter (Matt) to recommend a vegetarian roll that was not spicy, however when he asked, it sounded like "not-a-spicy". Matt Â told us what he recommended and when my boyfriend asked for confirmation that it wasn't spicy, Matt said "no, not-a-spicy". I'm not sure if Matt was making a sordid attempt at being funny, or perhaps he's just not very self-aware. Either way, it was unappreciated. Aside from that moment of ridiculousness, the food just wasn't up to par with the Austin location. They did give us a free foie gras sample for my boyfriend's birthday which we enjoyed, but it was a dollar short and a day late at that point. If the meal is going to cost $115 for two people, the taste had better be exquisite, and the wait staff should be top-notch.
