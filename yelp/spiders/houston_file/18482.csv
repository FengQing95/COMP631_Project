Uchi////I want to start off by saying if you are a sushi person you must have your wasabi and soy. NOT HERE! you don't even need it! The food is just absolutely phenomenal. The menu can be a little intimidating but have no fear,  when your  food is brought to the table they thoroughly explain it to you! Chelsea was our server and made it a point to help us order customized to our taste which was extremely helpful. Also I know first hand when you dine in a busy restaurant you just know something will go wrong or it may take longer to get your food, I must say I have never seen such perfect timing with plate service as well as AMAZING teamwork! They truly have a perfect establishment, they are on point from the front door till the end of your meal. Considering how busy it was I never saw one person even look stressed out which caused an even flow and provided one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. Also Rosie was super helpful and especially gracious in making our reservation she was kind enough to squeeze us in last minute and even came by to introduce herself and made sure we had an excellent time! As I was observing EVERY PERSON AT EVERY TABLE was happy! Needless to say of course I will be back and recommend this restaurant as much as I can. I was more than impressed with my overall experience 10 stars!!!!!
