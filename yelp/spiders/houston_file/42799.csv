Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Not sure whether to call myself a fan, a regular, or an addict! Unbelievably good pastries. So far I've tried the lemon tart, chocolate tart (chocoholic's dream), sticky bun, and kougin amman (sp?). The kougin amman was sublime. So buttery, just the right amount of sweetness, and the texture is hard to describe, but really wonderful. Being from Pennsylvania, sticky buns and me go way back, including the Penn State favorite: grilled stickies. Chef Roy's sticky was in another league. The caramel -- wow! Sticky heaven!
