Kata Robata////Our server was very scatter brained and didn't care too much about us. And I didn't like how he had a flashlight to everything. BUT THE FOOD is very special with the right amount of flare. You get what you pay for. I ordered all appetizers like the bone marrow and the duck foie gras soba noodles. I really loved the soft shell crab and Marsala sauce. I finished my meal with a single bite of sushi recommended by the annoying server. Overall a very memorable meal.
