JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The dish I ordered was the spicy chicken ramen and the spice level was SPICY. I didn't want to risk it and end up in tears trying to enjoy my food. The dishes came out at a good pace and the presentation was bang on. Love at first bite! Every ingredient was carefully added to proportion without it being too salty or too oily. The noodles were thin and perfectly cooked. I am getting hungry for ramen writing this review.
