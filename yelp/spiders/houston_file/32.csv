Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////All I can say is wow! Let's cut to the chase, this place is my new favorite place to eat downtown. I believe our waiter's name was Jeremy, and he made the whole experience wonderful for my girlfriend and I. We ordered the pulled pork hush puppies (try them, trust me) and they were fantastic! I followed a separate review on here and ordered the Bosscat Burger made the chef's way (DO IT YOU WON'T REGRET IT) and I can honestly say that this was the most delicious burger I've ever had. The fries are fresh and crispy, and come with their house ketchup which is a perfect combo. For dessert, Jeremy suggested the red velvet churros and they are incredible! There is legitimately nothing I could recommend for this place to do better because they are perfect in my opinion. They could easily charge way more for the food for how good the quality is. I'm looking forward to my next visit to downtown (can't believe I'm saying that) so I can swing by my new favorite restaurant!
