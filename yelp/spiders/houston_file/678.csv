JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Finally found a Ramen house that we love! The Brussel Sprouts tempura are incredible. Got my Ramen spicy, my wife got the same mild and my son got the truffle fries; all outstanding! We will absolutely be back soon! Next time we'll be trying the octopus ball. Also, I don't know that I've had a better waitress. She was so sweet. Thanks Zoey!
