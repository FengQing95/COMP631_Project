Uchi////Next was the Walu Walu: Oak grilled Escolar, served in a candied critus Yuzupon sauce with a hint of Myoga. OH MY GOODNESS'S!! This was one of my favorite dishes of all and that is hard thing to say. A large piece of Escolar, that is grilled on both sides so that it leaves a wonderful crispy outer cover. However the center of the Escolar maintains its flavor and texture, almost as if you were eating a large piece of sashimi. Then the sauce, completely transforms this mild flavored fish into something completely wonderful. The citrus flavor compliments the escolar wonderfully and the crispy outside adds that texture contrast that absolutely completes this dish. Absolutely AMAZING!!
