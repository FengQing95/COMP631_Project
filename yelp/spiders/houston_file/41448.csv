Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Visited two days in a row for outstanding pastries and coffee. Be prepared for a long line. I'm typically okay with waiting for quality goods, of which this certainly qualifies. However, I don't think the line is because of so many people coming, it is because the staff seems very unorganized. During both visits the staff taking orders was pleasant, but they just did not seem at all efficient. Once I received my food and sat, I watched as several potential customers left because of the line. That's a shame because they are losing business due to their inability to serve quick enough. Otherwise, highly recommended.
