Local Foods////Finally, Local knocked it out of the park!  The Egg Salad was pretty much incredible!  They add truffle oil and it adds a unique and delicious flavor.  Also, the pretzel bun is just the right texture for this sandwich.  I think that this will be the only item I will order from this place from here on out.
