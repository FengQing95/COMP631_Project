Kata Robata////* Ambiance: Kata Robata is perfect for a date night -- it's low-lit and intimate, though not overly-so, so small group gatherings would still fit right in. Aside from booths and small tables, there's also a sushi bar and heated outdoor patio. There's also this ONE particular booth in the middle of the restaurant that kind of sits on its own, has its own liting and decor, and it practically screams "special occasion"... I wonder what that's all about.
