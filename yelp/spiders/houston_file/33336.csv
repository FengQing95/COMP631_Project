Local Foods////While many say this place is overhyped because "I can make any of these sandwiches at home", I think Local Foods does a good job of using quality ingredients and has a nice variety to their menu.  Plus points for more than one vegetarian option.  Comparing it to other sandwich shops, I think it's near the top of the list.  Each sandwich comes with 2 sides (and you have some unique choices to pick from), making a very complete and filling meal.  Any sandwich can also be made into a salad as well.
