The Pit Room////In town from Alabama and wanted to try real TX bbq.   Glad we tried this place.  Convenient to the museum district.  Awesome food and friendly service. Had the two meat sandwich with brisket and jalapeño cheese sausage.  Best brisket ever.  Sausage was also very good.  The sauce with the sandwich was very good but the meat is great without any sauce.  Tried the coffee bourbon sauce and the hot sauce and didn't care for either.  Enjoyed charro beans.  Sautéed okra was special of the day.  It was unique and pretty good but I wouldn't order it again.  Too many other sides to try.  If you are in Houston, this is a must visit
