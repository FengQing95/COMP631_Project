Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It does get pretty busy, and popular items will run out. There are close-range tables inside and some tables on a little patio outside. The location is pretty crowded - solid for grabbing breakfast and having casual chats, but not the kind of place to sit for a long time or study. I think this is what Common Bond intends, anyway, not really a complaint! Every spot has to pick a vibe, and Common Bond is a bustling pastry shop.
