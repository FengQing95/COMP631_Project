JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Regardless, and to reiterate, I appreciate your visiting us and taking the time to give us a review. Obviously we didn't quite meet your standards, but you did leave the door open for us for a possible future visit, and as far as I'm concerned, we can't ask for much more than that.
