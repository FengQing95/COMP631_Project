JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As a main dish, I got the Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen. It's pretty good. I definitely like the noodles & broth more than Tiger Den. The noodles were thick and the broth was creamy. In addition, the spiciness was perfect. It was enough to pack a punch without setting my tongue and stomach on fire. The broth complimented the spice well. It was not a battle of spiciness vs saltiness like most places I've been to. You can definitely taste the balance. The pork chashu practically melted in my mouth. The kikurage provided a nice texture contrast to the pork chashu. Combined with the egg and corn (which you have to ask for), it was heaven on earth.
