Kata Robata////If it hadn't been for my pork belly don, this place would be 3 stars for me. Service is slow. Prices are way high. If you get the run of the mill sushi things (rolls, sashimi), it's just your normal sushi place. You go to Kata Robata to try the OTHER stuff that you can't get at a sushi happy hour.
