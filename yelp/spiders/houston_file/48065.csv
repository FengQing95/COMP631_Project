Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////New hype in town. Several options to choose from and vegan/vegeterian friendly! I'd highly recommend their Sweet Potato pancakes, OMG! French Toast or Spring Harvest Benny. All were super delicious and different from just classic breakfast items! Beware, this place is usually packed!! Always a wait for weekend brunch! Ambiance is very welcoming, super bright, colorful and even more welcoming/sweet staff!
