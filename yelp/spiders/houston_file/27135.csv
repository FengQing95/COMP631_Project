The Pit Room////Parking is limited to a small lot and it was FULL‼. We were lucky to find a spot across the street.  The service was you order, receive & pay and we were eating at a table enjoying our BBQ‼. We noticed customers ordering take out some customers eating outside. I think we will visit agsin‼
