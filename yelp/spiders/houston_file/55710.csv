Kata Robata////By far my favorite sushi restaurant in the city! Astounding selection of fresh fish straight from japan. I highly recommend doing the omakase ($150 a person when I went but prices may depend on the courses) but if you don't, get the New Zealand king salmon,  anago (saltwater eel),  and kamasu (barracuda).
