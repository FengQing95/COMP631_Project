JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place serves food till 2 am! At least on Friday night. It was easy to find a spot before 11:30 pm, somehow it went really crazy afterwards. I ordered the vegan bun and the vegan harvest ramen. Sometimes people mess up the order and today was one such day, I asked for additional egg in the ramen and instead they added tofu.
