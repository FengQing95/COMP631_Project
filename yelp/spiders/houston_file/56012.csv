Kata Robata////So many other things...! Always look over the daily specials, there are some amazing things on there. Had a live scallop once that was fantastic :) Sushi is fresh (sometimes served too cold on the ice so just let it warm up a bit) and rolls are creative and tasty. Specialty cocktails are good too, but can be pricey.
