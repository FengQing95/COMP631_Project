The Pit Room////Overall quality of the meats I think is better here than Killens.  One thing for sure that puts Pit Room ahead of their often compared to rival is that they have a nice assortment of pickled veggies you can get an unlimited amount of - pickles, red onions, green onions, jalapeños.  Plus they have a few other pretty tasty sauces like habenero in addition to their standard bbq sauce.
