Baby Barnaby's////The pumpkin pancake is one of the best things I have ever tasted. Throw slow service, long lines, and crowded conditions out of the window and consider this little microcosm of perfection. The pumpkin flavor is subtle, but what it adds best is texture, allowing the pancake to be denser, fluffier, and crispier all at once. Don't ask me the physics of those contradictions, just appreciate the pumpkin pancake.
