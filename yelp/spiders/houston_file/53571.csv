Kata Robata////The trick here will be - if you don't see it, ASK! I tend not to do so because I really really don't like to inconvenience people, and I feel like if I don't like what's on the menu of a place, I shouldn't be there expecting to be accommodated. But here, at least, I hope you'll mention some of these dishes (again, also see Jim M's review) if they aren't on the menu and sound good to you.
