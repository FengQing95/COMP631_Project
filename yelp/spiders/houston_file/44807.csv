Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Whoa, this was a surprise.  I wasn't sure what to expect after friends hyped this place up, but it's worth the wait in line on a Sunday morning.  Croissants were super flaky and buttery and the coffee is pretty good, and I'm not a coffee drinker.  I wasn't sure I would be able to tell the difference between these pastries and those from elsewhere, but they definitely put some work into getting them just right, and it shows.  Well worth the extra expense.
