Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I'm a big bourbon fan. Unfortunately the waitress couldn't answer some basic questions regarding their bourbon selection. So, I decided to go with their basic old fashioned to give them a little test, although it was $14! Â I have to say it was one of the worst old fashioned I've ever had. I'd expect more from a whiskey bar.
