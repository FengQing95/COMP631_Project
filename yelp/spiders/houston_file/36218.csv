Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////One of the best times of my life. It's great to enjoy time with good friends here. Our waiter, Terry, served as a waiter and comedian as we were served. Great guy. This places serves class with a comfortable atmosphere. If you're looking for a " stuck-up" bar, you're in the wrong place. Bottomless mimosas and amazing Texas brunch make this a great place for friends to meet up. So please, trust this review and come and have a good time. This place is the perfect example of how real we are in Texas while bringing you class. Â Also, take a tour of the whiskey room.
