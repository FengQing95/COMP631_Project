Kata Robata////Food is about a 31/2 to 4.  I have been there 3 times, twice outside at the back and gotten Nick both times.  He is really bad doesn't have a clue about being a waiter. Last night when he brought the two plates with ginger and wasabi prior to the sushi coming he dropped one on the table didn't apologize scooped it up with his hand and never came back to replace it. Didn't bring the tea, I had to ask somebody else.  He later brought some of the other dishes.  It appears that they send out the various dishes when they're ready not in any order but that is fairly common for most average sushi restaurants.
