Kata Robata////Looked up the Sushi Club of Houston's recommendations while on a business trip and Kata Robata was listed #1. They factor many things into this rating, like value, service, rice, and quality of fish. I've been to many of the top choices, including Uchi, and I will say when you take all those factors into account, I agree. "A" quality fish, great service, professional chefs, perfect rice, and while expensive, it's worth it. Great Sake list. Happy Â hour menu, too, if you're looking to try a few great things but not break the bank. Will return.
