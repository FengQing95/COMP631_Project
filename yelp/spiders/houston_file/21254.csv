Uchi////Love this place, it really is the one of best japanese restaurant in town, second to MF.. I've been here quite a few times and have tried almost everything on the menu! I even had the honor of experiencing the community table, which was amazing!! Definitely try EVERYTHING under the cool tastings, u won't be disappointed. My must have dishes are the yokai berry, Hama chili, machi cure, and karaage chicken.. Only bad thing about uchi is there aren't ANY good rolls.. I'm not a sushi roll kinda girl so it doesn't bother me, but their sushi rolls are very below average.. Boring and lack in flavors or creativity, unlike everything else on the menu. Uchi is definitely one of the best I've had, only uchi and MF sushi are comparable to the finest japanese restaurants in Vegas like barmasa, blue ribbon, nobu, and mizumi.
