Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////They have a wide selection of pastries. A lot of people ordered their croissants. I got the pear and earl grey scone, which is massive. I also got the mocha mascarpone tart. Their pastries look very decadent and I think it's what they're mostly known for. A great place to grab coffee and a pastry!
