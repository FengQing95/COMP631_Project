Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Yummmm. I came here in Monday morning with a large-ish group and Snooze happily (and quickly!) accommodated us. I started out ordering an almond milk latte- it wasn't amazing but this isn't a coffeeshop and it also wasn't half bad, so I'm not going to complain... especially because my breakfast was BOMB. I ordered a 3 egg scramble with bacon, onions, and cheddar cheese (and flour tortillas for my carb.) OH MAN. First of all, the potatoes that come with most meals are fantastic-- I love the cylinder shape they come in and they were cooked perfectly... and I mean in all of the ways (crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and perfectly salted.) The eggs were perfectly cooked and the bacon... ohhhhhh man the bacon. This is not the tiny crunchy slivers you might find in some places-- this is is the thick, slab bacon that Ron Swanson dreams about. This breakfast was probably enough to make a large man feel full, but it was so ridiculously delicious that even as a 5'5" girl I downed the whole thing. Highly recommend this place (and highly recommend coming on a weekday morning if it's in the cards for you.)
