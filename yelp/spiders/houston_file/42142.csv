Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This cafe takes their food very seriously and do a fantastic job of their pastries.  However, the place could be much more efficiently run, they run out of the best and popular pastries early and the line is always extremely long when you go for brunch.  Is it worth the wait?  Yes, the quality is fantastic and the ambiance is great.  This is one of my favorites.
