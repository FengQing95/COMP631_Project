Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////What a find! Visiting Houston for a weekend and found Bosscat on Yelp. Glad we did. Great venue with open sides, brick and reclaimed wood. The whiskey selection is great. Almost hard to choose with so many rare/hard to find options. The food was fantastic, focused on "comfort options" but not any one cuisine. We had a fantastic shrimp and grits with Crystal hot sauce and a braised short rib with potato.
