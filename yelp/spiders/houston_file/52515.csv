Kata Robata////Great place!!  Loved the atmosphere, food, service...everything!  A packed house on a Tuesday night must mean something.  Our server was very helpful with recommendations and low and behold, I loved what he suggested - the Ocean Picante roll.  I also had a few pieces of nigiri (fresh salmon, tuna, and yellowtail), all delicious.  Try the oyster mushrooms; they are out of this world, and I am not a huge fan of mushrooms normally.  I am no vegetarian, but I really liked some of their veg options that my friend ordered (namely the sweet egg sushi).  I was very impressed with this place and can't wait to go back next time I feel a sushi craving coming on.  Oh, and having Arian Foster at the next table was pretty cool too!
