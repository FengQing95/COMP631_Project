JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi London - Thanks for the great review. I'm glad you enjoyed our fare. The pork belly chashu we use in our ramen bowls does tend to be a bit fatty, but the argument is that is where the flavor is! Understandably, it's not for everyone, so when you return, just ask your server to inform the chef. We try to do our best to accommodate all of our guests' requests, but given that we serve well over 1,000 guests on any given day, it's not always feasible.
