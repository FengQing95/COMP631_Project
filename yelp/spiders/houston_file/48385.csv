Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Got in and out in about 40 minutes. Â Just me with my dog. Friendly service, except one guy who rolled his eyes when I asked him who my waiter after I'd been sitting there for 5-7 minutes without service. . Other than HIM, good service and good food. And the mimosa was yummy.
