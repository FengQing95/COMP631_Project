Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is definitely a new kind of place for Houston! Fancy pastries, interior, and staff. Don't ask too many questions or even bother complimenting the beauty of the desserts. Â You'll be met with an expressionless answer that implies "have you never seen a pastry? just order."
