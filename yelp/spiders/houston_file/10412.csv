JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////There's always a great experience at Jinya's. Wait sucks but the food does indeed make up for the lost time standing for a while. staff are attentive, my server made sure food came out in a timely matter hence the waiting. This is a place where you'll wait for the food because it's just that good. So I won't complain about the wait anymore.
