Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We started drinks and a appetizer!  We ordered the  Boss lady and Boss cat  cocktails and Bosscat fries, neither was not included on the happy hour menu. The fries were thick, fresh and came with a spicy ketchup on the side. We both were pleased with our drinks and appetizer.
