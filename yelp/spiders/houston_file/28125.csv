The Pit Room////Super fun place.  Indoor seating quite small, but the patio is never ending.  Not a sit down and order place but a stand in a que to get your bbq.  Ordered the brisket Sammie, coleslaw, 1/2 chicken and potato salad.  The only thing that kept me occupied and focused was the brisket piled high on a buttery type brioche bun.  None of the sides did any justice for me but that's all personal preference.  It would have been nice though, if the coleslaw had more of a KFC sweetness to balance out the savory essence of the meat.  Everyone in our party of six devoured their meals with gumption.  The frito pie got passed around for tasting and was a crazy concoction of brisket, chili, and frito chips and piles of cheese.  Not for the faint of heart. Everyone raved about the Mac n cheese.  Definitely worth a stop if you are in the neighborhood.
