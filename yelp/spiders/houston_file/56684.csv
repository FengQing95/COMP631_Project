Kata Robata////The Ramen here is top notch. It's not too salty and the broth is very flavorful. The texture of the noodles is just right - not too hard but also not too soft. My favorite part about the dish is the hard boiled egg. It may just be an egg, but the yolk is amazing and goes well with everything else! It's the perfect dish to eat on a cold day, especially since the dish comes out steaming hot. For $14 it's not considered cheap, but it's also not instant either!
