Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The main entr√©e was a comically large pork shank. It looked like a whole pig was sacrificed just to provide this meal for the table. The pork was extremely tender, although there were parts of it that we didn't attempt to eat. There's a certain skill involved in eating the skin off of a pork knuckle, and it doesn't look pretty.
