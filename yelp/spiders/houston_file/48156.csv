Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Went to try out Snooze in their new Galleria location.   The hostess...with that attitude hostesses can get when a busy new restaurant opens...tells us it's a 45 minute to an hour wait.  Which was fine, except that there were 8 empty table on the patio.  We asked about them and she came up with some non-sensical explanation.  We left with no intention of returning.
