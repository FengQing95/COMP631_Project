The Pit Room////Best BBQ within Houston IMHO... their brisket taco in particular is amazing and love their sausage and ribs too. Sides are also all good too especially the okra when they have it (wish they had it every day but they rotate).. their BBQ chicken and the mac & cheese are probably the weakest items... not terrible just not as good as the rest.
