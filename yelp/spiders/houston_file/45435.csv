Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond... the bakery that always sells out. I'm starting to think they don't even serve croissants. I made three attempts to come here and try their popular croissant, but I'm always too late. In fact, half their items are usually gone by the time I get there. All I would see is an empty glass case of crumbs and dried tears of happiness from those who won the faster draw. I'm usually defaulted with their lemon tart pies... which are actually pretty good - but dang it, it's not a croissant.
