Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////What a cute little slogan! I arrived here on a Saturday morning for brunch for my cousin's birthday. The moment I entered I was greeted by the hostess and she had said she couldn't seat us until half our party had arrived. Womp womp. I guess I understand that gesture but I don't really enjoy waiting. So me and a couple guests went and waited at the bar where we all ordered mimosas. Saturday and Sunday are all different menu items but if you don't want to choose from the menu they can provide you with their regular lunch menu.
