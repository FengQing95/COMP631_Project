Baby Barnaby's////Among all of their breakfast offerings the Green Eggs is what I default to. The eggs are scrambled and are super smooth 'n creamy . They're never overcooked or rubbery. The only con I can think of is that I wish there was more of it on the plate! P.S. the portions aren't skimpy, I'm just being greedy here~
