Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We started with the Spicy Chicken & Cheese dip, Pulled pork hush puppies, and fried oysters. Unfortunately we could not find any chicken in our Spicy Chicken dip which I would skip if I came here again. The Pulled pork hush puppies were kind of dry but that's about normal for a hush puppy. Now these magical fried oysters.... OMG it was amazing. Very good we wanted to order more they were delicious.
