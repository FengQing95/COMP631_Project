Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////--The yeast-based desserts (like the croissants, kouign amann, kugelhopf, etc) now have an almost cheesy flavor. I'm not sure if this is because of the yeast or the butter used, but it's different than before and can sometimes be quite strong. Also, nitpicking here, but it's a real shame that pistachio croissant is so artificially green since the filling tastes pretty good! When I brought one home to family, most found the kelly green swirl a little freaky.
