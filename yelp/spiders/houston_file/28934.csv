The Pit Room////Beef Brisket, so soft and tender it melted in your mouth. Pork Ribs smothered in BBQ sauce so good you cried when you hit bone. Whole Chicken, so juicy, you couldn't stop licking your fingers. Sliced Turkey so flavorful and you wonder why you only have Turkey at Thanksgiving. Mac'n'Cheese. Jalapeno and Beef Sausage. Beans. Bread. Beer.
