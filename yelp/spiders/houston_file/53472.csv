Kata Robata////After reading rave reviews and passing by this place a million times, I decided to give it a try once and for all. Unfortunately, I was definitely left disappointed... I don't know whether it was the okay service or the not-so-great food, but I was not happy. The atmosphere and decor is undoubtedly great, the happy hour menu is below average, and apart from the awesome appetizers, the sushi rolls were not so appetizing.
