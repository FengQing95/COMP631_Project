Baby Barnaby's////My cousins and I were looking for a place to brunch at that we could actually be seated at a timely manner without having to make reservations and thought this was a good choice. I guess we were just really lucky that day, from finding a spot right next to the restaurant to getting seated within 10 minutes cause this place was hellaaa small and packed when we came at around noon, or at least the baby barnaby's section of it. Like good Lord y'all gotta suck in your gut if you wanna navigate around that place.
