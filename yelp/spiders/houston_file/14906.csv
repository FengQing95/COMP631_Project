JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Britney - Thank you very much for the folow-up review. I'm happy we met your satisfaction again, but regret that we no longer rank as your #1. We can only hope to reclaim that spot through hard work and more offerings down the road. At any rate, I think you can agree that Houston now has several options for quality ramen and that is a boon for all. Thank you again, and we appreciate your business.
