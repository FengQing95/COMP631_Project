Baby Barnaby's////Spent 20 minutes searching through Yelp for a great breakfast spot on our last morning in Houston and we found it. There was a list they had you add your name, how many in your party and whether you had a seat preference. Only thing I'd add is a sign or something in front showing where the list is. We waited a little less than than hour for our name to be called for an inside table. Waitress was friendly and took our order quickly and food came out quickly. Got 2 breakfast plates and split a French toast. All of it was great. Had to let the French toast soak in some syrup but I was still good. Orange juice was super freshly squeezed and hot chocolate tasted great. Would definitely come back if we made another trip to Houston.
