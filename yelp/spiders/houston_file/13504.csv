JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the wonton chicken ramen. I found the broth to be a little plain, but it was good. I liked the wontons, but wish there had been a little more to the bowl than broth, wontons, noodles, and spinach. I would check other ramen places before going back but I would go back and I recommend that everyone give it a try. It was very reasonably priced.
