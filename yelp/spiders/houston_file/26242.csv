The Pit Room////Fantastic smoked turkey breast and pulled pork; the beef ribs look like dinosaur bones and taste heavenly.  Now for the sides, the Mexican corn is off the charts!!!  The prices are average to high but the quality is exceptional.  I know you will not have room, but force yourself to try the "sugar cream pie", perfect to share with friends!  The pie is delicious!!!
