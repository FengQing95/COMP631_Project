JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Nice place, BUT it stunk like sewer. Ordered this chicken BOWL , forgot what it was called tbh, but when I got it, it looked like dog food but on plate next to some rice. I was like "wtf Â yo I ordered a chicken bowl not a chicken plate." Never the less making hard to eat! Nice place tho. Not angry, just disappointed.
