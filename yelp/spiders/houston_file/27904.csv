The Pit Room////Overpriced and extremely salty. Nice clean place and pretty friendly staff, except for the guy cutting the meats. I don't like how they didn't just bbq the sauce with the ribs. There were only one flavor of sauce. The ribs were dry and tough. Pouring a bunch of bbq sauce on top didn't help, just made them more salty. The Fritos pie was not bad. The brisket was good. My kids loves the Mac and Cheese.
