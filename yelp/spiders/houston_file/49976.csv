Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Our waitress comes by and is very nice in telling us all about what is good and what our options are in breaking up menu items. I order the pancake flight, pineapple, peanut butter cup and sweet potato. I also love Eggs Benedict so I add the Ham Benedict III with a side of apple chicken sausage, you can get a 1/2 order so I did. Wife gets the breakfast burrito and everyone else gets their thing.
