JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Tan - Thank you very much for the update. We really appreciate your giving us another chance, and for granting us another star. We often suggest the Tonkotsu White or Tonkotsu Assari since these respective broths offer a much lighter profile than the Tonkotsu Black. And we also appreciate your maneuvering around our peak-rush hour traffic. Our primary goal has and always will be to maintain consistent quality and service to continue earning your business. On behalf of everyone at JINYA-Midtown: Thank you.
