Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Omg I love this place. Everything I've had is delicious, the service is great, and the price is reasonable! Sweet, savory, you name it, there's food for everyone from carnivore to vegan. I was especially impressed how they made my vegan dad a delicious, individual meal to cater to his dietary needs.
