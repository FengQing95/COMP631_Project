Baby Barnaby's////Really overrated. My migas were bland, but the potatoes were good. My wife's hash wasn't really anything to write home about, it was corned beef, potatoes, and onions thrown together with no cohesion. The service is average, but they were busy. My rating is 2.5 stars, but I rounded up.
