Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Checked website for hours and menu. No mention on it of entire restaurant being closed for a private event.  Had guests from out of town meet me there for bday dinner,  and when we got there we were informed of the closure.  If you are closing your whole restaurant for a private event,  that should be noted on your website!
