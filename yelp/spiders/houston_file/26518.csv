The Pit Room////So this was my first time experiencing some Texan BBQ and it was definitely worth it! I had the 3 piece meat dinner (pulled pork, brisket, venison sausage) with potato salad and mac & cheese as my sides. Everything was pretty solid, the meat wasn't dry, and that was probably some of the best damn brisket I've ever had. The staff were pretty chill and frequently checked in on me to make sure everything was good. Overall, a solid place to break my Texan BBQ cherry.
