Uchi////So, I don't like seafood. You could say Uchi isn't the best place for me. Regardless, I still wanted to give it a shot after all the praise from multiple food critics. I was assured there were options for non-sushi lovers so I gave it a go! I tried the crunchy tuna, quail and wagu beef to start. If you're looking to impress, Uchi is the place for you. The presentation is exquisite. What I think is unique about Uchi is that each food item involves some form of interaction or other activity outside of consumption. Whether it's cooking beef on a rock or discussing customized pallets hitting your tongue, Uchi has become a Houston landmark and is a necessary experience.
