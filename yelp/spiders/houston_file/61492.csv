Baby Barnaby's////I LOVE THIS PLACE! Such a great place. The food is amazing! On a nice day, it's amazing. The parking is only on the street. It's a house turned into a restaurant. Dog friendly. Great service. They are always packed. I love the outdoor seating. I have been here twice and I have always sat outside.
