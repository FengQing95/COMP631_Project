JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Came here for lunch; even on a weekday (albeit a Friday) it was pretty popular--a 20 minute wait for a party of 2. Nevertheless, service was prompt and our ramen, once ordered, arrived quickly. I ordered the Tonkotsu White but with THICK noodles, which turned out to be the right decision. I appreciated that nothing about the presentation was extraneous; each component actually fit well with the ramen. The seaweed had a crispness in its texture that was a good balance to the soft chewy noodles. The green onion was fresh and chopped finely enough to be distributed throughout the broth. The dollop of spicy sauce was just right and cleverly placed on top of the chasu so it didn't just dissolve away in the broth. The fried onion was flavorful and not overpowering. The pork was soft, the broth was rich, flavorful and not salty. The seasoned egg could have been less salty, but overall this dish was great. I think what made the difference was ordering thick noodles, which really aren't much thicker but just enough to be chewy--yum.
