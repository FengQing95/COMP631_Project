Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The manager here is the absolute best! Made sure everything was tasting well and was good to see him on the floor helping out the team. I do think the set up is kind of odd...you pay in one place but there is different stations for bakery, hot food, and coffee beverages. My latte was fantastic and the food was just what I needed!
