Local Foods////However, both the sandwich and salad were not the main attraction today. Both of us definitely agreed on the soup. The soup was not too heavy to put you into a food coma, but not too light that you're looking for food 30 minutes later. It was sweet and tangy with a hint of coconut. It reminded me of thai curry, but with a less overwhelming flavor. The wonton crisps added a nice crunch, the chicken wasn't too dry, I can't really complain about this soup except for the fact that I didn't get enough! I'm looking forward to the next time I go back. Yum!
