Local Foods////We saw homemade chips being made and went up to order some after we got our drinks and thought they would be ready instantly but had to wait and get another number, then we finished our meal and turns out the guy forgot our chips. We waited awhile to consume the soups due to the chips we wanted to taste with it, but oh well next time. I will def be back to try more sandwiches, and different variations but nothing really struck me as AMAZING to come back to within the month... but I'm happy they have great local produce, some organic products and mostly fast and organized service. The interior is also awesome and I love the tables, bar tables, the LOCAL lit up signs and the organic earthy feel.
