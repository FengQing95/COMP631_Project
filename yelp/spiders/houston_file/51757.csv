Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////In the time of COVID-19 and my remote working ass's need to see, even from a distance, other humans; it was awesome that Snooze was open.   They are overly conscious of our safety and the entire staff were masked. (I realize this sounds like a "duh", but I have witnessed far too many food service employees becoming more lax on this basic standard of care as the capacities continue to increase).  The menu is accessed via a QR code on the table and check out is done with a mobile device instead of the staff having to handle customer credit cards.  Tables were responsibly distanced and when we arrived at 9:30am on a Sunday, we didn't have to wait for a table.  Our food arrived quickly and just in time as I was H.U.N.G.O.V.E.R.  My pancake flight with a side of bacon was just what the doctor ordered. I even ended up stealing the hashbrowns from Boyfriend's plate.
