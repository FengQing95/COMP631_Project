Uchi////To keep it short and simple and like all the reviews on here yes it's one of those restaurants with little portions and expensive prices but the quality of the dish itself was extraordinary. We ordered 7 dishes in total including the fried milk and we thought we weren't gonna be full off of it but we did. And come to think of it, our waiter was right about how each dish is designed to be shareable for two.
