The Pit Room////This place is by far the best bbq that I've eaten in a restaurant.  The beef brisket was crusted and seasoned to perfection. Beef sausage and pork ribs were equally tasty.  They have a coffee based sauce that is different and super tasty! I decided to try the charred okra and I'm glad I did, it was soooo delish!  I can't wait to go back!
