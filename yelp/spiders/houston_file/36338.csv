Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The menu is limited and mediocre at best. I ordered the Scrambler ($15) which promised black beans, scrambled eggs and roasted chicken. And indeed, that is all that it was - Eggs. Black beans. And a few measly slices of chicken. Fortunately, my friend ordered the teeny trio of pork belly breakfast tacos that came with a side of pickled onions, jalape√±os and sliced avocado that she was kind enough to share with me so I could doctor up my bland dish. An order of super yummy, crispy home-cut fries also helped.
