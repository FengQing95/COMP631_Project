JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Wow!  Fantastic! 2 of my teens were craving ramen so we tried JINYA.  Son got the pork bun/bao, he ordered the spicy chicken ramen with a side order of dumplings.  Although he gobbled it down, he enjoyed it very much and kept commenting how great it was. Daughter ordered the OLD SKOOL ramen and said it was so yummy. I had the shrimp balls (so yummy and juicy) and the spicy tuna tacos - very flavorful with just the right amount my of spice.  One of the most delicious lunches I've had in a long while.
