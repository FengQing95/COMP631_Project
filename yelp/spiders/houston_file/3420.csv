JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It's a food that originated in Osaka created by a street vendor named Tomekichi Endo in 1935.  The popularity of it as street food carried over to the product being served in restaurants over the years.  Tako means Octopus and Yaki means "to fry or grill".  I'm sorry to hear this product didn't meet your satisfaction, but it is our #2 selling appetizer at Jinya.  Should you visit again in the near future, please ask any of my managers for some appetizer recommendations and we will be glad to recommend something more to your liking.
