JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////On entering, I was almost immediately transported back to Tokyo. The ambience, furniture, warm and loud greeting by the staff when I arrived. It was nostalgic. They were a little busy but only had to wait about 15 minutes for my bowl. And honestly, this is about as good as it gets. My first bite definitely took me back to Kyoto. While I had to leave in a hurry, I enjoyed my food and appreciated the kind service.
