JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the Tonkotsu Black and I got a combination with the Tokyo Curry and Salad, while my fiancee got the Spicy Chicken Ramen. Both were great, but I would have to give the slight edge to Tonkotsu Black because of the broth. Unfortunately, when we got there we were informed of a 35 minute wait, and it took us nearly 50 minutes for us to be seated in the communal table. That was the only bad part of the night. Other than that slight little blip, I love the place. Its a hot resturant which means it will be busy, so be prepared for a wait.
