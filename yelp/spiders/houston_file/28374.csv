The Pit Room////My wife and I were looking for dinner on Saturday night and decided to visit the Pit Room based on the reviews.  We got to the restaurant, and there was no line (despite it being a Saturday with two major sporting events going on).  I ordered the two meat dinner, with brisket and pulled pork.  You get two sides, so I chose tortilla chips and mac and cheese.  My wife ordered the single meat dinner (pulled pork) with potato salad and mac and cheese.  Each came with a slice of bread and BBQ sauce.
