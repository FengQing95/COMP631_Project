JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Although my experience with ramen is limited, my experiences with Jinya have been nothing short of fantastic. I can't recall what I got the first time, but last night I got a to go order of JINYA Tonkotsu Black with thick noodles and a side of fresh garlic, and I think it's safe to say it was the best ramen I've ever had. The pork belly melts in your mouth and the broth is so rich. The extra garlic is what set it over the top.
