JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have been to Jinya Ramen several times on different occasions and they never disappoint. My favorite is the Cha Cha Cha for garlic lovers. The food quality is always consistent and always hot. The egg that you receive in your ramen is pretty much always seasoned and the yolk runny to soft. The crispy chicken and pork gyoza are always a must for me when I am there. The chicken is lightly battered and steaming hot when you bite into it. Be careful! The pork gyoza has plenty of flavor and are bigger when compared with other gyoza dishes at different sushi restaurants like Koto Japanese restaurant (although still above average). Service here is average but the staff is always friendly. I highly recommend this noodle house.
