Kata Robata////Suuuuuuusheeeeeeee! So this place was suggested to me by my girlfriend. Boy was I glad I decided to come here! I gotta say, this was some of the freshest and tastiest sushi I've had in Houston. But then again, I'm not really a sushi connoisseur. Not yet, anyway. I had the salmon and shrimp roll, as well as the Caribbean roll. Both very very delicious. Girlfriend also tried the spicy soy ramen soup, or something like that. Forgive me if I'm wrong. Didn't care too much for the soup, but that's more of a personal dislike. To each his own. For my main course I had the lobster macaroni and cheese..guys....I sht you not, this is the BEST MacnCheese I have EVER HAD. Bruh. The cheesiest , most delicious, greatest Mac EVER. I took one bite and fell in love. Not gonna lie, I was on the fence on 4 stars or 5 stars, but when I took one bite of this Mac, BOOM 5 Stars went off in my head. All very delicious food. Waiter was also very friendly and helpful. I'm giving this place a solid A!! Whoot whoot!!
