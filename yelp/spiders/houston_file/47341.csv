Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I had the B.E.A.T. Sandwich for my meal. The hash browns are literally the best I've EVER had. The sandwich was very good, but the ciabatta bread was suppose to be toasted and it wasn't. It also said on the menu that it came with a side of black beans and I never saw any beans on my plate (which is fine, but the menu said that came with it). It also had barely any egg for how big the sandwich is. The bacon is super crispy and delicious though.
