JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Lydia - Thank you for the great, comprehensive review. We also appreciate the great photos you took. I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen and small plates. We offer Ramen Seasoning, Gyoza Sauce and Hot Sauce on all of the tables. And we can always provide more spicy sauce that the chefs use to flavor our ramens for a nominal charge -- it's akin to asking for sour cream in a Tex-Mex restaurant. We appreciate your kind words, and we hope you'll come back again soon.
