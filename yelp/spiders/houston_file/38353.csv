Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I've heard good things about Bosscat, so I was excited to check it out for the first time on Friday night. They did not disappoint! Everything on the menu looked good, so we ended up just sharing 3 items.. pulled pork hush puppies, shrimp and grits, and sweet potato mac n cheese!
