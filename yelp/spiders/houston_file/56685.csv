Kata Robata////The 72HSCTKB only comes with four bite size pieces and costs $16 (that comes out to $4 per bite!). For that reason, it might not be worth it for some people. As for me, I can really taste the difference compared to similar beef skewers. The meat was savory and ended on a nice smokey note. It's probably the most tender steak I have ever eaten. I would place this dish under the same category as macarons - delicious, expensive, and gone in less than a second.
