Kata Robata////I have never experienced true love until I ordered the Sushi Platter here...10 different pieces of nigiri and the tropical tuna roll will make you wish you could experience it all over again.  And again. And again.  There are a couple of weird ones- the fish egg nigiri is quite the salty experience and the shrimp nigiri is a hefty sweet & slimy 1-2 punch- but the other 8 more than make up for it.  Their fish is fresh and well-prepared, and the wonderful service and romantic ambience create a rare and unique dining experience.
