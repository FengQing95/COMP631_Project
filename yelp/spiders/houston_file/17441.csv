Uchi////Our waitress (sorry I didn't write her name down) was very helpful and extremely well-versed in the many items on the menu.  Good thing because there are a lot of things on the menu.   We couldn't decide where to begin so she recommended either the 6 or 10-course tasting menu.  We ordered the 6 - it was plenty of food for the four of us.  The way this place combines ingredients that you normally wouldn't expect to go together is really special.  Our waitress also recommended a bottle of an excellent Pinot Noir that paired nicely with every one of the courses.  You simply have to try the brussel sprouts, even if you hate brussel sprouts - they are really delicious and a great way to top off the meal before dessert.  Uchi apparently has two locations - one in Houston and one in Austin.  I'm hoping they open in Dallas.  Uchi is at least as good as Sashi in Manhattan Beach, CA, which till now was my favorite sushi place.  It might even be a little better, simply because of the uniqueness/innovative dishes and the ambiance is excellent but not California, if you know what I mean.  It was not inexpensive, but definitely worth it.  I will certainly go there again.
