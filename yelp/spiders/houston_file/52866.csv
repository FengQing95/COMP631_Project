Kata Robata////My first time here was Saturday 5/21/11. I ordered the Houston roll, a spicy tuna roll, a rodeo roll, Â the sashimi combo and chicken yakatori - all to go. The bill came out to right at $48. It was a Saturday afternoon so the place wasn't very crowded. The hostess took my order, invited me to sit at the bar and offered to bring water.
