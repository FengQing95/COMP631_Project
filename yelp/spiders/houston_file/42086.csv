Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Busy loud atmosphere that was fun and bustling. It was very crowded so a large group wouldn't be ideal. Unfortunately, we arrived at 10:35 and according to the lady at the counter, 10:30-11 each day they don't serve food because they're prepping for lunch. We did select 3 pastries for my 2 little boys, husband, and I and it was more than enough. The sticky bun was AMAZING! The almond croissant was okay, bust not nearly as good as it looked. The last one was a sugary covered cake donut type pastry and it too was so delicious! My latte had an amazing design on the top and tasted yummy and was very strong.
