Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Filthy, dirty coffee bar. Different menu now. Rude weird queer people works there now. Constantly out of things. Direct result of poor new management. Can't even make a good tasting coffee anymore. It is very sad, this used to be one of the BEST places to go in the whole Houston...SOS! Hope one day things will go back the way they used to be!
