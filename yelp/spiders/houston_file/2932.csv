JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi K S. - Thank you for your review. As a high-volume, high-turnover restaurant, we must remain vigilant when seating our guests. Although the restaurant may have been mostly empty when you arrived, we have filled to capacity in less than 5 minutes. As such, we have simultaneously dealt with situations where we sat one guest who claimed to be waiting on a companion, only to discover the companion would not arrive for another hour.
