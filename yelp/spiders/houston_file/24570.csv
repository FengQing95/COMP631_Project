Uchi////When I say "not the same," I am not talking about the raw fish or dishes.  The fish is probably from the same supplier as Austin and as last year.  It's the cooked items that are no longer as flavorful or as consistent.  The onion rings are not as light and flaky.  The brussel sprouts are a bit burned.  Don't get me wrong.  It is still very good food, but they are slipping a bit.  I hope they get it back on par soon as I love this place!
