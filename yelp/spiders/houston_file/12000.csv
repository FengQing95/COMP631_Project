JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen itself was pretty tasty. I recommend going with one of the spicier options. My fiance didn't get a spicy option and it was a little bland. They also have a little bar outfront to grab drinks during your wait. This place is usually packed so expect to wait a little on the weekends.
