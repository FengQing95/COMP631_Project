Local Foods////Amazing menu and it was hard to choose - went with the vegan power bowl which was amazing and enough food that I was not hungry come dinner time . It had a delicious rice component , beans also delicious and loads of fresh veggies!! The table also tried the jalape√±o hummus which was so good it did not last long !!
