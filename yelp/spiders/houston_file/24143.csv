Uchi////Phenomenal experience.  I had the Signature Tasting and everything that came out were a blend of the most amazing combination of flavors.  We had watermelon prepared 3 ways and who would think to freeze thaw a slab of watermelon and then compressing it so they could smoke it?!  Food combinations were creative and flavors are out of this world.  I've never tasted anything like it.  Would definitely go back even after the 1 hour 30 minute wait.  The estimated wait time is very accurate.  But it was well worth it!  The rice in a clay pot with the citrus flavored fish was amazing!  So was the bacon tataki.  The escolar fried and served in the ponzu was delish!  The sushi rolls were soft and the flavors were amazing!  The peanut butter dessert was divine!
