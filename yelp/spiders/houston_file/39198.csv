Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Absolutely Amazing!!! We ate dinner here for the 4th of July. It was our first time visiting. This place is a whiskey bar, but there's a nice ambience that leave you feeling relax as soon as you enter. There no wait time and our waiter Jeffery did an amazing job in describing the different parts of the menu. I ordered the Cajun Brick Chicken and my lady had the 12hr slow cooked ribs. My dish was full of favor and the chicken breast was grilled and tender. The Scallop potatoes was amazing with the cajan sauces. Bosscat definitely has my vote of approval!
