Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Before I dive into the details, I have to say that while the food was delicious, I do think it is a bit overpriced. Now, on to the food. The habanero pork belly benny was great, however it was mostly sweet from the toppings so I think more salty flavor would've really balanced well. The smashed avocado benny was really great, the avocado well seasoned and the egg on top cooked perfectly (the pork belly's egg was overcooked). I love their hashbrowns! Topped with the Yellowbird hot sauce and wow, a perfect breakfast food.
