Uchi////The predominantly Caucasian servers are so polite and attentive that in some ways it can get almost creepy. They are servile - but often times I am wondering how sincere they really are. What bugs me is that these servers never got any training about Japanese food- if you are experienced in sushi and order using the Japanese names, they won't understand you, and you will have to repeat it in English. We ordered Karaage appetizer, and the handsome muscular bodybuilder server said: here is your "Kackey-Yackey" appetizer! Kackey-Yackey, really!? Instead of Ikura, they brought us an order of "Eye-Coorah"... Uni (sea urchin) at Uchi sounds like "You-Nay" (and they were out of it during a couple of our recent visits, with the excuse that "its not in season"... but we did get great fresh Uni the next day @ the second best Sushi joint in town... Also the Japanese supermarket in Houston has been carrying Uni without any interruption)... This is all very entertaining, except that it doesn't go that great with the high-end 'authentic' Japanese culinary experience they are supposed to be building... Even if you can't avoid the heavy Southern-American accent, at least could you try to double-check the dish's name before serving it... I know hiring Japanese-American servers is next to impossible in a jumbo city like Houston where the Asian population percentage seems to be a single digit...
