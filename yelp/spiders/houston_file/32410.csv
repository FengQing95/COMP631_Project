Local Foods////This place had great reviews, so me and my husband decided to make the journey to Rice Village and check it out.  So worth it.  I had the Crunchy Chicken and my husband had the Smoked Salmon.  We always cut whatever we order in half and share so that we are able to try each others.  I was reluctant to try his Salmon sandwich because I am not a big fan of salmon but he said if I didn't like it he would trade it back.  I took a bite and I loved it.  That is really saying something because I stepped out of my comfort zone and was pleasantly surprised.  Not to mention, the customer service was outstanding.  The guy at the counter was very friendly and funny.  He offered to let us try any of the salads because for the novice foodie they may be intimidating.  We also had a chocolate cupcake that the guy said was made by a 75 year old woman.  God bless that woman.
