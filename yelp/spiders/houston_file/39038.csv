Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I LOVE churros. And red velvet. I hyped myself up for these more than I should have. The cinnamon sugar was more cinnamon than sugar, which dried my mouth out in a puzzling way. The dipping sauce was delicious. But, $12 for a plate of 4 churros? They were stupid expensive. I've had better, crispier churros from a Mexican food stand for less than half the price.
