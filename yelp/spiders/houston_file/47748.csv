Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I almost gave SNOOZE 4 stars for the 2 hour predicted wait but then I remembered that while I was eating my food I told my friend I would wait that long again. And in the end we only waited an hour & a half for a table. The dirty drunken chai & bloody Mary's are fun, delicious, and the prices are totally decent!
