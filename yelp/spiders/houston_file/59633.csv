Baby Barnaby's//// I ordered the green eggs with a biscuit instead of toast from the guy next to me's recommendation.   It was great, although very very cheesy.  The biscuits are good too, not the real crumbly kind and they kind of taste like honey.  It also comes with a nice pile of breakfast potatoes, crunchy on the outside like fries.
