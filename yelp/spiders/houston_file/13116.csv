JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My girlfriend got the curry, which was diced chicken in a curry sauce and a side of some really good white rice. It was also good, but not amazing. The portion size was way too small, but I suppose for a trendy location that's to be expected. We will probably try different dishes some other time.
