JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have become a Jinya regular. Love love love this spot and their tasty ramen. I've tried it many different ways but spicy with crunchy onion is my favorite. If you haven't tried this ramen bar yet, you are seriously depriving yourself of noodle goodness!! If you can, eat at the bar when Shalon is working. She is awesome!
