JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is fantastic. Not only the food but their staff, making me feel taken care of and important. I'll continue to come back to JINYA because of staff members like Anna. She dealt with being behind the bar tonight and kept her cool even with sassy patrons over some chili powder. The food is top notch and worth every minute of your patience if there is a wait. Thank you thank you thank you to everyone at JINYA serving Houston with amazing food and service. Keep it up.
