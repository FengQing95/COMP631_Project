Local Foods////After looking at the menu, I was a bit skeptical if I would enjoy this place. And I absolutely love it. I had the crunchy chicken sandwich (although I am not sure what is supposed to be 'crunchy') and the vegan gumbo. Both were very flavorful and the portion size was very good. I have only been here once and that was during lunch time. I definitely will be back to try more of the menu items.
