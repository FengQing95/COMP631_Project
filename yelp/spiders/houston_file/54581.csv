Kata Robata////Well worth the wait. And from what I hear there is always a wait, considering how amazing this place is. I went on a whim with a friend and let them order since they'd been there before...wow. An amazing surprise. I wish I could remember everything we had but it's been a while. The hamachi and quail egg were unforgettable, though. I can't wait to share this place with everyone! It's definitely my new favorite sushi spot.
