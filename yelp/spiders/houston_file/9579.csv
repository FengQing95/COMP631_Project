JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////All in all, Jinya is a very hip ramen restaurant in Midtown with friendly staff, great appetizers, and consistently okay ramen. I understand the hype and why it stays so busy. I'll keep coming when friends invite me, but Jinya won't be the first on my list when I'm wanting some ramen.
