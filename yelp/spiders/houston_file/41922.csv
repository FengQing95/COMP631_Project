Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It seems as if the service, quality, and culture is inconsistent. My first visit here was great. However we had a very disappointing experience this morning. The manager was rude and unaccommodating when I asked if my eggs could be cooked a little longer. She said no, that it was PRE MADE this morning and there was nothing she could do about changing the chef's dish. So much for being fresh and cooked to order! The manager claimed that it was on the menu and she could prove that it was a soft poached egg....yeah I looked at the menu, it was fried. Why even say something like that though!? She didn't offer anything, so ended up with a overly spicy, egg yolk mush. Mmm delicious. We will not be returning.
