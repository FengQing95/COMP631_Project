Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Brought my daughter here after daycare thinking her and I could enjoy an afternoon of Mommy Cappuccino and Hibiscus tea for her. I looked at the website with coming here prepared to order some yummy treats! The macaroons were spot on as well as the treats ! Though I was served with little to no engagement. The place is cool but the service is COLD and uninviting. I was really looking for a place that would my go to place since I work less than a block away with a few hundred caffeine enthusiasts like myself but with was a miss. ::Sad::
