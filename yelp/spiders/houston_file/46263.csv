Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If you want to wow a crowd at a dinner gathering, order from Common Bond!! This is my go to for desserts and it's always a crowd pleaser. I order a variety of options online- pastries, cookies, macaroons. It's so easy and the food is absolutely delicious!! I pick up curbside. It's all very efficient. Great customer service. And the packaging is so pretty. Great presentation when meeting with friends.
