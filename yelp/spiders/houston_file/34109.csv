Local Foods////I appreciate Local Foods' glorification of healthier options--they do gorgeous beet salads (I LOVED THIS--julienned beets, mint, wheatberries, cirtus--I need to try to recreate it), quinoa salads (edamame, bell pepper, almonds, a hint of coconut--This was my favorite thing in a long time), vegan potato salad, kale salad, and cole slaw. They also offer some pretty stunning dessert options, and a wide drink selection. NOW LETS TALK ABOUT SANDWICHES.
