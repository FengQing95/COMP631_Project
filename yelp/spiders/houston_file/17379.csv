Uchi////Wow!  This place rocks. I feel bad I don't live in Houston or I'd be here all the time. What did I not like?  Can't think of any. Service was over-the-top excellent. Our sushi chef was absolutely talented. The food was to die for- so delicious & beautifully presented. I don't usually eat raw fish, but I did share 2 orders of Hama Chili with my husband...so yummy.  I don't like Brussels sprouts, but at urging of our sushi chef, we ordered it. I was so disappointed when it was gone so quickly. It was so, so, so delicious. We enjoyed everything we ordered.  Must try: Walu Walu (yum), bacon otoshi (yum yum), machi cure (good enough to compete against iron chef Morimoto).  What can I say?  The next time I return to Houston- I'm heading straight to Uchi!
