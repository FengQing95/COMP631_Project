The Pit Room////There was no method to the outside pickup madness. Our food was not ready when we arrived. We kept told to wait "just a little bit longer" for ribs. Then after half an hour, we were told "it's gonna be awhile" and offered the option to cancel our order or swap for any of their other meets. Mind you, at this point there was a good-sized crowd all waiting for ribs. (Side note: how do you screw up this bad when you get your orders in advance?!?) There was only one other person left who had been waiting longer than me, but the guy in charge of canceling or modifying orders to account for the rib issue seemed perfectly content to address the orders of multiple male customers who had arrived after me before speaking with me. I had to be pretty forceful to avoid being overlooked, and he seemed a bit peeved that a woman was not willing to wait her turn. I was then told my options for what meats I could swap for were severely limited. At that point we just cut our losses and canceled our order.
