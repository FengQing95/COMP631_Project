Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////However, I would not recommend the latte. It was fairly good at first, but has a semi-grainy taste that left my throat sort of scratchy and uncomfortable afterwards. Wifi also only lasts for 1 hour, since they have to leave space for people grabbing brunch or another meal here...which is a bit of a downer if you're trying to find a cafe to do work at. :(
