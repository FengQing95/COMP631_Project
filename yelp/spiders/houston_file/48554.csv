Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////However, the food (and menu) was awesome as expected. I do think this place is slightly overhyped, but we don't have that many good brunch places in Houston so I think that for what it is, it deserves the hype. The food took a while to come out though (I think maybe 40 minutes or more), but I guess that's unsurprising. I probably won't come on the weekends given the crazy waits, but will definitely try a random weekday visit in the future!
