Uchi////A5 strip with bok choy and mustard greens we were a bit let down. Ok this was $65 the most expensive thing on menu. I hate to say also the most disappointing on the menu. The meat was lightly seared but felt cold and oily. I had waygu and kobe before even in japan & texas it just tasted like chewing on a piece of cold fat. The vegetables was very char but under seasoned. Just char taste. We both ate a bite and did not want any more. It was $65 so $11 a piece less than .25oz maybe of disappointment.
