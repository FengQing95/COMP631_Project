Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love this bakery! I've been here multiple times for a sweet treat. I was finally able to make it out for breakfast and got the biscuits and gravy. The biscuits and gravy were topped with a poached egg that was cooked to perfection! I would go as far to say that the biscuits and gravy are the best I've ever had! The blackberry lemon macaron is fantastic! A perfect blend of flavor! The Nutella Bombe is also fantastic, but very rich! A glass of milk would compliment it well. I had the lavender creme brûlée and it was a good blend of flavor, but i found that I prefer regular creme brûlée. My only complaint is the coffee. I would like to give the coffee another try, which is why I still have this place 5 stars, plus the deliciousness of everything else makes up for he coffee I had. I ordered an iced latte and it tasted so burnt I could not even drink it. Before I left I asked for some more vanilla syrup to try to mask the burn flavor, but it did not help. I ended up throwing it away. I hope it was just a bad day for coffee because it would be very disappointing if that is the norm!
