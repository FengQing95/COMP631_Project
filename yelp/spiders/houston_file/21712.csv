Uchi////Definitely restating what everyone else's reviews say, but this place is uh.  maze.  ing.  This is definitely a special occasion type restaurant (unless you're baller enough to eat here on the reg, if so hollaaaaa ;) ).  The prices of the dishes are regularly on the steeper side, but the quality of the ingredients is worth the price IMO.  Some of the combinations sound weird at first, but somehow it just works.  The dishes are meant to be shared amongst the table, but hot or cold dishes, you honestly can't go wrong anywhere.  Also, I'm fairly certain their Brussels sprouts are laced with crack.
