JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thanks for your concern as I am more then happy to elaborate.  I think the inconsistencies are in the broth that makes it the most noticeable.  As you know, it is the heart of the dish.   Some days the broth is lackluster and some days it tastes nice and rich.  The chasu is also over salted on rare occasions.
