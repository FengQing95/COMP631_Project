Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////She whispered something to another lady, who waited about 30 secs before coming up to me.  The other lady  said she would get me fresh hash browns.   She apologized and said it's a very cold day and the hash browns werent as hot as normal.  I took a bite and said no these are very hot.   It is clear the plate sat out too long before bring it to my table.  Basically  no response after that.
