Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The hype is false!  The wait is entirely to long for the quality of food and service.. props to them though for constantly having a line out the door and a 2 hour wait .  I tried this place 3 times .. I kept hoping it would wow me ... it got worse every time.  The pancake selection was unique but they don't have a classic plain one to enjoy. Bummer .  The Benedict's were cool and tasty but the portion size was such a turn off .  The staff were polite but overwhelmed with the amount of tables they were assigned.  Overall terrible experience and will never come back .. this is a WARNING to people who enjoy a hearty breakfast and don't wanna wait for 2 hours !
