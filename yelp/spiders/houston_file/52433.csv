Kata Robata////After visiting this place more than 7 times, I'm breaking up. My drink (haikado summer) tastes different every time & my desired dessert (that is on the dessert menu) was only available during HRW. Â And why should I spend $20 on lobster mac and cheese that I have to add Kraft & crab to when I get home!
