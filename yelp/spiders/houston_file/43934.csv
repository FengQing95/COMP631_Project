Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First of all, I love desserts. Underneath my magic shell chocolate exterior, forged from years of scarfing down rocky road ice cream and sprinkles, is still the young me of 4th grade: husky, grandiose, and living off of egg tarts. I can't even look at desserts without giggling, therefore these will be judged on a giggle scale.
