Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Good drinks and atmosphere but food was mediocre. I ordered a bosscat burger for the first time. It was gigantic! But it tastes just like any other burgers...nothing too special. However the fries were horrible! They were potato wedges literally soaked in oil and grease...was way too overfried! Sadly I have to say that was one of the worst fries I have ever tried. Service was alright but when I explained to the waiter about the fries since I barely touched them, he never comped it or apologize for the quality of the food...
