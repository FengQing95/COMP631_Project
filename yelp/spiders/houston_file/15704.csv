JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////No place does Ramen like JINYA. I've never had ramen like here. I'm a "non-traditionalist" and prefer the thicker noodles. If you haven't had ramen before, this is the place to go. I've always had excellent customer service when eating here. The wait staff has always been ready and willing to make suggestions or answer any question I have; Â no matter how silly I think it is.
