Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////These people have A LOT to learn about customer service. When the kitchen is out of something that someone has already paid for, and there isn't a reasonable substitution, you need to make it up to them. There are too many other good restaurants in Houston for me to waste any more time or money at Common Bond.
