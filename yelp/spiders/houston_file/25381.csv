Uchi////My fiancÃ¨ and I decided to have our anniversary dinner here and we really enjoyed our experience. We ordered the chef's tasting omakase. We also ordered a lycheese and sastsuka cocktails. It was a 10 course meal and we were so stuffed afterwards. Our favorite was the fatty tuna, the pork katsu, and fried milk for dessert. Highly recommended to get this omakase. We paid roughly $300 but it was worth it!
