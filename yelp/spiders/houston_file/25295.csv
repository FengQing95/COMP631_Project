Uchi////I came here for a double date and it was amazing. Our waiter was funny and brought me a chair for me to place my purse on (after I asked). The food was absolutely amazing and my boyfriend, who never eats sushi, ate it and loved it. We both have sensitive stomachs, so usually we get sick after sushi, but we were both completely fine with no stomach pain. We got the flounder, the piece of salmon, the tuna sashimi, and a few other dishes. The alcohol was also amazing and our waiter knew exactly what to order for us just from us describing what we wanted. I'll definitely be coming back here with my boyfriend. It was the best sushi I've had and had an amazing time with my friends.
