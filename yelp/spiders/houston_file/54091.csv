Kata Robata////Our go-to sushi in the neighborhood.  Food is always fresh and on point.  Service is great and accommodating! Note table #31 is under the AC and it get very chilly.  Don't have a favorite or must try roll here because it's a place where everything you get will be amazing! Thank you Kata!
