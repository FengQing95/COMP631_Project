Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Had high expectations based on reviews but I wasn't overly impressed.  It is a trendy place and was decently packed, but not slammed.  Service was a little slow and my food didn't come out hot.  I was also disappointed with my entree.  It was good enough, but not sure I would go again for the food.  They did have a good Old Fashioned so may return for drinks
