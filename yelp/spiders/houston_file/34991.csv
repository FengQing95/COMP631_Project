Local Foods////I came here for dinner on a Friday night and there wasn't much of a wait! The lines run quickly and the food comes out fast The staff are nice and friendly and the place has a cool and casual vibe to it. The most annoying problem is parking, but if you're going anywhere in Rice Village you'll have the same problem.
