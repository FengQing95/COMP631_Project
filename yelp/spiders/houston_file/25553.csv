Uchi////If you're there for social hour, always get that AND the chef's choice. It sits at $4/pc but the I'm sure the fish rotates based on how much they have in stock or how the chef feels on that particular day, and today they were serving loup de mer--and good God, I had to get another couple pieces after trying it; ontop they accent the fish with a bit of olive oil, a few flakes of kosher salt, and something green (maybe some kind of dill puree?).
