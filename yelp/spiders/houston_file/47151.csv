Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Went in at about 11 am on a Friday with no reservation. as expected, there was a wait, maybe 30 mn, but, since i was alone, i was seated immediately at the bar. nice atmosphere, wait staff and others were singing along with the tunes. ordered cafe latte, standard breakfast of eggs poached, sausage, hash browns, and english muffin.
