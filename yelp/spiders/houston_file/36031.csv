Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Food was excellent, service was even better. Very cool ambience and vibe to the place. Had the pork belly poutine and frog legs which didn't last long on the table. Â Tried the 12 hour short rib which was super flavorful and tender. Cajun brick chicken was good but the dirty rice that came with it took it to the next level. Would definitely come back.
