The Pit Room////Coming back for the Patio + Brisket / Came in on a cool Saturday evening to watch the iron Bowl - Alabama vs. Auburn!! Good outdoor seating with enough TVs to fill the patio. Ordered a 1/2 pound of Ribs, brisket, potato salad & venison sausage. Came with a buddy to split the meal and portion size was decent and all meats cooked well to perfection! The potato salad was pretty bland but understandable as it is a very subjective dish. All in all they'll see me gracing their patio again!
