JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Food. Yes, there are better Ramen. For example in Japan, NYC, LA, or SF. But all those places are irrelevant when you are looking for Ramen while residing in Houston. So far, this is as good as it gets in Houston. Ramen wise that is. Broth is thick and sufficiently flavored, Noodles have just enough bite. Pork chashu cooked through so that it falls apart in your mouth while still retaining enough texture so that you need to chew it. Other ingredients tasty as well. You can add all kinds of stuff to the base soups.
