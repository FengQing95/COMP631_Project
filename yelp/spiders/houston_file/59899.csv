Baby Barnaby's////Edit: After finally being seated, I have to say the food was above average. Ordered the migas w chorizo and it was delicious. Also ordered the French toast and it was great. Â The staff realized they took long to seat us and gave us a complimentary fruit bowl which was nice. Also, the service one we were seated was spectacular, as expected of course considering the long wait. Changing my review to 4 stars
