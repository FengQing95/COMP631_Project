Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great atmosphere, no line on a weekday , I loved their French toast it was light and flavorful. They even have coffee for when there is a line. Also I find them technologically Â advanced they hand you the check if you pay card you can do it yourself each check comes with a small machine that allows you to pay. They also take cash . Only downfall is they didn't have Splenda which is what my family uses but the stevia did the job ! Will definitely come back and is worth the wait if we had to wait too !
