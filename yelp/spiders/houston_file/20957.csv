Uchi////In all, service by our primary server was very lackluster and I felt as if we were being rushed. We don't get a lot of opportunities to dine at high-end establishments like this, and because we were celebrating a birthday, I would have liked a bit more fanfare. In an hour's time we were finished with our whole meal and had dropped around $200, if not more, and some appreciation for choosing Uchi (or at least a "Happy birthday!") would have been nice.
