The Pit Room////First off let me say... that wagyu beef rib was everything and deserves 6 stars. It was truly an experience and well worth the price. Now, I only gave 4 stars because Â the other meats were just ok and the sides (macaroni and elote) were subpar to me. We tried the pulled pork, brisket, and pork ribs. The pork ribs were tender and had a good taste... but I tell you nothing will ever taste better than the wagyu beef rib.
