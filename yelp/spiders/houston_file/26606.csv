The Pit Room////This was my first time having BBQ in Houston and it was great! Delicious food, quick and efficient service. Will be bringing back our family and friends when they come to visit. I had pulled pork with charro beans and potatoe salad. My husband had the 2 meat dinner of sausage and brisket he enjoyed.
