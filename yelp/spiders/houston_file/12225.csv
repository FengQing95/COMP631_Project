JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It is small establishment so make sure your whole party is with you or you'll have to wait to be seating. Thankfully, it's not so tight that you're sitting on top of each other. The staff wasn't slow and are easy to get a hold of if you need anything. The menu is easy to understand.
