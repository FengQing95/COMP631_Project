Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I am IN LOVEEE with this cafe. I moved to Houston just a month ago and have gone to this cafe so much I don't even know how I existed without this place. Not only is this cafe adorable, they really have the best pastries ever. I nearly died when I saw some Kouign-amanns in their pastry case. It is insanely delicious - Buttery, soft with so many layers. Kind of like a perfectly caramelized croissant. Oh speaking of croissants, their croissants are also to die for. And that lavender latte! OMG. Ultimate perfection. Please just come here.
