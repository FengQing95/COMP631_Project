Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The shrimp and grits were different from what I've had before in that it came with a salad, there was a soupy sauce, and the grits were very coarse (you could see portions of the kernel in it). It was very tasty but did get to be a bit heavy after a while, so mixing in some liquids or chocolate helped to balance it out a bit.
