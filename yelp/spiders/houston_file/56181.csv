Kata Robata////The blueberry cake and earl grey ice cream is by far my favorite dessert. The blueberry jam on the side compliments it well, and follows the theme nicely of eating all flavors in a bite. This also gives an English tea time experience and is well worth it. The earl grey is spectacular and sits on a crunchy delicious crumble that adds an exciting texture to the whole piece.
