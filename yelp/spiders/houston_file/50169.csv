Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I remember being young (I'm old now) and hanging out in the Montrose area. At the time I was too young to get into the clubs, but I could hang out during the day and visit the shops and enjoy the restaurants. And I could remember that every restaurant I had gone to the people were just very welcoming and they usually lived in the area.
