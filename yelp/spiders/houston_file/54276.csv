Kata Robata////3. The sushi platter left something to be desired. It came with a roll (which was pretty good, but nothing special), and your typical sushi selection - eel, salmon, tuna, scallop, and yellowtail. Perhaps if I'd ordered whatever was fresh at the sushi bar that day, the quality of fish would have been better. But I was really disappointed when my eel was full of bones and the scallop tasted tinny.
