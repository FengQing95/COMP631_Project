Kata Robata////5 stars.  I love eating here.  Food here is fun to eat.  The plates can be very creative like the miso-crusted bone-marrow.  It can be very filling like the uni chawanmushi or the foie gras/duck chawanmushi.  It can be decadent like their 72-hr Kobe Beef Skewer robata.  They're not perfect (ramen is ok and I've had better ika sugata yaki at other places).  Definitely pricey.  I still need to try their omakase here one of these days (esp the fugu).  Sushi-wise, maybe not a good value.  But coming here, I always make it a point to order their specials and try something new, that's what separates Kata Robata from the rest of the pack.
