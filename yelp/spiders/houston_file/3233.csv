JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I came here with coworkers for lunch on Thursday. Place was pretty crowded and quite loud which I guess is the atmosphere they are going for. The waitress was pretty helpful and nice (so lucky they get to wear t-shirts and yoga pants. talk about comfy work clothes!). She was also attentive and ensured out drinks were always full. I ordered the plain Chicken Ramen with pork gyoza and salad. The ramen itself was good. Broth was flavorful and they have extra seasoning at the table if you want more (yes please!). The thin noodles are nice and slurpy. The salad was mixed greens rather than plain iceberg which I seriously appreciate but the dressing (ginger? miso? both?) was a little disappointing. Perhaps it's because I'm used to teh dressing being a little more on the creamy side while this was pretty lumpy. The gyoza were tiny but very delicious! It was definitely plenty of food for lunch. I've been to the restaurant before and have even gotten to-go food (don't really recommend because the noodles get clumpy together) but it's a very nice place. I'll always be happy to return.
