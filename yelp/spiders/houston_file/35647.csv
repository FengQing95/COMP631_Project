Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Followed them for a while on Instagram and finally made the trek in- did not disappoint! I don't know if this review could fit all of the positive adjectives about this place, but I will start with amazing, awesome, spectacular and delicious!! Lots of tv's for sports viewing and lots of booze and liquor for a fun time!!Ask for Megan at the bar because she is phenomenal and definitely knows her stuff! I would recommend it to everyone and I will be back!!
