Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I wrote a review of this location a month or so ago and it was scathing regarding the service that day. I went back again today because the management sent me a gift card for the terrible service. So today, I went back using the gift card sent me. Today when I went back to use the last remaining balance on the card, I placed a take out order. The morning manager took the order. Her attitude and service were great. When the order was brought up to the front, I stood up ready to leave. There were three employees at the back of the bar standing there. I stood there at the front of the restaurant for several minutes looking at them waiting for one to come up front to bag the order so I could leave. After about five minutes I got fed up with the three staring at me not doing anything but to stare at me. I got fed up with the staring contest, grabbed my order and left but came back to make the manager aware of what was going on. Now, I'm not stupid. I know what standing around and staring at someone looks like. I also don't like being told that I don't understand because there's a lot going on in the restaurant.Or that they were trying to determine if the take our order was mine or not. That's hard to determine from across the room without coming to the front desk and looking at the damned order. I have tried more than once at this location and except for one person, "take out order" customer service is absolutely horrible. I do not want a gift card to make up for this. Someone needs to address this with the employees there. You see a take out order brought up front and you know there's only one person sitting there waiting on it, it's a good bet it belongs to that person. Even if there is more than one person waiting for take out and an order is brought up front, you don't stand around in the back of the bar trying to determine who the hell it belongs too. You go up front and check it out.
