Kata Robata////We started off looking at the happy hour menu, really good deals. I concentrated on the sushi on the happy hour menu. There was the phoenix roll, spicy tuna, crunchy eel, something with tuna, mango and avocado (try it next time.) I decided on miso soup, the crunchy eel roll, flying fish roe sushi and salmon sushi. Josh got the phoenix roll and a rock and roll. My friend Liz got the phoenix roll and the crunchy eel roll. I really enjoyed my crunch eel roll, as did LIz. It was really big (12 pieces I think) and at $6 you really can't beat it. Both of my sushis were very good (they are always my fav's). I was a little disappointed that they don't have any sushi on their happy hour, just rolls. The phoenix roll surprised us after we heard the directions. We thought that there would be the tempura crunchies on top but it was actually put into a tempura batter like tempura shrimp and the whole thing fried. I really enjoyed them but since Liz was expecting something else she didn't enjoy them as much as their other rolls. Josh like his Rock and Roll but not as much as the phoenix.
