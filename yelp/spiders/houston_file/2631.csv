JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Meh is a decent way to describe this place. I have a friend who thinks this place has the best ramen, but that doesn't matter because he's wrong. Another friend and I, who we fancy ourselves to be quite connoisseurs of food, thought this place hovered around PAR. Compared to other places in Houston, this may be a better option for ramen. But compared to other places in Texas in general for ramen, it's probably in the middle of that list. For those visiting from DFW, Tei An is still much better than this place but this place is better than Hanabi (which sucks so that doesn't say much haha). But back to the beginning.
