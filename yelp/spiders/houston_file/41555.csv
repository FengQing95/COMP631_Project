Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Came in today after work to get a quick iced doppio before my afternoon swim (1 1/2 miles NBD or anything.) Saw Emily, first thing she did was compliment my mustache. I responded by throwing the rest of my cash into her tip jar. Wish there was a six star rating option...
