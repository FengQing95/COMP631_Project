Kata Robata////We got there just as they were making the last call for their sushi happy hour. The happy hour menu consisted of your basic sushi rolls (think Spicy Tuna, California, etc.) but the prices were very decent ($4-$6), and I have to admit, it enticed me. I ordered the Spicy Tuna and the Spicy Salmon rolls. Each roll consisted of 8 pieces which is an A+ in my book.
