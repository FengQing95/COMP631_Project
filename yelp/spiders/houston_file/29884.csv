The Pit Room////My wive's two taco meal looked great.  The brisket taco was huge and was stuffed with a large portion of meat.  Topped with cheese, cilantro, and sour creme.  High quality good stuff.  The chicken taco was just as impressive.  On a small griddle they fried up the cheese for the chicken taco as well as 4 or 5 gloves of fresh garlic to top it off.
