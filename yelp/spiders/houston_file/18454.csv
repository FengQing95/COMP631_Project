Uchi////We were taken to a table but I had preferred a booth. I had let the waitress that led me to the table know that I would prefer a booth but all she said was "Oh okay. Well you can stand here and I'll check with the hostess." What? (There was only two other tables int he restaurant, it's 5:00pm, opening time) We're a two-top, you get plenty of those. Weird.
