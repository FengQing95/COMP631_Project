Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love everything about this place!  My mom and I came here since we were in town, and we had heard so many wonderful reviews about this place.  We were super lucky to not have to wait in line when we went.  We ordered a Caramel and Vanilla Latte, a Soft Scramble, Bialy, Plain Croissant, Almond Croissant, Kugelhopf, and Kouign Amman.  Everything was so delicious.  I miss it, and I will definitely be back when I'm in town again.
