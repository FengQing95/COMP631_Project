The Pit Room////Service was superb and the food was excellent. Definitely give this place a try. Some might view them as being a little pricey but I will admit the food is worth the money. I had the ribs and brisket. I give the ribs a 9 and the brisket 4.5. The potato salad was as made with to much mustard for my liking which appears to be the norm here in Houston. The ribs were very tender however they did not fall off the bone (which is great) real bbq enthusiast know while the rib should be tender, all the meat SHOULD NOT fall off the bone!!!
