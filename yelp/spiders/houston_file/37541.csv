Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Man where do I start. The atmosphere and vibe in this place is tremendous. I came here for a few drinks and appetizers right after my movie & I must say I was truly impressed with the service. My waiter was Henry and he was very courteous and knowledgeable about the items on the menu. Our drinks and food was served in a timely manner even with it being a packed house. The manager Chase came by and introduced himself to us and made it a point to check in on us periodically to make sure everything was fine.
