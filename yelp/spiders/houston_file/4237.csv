JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We came during the lunch rush and were seated quite a bit quicker than the estimated wait time. I ordered the chef special and it was delicious! Plenty of noodles, tasty broth, lots of chicken, and all of the flavor was great! Service was also excellent and they were happy to split checks - major plus for group dining!
