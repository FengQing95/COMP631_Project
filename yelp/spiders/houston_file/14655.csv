JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was a little underwhelmed. I had high expectations for Jinya and they did fall short of those expectations. Overall, the flavors worked well together, but I wouldn't say it was exceptional. I would have hoped that if I were to order a product off the menu with the restaurant name in the title, I would be getting something that would be considered a staple of the establishment. Something that when you eat it, you get that feeling of "Wow, this is delicious and I get it, this is Jinya." However, I did not find that to be the case for the Jinya Tonkostu Black.
