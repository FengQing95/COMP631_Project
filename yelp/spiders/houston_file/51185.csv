Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////They need bring Snooze in from Texas to LA!  Actually there are a few locations in SD as well, so maybe it won't be that long before it comes to the City of Angels.  Walked over from our Air BnB in Montrose area before heading out to the Johnson Space Center.  Had to fuel the brain before learning about space and this is a perfect place to go!  We ordered the Chile Verde and Smashes Avocado Bennie (they have an option where you can try two types of their eggs Benedict, but just get half of an order), and OMG French toast.  Both bennie's were really good, and it was nice that the hollandaise sauce came on the side, and didn't break.  The French Toast had toasted coconut on it and was sweet but not cloyingly so.  Pricing is fair for breakfast/brunch places,  and service is pretty attentive.  We didn't have to wait for a table, which was nice (granted we did come on a Tuesday morning).
