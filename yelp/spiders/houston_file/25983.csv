The Pit Room////First time trying it, brisket is 7.8/10, potato salad and cole slaw side were a bit weak, especially cole slaw. Cole slaw is supposed to be their to help cut the fat from brisket but this cole slaw had zero dressing to it. The flow for the line is not designed well at all, otherwise recommended.
