Uchi////Uchi is one of my all-time favorite Houston places. I was first introduced to Uchi in Austin, TX. The highly acclaimed brussel sprouts are a must try, crispy, salty, with a nice carmelized tang. Although not traditional sushi, the ham and eggs roll is still one of the best items on the menu. We also love the zero sen roll, short rib, and walu walu. I recommend the happy hour for the best prices and the short wait. If you love good food, this is a must try restaurant.
