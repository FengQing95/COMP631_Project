Uchi////The delishly glazed Brussels sprouts are like crack and a bowl or two is a must for every table. I've had everything from the raw to the cooked and you can't go wrong. I'd mention specific dishes but literally I just have the waiters bring out their recommended dishes. Also have lots of sushi type food if you like that as well and cooked food for those friends who don't (but you should try it anyways)
