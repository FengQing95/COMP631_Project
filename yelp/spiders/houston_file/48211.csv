Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So, I must say that after my previous review a corporate representative contacted me to discuss my issues. I appreciate that because in 2017 most businesses wouldn't care. My husband and I went back to try snooze for a third time....and we truly enjoyed our meal. The food was hot and delicious!!! Out wait staff at the bar was fun and pleasant. I would definitely go back in the future. Great job Snooze!
