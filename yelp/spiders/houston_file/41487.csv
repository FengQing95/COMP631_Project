Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is the best bakery in Houston. Tastes like a real french croissant. Get there early or you will be one of these complainers down below, because everyone knows they are the best so they DO sell out every day. We tried their "KOUIGN AMMAN" "CHERRY PAIN PERDU", "BANANA PUREE YOGURT PARFAIT" and the "HAM & EGG TORTA". My favorits were the kouign and parfait, but my boyfriend preferred the pain perdu and torta... so essentially it worked perfectly. We plan to come back again with our sunday paper to enjoy the atmosphere and eat the BEST breakfast in Houston
