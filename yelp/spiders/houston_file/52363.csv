Kata Robata////I'm a sushi fan and this is my favorite sushi in Houston. Great atmosphere as well. But tonight this grandma tried to ruin it. Might i say that I love my own grandma and I actually play bridge with a bunch of grandmas on a regular basis. But seriously grandma, if you don't like soft techno music in the background of this hip sushi bar then stick to Denny's. Don't complain to the manager like you own the joint and ruin it for the rest of us. God love those who respect their elders bc the manager actually changed the music. I almost asked the manager to go back to the former CD - not worth it. But yes, great sushi. Love the miso soup. Nice selection of Japanese beers as well. I almost ordered the lobster mac and cheese tonight, but I just couldn't resist ordering the creative sushi rolls that I've admired over the past few months of coming here regularly. The table next to us ordered a sizzling plate of seafood noddles which looked and smelled delish.
