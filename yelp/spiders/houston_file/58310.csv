Baby Barnaby's////(no more than 15 minutes) considering how small the place is. You have to write your name on a board outside. For how busy it is though, the staff is amazingly friendly. If the weather is bad expect to wait upwards of 45-60 minutes since the patio pretty much doubles the seating space. Also, I don't recommend coming here with large groups during peak times.
