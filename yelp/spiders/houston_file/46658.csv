Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Have to update my review from the last time I've been at Common Bond. I went here on a Sunday evening and the service was so bad. First off, my friends latte came out with lipstick marks on the cup. When we asked to replace, the service gave us a weird look. I think it's pretty reasonable to not want to drink from a cup that's not properly cleaned! Also I ordered a Prosecco and they charged me for it but after a long wait, they came back and said they do not have Prosecco. The guy who was explaining to me said they didn't charge me for it even though I definitely paid for the Prosecco from my bank statement. After that, he said he will take care of it and remove the Prosecco charge from their end. My other friend asked to heat up her pastries and they said no. She also had to wait at least 30 mins for her london fog. When we went up to check up on it, the only response we got was not sure what happened but we don't have it, we will make a new one. I'd Â say the quality of the pastries and coffee stays consistent High disappointed by this place's customer service.
