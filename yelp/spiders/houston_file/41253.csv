Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The service was fine. The bread was good but I felt chastised by 2 employees when I only ordered a grilled cheese. This was my first time here and what I got did not fit the description on line. Mozzarella balls in a grilled cheese that costs ten dollars!!! It was disgusting. It wasn't boconcini it was just butter and balls. If it were Saturday night I wouldn't complain about butter and balls but i was at lunch on a Wednesday
