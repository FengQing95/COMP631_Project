Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Extremely trendy restaurant if you are into that type of thing. All I care about is the food and drinks. I ordered a mimosa with pineapple juice. Nothing special. I also ordered the morning margarita which was amazing. Extremely fruity drink. Worse choice of all was the bacon Bloody Mary (not a fan of bloody Mary's but a huge fan of bacon). I had plenty of time to order the drinks because of the wait which was AN HOUR and a few minutes LONG. Which was the worst part. Oh also the parking is horrible. Be prepared to walk. Now time for the food. I had a burrito with red salsa and green salsa which was the best part of this resultant. Definitely would go again just to have it.
