Uchi////-Nasu Nigiri ($3): I almost choked on my water when our waiter brought this out.  Two insanely thin and tiny slivers of eggplant on rice.  For $3?!?!  But after taking a bite and almost crying at how amazingly roasted the eggplant was/how interesting the flavor of the marinade was...wow.  Wish they had a $6 version with more slices!!  Now that I'm thinking about it I guess I could have just ordered 2 haha...
