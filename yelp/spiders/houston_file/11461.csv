JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I went with my brother who is the pickiest ramen eater ever! He's had it everywhere in the world and really enjoyed it at jinya. He said it's the best ramen he's had in Houston. Wasn't a huge fan of their tempura Brussels Sprouts but that's not why we were there! Loved the vegan ramen!!!
