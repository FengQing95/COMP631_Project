Baby Barnaby's////I ordered the Green eggs, which has spinach, artichokes, and cheese scrambled with 2 eggs. The eggs are creamy, flavorful, and cooked perfectly. Comes on the side are chicken sausage, which is the bomb, and hash brown, which are light and crispy. They have fresh squeeze orange juice!
