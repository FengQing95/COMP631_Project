Kata Robata////Super experience! While in Houston a friend and I were in the mood for sushi. We looked up the rating on Yelp and decided to try it, what a find. We went without reservation on a Saturday night and there was a 20 min wait so we decided to sit at the bar. The servers were amazing! The menu is pretty extensive and complex, the servers were very knowledgable and helpful in pointing different items on the menus. The sushi was excellent, but the standouts for me where the Pork Belly and Papaya Salad, Green Tea souffl√© Cheesecake, Miso Gyoza (pork potstickers ) and Uni Chaawanmushi .
