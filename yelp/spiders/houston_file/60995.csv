Baby Barnaby's////Portions are substantial, and the staff is happy to set you up with a doggy bag. While we finished off the corned beef hash (not traditional, served with cubed potatoes) and OJ, we left with a box filled with a 1/4 of the burrito (lots of egg whites, chicken, and black beans!) and to-go cups for fresh avocado and salsa. The waiter also refilled the coffee carafe and gave us a large eco-friendly to-go cup.
