Uchi////yokai berry (4/5)- atlantic salmon, dinosaur kale, asian pear, Â i loved the different textures and flavorings this dish provided. i wish there were more pieces of salmon though. there were maybe 6 or 7 chunks overall and ended up having a lot of kale and asian pear left over. there were also large sheets of fried seaweed?? (not sure what it was) some type of fried leafy vegetable, which soaked up a lot of oil ...which i found a bit overwhelming
