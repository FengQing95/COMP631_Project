Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////- I really like their Pancake Flight. Although most of the pancakes share the same base and just have different toppings/add-ins, I like it because I usually want to try different types of pancakes! Any of their pancakes are probably a safe bet (they're all fairly similar), but I particularly liked the Blueberry Danish pancakes and Pineapple Upsidedown pancakes.
