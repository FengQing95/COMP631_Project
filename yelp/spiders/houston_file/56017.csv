Kata Robata////My husband and I enjoyed our Sushi experience at Kata Robata. The staff was pleasant and helpful. We are not that experienced in ordering Sushi but had some great recommendations by friends. I enjoyed the Longhorn signature rolls and my husband loved the Rising Sun signature rolls. The rolls were absolutely delicious and a pretty presentation. The dining room is very noisy and I had to talk rather loud if I wanted my hubby to hear me. But once we started eating we didn't need to talk much.
