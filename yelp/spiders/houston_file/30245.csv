The Pit Room////Delicious. A quick BBQ fix. We had the 1 and 2 meats platters with 2 sides. A must go to Brisket and Pulled Pork. Our sides, Mac and coleslaw of course. The bread I can do with out. I wish it was corn bread though. Or a big Texas toast with butter and garlic. Lol. Also we had some tacos and the tortilla was amazing so soft and perfect, handmade. Just look out for spicy sauces just in case cause we are not big on spicy and the tacos had some big spice to it but we wanted it how it comes so we didn't mind it. The service was good and they are quick and very attentive. Oh the sauce on the side is great with your brisket and pulled pork. Delicious.
