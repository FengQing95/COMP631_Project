Kata Robata////In addition to the sashimi, I've had the Pork Dom, Lobster Mac & Cheese, Bone Marrow, Uni Pasta, Sake Mussels, and Kobe Beef (this is over the course of 3 trips, I swear I'm not a fatty). Most of the menu is tapas-style, so you're looking at smaller portions on most things, which means you should order two.
