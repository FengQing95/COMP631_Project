Kata Robata////Looking at the menu, there's many things to choose from.  I always make it a point to order something different and order a special of the day.  Today I decided to order food I usually hate and see if they can change my mind.  First up for me was the octopus crudo, one of their Houston Press specials.  It's a lovely dish with tako carpaccio swimming in olive oil with a light citrus flavor to it mixed with shimeji mushroom, cilantro, and supposedly volcanic salt.  it's sliced so thin that it almost melts in your mouth unlike typical tako nigiri that usually has a chewier consistency (ie. chewing a tire).  Topped with a flower, it's a pretty dish to behold and consume.  Next up was some sushi.  Uni here is always consistent, reliable, and delicious.  Foie gras of the ocean for me.  Speaking of which, the foie gras+scallop was amazing!  Typically I hate hotategai nigiri, but here it's wrapped with a piece of foie gras with kabayaki sauce (y'know, that brown sauce they put on eel) and oh boy it made the dish so buttery and decadent!  Mackerel is another least favorite of mine as  it tastes very fishy (I always smirk when using that term b/c I guess good fish shouldn't taste fishy?).  Today's special was mackerel-related, but it's smoked and treated with something else (sorry, can't remember what).  Eating it gave me the impression that I was eating smoked ham.  It was quite surprising to taste that, but so delish!  Had some barrelfish nigiri.  There isn't a wiki entry for this type of fish, so definitely uncharted waters for me to eat.  It's a sweet tasty fish with its delicate white meat.  Wouldn't say it's off-the-hook, but tasty nonetheless.  Then came out Ole' Reliable, the lobster mac'n'cheese.  It's mac'n'cheese with lobster meat in it.  I really don't know what more to say about it than that.  It's tasty, it's a simple dish, it's fun to eat, and it's like comfort food.
