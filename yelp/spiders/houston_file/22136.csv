Uchi////Valet complimentary. Small place. Wait time Monday evening @6:30 pm was quoted an hour and half although we waited just 30min. (The group of 4 who came after us did wait the full hr & half.) We Ordered drinks on the cramped patio while we waited. I was there for my cousin's bday, just us 4 ladies. We ordered the chef selection 10 sampler dishes @ $167 (serves 2) but we had to double it bc there were 4 of us. I had the champagne with frozen blueberries, very good drink. I have no idea the names of what I ate. We also added on a few more dishes and the milk ball dessert. The dessert was ok, not sweet which was good, but nothing to say wow about. Waitstaff was nice and helpful, full of expensive suggestions. Lol. Everything was pricey, but I expected it. Tip: Make sure you eat before you come bc trying to get full here will break your bank!
