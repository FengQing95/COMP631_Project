Uchi////The food.... we had the zero zen roll that was excellent - flavorful and creamy. The divers scallop sushi pieces were also very good, probably our favorite, they melted in your mouth. Then, the hamachi nabe was quite good as well, very flavorful. My husband liked the dessert, we ordered the fried milk. Other dishes were better than average, but forgettable. After visiting Morimoto's restaurant in New York, this was a bit of a disappointment.
