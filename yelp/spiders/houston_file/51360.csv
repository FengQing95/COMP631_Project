Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I have never been a huge breakfast food/ brunch person, but I love Snooze! It's my favorite brunch place ever!! The food is consistently amazing every time I go. However, whether I go on a weekday or at an early time on a weekend, there will always be a wait here. I think my shortest wait time was 25 minutes at noon on a Thursday, which is great for Snooze. It's usually 2 hours during peak times (noon/1pm) on Saturdays and Sundays.
