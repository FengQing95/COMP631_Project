JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As for the service, I have to say there was more to be desired. Our server wasn't terrible but she wasn't great. We never got our water refills and we felt like she could've been more attentive. My friend brought a birthday cake for me and gave it to a staff member to put it in the back until the end. When she brought the cake out, it was still in the box, with the candles still in its box, and it was warm. -_-
