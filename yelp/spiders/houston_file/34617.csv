Local Foods////One of the places I love to eat at, because the food here is fresh, health and so tasty!  It's hard to say what my favorite meal is as everything I've eaten leaves me with satisfaction. I find on a cooler day the soups are unique one that I simply love has coriander in it and is a must.  Also the selection of salads have interesting dressings that can be had on or on the side.  Casual, relaxing seating indoors or out.
