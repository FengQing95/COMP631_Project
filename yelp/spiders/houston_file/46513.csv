Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is definitely a cute little brunch spot. The lattes are good, I have yet to try the pastries but they look so yummy and pretty. I've had the vanilla lattes here and they are always good, the avocado toast and the shrimp and grits are pretty good as well.
