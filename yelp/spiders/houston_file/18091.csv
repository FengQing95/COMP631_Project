Uchi////Simply the best sushi I've ever had.  I don't think I will ever find better.  The atmosphere is also top-notch.  The wait staff explains each dish to you as they bring out your food.  Each dish is a special combination of flavors.  Yes, you will pay a lot of money, but in this case it is worth it.  You can also try it for happy hour where the prices are much cheaper.  You might have to reserve your table a week in advance.
