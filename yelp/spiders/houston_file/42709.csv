Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Always packed. You have to be smart with seating and pay attention to who's almost finish eating so you can grab it as soon as they get up or you'll be left waiting. However food was delicious! Definitely a great spot to try if you are a pastry and coffee lover.
