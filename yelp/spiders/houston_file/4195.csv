JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Very excellent. Checked this place out while vacationing in Houston. The service was good and very prompt. I liked the communal tables in the center of the room. Best part are the noodle refills, I live noodles so this was a plus! Definitely worth a try, plus the atmosphere is really fun, when new guests come in everyone yells. In short, go it does not disappoint.
