JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////If you can elaborate, I'd like to know what you ordered tonight being that it should not take 45 minutes for ramen to come out.  I'd like to investigate the issue personally as well as checking the cameras on my ramen line so I can prevent something like this from happening again.  On regular nights, ramen should be out in 15 minutes assuming no appetizers.  On Friday and Saturdays, it usually takes 25 minutes being that the restaurant would be packed.  45 minutes is way too long and I will address that with my ramen line chefs.  Also, should you ever have any issues with your food, please, please, please send it back.  It's the only way we can address issues and correct our mistakes.  I have managers on duty that are there just to handle these issues.  We will take it back and make you another one "on the fly" and get it out to you ASAP.  I'm here for my guests and so are my managers.  I have a motto I go by "If is it not GREAT. . . REMAKE".
