Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I was trying to think if there was any reason this place not deserve 5 stars and I could not come up with one.  Went for breakfast and I had the bread plate ($4) and my wife and the pain au chocolat.  Both were really good.  I got three types of bread, some different butters and jams and was really happy enjoying my coffee.  Got a free refill of the drip coffee which was a big highlight of my day,  yes I know that is sad.  The pain au chocolat was also really good especially for a guy who is not big on morning sweets.  Not super cheap, but by no means expensive for what you get.
