Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////What a way to start off my 22nd birthday!! Service was amazing. Funny, fast, and amazing!! Cracking jokes since the very beginning and they brought me a bed & breakfast shot to start w/ a candle. The food was to die for, French toast was out of this world!! I'm for sure coming back next birthday! Terry and Jose were the best waiters.
