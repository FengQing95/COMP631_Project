JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Simply delicious ramen!!! Great service! Always busy. I got the salmon poke tacos which weren't that great to be honest- could use some more flavor. The vegan ramen that my friend ordered was super good. I tried the chicken cilantro one which was ok but I wished I had tried a creamier ramen. Overall, I would come back to try more ramen for sure!
