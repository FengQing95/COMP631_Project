Local Foods////Local Foods is a trendy sandwich joint.  I've really enjoyed the food I've had there with high marks for their duck confit & roast beef sandwiches.  Besides homemade potato chips, they also have a variety of unique sides (the kale and orzo come to mind).  If its a lazy weekend, definitely worth a crosstown drive for sandwiches.
