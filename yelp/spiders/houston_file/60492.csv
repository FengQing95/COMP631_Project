Baby Barnaby's////3 months in Houston, 3 visits to Baby Barnaby's. It's the best brunch I've ever come across and the long queues are well justified. The food is epic (Green Eggs and OJ FTW) and service is the best you'll find in the US if Scott is looking after you. He could run the whole place on his own and make you feel like you were the only customer there.
