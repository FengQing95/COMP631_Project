The Pit Room////Loved this placed was lucky it was opened while I was in Houston. I was only in Houston for a few days. The days where Sunday and Monday when all of the highly rated restaurants where closed. That is ok because on Sunday i went to the Houston BBQ fest where all the highly rated restaurants where and their food didn't impress me. However, this place was opened on Monday night and even the police was there to eat so that tells you something. Got 1/2 lb of lean and 1/2 lb fatty brisket. It was very good just as good as the top rated places in Austin. I am glad I was able to go to this place on my last night in Houston. Authentic BBQ place.Oak wood out front and you can see the smokers and all the smoke Â billowing while making BBQ
