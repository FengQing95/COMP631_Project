Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////VERDICT: I don't know why there was such a long line that never did die down (when we left about 2 hours later, the line was still going strong) and why they ran out so quickly (marketing scheme??), but it's a must try place. Just be prepared for the crowds and needing to hunt for parking and a table. Prices aren't cheap but I can part with the money for a special occasion or for a needed treat. Ah~ buttery pastries. I'd love to visit again to try more of their stuff!
