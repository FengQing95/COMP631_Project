Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love carbs, but I try to avoid carbs as much as possible. However, with this place, I'll lose my intuition and would just eat the whole pastry if it's placed in front of me! Although the buttery sweet top Kouign Amann is the most popular in the bakery, my favorite is the almond croissant. It's light, fluffy, yet crispy with a sweet but not too sweet top. If you're more into savory food, then definitely get the chicken torta. It taste like pulled pork with a little kick of spice. The egg salad is okay, but I'm not a big fan of egg salads. Also, make sure to get a latte! Their latte is perfectly lightly sweetened and the latte art is on point! I'll definitely come back again to try the other things! Can't wait...
