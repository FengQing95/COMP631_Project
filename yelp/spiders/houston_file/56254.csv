Kata Robata////What really ruined the whole experience was the service. I have to mention it wasn't busy. Our server barely checked on us the whole dinner. It was impossible to find her because she was just standing far away from our table talking to her coworkers. I asked for straws which she never brought so I had to go to the bar to get them! Ridiculous, isn't it?
