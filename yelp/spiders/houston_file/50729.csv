Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Thirdly. Service. I literally watched a server come out of a stall in the bathroom, and left without washing his hands. It is like saying "Here, have some diphtheria" or "Please stab me in the eye when I am not looking". I don't want either but apparently might not have a choice.
