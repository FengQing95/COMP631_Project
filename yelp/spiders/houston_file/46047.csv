Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I ordered the hot Nashville chicken sandwich and got an americano. I sat on the patio with my pup. The sandwich was huge, juicy fresh fried chicken on the best buttery bun I've ever had. It was paired with bread and butter pickles and coleslaw. Seriously perfect. The americano was also great. Service was friendly and the bakery was drool worthy. Definitely stop by!
