Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Sadly, there was no brunch on the weekdays, but my friend and I decided to stay for lunch. While waiting, we started out with a Kouign Amman, a Flat White for me, and a hot chocolate for her. The pastry was delicious! Crispy on the outside with carmalized sugar and soft and custard-like on the inside. As for the drinks, my coffee was great in flavor and presentation and my friend said her hot chocolate was rich and creamy, almost like drinking liquid chocolate.
