Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Like public enemy raps, "911 is a joke." You thought I was gonna write "don't believe the hype." But you'd be wrong. Very, very wrong. Believe the hype. Like the Monkees sang, "and I saw that Kouign‑amann, now I'm a believer."  The pastries are first class as is their coffee. The entrees are quite delicious as well but go early if you want to have a variety of options as they sell out early and often.  I can't think of a more delicious way to spend breakfast, brunch or lunch in an immensely affordable casual dining place with near Michelin level quality food. The Chef trained at many of the best restaurants in the world and we are lucky that he has come back home to share his skills with us.
