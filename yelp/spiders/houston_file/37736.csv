Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This was the first time my husband and I visited. We were both completely impressed with the customer service, vibe and the food! We really were blown away thanks to Jose and the 3 other gentlemen that came around to check in on us. Jose really took the time to explain the restaurants story, the rare selection of Bosscat whiskey, which we tried and it was amazing! We even were given a tour of the whiskey room! We have a lot of experience with great restaurants having lived in San Francisco, Connecticut, New York and Seattle. We were just visiting today but will definitely be back and have already spread the word. Keep up the great work!
