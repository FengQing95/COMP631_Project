JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is a delicious spot for ramen. The spicy ramen is definitely spicy, so be careful of that! The ramen bowl is so flavorful and you really can't go wrong with what you order here. They have a good list of wines, beers, and sakes. Ramen hack, if you have lots of broth left over but need more noodles you can order extra for only $2.50 or so. Makes the rest of your bowl go farther! I also love the pork chashu bowl on the side. It could even be an entree in and of itself. The pork is salty, well marinated and so tasty. It's served over rice with green onion and a delicious soft boiled egg. This is our go to ramen spot and usually the wait time is a little shorter than they estimate. But do be warned that on the weekend nights the wait can get long--which is a good sign!
