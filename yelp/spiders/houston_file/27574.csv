The Pit Room////Visiting from California and could not leave Texas without getting some American BBQ! It was so good, I wish we had one back home. Definitely going to come back... my favorite was the corn and brisket; super sweet and juicy. The sauce was a bit salty and lemonade was super sour but I guess that must mean it's made out of real lemons? Anyways, satisfied my cravings before my flight home that's forsure (we even got some togo haha)
