The Pit Room////My husband absolutely loved this place. He said it was his most favorite barbecue ever and we have tried a lot of places. It loses one star because I didnt like anything I ordered. I tried his brisket and it was really good but I wasn't a fan of anything else. He LOVED everything though, so I dont really know what all of this means.
