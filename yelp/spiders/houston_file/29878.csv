The Pit Room////2 stars for the the barbecue sauce, it was good. Service was good. Food was trash. Ordered the beef rib and brisket... beef rib was a little salty. Brisket wasn't too bad. Ordered the beans and Mac and cheese. The beans were definitely not bbq beans, they were more like taqueria beans. Mac and cheese was plain. At least the lemonade tasted homemade but it was still on the sour side. I've had a lot better so this wasn't really worth my 60$.
