Kata Robata////Just came from kata and it was deleeeeecious! It was my 3rd time coming and the experiences get better each time. My bf and i shared the duck gyoza, oyster mushrooms, Kobe beef skewers, longhorn roll, salmon and soft shell crab roll, and kata ramen. My favorites were the Kobe beef skewers, oyster mushrooms, and the two rolls. I usually like my beef lean with no fat, but I'll make an exception for Kata's Kobe beef because it is just that good. It just melts in your mouth. At the end of the night, i had to resist the urge to order another plate. It gets pretty busy at night but the service here is quick and attentive. I can't wait to come back and get some more kobe beef and try something new!
