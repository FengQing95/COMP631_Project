Baby Barnaby's////Perfectly charming first impressions. We were there when the doors opened and within the first fifteen minutes, it was almost packed. Everybody was perky and cheerful which is great for us morning people. Fresh coffee awaited us  at the table, made especially for Baby Barnaby's. Trivial pursuit cards kept us entertained after the meal as I enjoyed another cup of the wonderful coffee. I couldn't have asked for a better breakfast. Everything tastes fresh. My boyfriend doesn't even like eggs that much  and he raved about the ones on his plate.  They had some healthy choices for breakfast too.
