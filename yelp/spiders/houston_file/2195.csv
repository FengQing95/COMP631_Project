JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I appreciate your remarks on the "unjustness" of competition within the restaurant industry. However, I'm not sure I fully understand how (or why) you're comparing two wholly different Asian cultures that have developed two vastly different versions of broth and noodles. To me, comparing Vietnamese pho and Japanese ramen is like comparing a burrito to a spring roll. I think the differences in pho and ramen speak for themselves.
