Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Just amazing all the way around. The service was amazing and the food was just right. Great great whiskey here for reasonable prices. We had the boss hog and it was so smooth! Then we asked the manager if they sold cigars, he said no but then a few minutes later came up and gave us some of his personal cigars that he had! This is quality in a business, this is what people should be following. Managers shouldn't sit back and watch they need to be like this one that interacts and makes sure his restaurant is running efficiently and effectively. My hat goes off to this place. Thank you for a great experience!
