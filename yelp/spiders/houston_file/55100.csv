Kata Robata////Great place to eat quality sashimi. Be prepared to spend some money though. Averaging about 6-8$ for 2 pieces of sashimi. Not steak cuts either. Great atmosphere, although it feels like it has not had its proper maintenance. The quality of the seafood has not let us down. You can tell how fresh the fish is by having some Toro, some Hamachi, as well as some Uni. All should not be too cold, near frozen temp, and all should not need a ton of soy sauce nor wasabi.
