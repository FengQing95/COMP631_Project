JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Awesome ramen!! I have been here many times and every time it is delicious. I subbed the ground chicken instead of the sliced chicken and the flavors were remarkable. Perfect blend of spicy and other asian flavors. The noodles tasted homemade, and were perfectly cooked. Only reason I did not give a 5 star rating is the ambiance. My personal opinion, I don't like the community table, I wish that they had more private dining tables. Went here on a date, and it was very awkward and kind of killed the mood. The service was a little slow too, but it was pretty packed. Definitely a fan, when I crave good ramen, this is my first choice.
