Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I am in love with this place! I had wonderful Spicy Mimosa and it was half price off because I work in the medical center. For my meal I had the Juan's Tacos, they were yummy as well. Also tried a cinnamon pecan pancake that was to die for. Parking is tough and the wait is extremely long, those are my only complaints! The prices are reasonable and the staff I have to say is wonderful!
