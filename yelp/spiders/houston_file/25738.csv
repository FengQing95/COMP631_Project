The Pit Room////Tried this place last night and we all enjoy the meat and the sides.  Wish we would have had more of the turkey, loved the pork ribs and the brisket.  Next time we will try the beef ribs and pulled pork.  The home made sides, brussel sprouts, potato salad, coleslaw were out standing.  Our new favorite barbecue place.
