Local Foods////One bite into my sandwich and this place already has me hooked (too bad I don't live here!!!) the felafel sandwich is incredible, mint-ade is delish (I added a little water to my glass and it was perfect) the staff is very friendly and the decor is the perfect blend of that rustic/urban/chic feel.
