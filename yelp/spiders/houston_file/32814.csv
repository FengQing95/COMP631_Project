Local Foods////We ordered the crispy chicken sandwich, lemongrass soup, kale and qunioa. Every single thing we ordered was 5 stars! The crispy chicken sandwich was not fried, it was crispy because of the yummy pretzel bun! I loved all the toppings on the sandwich, especially the pickles! The lemongrass soup had a yummy, creamy, coconut milk tasting broth that was fab! The sides were surprisingly just as good as the soup and sandwich! Who knew kale and qunioa could taste so good! We will definitely be back!
