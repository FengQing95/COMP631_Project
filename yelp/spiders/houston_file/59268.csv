Baby Barnaby's////I also tried the green eggs as I've heard it's one of their best dishes and I have to agree with everyone else, it was very good served with their home-fries.  I loved the way they seasoned the potatoes.   Our waitress was very nice and paid close attention to detail, refills, water, silverware, the whole nine yards :-)
