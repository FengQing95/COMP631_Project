Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. I apologize that we failed to impress you. That's terrible to hear. As one of the owners, I read our reviews daily. We're alway looking for opportunities to improve. You mentioned that our food wasn't good. May I ask for a little more detail? What did you have and what didn't you like about it? I honestly would like to know.
