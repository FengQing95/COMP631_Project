JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Would've given this place a 5 star at one point, but after being in Japan for 2.5 weeks I can't. However this one of the best if not the best Ramen place in Mid-Town. Been here serval times and customer service and food is always good. They can get real busy so I recommend calling to check on wait time.
