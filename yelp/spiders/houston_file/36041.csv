Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Food was good.  Atmosphere was good unless you needed a place to talk - it was quite loud, but luckily we were seated near the back and it was quieter.  The have a rotating draft beer menu on a chalkboard but the waitstaff could only name a few but pointed us to the chalkboard which was across the restaurant.
