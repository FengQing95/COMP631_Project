Baby Barnaby's////The breakfast potatoes are the bomb and the bacon is the real deal. I'm talking thick cut, manly bacon. Not for wimps! The biscuits are yummy and the coffee is pretty good. Not excellent, but it gets the job done. People who complain about the parking situation need to come to Boston and see what a real parking shortage looks like. I think we had to walk like half a block during prime breakfast hours, which was fine by me. I'm coming back to Houston in a few months and will most definitely be back.
