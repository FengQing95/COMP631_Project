Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Jose and Terry were amazing hosts and waiters that helped us out! Imagine you needed a great recommendation for a good entree, but didn't know which one to eat? Jose gave his utmost recommendation plus a couple jokes. It was a happy time with our waiter and who were always readily available to fill our mimomas glasses!
