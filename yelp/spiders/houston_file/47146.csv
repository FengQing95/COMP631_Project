Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze A.M. is the place for you if you're a fan of brunch and waiting for a long time! This business is smart enough to know that distractions keep people pleased and build up an appetite. Lucky for you, breakfast/brunch eater, this restaurant provides several outdoor game options you can occupy yourself with while waiting for seating. Before you get too excited about losing in a game of Connect Four, make sure to go inside and give them your name and phone number. They'll contact you when a table is ready. Prepare to do some more waiting after you are seated and have your order taken. You won't have games to distract you at this point, but at least you're seated! My advice is to get there really early (no later than 7:30 AM). The wait time to get seated was about 30 - 40 minutes when I went around 8:30 AM on a Saturday morning. I had better luck on my second visit when I got there at 7 AM on a freezing cold Saturday morning. Parking was easy, and I was immediately seated that second time.
