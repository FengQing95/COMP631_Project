Kata Robata////They have sushi and roll combo options on the lunch menu. I got the 3 sushi & roll, which came with two different rolls (8 pieces total) and then three sushi pieces. Lunch specials also came with soup or salad. One of my colleagues got the miso soup and said it was the best miso soup he's ever had!
