Uchi////All of the food was great. The atmosphere was good. A little cramped but it is a tiny space. The staff was extremely friendly and informative. They explained all the dishes when they served them. I only felt a little bit rushed while eating. I wanted to just enjoy being there a bit longer. Other than that, I will return and it was a good experience.
