Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Go to this place for drinks . Our waiter was really sweet and gave us some nice recommendations . I really liked their patio too . Food was good .. it's just that it's not our style ( fried n red Â meat ) we ordered the steak n it was really good .meat was cooked to perfection . We will def go back for the service and the drinks .
