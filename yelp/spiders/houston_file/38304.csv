Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The only thing i like from here is their salad. Its definitely one of those places that you only go for the happy hour. They have very limited items on the menu. The burgers are terrible. Â Its definitely over huped. They even told us when we should leave as they have other people coming in right when we walked in. Bad service.
