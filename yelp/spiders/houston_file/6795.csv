JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Nicole - Thank you very much for your review. On behalf of our entire staff, I'd like to thank you for your patronage and your kind words. We do regret that our company's operating standards require us to keep our house lights fairly dim. We wish we could be all things to all people, but it's just not possible; nevertheless, we appreciate your understanding.
