Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We had the pancake flight (highly recommend), the batman returns pancake, and the super spuds deluxe with bacon and caramelized onions. Everything was so delicious!! I usually don't like fruit pancakes because they either taste too sweet, don't work well together, or just taste artificial. Dear lord, this place knows what they are doing. The pancakes are just so fluffy and everything they put in the pancakes is the perfect flavor combination. My personal favorite is the pineapple one. I could eat so many of those. If you're feeling adventurous try the batman returns. It has a really interesting twist to a regular blueberry pancake. The hash was also so good. It had the perfect amount of cheese, scallions, and seasoning.
