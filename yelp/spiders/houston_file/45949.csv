Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond has evolved into a full on restaurant.  It is still a great bakery and now you can get complete meals. Really good ham n cheese on baguette, onion soup, quiche, shrimp n grits, coffee and cookie.  2:30p lunch on rainy Sunday and not too crowded.
