Uchi////Yes, I'm obsessed with Uchi. Every time my friend were in town, I took them here. This restaurant will be forever on my must-go list, and its spot will be forever number one. So I have to be 'picky' with it somehow. The reason I did not give 5 stars because last time, their sushi were not as fresh as they could be. And today, the Uchi salad sauce was not wow me like it used to be. Something was missing from that edamame-jalapeno sauce, it did not have the WOW after taste anymore. If Uchi chefs are reading this, please do something about it for God's sake because it is my favorite.
