Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The parking situation was a little crazy but I managed to find a spot across the street and walk over. I love the retro feel and decor of the restaurant.There was about a 15-minute wait and coffee was available at the front while you wait. I was eating alone so I decided to sit at the bar. The waitress was very nice,  she called me by my first name during the whole visit!  I ordered the pineapple upside-down pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were amazing especially when I added maple syrup! The bacon was a little too hard for my sensitive teeth but I will definitely be returning!!
