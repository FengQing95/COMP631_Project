Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I love this place. The environment is the best place for Sunday Funday Brunch in Houston in my opinion. The music is incredible, loud, nostalgic early 2000's hits mainly hip hop (which I love) the service is very good especially for how crowded it is - also the servers are great at their job and are genuinely sweet every single time!
