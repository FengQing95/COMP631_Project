JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For starters they don't have the crispy kale lollipops. Not sure why it's still on the menu but apparently they don't serve it anymore. So we opted for the brussels sprouts tempura. It's not worth it. There's too much tempura so it takes away a lot of the flavor from the Brussels sprouts which you can barely taste anyways because it's bland.
