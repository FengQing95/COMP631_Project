The Pit Room////I came on a Saturday right when they opened and managed to get a parking spot and not have to wait in line forever (maybe a 10 minute wait).  I got the 3 meat dinner (brisket, pork ribs, and pulled pork) with elote and coleslaw.  I thought the food was good standard BBQ, but I didn't think it was as amazing as everyone hyped it up to be.
