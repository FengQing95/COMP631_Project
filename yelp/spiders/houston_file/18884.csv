Uchi////My second experience (yesterday) featured Chef Paul Qui from Austin, making the venture to good ole' Houston to cook some of the dishes that were featured on Top Chef. In all honestly, all the dishes were amazing in presentation, but necessarily in taste. True to Uchi form, each dish played off of a myriad of flavors and textures, but in two out of the three dishes the overall flavors were so subtle that the presentation was all I really enjoyed. However, the Uni Crab kicked ASS!!!
