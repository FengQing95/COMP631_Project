Baby Barnaby's////The staff is very friendly and accommodating and the food doesn't take long to come out. I've only ever gone for breakfast - but here are my recommendations: fresh squeezed orange juice (really, they squeeze it there!), banana walnut pancake, the migas, anything with chicken apple sausage, and last but not least...the green eggs!
