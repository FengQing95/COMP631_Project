Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I lived near a Snooze in Denver ( Southglenn) and it was my go to place for breakfast. I could not believe they were in Houston and even better the food and people are great!!!  Being a creature of habit, I can only say the omelets are delicious.  Ht looking at others foods passing by I'm always tempted!
