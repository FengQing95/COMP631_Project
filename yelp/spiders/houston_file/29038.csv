The Pit Room////The food here is hardly Texas BBQ. Especially if you are comparing it to Black's in Lockhart or Austin. Their brisket is loaded with fat, and I even asked for "extra lean". Their beef sausage was cold and greasy, and I couldn't even eat a full bite. If you want real good beef sausage in Houston, Luling City Market on Richmond at 610 has great beef sausage. This place is expensive, and the food is not worth what they are changing for it.
