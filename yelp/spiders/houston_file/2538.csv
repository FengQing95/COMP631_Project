JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Came tonight for the second time and I think it was even better than the first. Everything is fantastic, the tempura fried Brussels sprouts in truffle oil were literally the best Brussels have ever had. The ramen was even better.....everything was super affordable! Our waitress was pleasant and genuinely hospitable! Best ramen place in Houston, definitely recommend.
