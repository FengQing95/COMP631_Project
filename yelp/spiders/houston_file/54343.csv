Kata Robata////The place is expensive though and even during happy hour, I'd walk out 40 dollars poorer. The happy hour menu is limited to mostly appetizers, rolls, and meat skewers, and my sushi snobbiness craves traditional nigiri and sashimi which quickly escalates the price. Even though their rolls are fresh, I just don't find them as flavourful.
