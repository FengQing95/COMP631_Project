Uchi////- Second...the food. I tried the wagyu beef which was extremely greasy and it had no seasoning at all. It was very disappointing; simply marinating this meat could do so much. I got the biendo tempura shrimp spring roll, which was good, but it had barely any shrimp in it. I tasted more vegetables than anything. Â We also got the shag roll and it was very good. I struggled to like the hamachi nabe it was extremely slimy with the egg all over it, but the flavor profile was ok. The grilled shishito peppers were bland, but with the sauce they were amazing. The portions were EXTREMELY SMALL so unless you want to end up with a $200+ bill, be prepared to leave hungry.
