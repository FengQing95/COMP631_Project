Kata Robata////The ramen came out last and the broth is sweet and flavorful. It's a generous portion and I couldn't finish all of it. The noodles were fresh and soft. It's not the best ramen I've had, I tried another ramen place in Irvine that was really good, but it's definitely the best in Houston. Plus, who can beat $9 for good quality ramen?
