JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Staff was friendly and efficient, hence service was up to standards.  I will be visiting Jinya soon, probably some time this week.  We did have issues finding parking.  There was none available on the street, so we went to this lot around the corner.  I believe it was valet only but I could be wrong.
