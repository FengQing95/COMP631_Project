Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Wife brought me here for my birthday.  Went in a group of 9.  Started with drinks at the bar and had some masterfully crafted bourbon cocktails made by bartenders with real skill!  After a drink we were seated and ordered 3 different appetizers for the table.  All were very good with the frog legs being the best.  Service was mediocre (thus the reason or -1 star, I realize groups are difficult or i would have taken away 2 or 3 stars).  I was not offered another drink to replace the one I got from the bar until dessert came an hour plus later, not a good revenue generator for a business... Everyone enjoyed their food and I would probably go back to give the service a second chance.  The floors are concrete and the ceiling is industrial (exposed beams) so the atmosphere is noisy on a busy night.
