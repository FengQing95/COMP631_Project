Uchi////Came here during their soft opening when all the dishes were half off.  Because I'm a sucker for sales, we went nuts and ordered 29 dishes: everything from the cool menu, a few from the hot, all the rolls, the special, and 2 desserts.  The dishes are all very creative and come on small plates--think of a cleverly devised tasting menu where you can have a little of everything.  I love to dine this way so I don't get bored with my dish but instead can taste everything (and that we did).  Out of everything I tried, my favorites were the sake nigiri and the special they had for the night which, I believe, was a Wagyu beef shortrib with strawberries.  But most everything (except for the shag roll) was delicious.  I am not a fan, however, of the quinoa-turned-rice--the texture is just not right.  Felt like I was eating larvae.  The service was attentive and excellent--servers explain what each dish is before you eat it.  Food is excellent--fresh and innovative.  Some of their fish is flown in from Japan daily.  Ambience is typical of those up and coming restaurant trends: buzzing noise level, wooden furniture mixed with exposed piping for an industrial bent.  If Barley Swine were a sushi restaurant, it would be Uchi.  Sadly, I'm not sure if I would come back any time soon and pay full price; once you've had it half off, why pay full price?  That's why we gorged like the fat ass Americans we are...just so we can be sick of it and not want to come back for a year.  But if you haven't tried it, it's a good new place to try.  Just be prepared to leave hungry and/or with a much lighter wallet.  Kudos, though, to Houston for getting better and better at the food scene.
