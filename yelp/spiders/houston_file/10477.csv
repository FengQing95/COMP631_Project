JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I guess there's not a whole lot to add here. The thick noodles here are definitely better, and I thought the tonkotsu was pretty delish. A lot of people rave about the chicken broth, but I haven't had a chance to try it yet. If you come during happy hour, the jinya bun is only $3. Service is quite average, and it depends on you server. Sometimes it's really attentive and sometimes it's lacking. I'd call in during peak hours because there's sometimes a pretty long line. Parking can also be hard to find, but not impossible. Pretty great ramen here, but I'll rotate between here, ramen tatsuya, and tiger den.
