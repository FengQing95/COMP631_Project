Local Foods////My first take was that Local Foods is very much a deconstructed Ruggles Green. The food screams overpriced (roughly $10 for a sandwich and two sides) yet fitting with the "conscious eater" concept (healthy, local, organic, et cetera and so forth). Unlike Ruggles, which has a positively overwhelming menu, Local Foods sticks to a very business-like soup, salad, sandwich menu. The space is much more wide open and industrial-like when compared to the crowded, earthy tones of Ruggles Green.
