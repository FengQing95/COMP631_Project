Uchi////-I think I can find very high quality fish (maybe not exactly Uchi-level, but still fresh and delicious) at a lower price point. Perhaps it's because I ordered a bunch of nigiri from the daily specials section, which ranged from $7 to $12 for a single piece of nigiri. The regular section was closer to $4 per piece, which is more reasonable.
