Uchi////They had a couple really unique items that make me want to go back - their edamame is grilled, not just steamed, and that makes it super delicious. I have been raving about it to everyone who will listen, and I don't ever want to eat steamed edamame again. It's not even an option to me. Their brussels sprouts, which I generally would not even approach, are glazed with a delicious sweet sauce that actually makes them not just edible, but very good. I'd order these on purpose. And their "PB&J" dessert, the name of which I forget, is amazingly good. And if you close your eyes, man, you can't tell the difference between that and a sandwich. A bit out of place at a Japanese restaurant? Maybe. But it's fun and tasty. And one of their special entrees, featuring foie gras, had delicious citrus jam and olive oil drizzled over top of it, making for a unique and delicious combination. The citrus particularly paired really well with the super rich foie gras. I would have eaten a lot of this.
