Baby Barnaby's////Nothing short of AMAZING!!!!!! The breakfast is consistently spot on! The protein packed breakfast burrito is Delish and HUGE...next time hubby and I will split. Gets rather crowded and sometimes a long wait, but they have coffee and water to entertain your thirst....definitely worth it though!
