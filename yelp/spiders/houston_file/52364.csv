Kata Robata////Mediocrity personified. This joint is not for anyone who appreciates Japanese cuisine. I stopped by Kata while killing time one afternoon just to look over the menu. I was very impressed with the selection of "freshly flown in "Japanese fish on the menu, and decided to go there for dinner a few weeks later when I returned to Houston. The server was very friendly but was unaware of the fish included in the daily selection of the "Omikase Sashimi" or "Chirashi". She went on to say that the chef was an "award-winning" sushi chef, and that I should expect only the best. (NOT). They were out of 3 of the 4 "Japanese fresh fish" on the menu! The "sashimi "I ordered by the piece was equal to the typical defrosted fish we get in any run-of-the-mill Japanese joint. The pieces of "sushi "I ordered were so poorly constructed, that the seaweed was falling off the sides, and the fish was falling off the rice! (Obviously not prepared by the "award winning Japanese sushi chef". Calamari appetizer was coated in an extremely thick batter...inedible. Very disappointing. I've had better sashimi/sushi in Korean owned /staffed restaurants! If you appreciate the subtleties and beautifully presented plates we all associate with "real "Japanese food ( ie---nothing related to Philadelphia , Dynamite, or Rainbow Rolls) take a pass on this place .
