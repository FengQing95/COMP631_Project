Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The almond croissant is my absolute favorite out of the their pastries, and I always get one every time I come. They're constantly changing their menu items, but I've also had a chocolate boston cream brioche that was delicious. Honestly, everything we've gotten Â whether it's their lemon cake or macarons are delicious. I wish there was more variety especially with the macarons.
