Kata Robata////*Pros: The food is too much good. I got here for lunch and tried with lunch special menu. I was served the sashimi combo and lobster salad. The salad can't beat anywhere, sure! I don't know how to describe that great feeling of having the best ever tasty salad like this. Just so good and memorable meal. The cut of sashimi and lobster were fresh and big to satisfy my craving. Highly recommended !
