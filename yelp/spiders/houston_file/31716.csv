Local Foods////Don't think it lives up to the hype. I love the organic selection, but I think the sides are actually better than the actual main dishes. I've had a couple of sandwiches and I just thought they were a bit bland. The portions however are huge and they come with two sides (which I've found to be the best parts of both meals I've had there).
