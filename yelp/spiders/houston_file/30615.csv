The Pit Room////My first "issue" was I asked for the beef ribs and if they were still available. The lady on the phone said yes which I was happy for because I hadn't seen alot of beef ribs back in CA. HOWEVER when I got back to my place I had the pork ribs but I sorta shrugged it off and opened the rest of my food...I got the 2 meat dinner plate with Brisket and the Venison Sausage (Mac&Cheese and Potato Salad for sides).
