JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Service was very friendly. We had a nice waiter, whom we actually confused with all the others...I mean, they were all wearing plaid shirts, and all the male waiters were Asian...why do they all have to wear plaid?! Lol. Anyway, the service was great from all the waiters who helped us out!
