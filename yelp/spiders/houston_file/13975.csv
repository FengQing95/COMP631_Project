JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I took the opportunity to discuss your review with our bar staff, and I understand that they did not attend to you in the correct manner. The issue at hand -- and this is something we are actively working to correct -- is how our staff balances handling large influx of to-go orders while also providing service to patrons seated at the bar. I am pleased to hear you enjoyed our food, and I hope this experience will not preclude future visits. If you do come through again, please ask for any of our managers on duty, or text/call our managing partner Keith (I will DM his phone number to you now), and they will make sure your experience is vastly superior to this one.
