Uchi////Ham & Eggs Makimoto-  Everybody tells me to try this roll and this roll tastes like spam and rice to me (similarly).  It was good but it was not particularly my type of roll.  This is because I do not particularly like cooked rolls and lean more towards raw fish.  My friends LOVE this roll though.
