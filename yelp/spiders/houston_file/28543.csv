The Pit Room////The beef rib is really good - juicy with good flavor. On the other side, the side is ridiculously PRICEY. A piece of finger long corn cost $3.25 same price as other side (small as well). I didn't notice it until I got home - this is just crazy... I will come back for the beef rib, but I would never order the side again!
