Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I really enjoy Common Bond. I have only had food one time and all of the other visits I've just had a baked good and/or coffee. My favorite items are the cookies. Their chocolate chip cookies are some of the best I've had. They easily rival (and remind me of) NYC's popular/famous Levain Bakery's cookies. They're perfectly crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. Very rich! Their oatmeal cream pies are amazing as well. Super sweet and pretty big - so perfect to share or take home for later. Only downsides are - it can get pretty packed and line can get long (but they're very efficient and keep the line moving). Parking- they have a small private lot, but when it's full it can sometimes be hard to find a spot in the neighborhood.
