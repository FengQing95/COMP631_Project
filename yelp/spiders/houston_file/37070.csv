Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great atmosphere, great drinks! Best indoor/outdoor, open air seating. Our server, James, was awesome, and even checked with the kitchen on certain ingredients in one of the dishes. I have food intolerances and am always so impressed with servers who are willing to take the time and check to see it foods are safe for me to eat. The wine selection was great and I had such a delicious burger! Looking forward to coming back and trying out the rest of the menu.
