Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I want to write like an entire review just about our waitress Kandra ("Like Sandra but with a K"). Â She brought her entire, authentic self to work today and had an incredible, hilarious personality. She was working her tail off and cracking jokes. We ended up taking pictures with her and that's not like a thing that we do. She sang happy birthday to my friend, cracked jokes about us in that we-just-met-but-we-might-be-best-friends kind of way, and made great recommendations about tweaks to our order (e.g., "I would add peppers" or "ya'll need to try this flavor of pancake."). She was spot on with her recommendations.
