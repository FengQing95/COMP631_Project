The Pit Room////I walked back to the cashier and ask if I may please have a regular cup so I dont have to make 20 trips to refill my water.  The cashier smiled and was reaching for a cup, at that time an older Hispanic female grabbed the cup from her hand and told me..."I have to charge you for the cup". I was like what?? I just paid $40.00 for one rib and two small sides and you want to nickle and dime me for a Styrofoam cup?? Now this was not some fancy cup, no printed logo just a plain jane Styrofoam cup that they had a huge stack of!  I didn't have cash on me just my debit card, I declined and just could not believe they wanted to charge for that, its not like they have rock bottom BBQ prices, in fact its quite expensive for what you get, defiantly has gone up in price since my last visit
