Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Avocado Benedict (Benny) was extremely good.  It's apparently seasonal and it's November right now!  We got three flights of pancake including pineapple, chocolate chip, and cinnamon roll.  I liked the chocolate chip pancake the most and then then the pineapple.  By the way, the cinnamon roll pancake is not on the menu so you have to special request it.  Wait was not bad.  15 minutes at 9 am on a Sunday (thanksgiving weekend).  Definitely will be back.  Parking is challenging since they have a small lot so you have to parallel park down the street.
