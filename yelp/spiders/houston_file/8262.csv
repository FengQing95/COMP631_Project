JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Came here from a recommendation of a good friend. Came here around 5ish. The atmosphere is a little dark but I like the mellow feeling with good company. Our waiter was nice and attentive but I wish I knew is name.. ( he wear glasses). I ordered the cha cha ramen. My gawd..... I loved it!!! Good flavor of broth! I wish the ramen had more meat but that's not a big deal. Will be back here again when I visit houston!
