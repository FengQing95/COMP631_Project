Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Bread actually has a real crunch. Being originally from NYC, I know bread...and it should have a crunch.  This place does it right! The only negative is they don't have Italian bread.  The closest thing is they have French bread.  Make Italian bread and I will be there every Sunday to grab a fresh loaf and have Italian Sunday dinner at home.
