Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////A friend and I had brunch and I was pleased with my choices. Since it was my first time visiting, I asked my waiter, Jeffrey (forgive me if I didn't spell your name right) suggested a drink called, "The Good Life". I like sweet drinks and this was PERFECT for me. When my friend joined me, we ordered our meals (Shrimp and grits, and Avocado toast) and it was DELICIOUS! The presentation was appetizing as well.
