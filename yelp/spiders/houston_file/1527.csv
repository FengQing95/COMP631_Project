JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I tried the Tonkotsu Black and it was pretty rich and hearty (which I like), but it was a bit on the bland side! It needed salt. I don't like having to season my own food. But everything else was great. You can order fresh garlic to crush yourself for free. The garlic was a little dry so either it was old or it was peeled a while ago and just left sitting there.
