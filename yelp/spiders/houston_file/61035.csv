Baby Barnaby's////I started out with the organic coffee. It was good, but a side of liquid creamer would have been a very nice touch. When looking at the pictures on Yelp, I noticed green eggs were on 80% of the pictures. So I had to try it. I got the steak and eggs and subbed the eggs for green eggs. It didn't disappoint. Scrambled eggs with spinach and artichoke is a match made in heaven. The steak was decent. I wasn't expecting a Ruth Chris steak for $10. But it was good. The breakfast potatoes were good too.
