The Pit Room////Pretty good bbq. We got the extra moist brisket and the giant 1lb rib. The sides were pretty good but not really my style. The beans weren't sweet and I like the sweet ones w my bbq. The slaw was also very tart and not sweet which also isn't my style. The sauce was a bit too vinegary for my taste as well. Can you tell I like sweet bbq? It kinda reminded me of some kind of non-Texas bbq which I guess for some people that's good. I mean it was tasty but just not my fav kind of bbq. If you're into the Tennessee or South Carolina bbq maybe you'd like it more. The meat was really well cooked and tender tho which was very pleasant. The mouse brisket was suuuuuper fatty which was really tasty but I wish I had brought my own sauce haha!
