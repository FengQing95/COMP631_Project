Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The wait also for this location is among the longest in Houston. Most places will tell you 45 minutes to 1 hour wait and you'll be sat in 20-30 minutes. That's not the case here. 1 hr wait means you'll get called in 1 hr-1hr 15 minutes, then when you arrive (even if you're already there) you'll have to wait 15 minutes for them to clean a table. It's a good idea to check in, then stop by a bar or something in the area for drinks until they call you.
