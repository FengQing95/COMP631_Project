Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I absolutely adore this place! A perfect little place for to go sweets & coffee or dine in lunch. They're menu isn't one with endless choices, but what they do have is delightful. The three bean salad is a must! The staff is kind and the vibe of the place itself is nice. They typically have a long line, and i do wish the establishment itself was larger in size.
