Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The line is long so if you don't have time I'd skip but if you have ~30 minutes to wait in line it's a treat! They have super flavorful pastries so some of the items may be overwhelming. Another downer is the price... It can get expensive. But if you like to treat yo'self, it's flavor explosion.
