Uchi////Save room for dessert - our "lime ash sorbet" thing was pretty tasty and weird - it was, in fact, limey-sorbet...but also a key lime panna cotta with some spicy meringue and chocolatey crumbs....I can honestly say that I haven't had such an Â exciting dessert since I was slumming it at Alinea, and Grant really went wild with a chocolate course. I digress.
