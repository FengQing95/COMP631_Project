Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Decided to have a brunch date at common bond this past Saturday as I've been to here in the past for pastries or to get something to satisfy my sweet tooth and had been impressed. However, for brunch the food was bland and the mimosas are over-priced for small amount they give. I ordered a chicken and biscuits and my boyfriend ordered I believe the crawfish Benedict. I'll just stick to baked goods there.
