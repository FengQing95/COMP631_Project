Uchi////By far the best sushi ever tasted. Besides great fresh food, the vibe at the restaurant is very inviting but also very hip and cool. The staff from greeters to wait staff to valet parking staff are very welcoming. You should call for a reservation, as this place is very busy. We went when you could order mini plates of different foods which was fantastic. If you are in Houston, Texas definitely delight your palate by eating at Uchi.
