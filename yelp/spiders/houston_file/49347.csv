Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the quinoa breakfast bowl. It came with roasted vegetables, wild mushrooms, baby kale, and goat cheese. I got it with the egg cooked sunny side up so I could burst the yolk and have it ooze over the quinoa. I finished it all. It was a great, light, protein-rich breakfast. My friend got the omelet with hash browns and toast. She couldn't finish the whole thing, but did enjoy it.
