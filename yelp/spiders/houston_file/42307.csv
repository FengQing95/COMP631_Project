Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////You basically stand in line and choose what pastries you want which are nicely displayed along the counter in front of you. I had to refrain from ordering the enter menu and decided on the almond and chocolate croissants to share, monte cristo sandwich for myself, and the veal sandwich for the bf. You're supposed to pay for your meal and then find a table but most people just grab a table first because they're hard to come by. I don't think there are enough tables to accommodate how many patrons come through this place however the staff is very helpful in finding you a table. We sat down and a waiter brings you your order. I shouldn't actually use the word waiter because you have to get your own utensils, water, and any refills.
