Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So I had the plain croissant, a mocha latte and the chorizo torta. ..all were amzing. The croissant was huge and flaky and melt in your mouth delious. The torta was huge as well...but when I tell you this breakfast sandwich was off the top boy it was goooid! Soft crunch roll chorizo and egg mixture was on point the guacamole and the jalapeño was icing on the cake...definitely deserves 10 stars. The atmosphere was very clean and peaceful.  I loved it
