Uchi////The selection is amazing. However, if you love nigiri sushi that emphasizes the flavour of the fish and coordinates all other flavours to it, then you will be severely disappointed. Repeatedly I have had wonderful sushi served with sauces and other additions that completely masked with the flavour of the fish. Tragic given the amazing fish they serve direct from Japan.
