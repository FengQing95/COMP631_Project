Kata Robata////I'm not sure if my gf and I went there on an off-night, but we were as disappointed as can be. Overpriced menu that tries to be Uchi half the time. If you think you're being adventurous by eating Americanized sushi rolls and other fusion dishes, you'll probably enjoy this place. If you want fresh-tasting sushi or sashimi that melts in your mouth, go elsewhere.
