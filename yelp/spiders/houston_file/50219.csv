Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Came here for lunch one day with a couple of friends and braved the 45 minute wait since I was craving some good pancakes (hoping it was just as good as the one in Denver). Service was a bit slow but the pancakes were to die for. They did comp the pancakes for us since we had a long wait for our food. Definitely will be coming back.
