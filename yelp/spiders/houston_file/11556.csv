JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The vegetable ramen was too bland for me. It had so much potential too but it was tasteless. The only components were raw vegetables that had no flavor. I had to order tofu on the side for some protein but that was also subpar. Since I am a vegetarian, I probably wouldn't go back for this ramen because of the lack of flavor. I did like the ambiance of the restaurant though.
