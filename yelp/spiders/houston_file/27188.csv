The Pit Room////This is one of my favorite places in the city - even the TURKEY is good! Since when does turkey have any flavor??? The fact that order and eat Turkey at this place outside of Thanksgiving season is an indication of how amazing it is. The people behind the counter are always friendly, generous and helpful. The place is always packed but what's amazing is that you can take your food to the bar next door where there's usually plenty of patio seating and get a drink to go along with it.
