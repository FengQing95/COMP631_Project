Baby Barnaby's////The only downsides to this restaurant is the location and the fact that there's not much parking, the line can be quite long at times depending upon the day and time. Its a fairly little place so if you get some loud annoying people in there then you'll hear them across the room. We ended up going when it was raining so the line wasn't long and thankfully the typical loud person that likes to make sure everyone can hear them came in just at the tail end of our breakfast.
