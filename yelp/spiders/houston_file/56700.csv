Kata Robata////-the third dish (uni chawanmushi) seemed cool but may have been my least favorite. The ingredients didn't seem to pair as well but it was aesthetically pleasing with the crafted bowl and matching plate. Worth a try if you've never had egg custard in it's savory form but it's not their best plate.
