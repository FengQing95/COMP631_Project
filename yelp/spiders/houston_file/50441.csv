Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I got the Chili Verde Benedict with barbacoa which was TO DIE FOR. The eggs were perfectly poached, I asked for the hash browns extra crispy and THEY DELIVERED, and the barbacoa is just perfectly tender and juicy. It was so good, I had to take one to go for my boyfriend to try--he was not disappointed either :)
