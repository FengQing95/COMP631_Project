Baby Barnaby's////I went there because of all the great reviews online. I had the green eggs everyone keeps posting about. ....and it was just perfect. I want to try everything on the menu. And the fact that they serve organic coffee, I'm in love. I am so happy I went there today. And I just love how their employees aren't forced to cover their body art. I greatly appreciate this place and will go back numerous times.
