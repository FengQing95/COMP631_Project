Baby Barnaby's////So you walk up to this wooden colorful shack and it immediately reminds you of all the dives in Austin, or at least it did to me. You go inside and write your name and how many people are in your party, then you go sit outside on the wonderful patio for your name to be called. If there are free tables you just go and sit at one when you walk in. The atmosphere is quaint but a little dingy.
