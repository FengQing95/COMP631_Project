JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Really good food, nice atmosphere, pleasant staff. I got the Ramen Wonton Bowl which was fantastic and did fill me up and I drink water before my meal a lot so that makes me feel full faster. I highly recommend checking out this place with friends and family. Nice Bar in the front and in the back. They only provide chopsticks and soup ladles as silverware. I brought my own metal chopsticks which made it a little bit harder to eat and eventually used the ladle. The staff was nice and patient with my friends and I. We did have to wait for our full party to be there in order to get seated but they also had to make sure there was seats for us since we became a group of 5. Please go here, great Ramen bar and all my friends got something different and each one enjoyed their meal by either taking it home or finishing it. The prices are reasonable my dish was $10.50. So a tip: have your full party ready, bring a fork if you don't like using spoons or chopsticks, it can seem crowded but it isn't, you do have an option not to get a ramen dish, and arrive early, it gets crowded.
