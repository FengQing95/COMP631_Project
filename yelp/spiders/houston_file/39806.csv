Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I decided to come here for brunch with my friends; I enjoyed the ambiance of this place, great music great vibes! Ava was our server was great she was very attentive, Gavin the manager is awesome he checked up on us and ensured we were enjoying our meal. The food was great! I would definitely come back here and I recommend it to anyone that's visiting Houston, can't wait to try the Newport Beach location.
