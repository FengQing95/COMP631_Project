Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is amazing. I was ecstatic after moving from Austin this summer to find that Snooze was also in Houston! Great customer service, outstanding food and free coffee to drink while waiting in line. The only thing that sucks about this place is the parking! But if you live nearby, walking would be my recommendation.
