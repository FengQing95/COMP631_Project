JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It was my first time going to Jinya and my friends and I loved it! As soon as we walked in we were greeted and were given a table right away! Our server was named April and she was amazing! She took our drinks and brought them back fast, and then took our order and was off to the kitchen! It seemed like it was only about 2 minutes after she left when she came back and asked if we needed anything; she was very kind and seemed to love her job! When our food came out it smelt so good and it tasted even better!! I loved the #1 and when I finished I wished I had more, although I was stuffed!! I suggest everyone go because it had great service and great food! It was amazing and I will surely go back!! 6 out of 5 stars!!
