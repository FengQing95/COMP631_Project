Uchi////Our sushi chef prepared our rolls and when I asked for some wasabi to go along with them, he recommended not using any with my rolls. Ok, no problem, I trust him so I give it a try. The rolls were nothing special, relatively bland and just sort of "meh" (would've been better with some wasabi). I can say that I enjoyed the duck liver, but probably won't be back just for that. We had the fried milk for dessert which was pretty good, it was very similar to gelato base or sweet milk with a crispy / lightly fried coating.
