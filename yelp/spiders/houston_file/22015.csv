Uchi////Great place for a date night or with the family. This was our second visit and we had the opportunity to sit at the sushi bar. These guys are professionals and the food is some of the best in the city. The onion rings, vegetarian rolls and hard core sushi rolls are all great. Treat yourself and check out Uchi.
