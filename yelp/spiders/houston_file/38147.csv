Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////They put a lot of care and effort into each cocktail, which is both a good and bad thing in my mind. The good is that you receive a product that is well made, cared for, and does justice to the whiskey or spirit that you ordered. The bad is that it sometimes takes forever to get your drink (especially in a large group), and you pay for it. The drinks are on the higher side of what I would expect here, and 2 cocktails will set you back about $35 (without tax and tip).
