Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place has atmosphere in spades!  Hip vibe, cool interior, and stays open late.  The cocktail menu was diverse, so everyone at the table could find something they liked.  I had two whiskey drinks (the orange blossom and old fashioned) and both were delicious.  The menu catches your attention, and we immediately found several options we wanted to try.  The staff was helpful, courteous, and attentive to our pace for the evening.  The food came out in a timely fashion and looked great!
