Kata Robata////Our waitress finally made her first appearance after about 15 mins. We were starting to wonder if we even had one. I informed her that we were in a bit of a rush and that we would order drinks but were also ready to order food. I ordered the Spicy Ramen soup and a side salad. When she asked me what dressing I wanted and listed them out, I asked "which one is the best?" She acted as if I had just asked what size bra she wears. She acted very irritated and said "all of them." I was a little confused and said "well which one do people like?" (She must have heard "what size panties?"). She scowled and looked extremely irritated. She abruptly responded, "the creamy one." When she was finished taking our order, we all joked about how it seemed she did not like me and that our food would take forever to come out now. Well, that joke wasn't far from reality.
