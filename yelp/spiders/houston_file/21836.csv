Uchi////Delicious and creative Japanese dishes. Probably best for groups of 3-8 so you can order lots of dishes and try a little bit of everything. The staff is super professional and knowledgeable. They're happy to continue bringing out courses so make sure you let them know when you're full. Pretty easy to end up with an expensive tab but that's to be expected.
