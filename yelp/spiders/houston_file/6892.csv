JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The seating is "family" style you will be seated with complete strangers.  Which I don't mind, but the seats are hard blocks of wood.  We asked to be moved to a padded seat when it came open, not any better.  The booth was so far away from the table I had to perch on the edge of the seat like a gargoyle on the side of a building, just to reach the table.  You need arms about 4 feet long to eat at a booth.
