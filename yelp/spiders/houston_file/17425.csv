Uchi////Had reservations and seated promptly. Yeah!  Very exceited about eating here after hearing such rave reviews.  Unfortunately, other than being seated promptly and our server, Edgar, there is little that we liked.  Dishes were mediocre, small, and overpriced.  After spending $245.00 don't expect to come home and make a chicken sandwich!  Setting was OK, but nothing over the top.  The valet brought our car around to us only to find my carpet filthy dirty with mud! :(
