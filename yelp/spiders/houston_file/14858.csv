JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Barbara - Thank you so much for the great review. I'm happy to hear you gave us a try and happier that you liked it! When we decided to open shop in Houston almost two years ago, we weren't sure how the locals would take to high-end Japanese ramen. But with feedback like yours, I'm beyond happy to know we have been embraced by my hometown. Thank you again, and we hope to serve you again soon!
