Local Foods////Found it through Yelp along with another guy in line in front of us. I think fancier Benjy's (right next door) is owned by same person. Food was fresh and very good. Crunchy chicken sandwich is popular. It is crunchy because it has their homemade chips (yummy- we ordered extra) on it. Good slaw and vegan chili. Huge salads. Homemade desserts. Don't arrive at normal busy times.
