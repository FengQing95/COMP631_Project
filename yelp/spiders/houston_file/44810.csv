Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Seriously, fives all around. Even with the worst parking spaces and located in the most inconvienent area, there is nothing that could deter me from rating it for it's actual potential. Common Bond is amazing and their pastries totally live up to the hype. The ambience is lovely, filled with entirely good vibes and starving bellies. Though it is a bit of a wait to get through the door, every minute becomes worthwhile. The lattes are steamed to perfection and topped with beautiful, frothy, foam in the form of art; macaroons that are rich and decadent... ugh, I could go on forever. Did I mention biscuits and gravy for brunch? Talk about COMFORT FOOD. Everything hit the spot here. Bring your polaroid cameras, and iPhones little hipsters. Your instagram awaits the perfection that is Common Bond!
