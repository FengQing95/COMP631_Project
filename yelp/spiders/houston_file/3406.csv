JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The spicy chicken ramen is delicious. We had a 20 minute wait time because of our party size. If you have a smaller party that can accommodate quicker than larger ones. Is the price worth it? Ehh. It might be worth it to try once but I wouldn't pay $11.50 plus tax & tip to eat here again. The service was okay. Don't expect spectacular service on a busy thursday night.
