The Pit Room////We had the brisket dinner and chicken dinner options, with an added pulled pork taco. Both dinners came with two sides. The brisket was perfect. Nice smoke flavor, fat rendered, juicy beefy brisket, just like it should be. The chicken was also delicious. Nice crust on the skin and great smoke flavor. Likely one of the best smoked chickens around. The sides were mac n cheese, which was delicious and very cheesy. The beans had a wonderful spice level to them. The dining room has an area to grab a variety of sauces, salsa, fresh jalape√±os and pickled veggies to accompany your meal. The pulled pork taco is a must have! Overall a great spot to get some really good bbq!!
