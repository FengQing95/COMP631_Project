Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The main reason I'm giving a 3 star rating is because of the long wait and that while waiting we had to wait a long time in order to get a drink at the bar. Only one person was taking drink orders as well as serving people food at the bar and it made waiting less enjoyable. However, the food was AMAZING! We got the Benny Benny eggs Benedict and the hash browns and it was so good. Would recommend this place for the food but would warn to be ready for a long wait!
