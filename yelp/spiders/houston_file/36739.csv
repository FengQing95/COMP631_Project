Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We recently hosted our wedding brunch on a Saturday and booked the Front Lounge for 40 guests. The place was not very crowded and seemed like we have enough space for us. The food (we went for brunch buffet and picked Bosscat Burger Sliders, Vegetable Omelet with spinach tomato and cheese, Shrimp and Grits with sunny side up eggs and Bourbon Chocolate Silk Custard with sugar cookie, candied pecans & whipped cream) the drinks (wine, mimosa and beer) and the service were all great! All our guests enjoyed the venue and cocktail style brunch. We especially liked having a cocktails setup, it enabled our guests to socialize and talk to each other more than table setup where people usually talk to ones around them.
