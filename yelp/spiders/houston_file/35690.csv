Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We had a private party for 65 people and everything started out great.....then they ran out of food. We had to ask them to replenish the buffet so everyone could eat. To top it off there were approximately a dozen plus dirty plates on the buffet.....crusty dried food, sticky, etc. Then we asked if they could accommodate our company employees attending the event at a table outside of the private dining area. They first said no, so I asked for the manager, then he referred me to the banquet manager. They shuffled us around for some time.....then finally got us some high tops set up. All along there were 3 large open tables in the area that no one sat at until after our event was over. Our event ended and they told us we needed to leave the high tops, moved us to the private room (while everyone was cleaning), didn't ask is if we wanted a drink or food. Then they moved us back to the dining area.....but completely ignored us! Â We asked for a server several times and they just ignored us. Not to mention the A/C was not working properly. Everyone complained about how hot it was.... Overall it was a horrible experience!
