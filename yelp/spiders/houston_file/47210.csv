Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Awful service. We waiting for 60 minutes for a table which makes sense for brunch on a Sunday but when we got to the table, we waiting 15 min to be greeted by our waitress. We never received water and our mimosa and Bloody Mary came out 30 mins after we sat down. Our empty drink glasses sat for 10 minutes before we had to catch the waitress walking by to get another drink. When we finally received our food, my boyfriend and our daughters food came out 15-20 mins before mine did. The manager had to come over and apologize for the terrible service and that my food (which was the exact order as my boyfriends) came out way later. We ate our food. Never received a glass of water. And Received our bill in the middle of your meal. Service was absolutely terrible. Food was good but go to another location.
