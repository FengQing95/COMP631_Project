Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Cute breakfast spot with good amount of tasty options. My friend suggested this place as it was my first time visiting the area. I wanted something sweet so i decided on the pancake flight which offered 3 different pancakes from the menu and it was customizable. I got the traditional flight and the danish was my favorite hands down followed by the sweet potato. It was absolutely freezing and the caramel latte was warm and refreshing. Would definitely recommend this place.
