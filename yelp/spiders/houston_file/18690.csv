Uchi////One of my absolute favorite Happy Hour spots. I think most people are deterred from trying this place because of the high prices, but I think they are overlooking the sake social menu. It's a great way to sample some of Uchi's most popular dishes at sometimes a third of the price! Sure the portions are smaller, but that's a plus for me, because I just get to try more of a variety of dishes. The dishes during Happy Hour are priced from 3 to 6 dollars (that's a deal that is hard to beat at any Happy Hour).
