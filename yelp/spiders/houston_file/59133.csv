Baby Barnaby's////Hands down, my favorite place to go for breakfast/hangover cure in Houston. Whenever friends and family visit, this is where I take them. Yes, parking is nonexistent (you have legs!) and it's quite tiny but I'm not going to Hugo's for an all out brunch buffet with stuffy corp execs who still wear ties on the weekend. I'm coming to Baby Barnaby's because I love the ambiance, the quirks, and freakin' fresh orange juice.
