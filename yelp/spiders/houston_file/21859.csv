Uchi////We tried the omakase which was $100, but it's based on market price so it will vary. Our table favorites were Hama chili, maguro & goat cheese, karaage, Brussels sprouts, hamachi nabe & a curry dish. As for desserts, the classic fried milk is a must. The red bean cheesecake on their daily special was great too!! Oh but a must have like a must must have, foie gras. Don't leave without trying this tender, juicy, melt in your mouth duck fat. Don't even need to bite it, just let the fat dissolve into your taste buds.
