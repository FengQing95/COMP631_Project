Baby Barnaby's////Well this place is awesome! Bob's Healthy Breakfast Plate was incredibly scrumptious. The granola and fruit was a very generous portion and I'm told was very delightful. The wait staff is kind, provided bottomless coffee, and even gave us to-go cups! Win! The only hang up at this great breakfast place is that they have an amazing porch but only allow people to sit on the porch on the weekend. It was a beautiful Spring day but we were relegated to the indoors. Other than that this is a great joint.
