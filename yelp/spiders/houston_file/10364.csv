JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA is a step in the right direction for an otherwise disappointing ramen scene in Houston. We dropped by on the Saturday of the opening week (bad timing on our part) and a 45 min estimated wait for a party of 6 eventually became 90 min. The hostess was clueless about the actual wait time. But no biggies, it's the opening weekend.
