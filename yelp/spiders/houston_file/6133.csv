JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////HI Quanxin - Thank you for the stars! We greatly appreciate it. Did you know about the free parking garage on Elgin between Milam and Louisiana Streets? Unfortunately, Midtown Houston doesn't really have too many parking spots available to the general public, but the garage does mitigate this a little bit.
