Kata Robata////Favorite Japanese restaurant in town Â has my birthday celebrated here. The portion of ramen is generous, and occasionally they have specials on weekends. Sashimi taste fresh especially uni. Grilled octopus was little bit over cooked on the outside, but the meat is still tender yet chewy at the same time.
