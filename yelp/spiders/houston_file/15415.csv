JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Now you can pick the specials, or your can build a ramen bowl-noodle, protein, and broth.  Today's choices that the 3 of us shared was the recommended popular, Sprouting up Ramen; delicious in my book, although the thicker noodles do fill you up quickly and the brussel  sprouts are a bonus. The other dishes shared, JINYA Tonkotsu Black, which they were happy to sub the thin noodles on my request, and the JINYA signature bun.
