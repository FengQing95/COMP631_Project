Kata Robata////For starters, when asked what vision the owners had for Kata, he asked me if I'd eaten at Uchi in Austin. My face lit up completely and gushed at how much I LOVE Uchi and would gladly drive 3 hours to Austin and wait another 2 hours just to eat there. The manager stated that they are trying to emulate Uchi's essence & replicate the type of cuisine here in Houston. This is NOT to say that they are simply copying the genius creations at Uchi, but it's the type of high end Japanese cuisine creations that Chef Hori is sure to produce that will catapult Kata into that status.
