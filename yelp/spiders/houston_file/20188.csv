Uchi////In the end, we split three different desserts among the 3 of us. One of them reminded me of those Terry's Orange Chocolate balls; one of them I don't even remember except it had an unusual foam on top (the ash sorbet, perhaps?); and the third one was, of course, the fried milk. It wasn't even a competition at that point. I'd heard so much about the fried milk that the other two desserts couldn't possibly have held up to the expectations.
