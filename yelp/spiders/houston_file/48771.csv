Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My food was nice, and my husbands pineapple upside down pancakes were excellent, but overall the food was ok and not outstanding. Our waitress wasn't knowledgeable about the menu and wasn't very attentive. I've eaten much better brunches in Houston with much better service and won't be heading back any time soon.
