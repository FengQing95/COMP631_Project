JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For the spicy tonkotsu, the broth was thick and good. I love it. The noodle was a little too hard for my taste. Didn't like it as much. It comes with "wood ear", two slices of pork belly, and I had to add an extra egg ($1) for it. The egg wasn't seasoned, which is fine I guess.. :P I like Ninja Ramen's egg alot.
