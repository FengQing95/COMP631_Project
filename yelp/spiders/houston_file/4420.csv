JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is great. See other reviews for the deets. I want to use this review to rant about the abhorrent valet. First, it takes more than 10 minutes at drop off to get a ticket. Second, they straight up harassed my father-in-law for a tip when he had to chase them down to get the keys bc they were ignoring his existence. He ended up giving them $20 bc that's all he had and they "didn't have change".... Third, they seem to think they own the entire garage, one-ways be damned and we'll just take ownership of every spot on 2/3 the garage! Seriously, I'd rather be charged $5 and have actual professionals run the circus.
