Uchi////One of the best meals I've had in awhile. Pretty much ordered everything on the HH menu and more on the regular menu. Everything was delicious. Staff was also very knowledgeable with the menu! It was even so good, we got a gift card for one of our friends upcoming birthday! Will come back soon!
