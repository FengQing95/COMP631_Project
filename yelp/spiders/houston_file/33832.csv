Local Foods////I cannot say enough about Local Foods. I've been a couple of times, and each time I thoroughly enjoy everything I order and have always had a very pleasant experience. For people unfamiliar with this semi-chain, they have a few locations across Houston, and each offers a unique menu. There are overlaps with regards to sides and a few entree items, but for the most part, there is a lot of variance among restaurants. In any case, I think the site in Rice Village is the best both in terms of ambiance and offerings.
