JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya was everything I expected it to be and more. It's located in midtown, and there's a parking garage located in the same building. Most likely, you will have to walk around the sidewalk to get to Jinya from the parking garage. I came here with my boyfriend around 7pm on a Friday night, JUST before the crowd came. We were about to get seated immediately, but my boyfriend wanted to sit at the bar and watch the Rockets playoff game. Our service was great, since the bartender was pretty much our server. I ordered the Chef's Special (Spicy Miso Tonkotsu), and my boyfriend ordered the Tonkotsu Black. They were both excellent! They taste VERY different in flavor - the black had a bit more of a garlicy taste (in my opinion). The chef's special came with thick noodles while the black had thin noodles. Both ramen were both very flavorful and the chasu literally melts in your mouth. The only thing is I wish the seasoned egg came cut in half, instead of a whole egg, but it was still seasoned perfectly and very tasty! I also ordered (aka my boyfriend, heh) the Japanese Slipper, which is a cocktail with midori and a bit of other stuff that I don't remember, but it was sweet and very good! You can taste a bit of alcohol, but it's not too much. The couple next to me ordered 3 Cherry Blossom's each, so I'm assuming that one's good too :P
