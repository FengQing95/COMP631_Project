Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I make sure to always visit Common Bond every single time I happen to be in Houston. I have even gone as far as having a friend of mine bring me pastries from here when he visits. The staff here are super friendly and helpful, and everything is made with really high quality ingredients. I have yet to try a pastry that I haven't liked; I highly recommend trying any of the croissants. The almond croissant is a personal favorite, and the new pistachio one is delicious as well. Try to get here early because there will be a line. Keep in mind that parking is very limited, so be prepared to park on the surrounding streets. Their coffee is also amazing, I recommend trying their flat white. One of the things that I admire the most about this place is their attention to detail in the presentation of their food and drinks. Definitely try this place out, you won't be disappointed.
