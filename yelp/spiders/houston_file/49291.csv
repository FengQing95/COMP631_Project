Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I tried the pancake platter with a couple of different kinds. The one with the strawberries were the best as well as the pineapple upside down.  The chocolate is also verrrrry good but kind of sweet or thick for me.  Hashbrowns were pretty average and the sausage that my friend ordered (I tried some) was meh.  The bacon was very crispy though and good.
