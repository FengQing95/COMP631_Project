Uchi////From the cold plates, the Machi Cure is a fun dish. It's smoked yellowtail with a variety of "chips", and is meant to be a Japanese take on nachos. I tried the Hama Chili for the first time, and loved the citrus-sour taste of the yellowtail with Thai chili. My friend strongly recommended the Uchi Salad, a wonderfully simple dish with a chips and salsa feel.
