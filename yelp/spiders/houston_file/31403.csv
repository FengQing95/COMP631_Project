Local Foods////So I came in yesterday for the first time and the line moved surprisingly quickly being that it was 1:15. The parking lot can be a bit hectic especially with deliveries going on so be aware. You grab a menu when you first walk in but the daily specials are posted at the ordering counter. I ended up placing two orders, one for the special which was a meatloaf sandwich on ciabatta -I chose slaw and homemade chips as my sides. The other was for the truffled egg salad with two sides of kale. I also grabbed a bottle of cherry limeade which they opened for me at the counter (ie the service was good) I think the prices are extremely reasonable for what you get. The kale is awesome but if you are not a fan of mixed flavors (sweet and savory) you may not enjoy it as much. The slaw is very mild--though I was expecting more of a punch in either the spicy or sweet area but it wasn't bad by any means. The homemade chips were yummy as well. The pretzel bun is just plain amazing and I think I would eat the sole of a shoe inside of it and be happy. The truffled egg salad is very mild and the egg is chopped in larger chunks than I am used to for egg salad so a lot of it slid out while eating it. My kids (7 and 8 year old boys) DEVOURED the meatloaf sandwich and said it was soooo good--save the WHOLE banana peppers that they promptly removed. It's a very relaxed atmosphere, service is pretty fast and courteous. I'm tempted to go back today to get the crunchy chicken everyone talks about and the duck confit. I know..I know.. I'm hella (yeah I'm from Cali) greedy!!
