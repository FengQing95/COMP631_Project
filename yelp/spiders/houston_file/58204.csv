Kata Robata////Kata Robata is pretty good! It's a slightly less traditional Japanese restaurant and their options are more on the experimental side, but we enjoyed everything we ordered. The wagyu sando was delicious, and I would recommend that above everything else. The uni is also pretty good, but I would pass on the uni oysters. Bone marrow was delicious at first, but it gets very heavy and overwhelming quickly.
