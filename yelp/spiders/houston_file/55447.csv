Kata Robata////Right up there in my top 3 sushi spots in Houston, Kata Robata is always fresh, innovative and awe inspiring. The chefs Omakase can be prepared with a little advance notice, yet their set menu items are equally as experimental and always leave one wanting more. Also great for large groups and special occasions.
