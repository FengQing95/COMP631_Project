JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went with my husband for a quick bite this Saturday afternoon and got a booth right away. I liked the atmosphere, a little loud but hip, and cozy with dim lights. I ordered the Cilantro Slurp and he had the Spicy Chicken. I had a local draft beer for $7 (which I thought was pretty steep but I really wanted a beer, so...). I looked at some of the add-ins to the ramen but couldn't bring myself to pay $1.50 for some green onion. The flavor was good for both our dishes my husband wishes we had more than two slices of chicken breast each. If we come back we will probably give something else a try, not the Ramen.
