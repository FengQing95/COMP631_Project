Uchi////So over rated!!! Â The waiter was unfamiliar with the fish selection, his hygiene was poor and the food was average at best. I do not know how they get such a great rating. I travel very often to major cities and it's hard to believe this is considered a great sushi restaurant. Nothing about it was special and the portions were so small and the cost so high. I will never return and would never recommend this restaurant. There are far better choices in this city.
