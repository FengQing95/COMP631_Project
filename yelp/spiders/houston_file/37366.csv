Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Cool spot for libations and better than bar food with friends. Destiny was our server - and she went above & beyond! She gave us such a friendly greeting, told us her favorite menu items (which really helped) and gave us the history of the restaurant. Definitely a place to hit in Houston & request Destiny as your server!
