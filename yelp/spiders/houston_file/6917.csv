JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love ramen. I didn't really eat it much when I lived in California but once I moved to Houston, the craving got more intense. The only other restaurants where I have tried ramen were Tiger Den and Fat Bao. If I remember correctly, both places were good, but nothing note-worthy. I've never visited the places again since trying them.
