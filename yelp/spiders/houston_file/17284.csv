Uchi////This is my first 5 star review, and boy, am I happy to give it to them! My wife came here for dinner with her friends one night and came back ranting and raving about the place. Naturally, I had to try it now. So, I booked a reservation for 8 people for Sunday. We arrived just minutes before the restaurant opened, however, there was a long line outside that was already building from customers wanting to eat. We sat at the bar and had happy hour beer and sake while we waited for a table. Shortly after, a hostess advised me that they had wrongly booked me for a private table - which carries a minimum of $100 per person instead of at the main dining room. No problem, their mistake, have the private table with no minimum applying to me. This is already going to be a great night from that great start. We tried to eat as many different things as possible until we were full and silly. The place is a bit pricey, but what do you expect when you have a very renowned chef preparing your meal? Service - excellent. Food - Unbelievable. Ambience - just dreamy. The wife and I will definitely be back - after all, we still have 5 more gift cards to go through!
