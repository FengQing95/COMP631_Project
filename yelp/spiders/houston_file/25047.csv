Uchi////We have gone many times but the most recent one was a little disappointing. Did omakase and advised our server we wanted mostly sashimi with very minimal cooked dishes. 5 of our dishes were meat dishes: beef, duck and goat dishes. This was not what we expected from our favorite sushi restaurant in the city. The wagyu was extremely chewy and should be taken off the menu if that's the quality that is being served. For the amount of money spent with each visit here, for the first time, we felt unimpressed and almost ripped off. Not to mention at the 2 hour mark we are given our bill and literally told we should pay and leave ASAP because of other reservations! Not even during COVID with their limited capacity were we rushed out. May have made our last visit here.
