Uchi////The ONLY thing I'm not happy about is BE CAREFUL if you have any drinks before you are seated & be sure to make sure you are charged for what you actually ordered. I asked for a glass of the HH red wine while I was waiting to be seated. I finished the first glass & the hostess/bar girl asked if I'd like another & of course I said yes! Shortly after our table was ready & I asked that my 2 glasses of wine be transferred to the table. When I asked for the check I told our waiter to be sure the wine from the bar was included. Soon he brought the receipt he pointed out the wine - I had two glasses & the receipt showed $15. That seemed right, I remember the HH wine being $7 or $8 a glass. So I paid & went on with my evening. Yesterday I noticed my card was charged twice so I called & gave them my info. They looked into it & told me that I was charged for one glass at the bar & one at my table & the glass I had was $15 dollar glass & that they're sorry but it must have been a misunderstanding between me & the bartender who I ordered the first glass of wine from. The bar charged my card $20, so I guess they just assumed that a 33% tip is what I would leave at the bar?? Â It's not the $20 that annoys me, it's the principle.
