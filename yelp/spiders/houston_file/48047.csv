Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Ok this is awesome food, but you'll be met with a long line and might wait 2 hours for a table, so make sure you are ready for that. You can walk around or go to the coffee joint across the street to wait it out. I went with a group of friends and the food was great. I hate the fact that they don't take reservations, so that's why they lose a star. Either get to this place early or come later. They close around 3pm I think. It's cozy, so it's best to go with smaller groups.
