Local Foods////Stopped by for lunch with a friend and was pleasantly surprised to find a short line, especially after hearing all the hype surrounding this place. I was told that the crunchy chicken sandwich was the way to go, and I was not disappointed. First off, the pretzel buns on their sandwiches are terrific. It had a nice crunch on the crust while being perfectly soft on the inside. I could have eaten that as a meal and would still have been satisfied. The amount of chicken they pile on the sandwich is no joke either. I originally thought crunchy chicken would have been some type of deep-fried goodness, but this was so much better. The shredded chicken was tucked between crunchy potato chips and ground nuts, which gave a much better textural crunch and feel than a deep-fried piece of chicken and without all the grease. Â
