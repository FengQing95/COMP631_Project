The Pit Room////My friends and I landed in Houston and took an Uber straight to the Pit Room with our luggage and all. Ahhhhhhh!!!! It was so goood!!! I got a beef rib weighing in at one pound for $22. The line was intimidating but went by quick. Lots of friendly employees and happy customers. The hype is real and worth it. We didn't know until after we ate but the friendly old man working there suggested we go next door to the Patio for drinks and customers like to order their food and eat it next door.
