JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I want to start by saying I really do enjoy Jinya's food. As someone who doesn't eat pork, they have a great selection of different ramen with chicken bases and they are all delicious. But lately the service has not been so great. A few of my friends and I came in one night--4 people total. We put our name down on the waitlist and we were told it would be a 20-25 minute wait. Half an hour passed and the place was crowded so we understood. By the 45 minute mark we decided to just check on the status of our table. We were told we would be called next. When the 1 hour mark of waiting passed we started to see groups who came well after us be seated and we couldn't figure out what was going on. Every time we checked, we were told we would be next. Finally after about an hour and a half of waiting, we checked one last time and they told us they finally had 4 seats available. We were told they were trying to wait out a table that could have us all facing each other. When we walked into the dining area, there was an empty table with four chairs open and facing each other, the end of one of the tables had 4 chairs open facing each other, and another cluster of 4 chairs open besides the place they sat us down at which ended up being 4 chairs in a line..so confused. What were we waiting for then..?
