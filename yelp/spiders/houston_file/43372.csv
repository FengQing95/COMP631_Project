Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The crowd here reminds me of Empire Cafe on Saturday morning at 10am.  Except Common is smaller and it's like EC Sat. morning all day long.  I missed out on the trials of early morning breakfast when they first opened, so I hopped on over this morning to discover they don't open until 9 on Sat. and Sun.  Whaaatf?
