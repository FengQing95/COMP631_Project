Kata Robata////I wanted badly to write a positive review for Kata Robata. I've dined in on a few occasions and usually only have good things to say about the fish; most of the other small plates or hot dishes are also quite good. My Sunday dinner, however, was drastically different. My party of 4 ordered two sets of the DIY handroll takeout kits, each of which comes with 10 sheets of nori, rice, tempura crunch, spicy mayo, avocado, cucumber/jalapeno strips, and fish (tuna (akami), toro, yellowtail, shrimp, and salmon). For only ~60$ for a two-person kit, it definitely isn't a bad deal, as the amount of fish is pretty generous for that price point (though I wish they provided a little more rice).
