Local Foods////Local Foods does an amazing job of putting a fresh, unique spin on simple meals. After always getting their smoked salmon sandwich (which is excellent, with marinated onions on a New York bagel), I branched out today to try the roast beef. Terrific sandwich, with horseradish sauce, kale, and curried cauliflower, plus vegan chili as the side.
