Uchi////Love it. Come here for hh with friends. You can be fancy, but don't have to spend too much $$$ to break the bank if you come during hh and split plates to get a little taste of everything. I came with two other friends, and like the waitress suggested, we ordered one off of everything on the hh menu.
