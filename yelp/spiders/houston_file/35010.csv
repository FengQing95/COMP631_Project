Local Foods////Local foods is a great healthy lunch spot. You can taste the freshness in their food. I got the crunchy chicken sandwich, thinking the chicken was fried. But the chicken wasn't fried, and the "crunch" comes from a potato chip/nut mix added into the sandwich. They give you a good amount of moist chicken, along with veggies. I really liked the pretzel bun!! I also tried the roast beef and egg salad, which were both good but not as good as the crunchy chicken.
