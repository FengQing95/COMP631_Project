Baby Barnaby's////This was my first time visiting Houston and having heard so much about their food scene, I made sure to make a list of places I wanted to try. The Breakfast Klub was at the top of my list but I always make it a point to try not so popular places. I stumbled upon this place on Yelp because they never steer me wrong and the reviews were pretty good. Also, a friend of mine mentioned that the food was pretty great too so it was settled. I took an Uber which was a 15 drive from where I was staying. I arrived and was about to put my name on the list until the waiter asked how many people in my party. I told him it's just me was and immediately seated. I assume it gets pretty packed especially on the weekends. I noticed that the restaurant is in a LBGT community including the owners of the place. It may bother some patrons but I'm from Atlanta so I didn't care. And plus I'm there for the food! Anyways, every table is given a huge vase of water which is needed since it's gets pretty hot in Texas during the summer months. Since I was still waking up, I ordered a cup of Joe and the Huevos Rancheros as my breakfast entree. Never had it and it'll be rude not to try Huevos Rancheros when you're in Texas! The food was good. It came out in like 7 minutes. The staff is nice. I wish they were more attentive as I kept having to flag down a waiter every time I needed something. I appreciate the fact that they try to greet everyone upon entering and leaving which I thought was sweet. I definitely want to come back. Maybe to try their fresh squeezed orange juice!
