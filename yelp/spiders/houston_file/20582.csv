Uchi////I met Clients for dinner and we are always looking for new places to try.  I had heard of Uchi's forever and we decided to give it a try.  I must say that we were blown away by the food.  What can I say that others haven't?  Spectacular, phenomenal, awesome!  Absolutely no regrets.  And,. I think, worth every penny spent.
