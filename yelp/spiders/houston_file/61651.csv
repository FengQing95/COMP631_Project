Baby Barnaby's////Update: I still love this place, but the most recent time I went I was turned off by the service (so I had to downgrade my review to 4 stars). I remember when I first came, they had the complimentary coffee set out while people waited and never got charged. However, this time - the server charged me and stated that "there is a sign" (which I did not see) and started arguing with me. I decided to apologize when he came back and all he said was "the sign wasn't there today." He didn't apologize for arguing with me earlier and had no intention of informing me I wasn't in the wrong after making a scene.
