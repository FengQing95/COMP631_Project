Uchi////They were nice enough to come get us from Southside Espresso when they were able to seat us earlier - we asked for first available and sat at the Sushi Bar, which is always a lot of fun:  You get the chance to see the chefs create the works of art on each plate and the attention to detail in each one.  We always talk to them and oftentimes get free tastings (unfortunately none last night though).
