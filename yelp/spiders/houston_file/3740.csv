JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went to this place with a friend and we both loved it! They have a vegetarian option AND vegan option. The waitress asked me if I was vegan when I told her I wanted a vegetarian ramen with no eggs because their thin noodles are made of eggs. I got the vegetarian ramen with thick noodles and ooh boy they were delicious. I would recommend this place to meat lovers, plant lovers, food lovers in general. Great ramen and less long of a line than other japanese ramen restauants! Plus there's a free parking garage right next to it!
