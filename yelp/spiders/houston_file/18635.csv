Uchi////Moving on, my friend and I were both early for reservations so we were asked to be seated outside until our table is ready. She ordered the green tea which tasted authentic (you know, not the powdered version) and I ordered my wine. We waited for about ten minutes. We were seated next to a couple doing their anniversay thing and I was doing a birthday thing. They looked like they were having the times of their lives so I was excited for our food. A must is the hot rocks and the yokai berry. The hot rocks is with DYI wagyu beef so you can cook it as well as you want it. The yokai berry has fresh fish, pickled seaweed, fresh pear and deep fried or possible baked kale. Those two dishes is always the reason I come back. This time is no exception. After that though, the dinner had a snowball effect. In other words, it was crap from there. Everything else was bland or too salty which was embarassing because I raved about this place to my friend. Sigh. I told her that Uchiko didn't need soy sauce because it was fresh, but this was not that case at Uchi. Needless to say, I rather save the money to go to Austin to eat at Uchiko. Dessert was fried milk which always my favorite thing.
