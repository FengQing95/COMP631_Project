Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////They have a great selection of different types of eggs benedict and pancakes. I had the bella benny (eggs with hollandaise, arugla, tomato, and balsamic glaze). I highly recommend their eggs benedict or pancake dishes - they are very good and give snooze their hype. I would say that their other items aren't worth the wait.
