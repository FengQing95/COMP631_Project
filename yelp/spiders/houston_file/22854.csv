Uchi////The  overall experience was phenomenal. I was wearing a simple jacket, yoga pants, and ugly mom sneakers. And I'm not a mom. Despite my wardrobe causality, I still felt comfortable and at home in this upscale Japanese fusion restaurant. (The dim lighting helped a bit, now that I'm thinking about it.)  Some people were dressed to the nines but many others were simply casual. A couple were in biker gear as well. So just come as you are where you are and enjoy the food, experience, and, of course, the nabe.
