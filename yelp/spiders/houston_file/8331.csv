JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I always get the Spicy Tonkotsu. I love the thick ramen it comes with and how flavorful the broth is. I usually get full within 3/4s of the bowl but I force myself to finish it every time because it's THAT delicious! I also love their appetizers, I've tried the crispy shrimp and the pork buns, both super tasty.
