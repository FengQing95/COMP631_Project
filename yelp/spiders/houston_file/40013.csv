Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My girlfriend and I saw the beautiful pictures of this place on Yelp. We decided to check it out. The cornbread was very disappointing to both of us. The pork belly poutine was tasty but I wish the fries were thinner. You get a lot of food for the money. We took food home. The bourbon balls dessert were just okay. The whiskey caramel was terrible. The place had a cool look and vibe to it. The beer selection on tap was limited to under ten options. It reminded me of Whiskey Cake in San Antonio,but it's not as good.
