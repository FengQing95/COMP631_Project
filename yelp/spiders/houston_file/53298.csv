Kata Robata////Last Â night was the first time i have been there, and I absolutely loved it. There were many people on the line, but gladly we had reservation :) Atmosphere was great. I like the decor, and our waitress seemed very professional. We had some sake and started off with the Hamachi and Jalapenos Sashimi. The combination was perfect.
