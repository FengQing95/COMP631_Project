The Pit Room////I always always always get the beef rib.  It is my favorite since I've had them at Killen's and I have to judge a BBQ place by the beef rib cause of my love for them.  To give them credit, they were very tender - but it was so so fatty and greasy... I cut off a lot of it cause of how fat it was.  Then the parts around the bone were burnt and won't even come off the bone!  Parts of it was overly seasoned and too salty and part of it was under-seasoned.  I was so sad cause I wanted to like this place cause it was so much closer!  To be fair though, they gave me the end piece, not sure if this makes a difference.
