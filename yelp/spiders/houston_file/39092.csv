Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place is the A1 sauce for anything whiskey! But even is whiskey isn't your thang it's all good because they can cater to your palate still. One thing is for sure and that is that you HAVE TO have to ask for Kristina to serve you or else the expirence won't come to a full complete circle. This place is 5 stars already but kristina's attitude makes for that extra credit start . Great vibe and awesome setting, you shall have no "ragretz" from visiting this outstanding watering hole.
