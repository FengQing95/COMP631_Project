JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We went there on Saturday night with my daughter and grandson. It was about 6 PM and they told us he would be about a 20 minute wait. With Covid we were outside waiting it was a little chilly but that's OK we're from New England we can handle it. Once we receded a server and his trainee came over and they were incredibly friendly. They made it a point to interact with my grandson and he felt like one of the group. We ordered some Gyoza and some Ramen as well as the kids meal with came with soup and rice and a couple of other things. We also ordered a beer, cocktail, and soda from my grandson.
