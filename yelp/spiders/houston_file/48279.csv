Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Pancake and omelette heaven. My favorites are the pineapple upside down pancake, OMG French toast, blueberry streusel pancake. Every thing is delish. Omelettes are full of variety and come with a create your own option and fresh egg white is also available. They have tofu meat options for you meatless lovers. The price point makes this an easy pick for brunch. Don't be deterred by the wait it goes fast.
