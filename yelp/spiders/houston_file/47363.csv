Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Overly crowded for good reason! Everything was so good!! We went on a Sunday around 12:00 and of course it was packed. We put our name down to be texted when our table was ready. They said it'd be an hour and 45 min wait, but really it ended up being about 50 min. The service was excellent. The waitress was extremely attentive and friendly. She even gave us a coupon for a free pancake to apologize for the wait. I started with a dirty chai. It had a very strong spice which I liked. I would have preferred it a little creamier, but it was still really good. I got the pancake flight with sweet potato, blueberry Danish, and strawberry coconut (the pancake of the day) Â plus a peanut butter cup pancake. The peanut butter cup was my favorite with sweet potato as a strong second. The blueberry and strawberry were really good, but super sweet. While 4 pancakes doesn't sound like a lot, here it is. Just the single peanut butter cup would have been plenty. I had to take a lot home for leftovers. I'll for sure be back, but I'll wait until the hype dies down a tad.
