Uchi////This was so hard not to give them a 5 star rating, but when the price goes up, so does my expectations and my critical eye looks to catch anything that isn't 5 star worthy. Don't get me wrong, Uchi is fantastic when it comes to a play on Japanese food, sake, and table service, but there are a few things that just didn't settle well with me that made me knock this restaurant down to a 4 star.
