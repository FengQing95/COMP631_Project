Local Foods////I ordered the 'Banh mi' with chips and slaw. Â On the menu, the description says 'pork, cucumber, jalapeno, French baguette.' I like my sandwiches plain so I asked for the jalapeno to be left off. The women behind the register mentioned that the sandwich also had a spicy Sambal sauce, so I asked to leave that off as well. I am a picky eater, so I made sure to specifically ask if there was anything else on the sandwich that wasn't listed on the menu and she said no. Well the sandwich came out with pickled onions, mayo, and carrots, none of which were listed in the description. I ate my sides, which were delicious, while contemplating whether to send it back because I know my pickiness is not normal. My friend convinced me to ask for another sandwich, and I'm really glad that I did. The pork was a bit fatty but very delicious and juicy. The only recommendations I would make would be for them to pickle their carrots and cucumbers to give a little more tang to the sandwich.
