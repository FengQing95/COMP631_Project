The Pit Room////We ordered the brisket, beef sausage, pork sausage and pork ribs.  Absolutely delicious!  They put like a salt and black pepper crust on the meat and I guess slow cook it in heaven and then bring it back to earth, because it was so tender, moist and best seasoning on BBQ I have literally ever had.
