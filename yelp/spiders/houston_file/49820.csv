Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The nice and friendly atmosphere continued to the table and our waiter who worked hard to get us everything we needed. Our table got the eggs Benedict, two classics with ham & sausage, the OMG French toast and the snooze breakfast burrito with pulled pork and avocado. Everything tasted great. The OMG French toast is a must have!
