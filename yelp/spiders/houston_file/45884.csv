Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We have gotten to enjoy brunch at Common Bond on a number of occasions. We're lucky enough that it is within walking distance from our place, but if not, parking does seem to be pretty tricky. Also, if you don't arrive early, then you will end up waiting in a long line. Despite those negatives, I have thoroughly enjoyed the food and coffee on every visit.
