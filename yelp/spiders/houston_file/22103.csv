Uchi////My wife and I got the signature tasting menu, suggested by Travis. I don't know any of the names of the dishes, but was very pleased with everything, except the sushi. The sushi was good but not great. Â We finished with the foie gras nigiri. That was awesome. The cocktails too were unique and very tasty.
