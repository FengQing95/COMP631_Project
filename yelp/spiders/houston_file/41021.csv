Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Visited the Houston area during the holidays and decided to check this spot out. If you're looking for a moderately quiet dinner with family, this is not your spot! The music can come across as too loud for some. However, it's perfect for date night, getting drinks, and catching up with friends. The steak was AMAZING and I regret not ordering it for myself. The salmon barbecue was good. Needed a little rice/mashed potato on the side, but it was flavorful. For dessert, save your money and don't buy the churros. The apple pie was the saving grace for the night ! Shoutout to Henry for holding down our table with his wonderful customer service !!
