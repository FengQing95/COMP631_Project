Uchi////I went on Mondays both pre- and post-opening, and the volume of people intensified greatly. Either way, service is always first class. Dishes are brought one or two at a time, in the order you're supposed to eat them, and with detailed explanations from the server. It's all part of the "intimate" experience.
