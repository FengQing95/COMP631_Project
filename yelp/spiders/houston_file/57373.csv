Kata Robata////I love Kata...I've been coming here since they first opened and continue to enjoy my experiences here. Tonight I was taken care of by Jacob and the amazing guys at the sushi bar. The food was outstanding as always - Rolls, Sous Vide Skewers, Ramen, more rolls, seaweed salad, sushi...everything. Can't get a reservation, show up and wait...it's worth it!
