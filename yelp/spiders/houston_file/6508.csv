JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the Tonkotsu black ramen and it was FANTASTIC!  I thought about this ramen for 48 hours straight after eating it.  my friends had the Tonkotsu white ramen and the cha cha chicken ramen and both of those were good as well.  We started off with the pork gyoza which I also highly recommend.  I can't wait to eat here again.
