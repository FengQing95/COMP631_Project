Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Originally i would tell people this was a "bar that served food"....then i actually sat down and ate dinner here. Wow! Not only is it a spectacular whiskey bar, but the food is highly developed comfort food suitable for the best foodies in Houston. The meat loaf app is so yummy, deep fried cubes of meat loaf with a sweet red sauce to dip them in. and the only burger on the menu looks good enough....however, the waiter told me to order it "the chef's way" which i did and it blew me away! Ive also had the breakfast item on the dinner menu, a iron skillet pancake with whiskey maple syrup topped with an egg and bacon! there are lots of tvs with sports playing all throughout the restaurant, it can be noisy but its so good i don't care!
