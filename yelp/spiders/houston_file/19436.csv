Uchi////Saving the best for last...the food! We order pretty everything as usual.  Overall it was good, somewhere between 4-5 star.  We feel (taste) the locations had better balance and flavor and service a bit better but its still a place to go for sushi.  It was a late Sunday evening, maybe it was an off day for them and we would try again.
