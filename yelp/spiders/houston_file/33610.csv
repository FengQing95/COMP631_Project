Local Foods////The other sandwiches I've tried and would recommend include the Duck Confit Sandwich (brie + duck is a match made in heaven) and the House Smoked Salmon Sandwich (it's basically like a lox bagel). I've also had the raved-about Crunchy Chicken Sandwich, but to be honest, I'm not a fan. It's good, but nothing great. I feel like I'd be able to get a similar sandwich elsewhere.
