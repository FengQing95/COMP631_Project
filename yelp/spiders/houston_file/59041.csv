Baby Barnaby's////This is one of my favorite breakfast spots.  They have a unique set of choices.  I have tried the Green Eggs and the Apple Pancake and the Steak & Eggs.  I loved all of them.  I think the Pancakes are unlike any other pancake you have ever had.  They have fresh squeezed Orange and Grapefruit juice, you can watch the machine cut/squeeze the oranges right in front of you which I thought was pretty amazing.  The food is always cooked perfectly.  The steak actually gets cooked the way you ask.  The staff is always friendly.  Also, the menu is simple so you're not trying to decide what to eat for 30 minutes.  It may not be clear to you at first but there is a clip-board on the wood beam in front of the door on the patio where you must put your own name and # of guests.  There is no host/hostess.  It took us a while to figure that out!  Did I mention the food is really cheap too?
