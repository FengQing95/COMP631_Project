JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The soup broth is thick and flavorful, I ordered the spicy tonkaso, it was good, but the noodle is thicker and chewy compare to other Raman places we been, it may be good for people who like thick noodles, but not for me.... The restaurant inside is dark and modern looking, but kind of hard to see anything, I would prefer to seat outside
