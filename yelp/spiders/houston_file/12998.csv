JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Farrah - Thanks for your review. I had one follow-up question for you: Have you only had our ramen as take-out? I only ask because our ramen is ideally served piping hot in a ceramic bowl. As far as noodle type is concerned, we offer thick noodles in addition to the thin noodles, and we're always happy to accommodate customers who prefer one over another. We also offer spinach noodles, though those require a $2 upcharge. Unfortunately, we do not carry fish cake per our franchisor's specifications.
