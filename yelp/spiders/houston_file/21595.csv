Uchi////Their sushi is fresh and delicious and have a great variety. Service was impeccable from front to back.Â We left with full stomachs and a passionate admiration for the food here. This is a great place to come with someone who appreciates sushi and wants to spend the evening savoring an authentic Japanese meal.
