Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place deserves 5 stars because of the amazing service I received this past weekend, particularly by a waiter named Henry. It was my first time here and I realized that it was more of a loungey vibe, with a DJ and people bustling around the bar just hanging out. So with our party of over 10 people and with it being so loud and busy, I was pleasantly surprised to have had such great service! Our waiter was attentive, timely and overall very nice. The food was also awesome! Will definitely be back to try their brunch :)
