JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was so excited to try this place and it did not disappoint. It was really busy on Friday night but the bartender talked me through my first try of the hot sake. The atmosphere was great and the staff was so friendly. I got the spicy chicken ramen and a pork bun and I really enjoyed it. Will definitely be back!
