Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I will say this place is a nice, hip place to meet at the bar and have some drinks.  It looked like alot of people were ready to hit the club.  That being said, it was super loud in there witht he music.  It was hard to hold a conversation without yelling.  It is totally a non factor to me, but just be aware.  I will definitely be coming back, especially for their brunch!
