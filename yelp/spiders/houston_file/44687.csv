Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The atmosphere is great, music not too loud and tables were set up for couples, community style, outside, or by the coffee bar. The food is overpriced in my opinion and my friend thought the bakery items were too, but the drinks were reasonable. I got two macarons (which I would normally never pay for, but had a craving for sweets) vanilla and citrus, and a vanilla latte. I studied there with my friend and was able to concentrate. One thing I didn't like was that it was freezing. And I was wearing leggings and drinking a hot drink. It was in my favorite coffee district too by Agora and Empire so if I had to choose one I wouldn't pick CB as my go to.
