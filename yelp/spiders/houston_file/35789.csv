Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Location and set up is breath taking. Waitress was amazing in regards to switching out my cocktail for free after noticing I hadn't touched it. Staff was also quick to clear plates and refill waters! Hostess might be the most unwelcoming part but the wait staff quickly makes up for it! Drinks were extremely over priced for the quality but is made up for with their Very unique tastes.
