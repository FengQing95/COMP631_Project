The Pit Room////They have a condiment bar with homemade pickled and pickled red onions, which I LOVE, and both were tasty. They also had a few other selections of bbq sauce, and I tasted one that was like a bourbon brown sugar that I found much too sweet to be called barbecue sauce. I also really enjoyed the citrus green tea.
