JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Pretty good - definitely better than other ramen places in Houston. Nice decor inside. The ramen itself is good, but the broth is pretty salty. One thing to note, there are thick and thin noodles (my parents didn't see the dishes with thin noodles). I'd say it's the best ramen I've eaten in Houston for sure.
