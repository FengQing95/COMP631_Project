Local Foods////Finally a place that actually gives you meat on your sandwich and not just mostly bread. You can get two sides with your sandwich for about ten bucks depending on the sandwich which is not bad considering how much they stuff in the toasted pretzel bread. They have local craft beer and Mexican Coke, yummy. Parking during lunch is horrible as they share a small parking lot with other places.
