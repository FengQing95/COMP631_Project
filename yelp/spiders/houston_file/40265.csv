Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////BC Press (4/5) - Probably my favorite thing that I ate that night - the sandwich was lightly crispy and was sufficiently stuffed with fresh ingredients, with a thin smear of mustard to cut through the richness of meat and cheese. Do be warned that it doesn't come with any side, so it's best as part of a shared assortment of plates.
