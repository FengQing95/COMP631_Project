Uchi////I started going to Uchi when I lived in Austin and it was always a favorite!  I haven't lived in Austin in a few years so while I was in Houston last I decided to give this location a try.  I was so happy, everything was just as amazing and fresh.  It is not a place I would recommend if you are trying to save money, as its pretty easy to spend money here.  With that said, the amount i spend is always worth the experience and awesome food!
