The Pit Room////Hellooo BBQ in Houston!  The pit room is small, with a little parking lot, but there's also street parking.  It's right down the street from Rice University!  I was there on a Saturday night and the place was popping, but we all waited in line for our turn to order!  The brisket was moist but not fatty, they were out of ribs, they had various offerings of sausage; turkey and pulled pork.  Sides included: Mac and cheese, Elote, Coleslaw, Potato Salad.
