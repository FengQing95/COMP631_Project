The Pit Room////As for the food, the prices are a little high in my opinion - note that their online menu is not up-to-date, and they would not honor it. Specifically, meals do not come with chips (i.e. not 3rd side for substitution of chips). As for the meat, I tried the pulled pork, which was definitely moist and well-seasoned but way too moist because it's soaking in a pool of juices and a bucket of grease. I can see why many people like their pulled pork, but it just wasn't for me.
