Uchi////On walking in, I looked onto the familiar setting of the same feel/elements as the original Uchi. A large open dining area, outlines of trees painted onto vibrant red walls and little light globes illumniating the table areas. The natural wood elments of the booths, walls, tables and chairs made the it feel warm and initimate. We were told it'd be a bit of a wait to clear some tables, despite having our 7:30 reservation (we were seated at about 8), but we were invited sit at the bar area and get some drinks in the meantime. Both the bar and sushi bar are situated in the center of the restaurant where we could clearly see all the action. I have to say, staff was very attentive about checking in with us, constantly updating us to what was going on as far as seating and I appreciated that.
