Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////If I had to pick my favorite brunch/breakfast place in Houston, it would definitely be Snooze. You can't leave that place without trying their sweet potato pancakes! That is the most amazing pancake I have EVER had filled with so much flavor that makes you go to brunch heaven in your first bite. What also makes this place so great is that they offer half off mimosas for health care professionals on Mondays and Tuesdays (:
