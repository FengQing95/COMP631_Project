JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ambiance is dark, and the place is somewhat small, so they get packed quickly. If you want a quick lunch during the day, I suggest going on the early side, 11 or 11:30. They have a big communal table in the middle and a couple bars that offer quicker seating. If you come during the busy time, expect to wait at least 30 minutes.
