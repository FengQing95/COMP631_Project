The Pit Room////I don't care what "best of" list you look at - to me, this is the best BBQ in Texas.  The brisket has a good bark and moist taste, the pork ribs come right off the bone, and the turkey is outstanding (I rarely order turkey).  Sides are pretty good, and the cole slaw is a vinegar-based version.  The pricing is actually less than other "best of" places here in the Houston area.  Great for a lunch during the work week as well as grabbing a few pounds to go.
