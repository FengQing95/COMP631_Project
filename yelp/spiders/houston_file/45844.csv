Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Came here after hearing about and it always wanting to come but being too busy to go. Finally had a date night with the wife and decided to give this place a try.  I had a pastry that was filled with raisins and boston creme and was dipped in chocolate.  My wife had a chocolate cake that was so chocolately.   I wish I was skinny so I could eat everything they had there.  I will be back and the staff here is super friendly and will help you with any questions you have.
