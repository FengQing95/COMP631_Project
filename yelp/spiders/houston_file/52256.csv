Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Love this Snooze. Friendly staff and like how you can join waitlist through Yelp which I HIGHLY recommend if in the weekend. Sometimes the wait can be pretty crazy, so joining waitlist allows you to not have to go to restaurant til 15-20 min before seating time. Parking can sometimes be a bit of a hassle but once you are seated. Mmmmm!
