Baby Barnaby's////Had breakfast here with my lil family back in August 2014. Yeah I know it was a long time ago and Im pretty sure I wrote a review but the little monsters in my phone must of deleted it before I got to post it.  But here goes. We decided to get a mid morning breakfast after arriving hungry from our summer trip and got there a bit after 9 am. The place was packed and there was a sign in sheet to wait for seating.  We signed in and stood up waiting in a small balcony area outside.  They had a little coffee station set up so you could have some caffeine while you waited in 90 degree weather. I'm sure it was maybe 85 but the sun was blazing that morning.  (off topic).  When we finally got called after about 35-40 minutes and we were lucky enough to get seating inside. The inside is really small so you sit in very close proximity to other patrons. Its loud too.  We ordered the freshly squeezed orange juice. I had the green eggs and ham and it was delicious. I particularly liked the chicken apple sausage they served with it.  We got pancakes for my son which took up his entire plate and some biscuits for the table which were so good. My husband got french toast and eggs.  Everything was very delicious and service was great even though the place was packed.  There were a few people outside with their fur friends as it is a dog friendly establishment. (If you didn't know, Barnaby was the owners childhood pet and he named the business after him---now you know.)  The place had a casual, fun and friendly atmosphere and we will return and be ready for a wait.  Maybe we will choose a day that has cooler weather. And Yes you should go.
