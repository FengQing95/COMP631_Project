Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This restaurant is still operating during COVID, allowing both dine in and takeout options. Dine-in capacity has been significantly reduced to comply with physical distancing, and they have no-touch menus now. Also all of the staff members wear masks, which I was happy to see. It's very nice inside and has an urban yet upscale vibe.
