Uchi////It's rare when everything is amazing, from the food, to the wine, to the service. Uchi has this down pat. Since it's ros√© season (call me a basic b all you want idc) I asked for help ordering one. I'm not a huge merlot fan, so I crossed that one off the list. I ended up ordering a pinot noir with floral notes. Floral over fruity. Every time.
