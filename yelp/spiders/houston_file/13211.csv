JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Good ramen -- definitely not the best ramen in Houston. As far as broth and noodles go I'd say it lacks flavor and it's very plain. They do have great toppings to spice up your ramen or to make it a little more savory. It's a cute spot but I wouldn't recommend it as one of my favorite ramen places. I love Tiger Den and Ramen Bar Ichi.
