Kata Robata////Two words: FOOD POISONING. been a long time customer, only place I would go for sushi on a regular basis. Husband and I both became violently ill after having dinner there on a Saturday evening, luckily our 1.5 yr old didn't eat what we ate. I called the restaurant Monday morning to let them know when and what we ate and I was told that a chef would be contacting me to further discuss. I NEVER received additional communication and I assume they didn't care much about a customers concern about food illness. Super bummed because I loved this place and can never go back due to fear of a repeat event.
