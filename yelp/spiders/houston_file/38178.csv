Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The husband and I came here before seeing a play on Super Bowl Sunday. The wait staff was wonderful and the food was amazing. We started with the portobello mushroom fries and were in heaven! I got the spicy pasta and the husband got the snapper. Both dishes were amazing. I finished with burbon chocolate pudding which was smooth and had just the tiniest hint of spice.
