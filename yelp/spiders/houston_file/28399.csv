The Pit Room////I'm a fan of the mustard potato salad because a mayo based potato salad is too heavy to eat with bbq. The mac and cheese is okay, but I wish it had stronger and thicker cheese sauce. The pickle and onion bar is also pretty tasty, and they even have salsa along with all the bbq sauce!
