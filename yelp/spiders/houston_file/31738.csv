Local Foods////Crunchy chicken add avocado is amazing !! Love this place . Love this location been to the San Felipe location a few Times not as friendly as rice village area but same quality of food. Found a small staple on the chicken the first time I took my bf to this place the manager apologized and refunded us back the money he said the chicken comes in portions in bags so maybe accidentally one came off. I keep going back because the sandwich is so good.
