JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Appetizers, seaweed salad and spicy tofu are good. Ramen is so so, I ordered the famous spicy chicken ramen, 2 pieces of chicken katsu seem to be thoroughly cooked, but they still have a strong taste of raw meat, which I personally cannot accept. As for the portion, it's not as large or generous as some other people say. It's just regular size compared to other ramen I have had in other cities in US. I also think it will be better if some more soup can be added.
