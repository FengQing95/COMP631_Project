Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I LOVE THIS PLACE. However, I hate the +1 hr long wait.... its sooo worth it though. Their OMG! French Toast is the best french toast I've ever had. Im not kidding, lol. I've also had their eggs benedict and it was good as well! I got the Benny duo with Bella Bella and Goodman. Let me say, their hash browns are soooooooooo good. I have to order them everytime I come!!! This is a place I actually crave to go to, the wait is ridiculous but I will definitely come back for their amazing french toast.
