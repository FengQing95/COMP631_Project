The Pit Room////Have visited The Pit Room twice now and have tried the loaded Frito Pie with brisket, lean brisket, turkey and jalapeno sausage. All were flavorful and perfectly seasoned. Moist, juicy meat melts in your mouth. The Mac & Cheese is good as well. Overall, great food, service lined moved quickly, staff professional and friendly. If you want an inside the loop alternative to Killen's BBQ in Pearland, this is your best bet. Dining room is nothing fancy, rustic, but very clean. They have a long bar area outside and a lot of outside seating. Parking is an issue though, just not enough and they run out of items early sometimes, especially the sausage, Highly recommended.
