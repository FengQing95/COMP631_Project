JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Hector - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry you had a bad experience at our restaurant. I am very surprised to hear your feedback regarding Celeste, as she is one of our veteran employees who in more than 2- 1/2 years has never received such a negative review. May I request more specific information from you regarding her attitude, and possibly an exact description of how she "snapped" at you for asking the wait time?
