Kata Robata////The server basically lacks attention to customer needs (drink refills, timing for check, etc.), and from the way she wanders around the restaurant, she appears to lack in training on time-management/prioritization skills, and also appears to panic when serving more than two tables. The server also lacks the feel of courtesy and hospitality (never smiles).
