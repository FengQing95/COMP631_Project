Uchi////As others have said it's an amazing dining experience from start to finish. I love how they explain what food they are putting down and even tips on how to eat it. Everything was incredibly fresh and delicious. Definitely an interesting take on sushi not just run of the mill dishes. I wish it was less expensive so I could come for a Grand dinner, but for now I'll stick to the sake social. We all have large appetites so we did grab more food soon afterwards but that being said good sushi isn't about volume or trying to be stuffed so i still thought the portions were fair given the quality and nature of the sake social specials
