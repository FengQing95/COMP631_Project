JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I finally decided to try a Ramen Bar (yes, I'm late in the game), and JINYA was the top recommendation. Being that it was my first time, I needed guidance on what was the "best" to eat. I lucked out with a waiter who not only gave me excellent recommendations but cued into my inexperience and offered me a discreet tutorial on how to attack the bowl of noodles. We started with the pork gyoza and the tangy, and very tasty, gyoza sauce. These were more delicious than most that I have tried, and I highly recommend them. I ate the spicy chicken ramen which apparently is a popular dish. I added extra garlic and wontons as recommended. The broth was super flavorful, and this flavor permeated the noodles and wontons to make for an excellent eating experience. I am already planning my next visit.
