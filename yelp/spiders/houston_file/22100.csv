Uchi////We decided to go to Uchi to buy a gift certificate and ended up deciding to eat there too. This was our first visit. On the way we were reading the one and two star reviews to see what people were complaining about. By the time we got there we thought it might be best if we go somewhere else. But, the restaurant has over 1,300 reviews with average 4.5 stars. We were not disappointed at all.
