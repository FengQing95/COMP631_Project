Baby Barnaby's////Heads Up: this location is tiny (they're not joking with the "baby" part) so expect a wait during peek times and also be prepared to be cozied up with your neighbor.  They also have a nice patio area that is pet friendly.  Suffice it to say that anytime I find myself in Houston, be it on business or pleasure, I make sure that I get to take a trip to the Cheers of breakfast places, sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name, and the fact the food is killer good makes this a double win.
