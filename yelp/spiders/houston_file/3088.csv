JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////After watching Naruto for sometime, I began craving the Ramen he always ate. I yelped a few locations and decided to check JINYA out. I am so glad I came here first. Walked in around 1500, no wait, and seated immediately. Hanza (sorry if I got your name wrong) was our server was great. I wasnt sure what to get my toddler, as the bowls we large and he recommended the kids meal, which came with a little bit of everything. Needless today my toddler loved it and went straight for the sweets first. As for our food, it was yummy and so filling. Aside from the cup ramen, I don't have much of a comparison but I feel strongly that this must be what Naruto's Â Ichiraku is like.
