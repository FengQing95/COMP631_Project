Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I'm a big fan of brunch.  I was in Houston for the weekend and I wanted to try this place.  We went on a saturday about 10am and there were tons of people waiting and there was an hour and a half wait.  The place was super cute and I could drink free coffee while I waited so that helped.   The pancakes were amazing and the eggs benedict was good.  It was worth the wait but I doubt I would go again if I have to wait an hour and half again
