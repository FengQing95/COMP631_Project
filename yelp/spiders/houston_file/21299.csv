Uchi////I have never tried sea bream or arctic char before and now I NEED to know where the fish market is that sells this. Not that I could prepare it so well in my wildest dreams. So many plates and tastes and textures - I don't think I had a bad bite. If we could replicate this exact meal again, I would in a heartbeat, but unless we bring in our receipt as a script, I don't see that happening! But we will FOR SURE return.
