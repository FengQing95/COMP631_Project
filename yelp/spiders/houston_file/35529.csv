Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We came here based on a recommendation. The vibe here is amazing. As soon as we walked in the general manager welcomed us and comped us some drinks because we were celebrating our anniversary. I cannot speak on the food but the drinks are great! All the bartenders were friendly and attentive. We will definitely be returning for the drinks and also to try the food.
