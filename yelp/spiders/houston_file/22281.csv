Uchi////MINDBLOWINGLY GOOD. Call ahead and make reservations or risk sitting at the bar for hours drooling at all the plates that walk by. Order the omakase. Go with what the chefs and waitstaff recommend because it will leave you wanting more. The flavors and combinations of items is just one of a kind, and we are so glad we came here. Uchi, we will come back year after year!
