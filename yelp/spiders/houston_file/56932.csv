Kata Robata////Came here for my 22nd birthday & absolutely enjoyed the food. Kata is definitely my favorite sushi restaurant in Houston ! Everything was delicious. This is the place to go for Foie gras nigiri if you love it as much as I do. The duck was my second favorite dish. It's always busy when I go so make sure to make reservations if you can.
