Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I love breakfast food so this was a great selection for me! It's a really nice place with great decor! I started off with the dirty drunken chai and that was delicious! Made my own omelet with pulled pork and spinach. Then finished off with the pancake of the day whihc was stuffed pineapples with coconut and brown sugar and sweet cream, I opted for strawberries instead of the pineapples and they were great! This came with some grits instead of toast, because why not? These grits at the look of it wasn't inviting but the taste was to die for! I finished it!!!
