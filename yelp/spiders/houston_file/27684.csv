The Pit Room////We did a carry for the Superbowl for me and my girlfriend from the Pit.  The lady Adrienne was very helpful explaining the menu at what were their  specialties.  I ordered 1 lb of rips, half lb of beef brisket, a pint of Mac N Cheese, and a pint of Elote, not on cob.  She said it was of season...which is bs.  I went to pick the order total was $43 with tax and I gave a $4 tip.
