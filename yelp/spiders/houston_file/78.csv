The Pit Room////I had Turkey. Jalapeno cheese sausage & Pork ribs, with Okra and Potato Salad as my sides. I cannot complain about anything! it was all amazing, and I cannot wait to go back. The place is clean and family friendly. Â  I am surprised how much I enjoyed this food! My dad has been Barbecuing for over 30 years... I myself love to BBQ and smoke meat and this is by far the best BBQ ive had (other than my dads lol).. Again I HIGHLY recommend coming to this place! we had no wait time, went around 2 pm on a Friday and there was still plenty of food. Only suggestions is if youre going to go on a weekend, go before 2-3 PM to ensure the meat you want is available or simply call ahead. Again, I cannot wait to go back.
