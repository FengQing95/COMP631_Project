Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Everything on the menu is customizable. The service is amazing. The food is delicious. The sweet potato pancakes are my absolute favorite. I've now been to two locations in two different states and was not disappointed! Consistent taste and service from the west cost all the way to Houston.
