Kata Robata////Before the Pink concert, a  friend recommended Kata, since I had never been ( for shame!) so we stopped in around 6, and decided to take advantage of their happy hour menu.  One of the things I did like was that you could sit anywhere in the place and still take advantage of the HH menu, some places you can only sit here, or only sit there which is annoying, especially if the place is packed.  Immediately greeted and sat, and handed all menus.  Lots of drink options for $5, and others for $9, good selection of martinis, specialty drinks, and lots of appetizer options, and rolls.  So far, so good.  More on the happy menu here:
