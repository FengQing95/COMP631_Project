Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Friends have been raving about this place for a while so I finally decided to give it a shot. Drove all the way from Katy to Montrose, but it was well worth it! Don't let the 30 minute or whatever wait scare you, it's worth it. I ordered and omelette and I also ordered the OMG French toast. Omelette was delicious, and all the ingredients were fresh. The French toast was simply heaven on earth. My only drawback was the coffee selection. I ordered a vanilla latte, and my brother ordered an iced coffee, neither was great. Give this place a shot you won't regret it! Will be back very soon.
