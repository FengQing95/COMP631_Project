Local Foods////A lot of pressure gets put on a place and a dish when Food and Wine Magazine says you have the number one dish in Houston. I was expecting to bite into pure heaven with that statement but was sadly let down. I don't believe that was Local Foods fault, it was just hyped up by the bold statement from Food & Wine. Don't get me wrong, the food was very fresh and tasty, I was just expecting a bit more of a wow factor from the crunchy chicken sandwich.
