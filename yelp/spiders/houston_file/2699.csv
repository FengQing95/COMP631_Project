JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It has been a year since the first time I dined here.Service was a big improvement and I was really enjoy the atmosphere. I had veggies ramen and a togo takoyaki. Still did not like the ramen but the takoyaki. I will think about it next time im looking for a weekend dinner spot in downtown
