Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Disappointed in our experience, not the service but the food. We came here with a group for a few birthdays and everyone's food was meh! The only part we really enjoyed were our starters. Maybe this is more of a bar than a restaurant with great food. Â I picked the place because we had fine before and it was really great! I won't be going back. Cool bar vibe.
