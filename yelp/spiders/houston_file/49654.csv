Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is hands down my favorite breakfast/brunch place in Houston. The only reason I was tempted to give anything less than 5 stars is the wait on weekends (1-2hrs). During week days there is usually very minimal wait. They do have a self serve coffee machine, so you can put your name in and grab some caffeine while you wait. They also have plenty of games to entertain yourself with, or order a cocktail at the bar to enjoy. Just know going in on a weekend it will always be over an hour until you are seated.
