The Pit Room////Awesome bbq joint in the museum district! Had the brisket, venison sausage, and turkey and they were all great! Mac and cheese and potato salad made for great side dishes. Plenty of parking and indoor and patio seating. Highly recommend to anyone looking for good bbq without a ridiculous wait!
