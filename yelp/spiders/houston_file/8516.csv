JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I came in on a Thursday night with my husband and kids, and as I walk into the restaurant, I am not even paid attention to by the host. But I don't mind that, the only thing is that this girl is on her phone, not even trying to hide it. The other hostess walked back up and greeted me with a warm smile, I guess making up for the other hostess. She walks me to my table and I immediately notice the modern and hip vibe to this restaurant. I asked what they were yelling when they walked me in, I guess it was just a greeting in Japanese. The hostess was also kind enough to walk me through the menu which was helpful.
