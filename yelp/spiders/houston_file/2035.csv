JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great ramen and fast service. Much better ramen than some others in town. I usually get the tonkatsu black. I also prefer the thin noodles over the thick ones. But that is just me. Would be nice if they expanded the menu a bit more. I have some friends that do not like ramen and they have a hard time finding other stuff to eat. but they still go so the must find something good here. lol
