Local Foods////I had the spicy Szechuan tofu salad and my bf had the falafel sandwich with sides of kale and beets. Both were delicious. The salad was easily big enough for 3 portions but was delicious, healthy, and really high in fiber. The falafel, beets, and kale were also delicious. Food presentation was lovely. The iced tea was wonderful.
