Uchi////Uchi has taken over the old El Felix space right off Montrose. The exterior, like the Uchi original, is nondescript. In fact, they've maintained the old El Felix signage, and you have to squint closely to make out the chameleon Uchi logo. Going to Uchi (loosely translated to "inside the house" in Japanese) should feel like going to a personal dinner party. (Albeit a dinner party with loud noises and very trendy people.) Reservations are strongly recommended, although Uchi leaves quite a few number of tables for open seating. If you don't have reservations and are coming during peak times, expect to wait an hour plus.
