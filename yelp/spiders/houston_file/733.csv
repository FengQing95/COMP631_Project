JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Gen B. - Thanks for your great review. We are most appreciative of your kind words, especially since you have been around the block when it comes to ramen in Houston. We always suggest adding fresh-pressed garlic to our ramen for that extra punch you mention. But otherwise, I'm beyond pleased you consider us one of your favorites, and we hope to serve you again soon.
