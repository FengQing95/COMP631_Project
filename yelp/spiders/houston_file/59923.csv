Baby Barnaby's////I love the adult version of Barnaby's, so I was very excited to try Baby Barnaby's.  They had water and coffee sitting out for us while we waited, and the wait wasn't long (just 10 - 15 minutes), because we asked for first available.  We ended up outside.  It was way too hot to be eating outside (I'm from the Midwest, can't handle the humidity!), but we did get seated much faster.
