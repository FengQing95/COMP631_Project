Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I'm a big coffee drinker and their House Blend is some of the best ever! Another must get are their Molten Chocolate pancakes! Yaaaaas!! Their hash browns are great too, unlike any I've had. The egg white omelet was a bit too greasy in my opinion, but it's rare to find an omelet that isn't.
