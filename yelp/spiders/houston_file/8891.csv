JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////While this is a franchise, it does not fall into the typical pitfalls of one.  The quality, flavor, and consistency amongst all of the Jinya's, is top notch which is a direct reflection of the hard work by the lead chef and owner that transcends into each and every bowl of ramen.  Given the consistency, when the noodles or broth is off it's easy to spot, which makes it a double edge sword... but let them know if that's the case.  I have learned that the owner takes great pride in his food being great so, "If is it not GREAT. . . REMAKE."
