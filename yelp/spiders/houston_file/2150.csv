JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Best ramen I've ever had. Even on par with NYC standards. It was temperature hot and very spicy (I requested extra spicy). Highly recommend the vegan ramen. Add Brussel sprouts and egg!! Food came out in less than 10 minutes. Every employee seems to be in a good mood and work hard. Waitress was extremely helpful. Cannot say enough good things. We will be back! **Waitress is named Anna by the way! She's great!**
