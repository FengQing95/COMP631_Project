Uchi////I've dined at Uchi during one of their first opening weeks, and had impeccable service and food, as with my experience of Uchi in Austin.  With that in mind, I decided to have my birthday dinner at Uchi in March.  I was absolutely floored by the unprofessionalism of the hostesses and the daily manager who my girlfriend spoke with. Not only did they give her conflicting and incorrect information the three times she called to speak to them to confirm our dinner party reservation, they also did not owe up to their mistakes and try to do us right.  I had planned to have a party of 12 at Uchi. First time we called, we were told that the max capacity that they had at any point was for a table of ten people. Upon further inquiry of their private room that we had seen them have in the back, we were suddenly told that they could accommodate 12. We put our names down, and then called back again a week after since we had not heard anything from the restaurant about a confirmation.  As we had suspected, there were no reservation under our name, so we told them to put our reservation in their system.  We were then suddenly told that we had pay a $175 dollar room fee, and that minimum spend on each guest was $100 (food & wine), which were all fine by us. Also, we were now told that we could have 15 people in the private room. Knowing that we invited 3 more friends. One day before the birthday party we called them again after not hearing back regarding any confirmation.  Suddenly, we were now told that we could not have 15 people at our table, and either had to bring only 12 guests or book the biggest party room that required a $350 room fee. Also, we were told (never told before) that for any party of 12 or more we had to order from a set menu and that we had to sign a contract.  None of this information had been presented to us 3 weeks ago when we made our initial call to book our party.  We asked to speak to the manager to see if they could make an exception this time since they had clearly misinformed and also given us incomplete information at several occasions. No apology from the manager, and instead we were told to uninvite guests or get a bigger room.  We even told the manager that had we known all the stipulations that they gave us ONE day before our party, we would have booked our party at some other establishment or invited less than 12 guests so that we could have picked our own food. We will NEVER try to organize a dinner party here again.  Clearly, just because the restaurant is new and busy, they think that customer service does not apply to them.  We were so disappointed with their unprofessionalism, and called Triniti that was more than gracious to accommodate us with less than 12 hours before our party.  Thanks for nothing, Uchi.
