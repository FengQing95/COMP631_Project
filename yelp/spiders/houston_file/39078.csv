Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////-Cookie Butter Fruity Pepples (4.5/5): OK let me first say THIS IS NOT ON THE MENU. My cousin really wanted to try the "Fruity Pebbles French toast" but they ONLY make that item on Sundays, so if you want this item it's only available on that day because they get their food order shipments in the day of so it's fresh.
