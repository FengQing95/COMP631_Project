JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Now, to be fair, I only ever order the spicy chicken ramen. It's so delicious, that I really don't feel the need to try anything else. The amount of spice is perfect. It doesn't distract from the ramen and isn't excessive at all. The there is also a great amount of toppings so it isn't just a lot of empty broth.
