Uchi////As if these selections weren't enough, Uchi *generously* granted us a few more dishes on the house: Shishito Peppers (flash grilled w/ sea salt sprinkled on top - a nice snack for pepper-lovers) and Peanut Butter Semifreddo (apple-miso sobert atop of block of peanut butter semifreddo - really fun and interesting dessert! My boyfriend loved this.) Thanks Uchi!
