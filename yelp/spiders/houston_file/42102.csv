Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love the atmosphere but find Common Bond to be over-priced for their bakery.  The food menu is actually really good and the price is reasonable.  My tab for an assortment of macaroons, regular croissant, chocolate croissant, egg salad sandwich, crab chile relleno, kugelhopf, Kouignan Amman, and fruit croissant came to about $68.00 plus tip.
