Uchi////So before I even came to visit for Christmas, we mapped out when we could fit in an Uchi trip, and it seemed that my last meal before heading to the airport was the best match. We attempted to make a reservation a few days in advance, but there were none to be had, so we just showed up at 5:10, hoping to score one of the walk-in tables, or a seat at the bar. Nope.
