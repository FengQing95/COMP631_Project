Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We came in from out of town and wanted a place with great food.  The wood and brick combination created a dark intimate atmosphere and ambiance.  The whiskey room is a site to see.  Their fried apple pie is one of the best apple desserts I ever ate. We loaded up on appetizers and enjoyed every one.  The beef short rip with au gratin potatoes was awesome.
