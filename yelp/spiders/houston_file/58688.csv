Baby Barnaby's////This restaurant was very bohemian. There was a wait and not knowing the local custom spent a minute looking for a hostess before a waiter told me just to sign myself in on a clip board hanging on the wall. Okay fine not a problem. While i was waiting there was a serve yourself coffee station. Pretty cool. There was a sign "coffee is not complimentary take your cup to the table" aw man, minus one. The waitress called us, and recruited my assistance in putting two tables together to accommodate our party of six..... Okay I guess. The service after that was pretty on point, and the standard breakfast/brunch fare was very fresh and well executed. The oj was fresh squeezed. I would absolutely eat there again. Just don't expect some five star attraction or anything.
