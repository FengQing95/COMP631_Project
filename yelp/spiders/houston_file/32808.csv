Local Foods////The menu was creative, the turnaround was reasonably quick for lunch. I had the salt + pepper roast beef. They slipped curry into it - I really hate curry- so that did not help. I guess it did say curried cauliflower on the menu, but i missed that part. I wasn't expecting curry in a roast beef sandwich.
