JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I found the noodles of the Tonkotsu Black to be nicely al dente and the broth had a consistent flavor without a watery finish.  The egg was delivered in the ramen as opposed to separate and cold like at other places.  The list of add-ons was long (and would be perfect if they offered spicy cod roe) with free fresh garlic as one of the options.
