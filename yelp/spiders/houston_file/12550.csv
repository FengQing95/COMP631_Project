JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Chris - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry you disagree with our pricing. In the restaurant industry, every single item comes into play in terms of covering costs and generating enough profit to maintain our businesses and to promote growth. We regret that our servers may have neglected to charge you for items such as Spicy Sauce. For the record, the only ramen bowls that allow customers to adjust the spiciness without an upcharge are the Tonkotsu Spicy and Spicy Chicken Ramen. All other ramen bowls do require an upcharge if you would like to make the broth spicy.
