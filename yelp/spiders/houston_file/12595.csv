JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Beware of the wait times here though.  They are incredibly unpredictable.  Sometimes you get seated right away; sometimes it's an hour wait. Also, the waiting area is small, and parking is limited as it shares a garage with a 24 hour fitness.  If you are short on time, go down the street to Ramen Tatsuya instead.
