Baby Barnaby's////This is my go-to breakfast place in Houston. I come here probably 2-3 times per month. Baby Barnaby's is in the heart of Montrose, is small, but has a ton of personality. The staff greets guests by first name, is very friendly, and goes the extra yard. The food here is . Quality, wholesome ingredients that will fill you up. I typically get the breakfast plate with eggs, potatoes, bacon and wheat toast. If you are visiting Houston, Barnaby's breakfast is a must. Especially Baby Barnaby's. 5/5 on this one.
