Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The ambience was nice for casual self service brunch and coffee .  The food was good, the cake and bakery section was great.  I Have the strawberry shortcakes at the restaurant, it was great.  And I ordered to go for my friends : chocolate chip , white chocolate butter cookies , and  a Boston cream kind of like upside down muffin ( forgot the name).  They said those bakeries were great also.
