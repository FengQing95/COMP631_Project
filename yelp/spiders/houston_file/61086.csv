Baby Barnaby's////Came on a Sunday for brunch and the place is extremely crowded. We brought our four legged family member so we had to wait for an outside table. The only issue we had with the restaurant is that they skipped us on the list multiple times for outside seating. After an hour wait the remaining experience was good. Service was prompt, they brought some water for our dog, the food was good and it's reasonably priced. We will probably be back but will make sure we bring it to the restaurants attention before waiting that long. All in all, a great way to hang out with your family and dog for breakfast or brunch.
