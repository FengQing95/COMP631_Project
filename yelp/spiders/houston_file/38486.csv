Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////It's was my first time here on a Friday afternoon after work. Met some friends here for their happy hour (yes they have happy hour on a Friday afternoon) and it wasn't too crowded. For the location, the happy hour is amazing. Get the Short Rib Grilled Cheese for only $6.00. Our waiter Rustyn got our drinks and food ASAP and I mean we got our rounds with a couple minutes of ordering. Will be back!!!!
