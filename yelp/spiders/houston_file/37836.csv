Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////As for food, I got the old faithful breakfast plate. Which was a regular breakfast plate. The bacon was a perfect crisp. My eggs were prepared just right. The hasbrown was a little over cooked and my toast was WAY over buttered and cold. My guy got the meatloaf which was amazing. Really just melted away in your mouth. No complaints on that one. Got the red velvet churros since as well. Disappointed with those. Although they came out hot, they were mediocre.
