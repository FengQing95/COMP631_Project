Kata Robata////The food is decent, there are a few things that are good and others that are mediocre. But what gets me the most is the service. The servers have been great, slow sometimes but good. It's the front desk- the hostesses. They are terrible. They have a terrible attitude, almost like they are too good to help you. And if you ever call in- good luck. They don't want to take any take out orders, put you on hold, hang up without apologies after, and rush you to place an order online when the system isn't even working. I'm over the hype. I won't be coming back.
