Kata Robata////Kata Robata is my absolute favorite place to eat sushi in Houston. Now I've been to almost every sushi restaurant in Houston and this one tops off as the #1. First off, the environment is great. Everything in there is filled with modern furniture and happy faces. The tables, seats, plates, glasses and utensils were all spotless. Secondly, the service is great. The waiters are well mannered and the food comes out in a well orderly pace. They take absolute care of you, just like your their family. And the most important part, the FOOD!!! First of all their starters are amazing. I would highly recommend the 72 hour Kobe beef skewers or the bone marrow. If you're a cheese lover then get the lobster mac and cheese. The Kobe beef literally melts in your mouth with a an exploding sensational flavor. There is 2 skewers with 2 large cube pieces of beef on each. It also comes with green sauce which I highly recommend dipping in. The bone marrow comes in 3 very large bones cut in half. Inside is filled with fat awesomeness and you have crispy bread pieces to accompany the marrow. Although these are pretty pricy for starters, they are definitely worth it. Other starters that I recommend are the yellow tail collar, ahi tuna, or you can ask the waiter for the specials they have that day. Next up is the sushi. The fish is extremely fresh and is combined with an even temperature of rice. The seaweed is nice but not that much of an concern. I highly recommend getting the foi gras, spicy chopped scallops, and uni. Those are my go to favorites. I also love to end with a nice bowl of ramen. The smell of it permeates through the restaurant with a nice homemade broth. As I said this restaurant is amazing and I would highly recommend you going to here.
