Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////omg I loved this place! It absolutely lived up to the hype of the reviews. We got a carafe of mimosas and it was the perfect amount for my boyfriend and I. We also tried to Breakfast In Bed Shot. It was delicious and I'm not much of a shot person. My boyfriend got the meatloaf and it was delicious. I got the brisket chilaquiles and I highly recommend the egg on top. Everything was so delicious. Our server was great and very honest with recommendations. They had a DJ which made the atmosphere unique and fun. I definitely want to go back!
