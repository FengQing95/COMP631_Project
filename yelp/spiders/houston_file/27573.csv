The Pit Room////5 stars for the food, 6 stars for the fantastic staff. Most helpful and friendly people at a bbq place that I've been to (other than a food truck once). The bourbon coffee sauce it to die for. And the moist brisket is better than the lean but both are great. And the original sauce is great too. I will be back.
