Local Foods////Fresh, organic and delicious food. I love that I can find gluten free options even for dessert!. The ambience is great. I can make many combinations with the menu between salads, sandwiches and the wraps. The sides are yummy and they have plenty of options. My favorite is the pork and the chicken gluten free wrap with kale and quinoa salads.
