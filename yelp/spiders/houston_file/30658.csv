The Pit Room////We tried the Pit Room on a recommendation of an acquaintance. The atmosphere is super cute and cozy. The staff was super friendly and helpful. As well as the food was AMAZING! the pulled pork was tender and moist. The dipping sauce was tangy and flavorful. Â The sides were delish. They were out of the brisket and pork ribs. Next time we'll be sure to come earlier so we can try them.
