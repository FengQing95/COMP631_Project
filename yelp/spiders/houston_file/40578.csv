Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I came here recently (during covid) around lunch time and it wasn't super packed, but thankfully other patrons were still there giving their business! On a beautiful day, this space is stunning as the natural light comes into the building in droves. I sat at the bar, and was able to sit down and order immediately from the bartender (full menu). He was kind, quick, and the bar (entire space really) was super clean - a plus during the pandemic.
