Baby Barnaby's////Yeah there is always a waiting list but it is definitely worth the wait... I love their signature dish, green eggs as well as several other choices on the menu (migas, waffle...). Their service is great. They are very friendly and quick. We took several out of town guests to Baby Barnaby's and they all loved it! Their OJ or grapefruit juice is made to order, coffee tastes good! They are dog friendly for the outside portion. Definitely a Montrose staple.
