Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////After biting into the Chile Verde Benny and grits, I looked to the sky and saw the heavens open up and the sun beamed down on my face. These are seriously the best grits I've ever had, and I loved this spin on a benedict. My friend enjoyed the Juan's Breakfast Tacos. Our inner fat girls led us to share the pancake combo, and they were not disappointed. Favorites were the Pineapple Upside Down Pancake and pancake of the day (buttercake almond). The Blueberry Danish pancake was good too, but had a bit too much cream cheese concentrated in the center for me. All this was washed down with Mojo Mojitos. I'm a mojito snob so I rate theirs 3.5 stars-it could be improved. I will definitely come back every time I'm visiting Houston.
