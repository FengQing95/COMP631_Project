Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Sometimes you just crave pancakes.  This place offers a delectable mix of pancake options, including my personal favorite Sweet Potato.  Finally a spot in Houston that matches the best of the breakfast eateries in other cities.  Worth the wait (or get up early . . . they'll be open.)
