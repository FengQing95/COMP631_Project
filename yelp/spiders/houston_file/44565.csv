Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is the best! I live for their soft scramble it is so good ! I come here as often as I can ( mind you I live in Katy ) but I don't mind driving 45 mins because their customer service is always stellar! Also their lavender lattes are awesome ( hot or iced)
