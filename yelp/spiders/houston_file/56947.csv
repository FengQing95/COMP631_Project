Kata Robata////Closest you'll get to a Nobu's in Houston if you're looking for creatively prepared and fresh Japanese.  From what I know the chef studied at a top cooking school in Japan, so pretty legit in all aspects.  Lobster mac and cheese is a must.  Yes, strange in a Japanese restaurant, but its one of the best intown.
