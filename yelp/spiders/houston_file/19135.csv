Uchi////But Uchi in Houston is nothing to shake a stick at. We started with some sushi, and it was subpar. My Ikura wasn't bursting with the sea, and my friend's uni was "alright." The oysters with shallots and lemon(?) oil were divine, however. There was a chewy potato-like texture with the tang of acid and the brine of the sea.
