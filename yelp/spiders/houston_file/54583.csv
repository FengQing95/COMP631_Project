Kata Robata////This is a top contender for being my favorite sushi restaurant in Houston! I have dined here 3 times and I have never been disappointed. The ambiance is beautiful and upscale and the chefs make sure that the plating matches. The nigiri always has warm rice and proportionate fish to match. Kata's uni is always well above par. I have tried the uni and duck chawanmushi and each are superb. The bone marrow is also cooked low and slow- perfection. Kata is a great place when you're craving not only sushi, but well paired delicacies. Dining here is a true treat!
