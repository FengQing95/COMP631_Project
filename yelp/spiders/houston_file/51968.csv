Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I love to try different breakfast spots, mostly because I'm not a fan of breakfast style food , I like more of a brunch . This was a good spot for sure. I had the tostada tacos. And a singular pancake. The pancake was ok but the eggs were really good. My kid had some good hashies too.The negative is that the location in montrose area has terrible parking options. I will probably not come back to this onw
