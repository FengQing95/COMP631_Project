Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This is more a bar than restaurant. The food choices are limited and the music is pretty loud. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're there for the drinks. They seemed to have a pretty wide variety. Â What we ordered was pricey but tasty. Parking was easy as it's a strip. Maybe there are more weekday food options.
