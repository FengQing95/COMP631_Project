Uchi////Highly recommend! I was in town visiting from Dallas and my best friend brought me here. We arrived 15 minutes before opening on a Saturday evening and lined up outside. After they opened the doors, we we're greeted with a bite of a complimentary veggie roll and a watermelon beverage - SO good! We were seated promptly and ordered drinks and food from the happy hour menu. We did order the brussel sprouts off the the regular menu and they were amazing!!! Our server was Ryan and he was exceptional! Everyone on the staff was very friendly and knowledgable. Ryan overheard us talking about how much we loved the brussel sprouts that he gave us the recipe!! Had a wonderful time and great experience! Uchi Houston exceeded all of my expectations and more. I will definitely be back!
