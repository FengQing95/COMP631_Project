Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The entire cocktail and food menu looked tasty but I decided on the chilaquiles Benedict and a mimosa and my friend chose the pancake flight with the bacon vodka Bloody Mary. Both my mimosa and the Benedict were delicious! The Benedict had perfectly poached eggs and poblano hollandaise over flavorful barbacoa and crispy hash browns on the side. The pancakes were super fluffy and topped and filled with all kinds of deliciousness. We both loved our entrees and finished everything!
