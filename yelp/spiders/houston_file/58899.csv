Baby Barnaby's////One of the coolest touches the serve-yourself coffee waiting for you if there is a little bit of a wait to get in (almost always...).  It's all honor system, so be good.  Really mild coffee but enough bold body to awaken your inner hung-over/sleep deprived/still sleeping self.  There are some garden tables and chairs out front if you're lucky enough to snag them while waiting.
