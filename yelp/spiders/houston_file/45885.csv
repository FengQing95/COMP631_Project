Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love the lavender latte when it's cold enough in Houston for me to want hot coffee. In the summer months, I stick with an iced decaf americano...one of my favorite in the city! When you first walk in, you are routed past the pastries, and it's hard to pick just one! They all look so fresh and perfect in the display cases. I've tried the health nut scone and blueberry muffin. My favorite brunch item is the bacon and eggs flatbread. I've tried the duck tartine, which was good, but I would probably not order it again. The egg on a roll is also very good. I've also gotten a loaf of sourdough bread, which was also delicious.
