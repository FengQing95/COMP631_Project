Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Service was great. Everyone was very nice and refilled our drinks and cleaned plates off table when not needed. Appetizers were great, hot Nashville chicken dip with chips were my favorite. The pork belly poutine was really good, I found out you can add fried egg to everything but it was too late. We also got the cornbread madeleines which was perfect. I got the chicken with dirty rice. Chicken was moist and perfectly cooked. Rice was too salty for me. My coworkers got the pulled pork sandwich and both liked it as well.
