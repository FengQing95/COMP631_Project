Kata Robata////I love the fact that Kata Robata has happy hour everyday, Mon-Sat, 5pm to 6:30, and Sun 12pm to 5pm! My favorite hh dishes are the 1) spicy salmon roll- these fat rolls (in the best sense of the word!) are generously filled with sumptuous spicy salmon, and 2) fresh catch ceviche- fresh, citrusy, pretty, perfectly plated thinly sliced pieces of fish served with crunchy taros, gosh it took a lot of power for me to let my companion have the last piece. Happy sigh. :)
