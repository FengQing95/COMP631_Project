JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've only tried one other ramen place in Houston and this one is the better one. The place isn't huge and the seats are cozy but the food is definitely worth it. I got the tonkotsu black. I was grateful it wasn't greasy like I had before at Ramen Jin but the broth was a tad bland. I used the spicy sauce to add a bit of flavor to it. The noodles were very good. I also got the crispy chicken and salad which was very good. They were very busy so that's a good sign. I would definitely recommend it!
