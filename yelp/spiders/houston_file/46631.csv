Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I always find something wrong with even the most perfect place so following this tradition,  I would like Common Bond to serve a better variety of cold drinks. I want regular coke maybe a couple of other American staples. Then Again you might say wait a sec weren't you just raving about how this place didn't feel like America? Touché!
