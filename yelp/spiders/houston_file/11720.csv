JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////If Ramen Ichi didn't exist I would go here consistently for the ramen but it has been outclassed. For some reason, their soups do not reach a depth of flavor in more "Japanese oriented". From my research and personal experience it is because to achieve this complex and deep flavor in the broth it takes quite a significant effort to achieve this by slow simmering pork bones and other ingredients, and Jinya just doesn't have it. Even though their website says so.
