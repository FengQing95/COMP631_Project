Uchi////The only reason this loses a star is the poor pacing of our meal.  Part of the reason one eats out at a place like Uchi is to lose oneself in the theatre of it all.  To linger; to forget, to rest for an hour or two along the edge of the haze of too much food and too much drink.  We were pretty unceremoniously rushed along, and plopped out back into the workaday world.  We even asked to be slowed down, and it didn't work.
