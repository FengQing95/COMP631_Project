The Pit Room////Our son grew up in Texas and now lives in London. "Where would you like to eat?" we asked him when he visited recently. "I miss barbecue" was his answer. So we took him to the Pit Room. Â The four of us had the Feast for Six. We demolished it. Really good Texas barbecue is really good - and the Pit Room barbecue may be the best of all.
