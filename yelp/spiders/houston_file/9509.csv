JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is my go to place for ramen! I always get the spicy vegan ramen and it's the best. If you're a garlic lover, they even give you fresh crushed garlic to put into your ramen. This place is packed during the winter so try to get in early. They have bar seating that is first come first serve.
