Baby Barnaby's////Quick, fresh, affordable, and most importantly delicious. Not too many spots in town have all of the above going for them on a regular basis. But breakfast at any of the barnaby's is delicious though baby barnaby's is by far my fav for a morning stop in. The others all serve delicious meals the rest of the day though and I am sure their breakfast offerings are equally as tasty.
