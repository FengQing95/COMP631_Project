The Pit Room////We are not sure what has happened lately but the food quality the last three times we have eaten here is not very good. The brisket does not have much flavor or smoke ring and has more of a roast beef qualty now. We needed sauce just to eat it. The ribs were even worse. They were so tough and overcooked that they were almost uneatable. The staff is just as nice now as when they opened so they are not the problem. It's the food,plain and simple. Probably our last time to ever eat there.
