Uchi////The bartender's name was Nathan and he did an awesome job taking care of us and recommending great dishes. I highly recommend trying it out and seeing why this place has such great rating with so many reviewers. I didn't even feel like eating sushi tonight, but decided to eat here mainly because of the ratings. Glad I came here and I'll definitely be back soon especially since I live so close. 5 stars, A+++, 2 thumbs up, etc.... Try it and you won't regret it....just make sure you have a few bucks saved up. ; )
