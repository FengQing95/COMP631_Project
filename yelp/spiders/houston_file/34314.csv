Local Foods////I have been to two Local Foods locations and both were very good. This time I got the Garden Sammie turned into a salad with shrimp. It was such a good combination of flavors. The roasted brussels sprouts were a bit oily for my liking, so I just didn't eat them. No big deal. One thing that I have noticed about all of my Local Foods experiences is that the employees are so NICE. They really look like they are genuinely listening to what you have to say and see you as a real person, not just as the next order number. I love this place!
