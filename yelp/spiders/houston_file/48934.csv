Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////That being said, I'm generally not a fan of waiting, and sometimes, the wait at Snooze can be past 30 minutes at busy times. Personally, that isn't worth it to me, despite them giving out complimentary coffee, but if you don't mind waiting and chatting with a friend, then Snooze will not disappoint.
