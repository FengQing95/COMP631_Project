JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I came to eat at JINYA the first time earlier this week. It was a drizzly day and I thought it would be perfect to get a bowl of Ramen. I came with a friend and we both started our meal with the pork bun. It was nice and delicate and porky and flavorful all at the same time. It definitely beats Fat Bao's pork bun which is usually too wet/saucy and tears the bun apart.
