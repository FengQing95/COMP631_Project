Local Foods////Immediately when you walk in, you can tell this place is a current hot spot because it's packed! Great sign right? The place is casual and has a nice warm (and green!) feel to it. I dig it. There isn't a waitstaff so you'll have to order at the counter top and then find a seat. But I would suggest having someone in your party find a seat first before ordering since finding a table is like finding gold. They also have a nice patio out back!
