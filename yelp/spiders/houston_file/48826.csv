Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great food and atmosphere, but the hour wait for table and hour wait for food makes it not a desirable weekend brunch location. It may be better on weekdays or earlier in the A.M. The food is awesome. They have a pancake flight which you can get French toast on. All the pancakes and French toasts we had were better than your average brunch spot, but were very sweet. The Corned Beef Hash was great really hit the spot. Overall not excessively expensive, but more expensive than IHOP. I would go back , but at a less busy time.
