Kata Robata////The special sushi rolls are large, fresh, delicious, and I am convinced they lace their tempura batter with crack.  But the star of the meal is the lobster mac n cheese.  OH. MY. GOODNESS.  Dishes like that should not exist, it was that sinful.  They could at least put a warning next to it on the menu:  ***ATTENTION FEMALES: DO NOT CONSUME DURING BIKINI SEASON, OR EVER***  (I'm lucky that calories don't count on your birthday).
