Baby Barnaby's////We were visiting Houston and we needed a nice, local feeling spot to try before we hit the road. This place DELIVERED! Such good food, we had wings and waffles and the wings were fantastic. The waffles were also delicious, but I really loved how charming the small area was. It had some outdoor seating and an intimate, cozy area that feels like a diner inside. The manager on that day was great, he made sure he checked on us frequently, was helpful and had some southern humor to match. Would recommend!
