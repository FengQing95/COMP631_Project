Baby Barnaby's////The eggs and potatoes were fantastic. The eggs were fresh, and the potatoes were crispy and not at all greasy. The biscuits were crumbly and slightly sweet, and the toast hit the spot for me. The fruit cups were filled with fresh pineapple, grapes, and various melons, and it was all delicious.
