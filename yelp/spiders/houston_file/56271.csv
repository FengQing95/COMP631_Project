Kata Robata////I've been here way too many times. Every time I come here w a friend, all the dishes are great. I love the lobster and truffle Mac n cheese, even though I don't eat Mac n cheese, it's one of my favorite dishes. The cold noodles and duck breast is so delicious! My favorite cocktail from here is 99 problems... it's great if you like bourbon! Sunrise rolls are to die for.
