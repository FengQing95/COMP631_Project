Uchi////Tonight was the second time my boyfriend and I stopped by Uchi for dinner. And I have to say today was probably even better than the first time we came. We had a seasonal cold appetizer. It was tuna and watermelon and it was delicious. The best thing about Uchi for me is how they combine all sorts of flavors. I love the fruit combinations because of how light the dish ends up being. The Bacon Steakie was also delicious. We then got multiple different sashimi and a roll. For dessert we got a strawberry shortcake inspired dish and then the (seasonal?) cantaloupe dessert. Oh my god it was delicious. If it came in a pint I would buy it in a heart beat. Service as usual was very spot on. I definitely recommend Uchi for anyone stopping through Houston.
