Kata Robata////All in all, while competent, the food was spare and overpriced.   There just wasn't anything here that wowed.  Even the much touted lobster mac and cheese, cooked with elbow noodles instead of the orzo rice Azumu mistakenly uses, lacked sauce and taste.  It was a huge letdown.  The waiter insisted it should end our meal for some reason, and brought it a good 20 minutes after our rolls were finished.  Frankly, we wanted to cancel it, but it arrived just before we could.
