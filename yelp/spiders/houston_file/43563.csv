Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I never write reviews, but their blueberry peach fritter deserves all five stars. It's my favorite pastry ever!! If you're staring at the pastries stuck on which one to choose, trust me the fritter will not disappoint ! Try heating it up for a magical explosion in your mouth
