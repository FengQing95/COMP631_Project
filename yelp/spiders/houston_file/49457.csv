Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////One time for the Breakfast Pot Pie! I'm a pot-pie lover and was extremely excited to try this. It didn't disappoint, although I would appreciate a thicker crust and bit more filling. My SO got the seasonal Hot Cocoa pancakes and those were also good (and HUGE). Our meal was very good and service was also good, but just know there is probably no time of day that you can come here and not have to wait. We came closer to closing and still had to wait 45 minutes! The great thing is that they will take your number and text you when your table's ready so you can sit in the car or handle errands while you wait!
