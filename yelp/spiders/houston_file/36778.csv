Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The atmosphere of this place is very nice, very industrial looking and the whole vibe is on point. My complaints are with the service here and the food I guess what not something I can say is unforgettable. The drinks were ok but again overpriced for what you get, the same goes with the food. Our server was nice but most of the time he was NO where to be found. We kept having to flag him down to ask him to order appetizers, then the same with our actual food. It took forever. It was like he was waiting on all the other tables but ours. I know he was busy, maybe this place needs more servers, I don't know what the issue is but I hope they get it together. This place has potential. Â I'm not sure if the waiter just thought they were automatically adding gratuity to our bill so he would just check on us when he felt like it because his tip wouldn't be impacted. If that wasn't the case, it sure felt like it. I really wanted to like this place!
