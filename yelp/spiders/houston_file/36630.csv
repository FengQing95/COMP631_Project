Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We went to Bosscat for the first time for their NYE fix prix menu. Pros: The food and drinks were good. Cons: The service was rushed, and the food was just ok for the price. Would have liked to enjoy the experience more rather than being rushed through drinks and courses so that they could turn over tables as quickly as possible.
