JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Two pieces of meat, 1 egg, some seaweed, and a lot of noodles. That's the white tonkotsu (pork), priced at $11.89, in a nutshell. I was disappointed in how little meat I got. I'm giving this place 3 stars for the 3 things they put in my bowl: 2 pieces of meat and 1 egg. The chicken ramen has 3 pieces of meat. I waited 40 min and only got 2 pieces of meat. I know the restaurant is trying to save money by skimping out on putting meat in the ramen, but with Chinatown being so close, they have no excuse. They could've given me another egg or more vegetables to compensate, but all they did was add more noodles.
