Uchi////For the rolls, we got all the ones they were offering. Shag (tempura fried roll), spicy tuna, and the ham & eggs. I am biased... I love all things tempura fried so the shag was great for me. I'd never seen pieces of sushi done this way so it was a nice change of pace. The spicy tuna was surprisingly my favorite. Light and tasty. And then the ham & eggs.. You might wanna order this before ordering other rolls because its heavier since it has large pieces of meat in them. There's no egg in them, the sauce on the side is supposed to be a play on the egg part of it. So if you're not big on raw fish this is probably for you.
