Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My first time hear and the food and drinks were excellent! I had the Hot Turkey Brown and it was delicious! Then we sat at the bar after dinner. Layton is one of a kind of a bartender. If you want yummy unique cocktails go to Layton! He even surprised us with a yummy red velvet churros for desert and it was amazing! We also got a tour of the whiskey room and it is a beautiful room. We will be back again soon! Great place and friendly staff!
