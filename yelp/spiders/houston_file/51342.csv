Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The Wait: It's long. Especially on the weekend. I think the shortest I've waited is 45 minutes. You give then your name and cell phone number, then they text you when your table in ready. A couple times, I've noticed my table is not ready when they text, and I've had to wait another 10 minutes or so.
