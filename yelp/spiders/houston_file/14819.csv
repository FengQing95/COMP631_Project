JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jai - We thank you for your excellent review, and we appreciate your business. I regret your server made the mistake of not advising you of the kitchen closing. We have had some new staff start recently, and we will use your feedback as a teachable moment. Thank you for you understanding, and we hope you'll come back through again soon!
