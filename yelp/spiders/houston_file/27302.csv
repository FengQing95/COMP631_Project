The Pit Room////After finding this place from YELP, decided to check it out based on all the delicious looking pictures and great reviews that were shared. I checked out this place on a Saturday and it was surprisingly not packed...was able to find a parking in their lot and even was serviced right away. The ambiance is comfortable and the workers are very friendly and nice. During this visit, ordered the jalapeno and cheese sausage, pork ribs, beef ribs, and chicken. The sides ordered were mac n cheese, cole slaw, potato salad, and bbq beans. Overall the food was great.....what stood out the most is the beef ribs and pulled pork, BUT I live close to Pearland and probably will not make this drive again. From one bbq feen to another ..it's definitely worth checking out once if anyone is curious about it, but I probably won't be checking out again unless I'm in the area.
