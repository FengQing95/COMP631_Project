JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is hands down my favorite place in Houston. Their Ramen will have you hooked for life. When I eat Ramen from other places I don't really tend to drink the juice because the flavors are off but at Jinya the flavors are so good I want to lick the bowl when I'm done. If you can't tell I recommend this place 100% actually 1000%. They have options from meat eater to vegetarian to vegan it's great!
