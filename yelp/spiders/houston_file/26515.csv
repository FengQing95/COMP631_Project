The Pit Room////If you are new in town and not sure which bbq place to start with. The pit room is a good place to get a taste of Texas bbq. I had the ribs, tacos, and 2 sides. The ribs was pretty good, nice smoky flavor and the meat is very soft. I love the taco with shredded pork, add a little lime, spicy sauce and you are good to go
