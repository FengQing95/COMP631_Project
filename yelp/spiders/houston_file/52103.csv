Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Covid procedures in place. I called to see if I can have my name put on the list and was told it was first come first serve. Then I stand in line only to find out yu still have to go inside to put your name on the list. The Yelp waitlist link didn't work. Then other ppl walked straight up and put their name on the list before mine. Instructions need to be posted on the door and nearby windows. The sign that's by the door needs to be by the entrance of the side walk. Being that people walked a mile to get to the door when there's no parking. And more than one would help. If I wasn't about to starve to death I would've left. Will update review after I eat.
