JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Freda - Thanks for your review. I'm glad you enjoyed your ramen and found our servers to be friendly, and presumably helpful. Depending on the flow of the day, and the rate at which customers arrive, we try to get the ramen and tapas dishes out as quickly as possible. And, more importantly, we try to ensure everyone's orders are prepared with precision. We appreciate your patience, and we look forward to serving you again soon.
