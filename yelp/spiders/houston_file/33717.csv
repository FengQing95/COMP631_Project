Local Foods////I love this place, I eat here entirely too much my coworkers and I. Their Harvest salad is the BEST salad I've ever had in my life! I absolutely love it and I recommend to any/everybody I know. Everything on their menu is delicious & worth every penny. Staff is always kind and attentive. No complaints here.
