The Pit Room////I had the brisket sandwich with a side of beans. The meat had a lovely smoke ring, and tasted great. I'm not sure the bun was authentic. It was kind of doughy and chewy, and it might have also had eggs in it, not unlike a brioche. But, even if not exactly authentic, it was a nice way to deliver the meat. You want a soft, chewy bun that will get moist from the meat, and that's what this bun did. The beans were also excellent, and the pickle bar was astonishing. My only complaint is that there could have been a little more meat for the price. I paid over $13 for my sandwich and beans (no drink). The atmosphere was nice -- the food comes on a tray with paper on it. And the first two songs I heard were Hank Williams and George Jones numbers. The one funny thing is that this place serves cold brewed coffee. I actually asked about it, and one of the people working there said it was a concession to Montrose. Coffee or not, overall, this is a good joint if you need a BBQ fix.
