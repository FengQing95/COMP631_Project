JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Updated: Hands down best ramen. Wait times suck, but that's not their fault. (Just go at a non peak time) After eating here, I've trie going other places and just get disappointed. So I'll just stop going elsewhere. Pricy for ramen, but again, the taste of the food trumps everything! Their servers are consistent and awesome too, I love that about this place.
