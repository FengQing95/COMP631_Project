Baby Barnaby's////This is probably my favorite breakfast spot in Houston. The green eggs and migas are excellent, as is the regular breakfast. I love going to this place and eating outside on the patio in the middle of Montrose. I've never been there for any meal other than breakfast so I can't comment on anything else, but the breakfast is good!
