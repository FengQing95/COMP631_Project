Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////As far as the food and service is concerned, you get nothing but praise from me. Those pineapple upside-down pancakes are excellent. I also like building my own omelettes. The coffee is decent as well. The different hot sauces they provide are a nice touch, and much better than plain old Tabasco. The hash browns aren't the best, but the chicken sausage makes up for it. Parking can be a pain sometimes as the lot is small. You may find yourself parked on the street around the block.
