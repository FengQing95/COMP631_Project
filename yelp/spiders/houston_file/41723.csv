Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Beautiful pastries, and hands down my favorite chocolate chip cookie, just edging out Tiny Boxwoods. I'm not a huge fan of the atmosphere- it's always packed, and I feel like it has a bit of an elitist/snobby vibe. Also, parking is impossible. I'll take my CCC to-go, but it is totally worth the hassle!
