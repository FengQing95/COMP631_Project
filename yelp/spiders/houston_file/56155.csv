Kata Robata////What is there to say that hasn't already been covered in all the other glowing five star reviews? Excellent fresh sushi, attentive service, one of my favorite sushi spots in Houston. My favorite dishes are the Kobe beef skewers and king crab and uni spoons. Try and stop by on a weeknight when they're not as busy and definitely make a reservation before you go!
