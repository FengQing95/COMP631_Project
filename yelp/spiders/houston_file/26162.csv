The Pit Room////Found this place while exploring the area while I was last in Houston. I tried the pork ribs, chicken, mac & cheese, and elote. The ribs were generous in portion in comparison to many other BBQ places I have visited. The seasonings on the ribs were also very flavorful making them tasty to eat even if you decided not to top off with some sauce. The chicken was also excellently flavored, however the skin seemed to come completely off with just one bite on all pieces making the rest of the chicken having varying amounts of seasoning. In my opinion the sides were smaller in comparison to other places. I found the mac & cheese to be my favorite part of the meal. The cheese sauce was the perfect amount of cheese flavor however it was thin for my taste. I did enjoy that the sauce was not overpowering and I was still able to taste the noodles themselves which were delicious. I was surprised by the elote when I received it. As this place also has tacos I was expecting an authentic Mexican elote that I'm used to. Instead it had none of the toppings and seemed to have been in a sauce cooking for quite sometime. Oddly the corn was dry even though it was dripping in sauce. The sauce had good flavor but overly salty. Next time I would for sure get double mac & cheese for my sides if I'm ever in the area again. I did enjoy the interesting selection of sauces they had near the soda fountain. My favorite was the coffee bourbon. What sounded like an odd combination actually combine to make an enjoyable fun taste pairing my meal.
