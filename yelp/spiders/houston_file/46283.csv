Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Best little bakery in Houston!! Common Bond has the eye candy angle down pat. On our way through town, our family grabbed a number of pastries for our upcoming vacation. Â Every single one was delicious...the pistachio croissant, chocolate chip cookie, Boston cream kugelhopf, and the macarons. I take that back. One of the macarons was stale, and they replaced it for me once I brought it to their attention. I was seriously considering hitting Common Bond on our way back from vacation! Sadly, didn't get to.
