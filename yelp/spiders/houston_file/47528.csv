Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was very good, but the service was not worth the high prices. Our waitress didn't come back after our food was brought to us and i had to get up to find her to ask for the check. While I was waiting for a table, I ordered a drink at the bar and the bartender was very nice and fast.
