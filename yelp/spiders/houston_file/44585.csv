Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We ordered real food too! I had lavender latte (no extra sweetness needed), fried chicken and biscuits (gravy on the side - the man at the register claim it was the most amazing gravy but when you don't like gravy even the most amazing gravy will change your mind..... probably not as good as he thought it was Â - P.S. they didn't put it on the side), and sausage sandwich. The biscuits might have been old from this morning. Would have tasted better without gravy on top. The soft egg was kind of weird with my fried chicken. The idea is weird.... was i suppose to mix mommy (chicken) inside of baby (egg)?
