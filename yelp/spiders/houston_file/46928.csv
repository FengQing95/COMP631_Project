Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place is great. Get there early on a weekend otherwise you will wait for over an hour to get a table. Food is good... not sure if it is worth waiting an hour for though. They have free coffee and water for while you wait. Only weird thing about this is they then charge for coffee once you sit down. So drink up while waiting for your table LOL.
