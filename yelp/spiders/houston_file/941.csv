JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love this place! The ramen options are interesting and tasty, the service and atmosphere are good and all fairly priced. We eat here most weekends now. Wish the parking situation was better (i.e. Would be better with no valet downstairs) but the food is so good I'll go with 5 stars anyway.
