Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Beautiful pastries, beautiful dishes. One of those rare occasions where the presentation is on par with the execution and flavor. The pistachio croissant was beyond ridiculous. So delicious! Also tried beef and grits, chicken and biscuit and lox on toast. Â All yummy. Friendly service, great ambiance but long lines (they go fairly quickly so no worries)
