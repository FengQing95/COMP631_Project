Baby Barnaby's////also a note to large groups.  please don't get all huffy and puffy in your pantaloons when your group is not seated sooner than 30 minutes.  this place is not the Toyota Center when it comes to seating capabilities.  a lot goes into making it work for large groups to be seated.  be willing to be broken up into smaller parties or wait it out....or don't consider this place
