JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Such a fan! I stopped in on a weekend and was greeted and seated promptly. My server made a few suggestions but ultimately I ordered the salmon poke tacos. It's an order of 2, but honestly I could eat 200. Crispy and delicious. I chose the takoyaki balls which were your average takoyaki balls. The real winner of this adventure is the Jinya Tokatsu Black ramen bowl. The broth really kicked it over the top for me. The broth was a bit fatty but soothing and great for a lazy recovery day. I will be back soon.
