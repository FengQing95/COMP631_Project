Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place is a gem and I forsee myself coming here alot in the very near future. Our server was so cool that from the moment he greeted us he offered us a tour to the whiskey room which was so fun. Then he suggested some of the food. My husband got a whiskey flight, which is so cool that they offer that. I got some wine, we tried the wings and the grilled cheese and both were absolutely amazing! This is a winner!
