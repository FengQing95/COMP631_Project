Local Foods////Had very high expectations so was a let down. I ordered a duck confit sandwich. The sandwich was very bland and quite small considering the price and other sandwiches around Houston. Most of the sides are salads. Their bread was very nice though. However the reason this place gets three stars instead of two is their amazing soups. Due to them messing up my order I got two cups instead of one. The lemongrass chicken was delicious and the veggie chilli also had a lot of flavor. That just about saved the day.
