JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I believe that this is one of the best ramen places in Houston if not US. After living in Japan for a year, I have struggled to find ramen places that pleases me. I can definitely say that compared to the other ramen shops that I tried Jinya is the only place with proper tonkotsu ramen. The pork and the egg almost melt in the mouth with the broth. I love to get their ramen with thicker noodle as I feel it has a better texture. The only downfall may be that the appetizers such as takoyaki and gzoya are not too great. But if you are here for ramen, you cannot ask for anything better
