JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm a huge fan of ramen, so I'm glad I tried JINYA. I ordered the vegetarian ramen. It was decent, but nothing special. I was expecting the broth to have a lot of flavor, but this stock just tasted like boiled vegetables and soy sauce- not so tasty. It contained about 4 pieces of cauliflower, 2 pieces of broccoli, small pieces of asparagus, and was garnished with spring mix on the top. All in all, if you want good vegetarian ramen, try a place like Tiger Den or Ramen Tatsuya. The service was great- staff was very friendly. Music wasn't too loud, so that's a plus.
