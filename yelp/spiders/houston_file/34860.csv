Local Foods////Local Foods knows how to make high quality healthy food, without compromising flavor! I got to try their crunchy chicken sandwich, truffled egg salad sandwich, and the chicken posole. Every item was absolutely delicious, with the two sandwiches being the real standouts! The crunchy chicken was just the right balance of sweet and salty. The truffled egg salad was creamy, garlicy, and full of flavor (the truffle flavor was phenomenal). The cherry on top were the fresh baked pretzel buns, which held up nicely and provided just the right wrapping for all of the ingredients. Some of the best sandwiches I've had!!! The posole was fresh and flavorful as well. Very similar to a tortilla soup. Overall, this is a great spot for fresh ingredients, impeccable service, and KILLER sandwiches!!
