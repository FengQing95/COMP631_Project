JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Now to talk about the food. The brussel sprouts tempura I ordered were just okay. I personally like my brussel sprouts roasted longer so it's easier to bite and more of the flavor comes out. I ordered the Garlic Tonkotsu Ramen, which was the chef special they were offering at the time. I was blown away by how much flavor the broth had. Granted, you can never go wrong with garlic. It was so savory without being salty. The noodles are slightly tougher than previous ramen I had but you can definitely taste and feel how fresh they are. My dad, a huge ramen fanatic, has finally found a ramen place that meets his high standards. I cannot wait to come back and try their other flavors.
