Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////every time I've gone here it has smelled like a blend of old fish and cappuccinos. The food usually leaves more to be desired.. the only thing I've ever really enjoyed was the yogurt parfait, but how could you mess that up? their Arnold palmers are good too, that's about it. every time I have walked out the door I have found myself confused as to how this place is so popular.
