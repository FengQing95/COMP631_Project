Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Drinks: EVERYTHING! If you like whiskey even a little it's worth a stop. We did two whiskey flights which proved to be both entertaining and fun for our table. The presentation was nice (custom typed card for your flight) and the selection was of course outstanding. The cocktail selection was pretty diverse. Think vodka drinks with peppers, Moscow mules with rum, drinks with rosemary... just fresh takes on everything. Not a standard "mojito, martini" lineup. I also LOVED the fresh ingredients lining the bar- oranges, lemons, sugar cubes, herbs, all freshly displayed for the bartenders use.
