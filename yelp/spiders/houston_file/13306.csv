JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Craving ramen while on a trip to Houston, came across this place via Yelp. It def filled with people. I think I came on a Thur/Fri can't remember. But we were seated rather fast. The waiter was kinda bearing down on us. Don't you just hate when you sit down, and 2 secs later they want your order? Can I 30secs to peruse the menu s'il vous plait?
