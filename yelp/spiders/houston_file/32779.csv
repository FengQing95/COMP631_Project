Local Foods////After looking over the simple menu with eight sandwich options plus an assortment of salads, I decided to go with the most popular item, the Crunchy Chicken. Nut crusted, served on a pretzel bun and my choice of 2 sides - tuscan kale and house-made chips - had me sold! For 11 bucks, this was my money's worth plus much more. My only gripe was the chips were a bit too salty for my taste and apparently the bottom of the basket as they were mostly crumbs but delicious nevertheless. Also, if you're a fan of lemonade, you must try the "mintade". Orange, lemon, lime, grapefruit juice, mint, a refreshing drink on a hot, Houston day!
