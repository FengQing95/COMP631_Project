The Pit Room////I've been eyeing The Pit Room for the longest time, but never actually took the time to drive out here because in the back of my mind, I always thought that this place would be crazy busy on the weekends (only time I could come out) and considering the location on Richmond, I assumed that parking would be a nightmare. So, when the boss man wanted to do a team lunch during the week, I suggested we go to the Pit Room.
