Uchi////The food though was still very good and I give it a solid 4*.  We ordered 9 dishes and sake and beer for the two of us and we left very satisfied. We got some of our usual, brussel sprouts, machi cure, blue fin toro, foie gras nigirie. Still all amazing, except last night they did not serve our foie gras last, like they always do.  When I asked, they said the kitchen was running behind and they had already seared the foie gras. Had I not asked, they would have not said anything.  Not a huge deal, but the foie gras is pretty amazing, and you kinda want that as the last thing you taste, not a pork rib, kim chi roll, which was kinda ehhh. We also had the A5 Wagyu and though we both agreed it didn't melt in your mouth like the A5 we had in Japan, it was pretty good. For $20 a piece, we'd probably do it again.
