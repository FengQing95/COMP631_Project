Uchi////Normally I would give Uchi 5-starts, but after last night I am downgrading them. I have been several times to the one here and the original in Austin, and our experience is usually great. Yesterday we arrived around 5 to take advantage of their drink specials. There was a line out the door and no one was directing us whether everyone needed to wait or only those without reservations- apparently not everyone had to wait as several people cut in line and went right in. They lost our reservation which was confirmed through the website, but they did seat us, although the tables in the middle are spaced very close together and the wait-staff had to squeeze past several times. We ordered a 10 course tasting menu, after getting the 6 course last time- the oysters and nigiri were okay on average. We did get a couple of really great dishes, but unfortunately they came so fast I wasn't able to get the names or ingredients of most of them. We asked the waitress at the end but she didn't remember either. The staff was courteous but the timing of the dishes was way off. Twice we had three dishes brought to our table at the same time, and we often had long waits between having food on our table. They brought us spoons for the fried rice but they were chilled, so I mistook them for dessert spoons. The fried milk dessert was good, but the flavor of the mouse was too bitter for the rest of the dish. It was good, but not worth the price. I left feeling less satisfied than when I shared the 6-course tasting, which I will probably get next time.
