Kata Robata////10 dishes for ~$170/person. We were full and happy by the end so it was well worth it. The only minor complaint is that it was my birthday and I had mentioned it when making the reservation, but there was no mention of it when we were there. But no worries - still had a GREAT birthday dinner!
