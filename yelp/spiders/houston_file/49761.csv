Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is a perfect blend of a coffee cafe and breakfast Â and brunch lounge. The vibe is absolutely positive, it's refreshing, the staff are all friendly, the service was great and the coffee was perfect! The unique breakfast foods with a twist of healthy ingredients like fruit and some guilty pleasures like chocolate, mascarpone, stuffed French toast, fruit topped pancakes and much more. I opted for a plain pancake and a basic 2 egg breakfast and the pancake was too thick and heavy. I would give it a five star, but pancakes are to be light and fluffy.
