The Pit Room////The best meat here is the beef rib! it's fall off the bone and so tender and juicy and smoky and full of flavor. You don't even need bbq sauce. It was about $15 a pound. Not included in the dinner plate. This place gets packed and it's small so make sure you are patient if you plan on eating there. The sides were good as well. The brisket was really smoky for my taste but but not bad. This is a nice place to come after you've gone exploring the museum district!
