JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We always order the same thing -- Spicy Tonkatsu, spicy, with garlic, butter, and a seasoned egg and takoyaki to start. The takoyaki is the best I've had anywhere, and I love the egg that's at the base. Don't miss out on that! The ramen is absolutely impeccable. There's nothing else to describe it. Pork melts in your mouth, noodles are the perfect firmness, and that broth...ugh. Every bite is heaven all the way through and the egg, after soaking in the soup, is on my list of best things in the world.
