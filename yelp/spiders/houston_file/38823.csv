Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Go here if you want to try small plates and a variety of flavors , yea they have larger meals but I personally think the chef shines on the smaller plates. The drinks here , well , not much stood out to me on the menu so I asked for a boulevardier to be made and 4 min later it arrived and was outstandingly made.
