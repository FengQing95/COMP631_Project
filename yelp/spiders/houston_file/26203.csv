The Pit Room////I probably didn't catch Pit Room on their best day but over all I thought they were good. Had brisket, chicken and sausage. All were good but a little dry. Went late in the day so probably try earlier in the next time. You can see there's some pit skill here but I would put it a tier below Pinkerton's which is a similar style BBG joint.
