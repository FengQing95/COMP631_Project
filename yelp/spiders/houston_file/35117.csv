Local Foods////Went for lunch (before the rush) on Tuesday with co-workers and was enjoying the bahn mi sandwich, which I've ordered a few times before, when suddenly I bit down on something METAL in my sandwich. It was a a 1" bristle from the grill brush! Lucky for me I thoroughly chew my food, because those suckers are dangerous and cause so many injuries every year! At the time, I quietly alerted an employee passing by, but didn't address much as I did not want to ruin lunch for my coworkers or draw too much attention. She was nice, but didn't really seem like she was all too surprised/concerned. The employee kindly offered to refund my meal and get me a new item - at first offering to bring me the SAME THING [ummmm no, and shouldn't you (sadly) be throwing out the loot of (needle) pork?!] - so I picked something else entirely and just got it to-go...she even threw an additional brownie in there.
