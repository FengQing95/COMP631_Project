Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My friends ended up here on a Monday morning for brunch - BEST way to start the week! The three of us arrived at 10 AM and there was only a 10 minute wait (as opposed to the groups of people waiting when we were leaving). We were seated fairly quickly. Our server was knowledgeable about the food but he was MIA for the most of our meal (which was the only downside of the morning but not enough to dock off points). I got the Snooze classic with bacon ... HOLY PIG. Seriously, some of the best bacon I have had. It was a thicker cut but still retained the crispiness. My friend had the Snooze Spuds Deluxe (which was good but I felt like their hashbrown leaves a bitter taste) and the Upside Down Pineapple Pancakes (another AMAZING dish and I don't even like pancakes that much!). My other friend got the Benny Goodman and Bella!Bella!Benny (you can mix two different types of Benedicts). She liked the Bella!Bella! Benny better because it was not as salty. They had a great selection of alcoholic beverages which we didn't try this morning.
