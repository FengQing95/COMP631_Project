Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I was visiting Houston for work and my girlfriend and I found this place on Yelp. It beyond exceeded our expectations. Our server's name was Terry. He was very friendly and knowledgeable. He spaced out our courses perfectly. We will definitely be back the next time we were in Houston. Terry deserves a promotion for sure! Fabulous server, atmosphere and time!!
