Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Ok, this place was line out the door busy and it was suggested by a friend. I totally get why it was so busy. Employees very patient as you peruse the amazing eatable works of art which are so good they are doomed to be devoured in record time which they were. It's their lifecycle, short and sweet. Â We got two macarons terrific, chocolate chip cookie with walnuts easily one of the best I've ever had and easily the best in Houston, an insanely decadent brownie with ganache and Carmel and walnuts sinful but I live in sin, and a croissant which was large and buttery the way they should be. If you can't tell, we will be back!!
