Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////One of my favorite brunch places in Houston! I love it all. Despite the 1+ hours wait, it is always worth it. When seeing the parking lot, I cannot get zoolander's voice out of my head (what is this, a parking lot for ANTS?) but I'll forgive you Snooze for your tasty food and friendly service. It's not your fault you are so popular, I guess. I always find street parking a couple blocks down so no worries.
