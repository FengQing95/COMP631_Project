Kata Robata////The eel on the top of one of my roles was complete mush. It is either old or they store it poorly, but it shouldn't just be sludge. The rolls that were "spicy" had NO kick at all. Now, I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to spice so if I don't think it is spicy then you know something is missing.
