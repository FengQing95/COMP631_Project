Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Not vegan friendly. I tried this place because I read they had vegan options but my order of The Snooze Classic with tofu instead of eggs was a failure. The tofu was straight out of the package, they only managed to crumble it and it had no seasoning or anything added. The soyrizo was good but that's nothing they have to prepare, and the pancakes are tasty but far from vegan. The staff was extremely slow to clear tables and the hour wait although expected for Sunday brunch, could have been significantly reduced if the staff was more motivated to pick up the pace.
