JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////WOW! First time here and it won't be my last. Delicious food. A bit tiny, so you may wait for a table during busy times. Ate there for lunch and enjoyed the chef's special. Service was also good. Located in midtown so parking will be an issue if you can't find parking in the garage.
