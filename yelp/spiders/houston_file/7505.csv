JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Beatweeze - Thank you for the excellent review! We greatly appreciate it. As a default, we bring all of the ramen toppings on the side for two reasons: 1) It cuts down on the number of mistakes (adding wrong toppings to wrong bowls, thus forcing the chefs to remake the order) and 2) It allows customers to share toppings.
