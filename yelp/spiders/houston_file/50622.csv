Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We got there at 8AM on a Saturday, and I was expecting a wait. The hostess told us it would be 20 mins until our table was ready. I was excited, because I honestly was expecting to wait at least 40 mins or more...... Well.... 20 mins passed... then 30..... then 40.... We finally get the text message saying to show up to the hostess stand for our table. We go up there and they say they are cleaning our table off, and then they will seat us. So we wait again.... 20 more minutes pass before we are seated.....20 minutes to clean off our table?
