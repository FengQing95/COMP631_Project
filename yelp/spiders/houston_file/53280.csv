Kata Robata////On other visits, we've encountered more delicious morsels to drool over. The scallop sushi topped with seared foie gras once again tickles my toes into submission. A weird marriage of flavors, but it is utterly scrumptious. Be sure you gobble these morsels up right away because once the seared foie gras cools, it loses a bit of it's melt-in-your-mouth quality. The uni and crab spoons are quite delightful as well. The chef puts bite-sized chunks of king crab with a piece of uni on an Asian soup spoon. The spoonful seems small, but the one bite is an explosion of sweetness from the crab and saltiness from the sea.
