Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////After finding a spot on the street we joined the line inside. We could see a few pastries in the cases but for some reason all of the menus were at the front of the line where people were ordering. Not ideal for those of us trying to decide what to get. I asked a nice lady to pass me one and she did.
