The Pit Room////I was traveling on business and looking for a great BBQ place not too far from Downtown. Found the Pit Room and gave it a try. It definitely did not disappoint. It exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend the brisket tacos, all I can say is WOW! Â I tried a variety including brisket, beef sausage, cajun link (limited special) and brisket taco. All were excellent but I would definitely go with more tacos next time. Thanks Pit Room!
