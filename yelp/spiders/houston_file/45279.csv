Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////On the other hand, Common Bond's pastries are huge and reasonably priced. For just under $4, I order the Pear and Earl Grey Tea Scone, which has a crisp exterior and a dense, cake-like interior. It's only delicately sweet, which makes it a perfect breakfast scone or afternoon snack. Because of its generous size, I often save half for my husband Jamie. Both of us recommend this scone.
