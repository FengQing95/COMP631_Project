Baby Barnaby's////First off I LOVE John!!! He is always so pleasant and the entire staffs customer service is superb. You always feel welcome. I frequent Baby Barnaby's throughout the week not just on the weekends and every time the food is always delicious. The green eggs are awesome! My go is green eggs with bacon, potatoes and the delicious fresh squeezed oj. If your craving a great breakfast in a great atmosphere or you have a a heck of a night and need a pick me from those drinks. This is the place to be.
