Uchi////The best quasi-japanese cuisine that you can have in Houston. I say quasi-japanese because although they serve sushi, the food here is so unique and different than any other sushi places that I've been to. Absolutely have to try this place if you like Japanese food at all. Service is also excellent and I recommend sitting at the sushi bar for the social hour.
