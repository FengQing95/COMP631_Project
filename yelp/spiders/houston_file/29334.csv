The Pit Room////And I started with the elote, the sour cream and queso fresco melting into the roasted corn easily and proving a refreshing start, before the moist brisket melted away as beautifully as Lockhart's classic Black's BBQ, surprising all of us equally with its chile-tinged dry rub that, like everything else, plays upon the Mexican influences beautifully by elevating the intensely salty and smoky edges of the meat. Enough so that my dining companion wondered if her husband might be able to tolerate the heat level, but for my palate, it was just enough to be noticeable without screaming in your face and thus a masterfully crafted surprise that I will always wonder why no one else thought of before. Even the lean brisket was only drier on half a side, nothing sauce couldn't fix up nicely, and even the sauce served the meat well, tomatoey enough to be sweet but not saccharine and overpowering. The pepper-flecked Czech sausage was just dry enough to have the appealing chew that I admire, and I found the lack of greasiness not disturbing. The charred green beans took a steep left turn from the green beans typically found in Southern joints, their blackened centers and edges also struck with a mysterious salty sauce that might include soy sauce and fried shallots and onions, almost Asian style. For some they may be an acquired taste, but they seemed wildly popular among the table and the only issue I might have is the sauce on its own being very intense, as otherwise they were absolutely perfect and a highlight of the meal.
