Kata Robata////No two ways about it, this place is pricey. Yes, paying for ambiance, but at least the food we got was very good. The standouts were the Caribbean roll with lobster, spicy tuna and mango, and the tropical spicy tuna with mango and wasabi vinaigrette. We also tried a Texas hamachi which supposedly had salmon, fried shrimp, yellow tail and eel, but Â the rolls were so tiny I didn't really believe they put all that stuff in there. All I could taste was salmon.
