Baby Barnaby's////Years later, enter Baby Barnaby's Green Eggs dish.  I was sold from the name alone, and I stumbled upon it on accident.  I was picking up my boy's Green eggs breakfast to go on my first trip there since he was running late.  One bite, and I was hooked.  This dish is comprised of four components, eggs scrambled with spinach and artichoke, apple chicken sausage, wheat toast, and crisp breakfast potatoes.  The eggs are slightly gooier than I usually prefer, but I think in this case, it makes them even better!  Spoon some of it onto the wheat toast, and Denny's and IHOP will be pushed to the back of your mind forever.  I usually salt my eggs, but it is not necessary for these eggs already have great flavor and a wonderful richness to them. The chicken apple sausage is delicious too, juicy and flavorful, tasting nothing like any chicken I've ever had.  You can substitute the crisp potatoes out for black beans for a healthier option or to help cut down the carbs.
