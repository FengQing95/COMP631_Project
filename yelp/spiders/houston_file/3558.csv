JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jennifer, you mentioned visiting us during "a full house," which is almost always synonymous with an atmosphere of stressful, hurried anxiety. It's far from ideal, but it does happen occasionally, and in many ways indicates that we are doing something right. But it is also during these times that speed can trump accuracy, and servers can lose sight of the importance of staying calm and focused and moving with purpose and efficiency. If you've ever worked in a restaurant, you'll know that this can best be described as the "eternal struggle."
