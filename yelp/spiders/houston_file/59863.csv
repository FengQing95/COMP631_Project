Baby Barnaby's////They have self-serve coffee outside, which you can feel free to help yourself with as you wait. Super nice. The coffee is standard, nothing special. However, the lines usually get kinda long if you come at a bad hour... you might have to wait a good 20 minutes before you get seated. They have both outdoor and indoor seating, which is awesome sauce.
