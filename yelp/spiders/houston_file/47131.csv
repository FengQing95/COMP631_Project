Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was outstanding! Everyone in my party started with fun drinks (which were half off since we are healthcare professionals). The food was delicious, some in my group got eggs Benedict, pancakes, waffles and I tried the breakfast sandwich. The sausage was a little spicy on my sandwich but I had bites off everyone's plate and nothing on the table was bad. Highly recommend waiting for this place, it was very good!
