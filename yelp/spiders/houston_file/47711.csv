Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Shortly thereafter a lady came over and apologized, asked if there was anything else I would like and I told her that I had ordered some dry toast and she apologized again and then said they would take care of my breakfast and I would not be charged. Nice to own a mistake and I appreciated it.
