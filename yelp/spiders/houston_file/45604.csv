Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////When I asked about the kugelhopf, the lady behind the counter said it's Austrian - but upon googling, it's actually Alsatian, due to its spelling preferences, meaning that it originated from the Germanic part of France, the Alsace region. The Austrians spell it differently. What does the Kugelhopf taste like? Very similar to the Italian panettone but with only spiked white raisins and no candied citrus peels.
