Uchi////My husband and I have been here twice...and he ranks both of the meals in his top 5 meals ever eaten. The flavors are awesome, interesting textures, and lots of variety. If you're famished this isn't the place to go, its definitely quality and experience over quantity. Neither husband nor I are sushi/Japanese food connoisseurs, but the waiters have been consistently helpful and knowledgeable, in addition to being extremely pleasant. We will have to hit Uchi Austin soon, since its closer to where we are now, but if its anything like Uchi Houston, I know it will be phenomenal.
