Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I came here for the second time to try the brunch. The first time it was a little on the mediocre side as the food was not seasoned very well except the tator tots which were too salty. But I came back to try it thinking maybe it was the entree I ordered well apparently this was not the case. Our waiter was really good but the food is sub par. The waiter even gave us salt and pepper for the hash browns and said you'll need this. I've heard good things about the lunch/dinner menu so I do want to return to try it out. I would suggest maybe offering some of the lunch/dinner options during brunch to give more options.
