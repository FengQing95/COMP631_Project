Local Foods////I remember when I first tried this place, I had the duck confit sandwich, and it was the richest, most delicious sandwich I'd ever had. They've since taken it off the menu (I think? they just brought it back this week for a hot minute), so I've had to try everything else, which is just as good. The crunchy chicken sandwich is good, but a tad cumbersome to eat. Same with the truffle egg sandwich. it tastes fine, but the pretzel bread it too crunchy to really keep the sandwich together, so I just ended up eating it with a fork. The limeade is dangerously good. The quinoa's okay? I could eat a punch bowl of the kale though. I come back to this place probably once or twice a month.
