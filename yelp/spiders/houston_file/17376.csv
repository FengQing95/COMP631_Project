Uchi////This place was packed on a Thursday night and when we left  a little after 11 pm, it was still pretty busy! I've been here twice and both times didn't disappoint. The first visit was during their soft opening so everything was half off. My friends and I pretty much ordered the entire menu! The second visit was for a friend's birthday and our bill came out to almost $900 between 7 girls. We let the waiter bring out whatever he thought would be good.  Some restaurants have a problem with consistency, but Uchi does not.  I had a repeat of some dishes from my first visit, and the 2nd time was just as delicious!  Some favorites are the brussel sprouts,  hot rock (both wagyu beef and scallops), hama chili, japanese sea bream, uni, sake, sake toro, wagyu short rib and  foie gras nigiri. The desserts are pretty good too. Some notable ones are the brown butter sorbet and this one dessert that tastes like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  I've had all their rolls and they are good, but nothing crazy special.
