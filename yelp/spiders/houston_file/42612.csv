Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The menu is very diverse and interesting. The service is quick and professional. There is a big placement with many seats where you can spend your free time with your friends with pleasure. Coffee is definitely great - fresh and tasty. My favorite Bond's coffee is espresso. I ordered it many times. And you can order chocolate croissants - you will be satisfied
