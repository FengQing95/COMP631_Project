Kata Robata////I've only been here once, and the first time I went it was for a birthday party and we had a table set up for us by the back area, a little secluded for privacy and if we got a little rowdy. The ambiance is nice, dark and romantic. The prices are a little high but Â the options on the menu were savory. I wanted to try the ramen but a few friends ordered that and they loved it. I ended up ordering the lobster mac and cheese. What? You'd think someone was crazy for inventing it. But oh my lordy this was amazing. It wasn't too salty and wasn't fishy at all. The lobster was delicious and the mac and cheese was perfection. The service was good for having such a large group and I was pleased with the experience. I haven't been back since because I live on the north side but when I do get a craving for it I will be heading to Kata.
