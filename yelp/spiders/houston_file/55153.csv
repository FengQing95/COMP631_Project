Kata Robata////This is seriously some of the best sushi I've had. I certainly won't find this quality of sushi for these prices in new york, that's for sure! The lunch prices are a great deal, ranging around $15 for the sushi combos. We tried the fancy roll combo (the crazy roll with soft shell crab was our favorite!) and the sushi and roll combo. The attention to the quality of the fish and the rice is noticeable. The scallop with foie gras at $6 for 2 pieces is worth it. The praise is all true-- except you might not expect it when you visit this cute unpretentious restaurant in a strip mall. Fantastic service, but expect a long wait.
