Baby Barnaby's////Now the place itself -- don't come here expecting some upscale cafe. It's more of a quirky, cozy, homey place. There is outdoor and indoor seating. The Green Eggs have CONSISTENTLY been delicious, and the portions are generous. If I ever break out of my comfort zone and order other stuff on the menu that I like, I may update my review for an additional star! ;)
