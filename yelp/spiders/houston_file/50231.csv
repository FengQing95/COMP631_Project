Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Really bizarre menu items- all sounding very appetizing. Told our waitress Jill (she was fabulous) it was our first time and before we knew it she plopped down some funky pineapple pancake thing- on the house-- for us to try. It was delish - off to a great start. Meal was the corned beef hash with toast egg and side of monstrously long breakfast sausage. Daughter went with the pancakes- think they had some sort of mascarpone cheese on them - very nice.
