Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The best plate (nothing special by any means) was our starter, the totchos, tater tots topped with chorizo nacho cheese and an egg on top. For entrees, we ordered the short rib chilaquiles and chorizo and potato benedict which were both cold (my biggest pet peeve when dining!!!) and in my opinion had awful texture. Maybe we tried the wrong meals? Â Or maybe were one of the unlucky diners to have bad food/service experience that one random time? Regardless it's unfortunate.
