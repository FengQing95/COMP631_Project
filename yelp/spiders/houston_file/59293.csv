Baby Barnaby's////Since working for The Man means that I almost never have time to meet friends for lunch, I try to make breakfast dates as often as people are willing to get up early and meet me. Baby Barnaby's is a favorite choice for such occasions. I usually meet folks at 7:30 a.m. and have never had to wait.
