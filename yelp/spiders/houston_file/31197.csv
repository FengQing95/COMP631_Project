Local Foods////After reading the reviews I decided to try this place for lunch. The truffled egg salad sandwich on the pretzel bun was amazing! I also had the Tuscan kale and 4 bean for sides which were both delicious. I also had to get the chocolate cake which was so moist. I had the mint-ade and didn't like that so much. Will definitely be coming back and try the crunchy chicken sandwich.
