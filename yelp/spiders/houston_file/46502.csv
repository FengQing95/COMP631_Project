Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Let's just be honest, this place have the best coffee products. I used to drive to Starbucks and get in line sometimes for 30 min and I don't know what kind of syrup they add, but their coffee looks fake and oily. Now, I am sad because after living here for almost 5 yrs I just found Common Bond that is 3 min away from my house, but we are 6 months away from moving to a new house :( Anyway, we had a very nice cake I forgot the name of it and I get a daily coffee served by Efe I, he is a very nice guy with the best Customer Service. Thank you guys and thanks Efe for making my day.
