Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////It's a great location with a HUGE bar made for a great night out. I wouldn't necessarily call it a restaurant though, only because it is so loud and not set up like a nice restaurant feel. It's a great place to socialize and enjoy well made cocktails that are over priced. The food is good too but very greasy. I love getting the okra and poutine. The shrimp and grits are very watery and salty. The side of mac and cheese are amazing! All in all, it's a really fun place. I enjoy going there for nights out and drinks and to snack on good food.
