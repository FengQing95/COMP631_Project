JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Two Thumbs Up! Tried the Jinya near Nasa Tx for the first time and I was in Ramen heaven! I ordered the Spicy Tonkatsu Black Ramen and it was scrumptious! My family also tried the Tonkatsu Assari, Brussel Sprout Tempura, Jinya Bun and their super delicious Pork Gyoza. This place knows good Ramen and good food! I also appreciated their straight forward and not so complicated menu. The vibe of the place is nice and very contemporary. Thank god they opened another branch in downtown Houston. This place a must-try!
