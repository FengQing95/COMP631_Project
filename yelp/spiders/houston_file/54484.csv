Kata Robata////The last thing we ordered was the award winning lobster macaroni and cheese. Nothing captivates a girl's heart better than lobster, and macaroni and cheese... I was in heaven! If you're still skeptical about how macaroni and cheese can be THIS good... I dare you to order this. I was skeptical too but after my first bite I couldn't stop eating it. There's huge chunks of lobster in the macaroni, and the cheese is salty and creamy but not soupy like other places. Just try it and don't worry about the price. Just let yourself go. Trust me, it will be worth it.
