Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Did not try a pastry-  BOO to ketoHowever, I did have the soft scramble with bacon,(came with a baguette which I successfully avoided-yay me) with a side of sautéd spinach and it was very good! My daughter and her boyfriend got the flatbread that highly resembled a pizza and they loved it. We had a lattes, cortado and a cappuccino -coffees all excellent. Order at the long counter with all the pastries starring at you and they will deliver your order to the table!
