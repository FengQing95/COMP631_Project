Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So the reason I took off a star was the set up for the waiting area which is literally anywhere there is space to stand. It's very uncomfortable trying to eat with people standing all around you asking you about your food and loud chatter. Also the parking lot is ridiculously small and you are forced to park on the street or in other parking lots risking getting towed. And lastly, the way they word the wait is off. They base it on time. So when I asked her how many people were ahead of us, she stated we had been there 54 min and there was still a 20-40 min wait based on the 75-90 min they told us. That made no sense. It should be based on the line system and not meeting the time quota given to us.
