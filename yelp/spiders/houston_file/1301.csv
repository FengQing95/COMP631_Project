JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We love this place! I usually get the spicy chicken ramen with chicken soboro and an egg. If you're scared about spice level get the mild soup and add spicy sauce later (they have the sauce on the table). Their ramen is loaded with stuff and very filling. The hot sake is great with it as well. They have a communal style dining area as well as some booths. If you would like a booth you have to request and if it's on a busy night, the wait will probably be a lot longer. We have waited 45mins both times visiting but honestly it was worth it! On busy nights out waiter seemed to disappear frequently but there was always someone else available to help. Staff is great. We will be eating here a lot more often!
