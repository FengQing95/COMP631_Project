Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I respect how transparent their menu is in terms of where everything comes from. Local, farm raised ingredients make a meal more delicious. I ordered the sweet chai drink and it was spot on. Food took a while to come out but that's expected when everything is made fresh to order. I'm interested to return for breakfast or brunch during a weekday when the Sunday crowd doesn't slow things down. Expect a wait, but definitely recommend.
