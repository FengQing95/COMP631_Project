JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Michael - Thank you for your 5-star review. I appreciate your thorough review, and I'm glad we have met your satisfaction. It is true, when the house fills up and folks are waiting inside (and outside), we try to move things along WITHOUT making any of our customers feel rushed -- it's never easy. But we do the best that we can, and we work hard to keep folks satisfied.
