The Pit Room////The meats were smokey and you definitely smell like it after dining. But that's how you know it's the real stuff! The meats were tender and juicy. I like the sides a lot which they serve actual corns! You get two sides for each plate. Wasn't a fan of the grilled okra only cause they were hard to bite.
