The Pit Room////I really enjoyed The Pit Room. Their beef rib was fantastic and so were their pork sausage. I thought the brisket was just ok and I personally thought the venison sausage was too peppery for my tastes. I would say that a big advantage to this place vs Killen's is that I don't have to drive down to Pearland. I will probably be coming here many more times to try their other meats and all their sides.
