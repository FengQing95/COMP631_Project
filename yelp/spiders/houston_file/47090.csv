Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////From other Yelp reviews, I knew there would be a wait, so I was prepared. No problem waiting an hour and 15 minutes because I'm the meantime, had a great mimosa. Yes I know mimosas are easy, but the MMM MMM Mimosa had the perfect balance of OJ and champagne and touch of pomegranate was delish. Once seated, they promptly took my order, the cold brew iced was so good, a great roast. Ordered my food pretty quickly but within 30 minutes, still hasn't arrived. I didn't mind this because managers came over and acknowledged and apologized for the wait. For me, that's still good customer service and I wasn't in a rush. Then they brought all of my food except my chicken sausage which they told me was coming right away. Twenty minutes later, sausage never came. Sorry, pancakes without the sausage just not the same. The manager said she would bring it and take it off the bill, again very apologetic but 15 minutes later, no sausage. Other tables had the the same issue with waiting a long time for food to come. So I give it three stars because of those issues, would totally go 4.5 for food alone. I'll come back and give it another chance to see if they can work out the kinks.
