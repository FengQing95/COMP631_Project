JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Second time here and love it. The spicy chicken ramen the first time made me want to come back and get the Tokyo Yatai ramen. it was fantastic, the pork was so tender and juicy. All the flavors worked perfect with each other. I should have got the spicy version because for me it did need a little bit more of a kick, but a small dab of spicy sauce that is on the table and boom, Spicy!!
