JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Bowl full of L's. Overrated is an understatement. If you've never had ramen that didn't come out of a package before then you will probably do back flips for this place. If you know ramen, or have been over seas then Jinya is going to disappoint you like a red headed step child. The 4.5 stars are from Midtowns new college grad scene, they've been eating pizza for the pizza for the past 4 years and don't know any better. They think this is "lit".
