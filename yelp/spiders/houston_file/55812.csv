Kata Robata////We made a reservation but they could not find it when we got there. We got crammed to a corner at a little table that was meant to serve 2 persons (we were four). Other people were so close to us that it was as if we were sharing a same space. The service was poor and got the feeling they couldn't care less about us as the restaurant was already packed. I had better Japanese food at hole-in-the-wall places. A disappointment through-and-through. It felt as if I was having French food prepared by Eskimos. A friend of mine recommended that place and that was the last recommendation I'd taken from her. It seems to be a place for the twenty-something crowd that can put up with poor service and are willing to pay a high price for the quality of food and overall experience that they get for it.
