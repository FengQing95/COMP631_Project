Local Foods////Their season's harvest salad got me rethink that salad can actually be worth $10. The porkchop burger on pretzel buns with apple and kale, among other noms, was a positive reinforcement on my tendency to order food with seemingly strange combination of ingredients. The crunchy chicken sandwich was also delicious. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the side with the soba noodle, which was much too smushy for my liking. Though, to be fair, I'm pretty picky with my Asian noodles.
