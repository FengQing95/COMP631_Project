Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Excellent. We chose Bosscat for a dinner for 49-50 people as part of a wedding celebration. Comments from the attendees were uniformly positive - food, service, liquor selection. As the host, I very much appreciated the attention to detail and deliciousness of the appetizer, salads, pasta, fish, and beef ribs. The desserts - chocolate churros, s'mores bars, and hot chocolate with add ins were yummy.
