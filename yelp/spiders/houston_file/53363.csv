Kata Robata////So anyway, this restaurant has been on my list of sushi restaurants to try since I moved to Houston and I finally got the chance to try it for my birthday!  It was a late dinner and we were starving so we asked the waiter for recommendations. He suggested the popular Caribbean Roll.  We ordered that and the Salmon/Soft shell crab roll along with some sake.  We devoured those rolls (so fast that I didn't even get to take my typical food photos) and continued to order the next roll, Ocean Picante.  My date, knowing all too well that I could fit more food in my stomach, allowed me to order another roll after that ( roll #4, don't judge).  ONLY cuz it was my birthday, probably  ;)
