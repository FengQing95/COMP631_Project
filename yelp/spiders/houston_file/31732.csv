Local Foods////Fresh, fun and delicious! The food is always amazing, and the service is fast and friendly. I travel for work, and this is the spot I most look forward to on every trip to Houston. Never had a dish I didn't like here. I absolutely love the Lemongrass Chicken soup, and the Mintade is pure heaven!
