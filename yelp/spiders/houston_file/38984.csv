Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////There is a cozier, more intimate area towards the back that I would recommend for dates. If you are going there at night, I would suggest dressing up! There were no t-shirts and shorts to be seen. It is a gorgeous place with dark, cozy lighting and candle lights. The bathroom is nice as well!
