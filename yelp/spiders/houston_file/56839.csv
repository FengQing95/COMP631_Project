Kata Robata////This is a strong staple to the Houston sushi scene. It's definitely pricier sushi, but I think their quality reflects the price. Here I wouldn't waste my money on the rolls....why spend good money to cover the taste of fresh sashimi with sauce if the fish is fresh enough to stand out on its own? And the sushi is where this place excels. I love ordering off the seasonal menu because it's truly seasonal...you may not see it again!
