Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////DELICOUS! I like this place a lot. The service is good, they usually get you thru the line with minimum wait time. The croissants are fresh and phenomenal. Only reason it's 4 stars and not 5 is because of their Nutella croissant. It was just TOO much Nutella where I couldn't even eat half of it. As well the scrambled egg dish was not to my liking but I can see it being for others. Otherwise good place!
