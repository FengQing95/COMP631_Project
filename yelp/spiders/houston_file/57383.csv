Kata Robata////Next up: dinner stuff. The grilled oyster mushrooms were spongy, delicious, and bursting with deceptive meatiness. The miso eggplant with grilled sushi rice was really interesting a quite good, featuring fleshy eggplant roll-ups glazed with a sweet and nutty marinade and doughy wedges of glutinous, garlicky rice. I'm not normally a fan of tempura, but Â the delicate, wafer-like panko crust on the shrimp tempura had me questioning my stance. The eel and salmon nigiri were both satisfying, but I would suggest opting for some of the more off-the-beaten path nigiri rolls such as amberjack, sea bream, or marinated gizzard. The spicy chopped scallop roll was a hit, with the quartered scallop chunks melting like sweet sea-butter in our mouths. The tropical spicy tuna roll was good but fairly forgettable. Can't remember what our final roll was, but it paired luscious yellowtail with the sharp bite of jalapeno -- definitely worth trying. We somehow had the gall to order the spicy soy ramen after this and, man, I'm so glad we did. The top-knotch broth was sweet and silky in a way I've never tasted before, and it braised pork was a nice change of pace from the subtlety of raw fish. For dessert, we ordered a very Fall-y pumkin-based tart that was heavy on aromatics (I think I tasted cloves and cardamom). It was alright, but I was too full to think straight at this point.
