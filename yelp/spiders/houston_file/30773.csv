The Pit Room////So good! The crust on the brisket is a bit thick with pepper and smoky, which I don't prefer. But a lot of people do, and the meat underneath was very tender and not dry at all. Flavors were all so good. The elote is customizable, the chicharones with hot sauce were excellent, and you can sub them for a side! Next time I'm getting a separate order of them. The bread was homemade, I'm pretty sure and excellent. Good selection of draft beer and various bottled drinks (also soda fountain, tea, lemonade and iced coffee dispensers). My favorite part was the pickle bar with pickled hot carrots, jalape√±os, cucumbers, salsa, and more sauces/fixings. Insanely good BBQ with a touch of taqueria. Will be back!
