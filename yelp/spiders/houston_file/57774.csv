Kata Robata////We got two desserts.  I was very excited about the green tea souffle cheesecake but it was more like a firm souffle than cheesecake, so I was a little disappointed (but not too disappointed because it was complimentary since we were celebrating a birthday - yay!).  I liked the banana creme brulee better.
