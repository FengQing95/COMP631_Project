The Pit Room////The sides were okay, sometimes with American food I need something more plain to balance the immense flavor and sodium levels lol but the slice of bread kinda counterbalanced that for me. Anyways i lovedddd this place i loved the food. There is also a little self serve bar with pickled veggies that was the perfect compliment for the food.
