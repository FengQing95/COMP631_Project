Uchi////We had a great experience last night. Our son was home from recently finishing law school so we were celebrating. Our server was Bret and he was fantastic. The food was amazing. Only caveat is I have owned cars as a young man that cost less than our meal but we did have the 10 course chef's menu. We found several dishes that will bring us back and not break the bank. The Brussels sprouts for only $6 is a great start. We finished with two different desserts and french pressed Honduran coffee. Jenice kept mentioning how much fun the evening was which made the money well spent for me.
