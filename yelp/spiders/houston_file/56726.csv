Kata Robata////Had low expectation and thought it's similar to places like Blue Fish. But wow, the food were actually very tasty. The dishes were more like Asian-fusion but they mostly stayed true to the essence of Japanese Â Izakaya style cuisine. Yuzu salmon was very good. Pork belly papaya salad is also very good. Kobe beef is also good. Surprisingly the foie gras was also well prepared. Will be a frequent visitor.
