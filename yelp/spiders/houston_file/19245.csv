Uchi////Used my birthday as an excuse to dine at Uchi at others' expense but I like to think everyone wins eating here. Once you get through the hurdles of seating, the service is top notch. Our server had great recommendations since it was my first time there. Out of the 10 dishes we ordered my favorites were the Machi Cure, Madai Carpaccio, Biendo, and the Fried Milk.
