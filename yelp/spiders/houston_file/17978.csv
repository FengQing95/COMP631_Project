Uchi////Aside from that, our extremely helpful and friendly waiter brought us a great assortment of things. We opted to have him bring us what he thought was best, and after asking the standard questions about allergies and raw food, and setting a reasonable budget, we were treated to an amazing meal. A couple sushi courses (including one unique one with frozen grapes and spring roll wrappers), a couple amazing cooked fish courses, and the edamame and sprouts made for a really enjoyable tasting menu-style meal that didn't break the bank - for four of us to eat until we were full, it was only about $200. I won't say how much the extreme quantity of apparently delectable "Demon Slayer" sake cost.
