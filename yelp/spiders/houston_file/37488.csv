Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Food is terrible drinks are good...they put tomatoes in their shrimp & grits, and when I didn't like it they had the audacity to send the manager over to my table and try to explain the difference of Cajun and creole to me? first of all just because you try to explain this dish to me doesn't mean I'm going to like it! Â and second of all, my WHOLE family is from Louisiana and this is just nasty. Otherwise the drinks were good and they should probably stick with that. It has a bar-like atmosphere with a lot of televisions EVERYWHERE, and the tables are too close together, it's easier to hear the person beside you; rather than the person across from you that you came with. With that being said eat at your own discretion.
