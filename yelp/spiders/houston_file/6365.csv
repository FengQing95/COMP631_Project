JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We started off with the brussel sprouts tempura with truffle oil. I've probably had brussel sprouts no more than five times (I think) in my life so I don't know what constitutes as good or bad... but they were quite yummy! Honestly, I mainly got it for the truffle oil, heh.
