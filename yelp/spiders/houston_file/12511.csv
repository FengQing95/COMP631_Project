JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love this restaurant! I have been to several locations and their food is very consistent. I have tried most of their ramen options and my favorite is the spicy miso broth. The Jinya bun is my must have appetizer when I come. They also do a good job of maintaining their drafts. I usually get the Sapporo draft and it's one of my favorites because t taste just right and it's served very cold.
