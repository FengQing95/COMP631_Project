Kata Robata////Kata Robata has been my go to sushi restaurant since moving to Houston a year ago. First check mark is that it is run by a Japanese chef! Second is the freshness of Â the fish, which so far, is one of the better ones in Houston. Coming from New York City has made me very picky about restaurants, especially sashimi.
