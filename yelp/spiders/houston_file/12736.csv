JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The Jinya tonkatsu black was flavorless, I also had the spicy tonkatsu which was a bit better but I didn't like the thick noodles so much. I'm not going to critique on that because it's preference. I find that it's over priced for what it is, also having to add on an egg to the dish for an additional charge where it's usually part of the dish in most restaurants I didn't like the idea of. I get it if the dish was inexpensive but lunch for 2 at nearly $30 you get a lot better and all we ordered was 2 bowls of noodles is a bit too much.
