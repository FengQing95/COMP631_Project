Local Foods////All the sandwiches are unique in its own ways. Some of my favorites here are Duck Confit, Crunchy Chicken, Truffled Egg Salad, and Seafood. For the first visit, I would recommend the duck. It's soooo good! They have a decent selection of sides but you can't go wrong with any of them. Even the kale taste good. The interior is nicely decorated with a touch of hipster-ness. It's like I've brought Austin with me to Houston!
