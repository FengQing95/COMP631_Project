Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Went her for the first time this week. I liked the variety in the menu and their take on classics. I had the Bennedict duo (Chile Verde Eggs Benedict and Bella Bella Benny). They were accommodating since I asked to have the eggs on slices of tomatoes since I was low carb. The waitress even asked if I wanted those slices raw or grilled. DÃ©cor is cute but the ambiance isn't anything special ... a true diner type atmosphere. .
