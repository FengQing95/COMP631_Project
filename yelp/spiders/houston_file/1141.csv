JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thus far, one of the better ramen places in Houston thus far. I love ramen, but admittedly - I'm not a huge fan of paying a decent sum of money for a bowl of tasty ramen. Either way though, I think the tonkatsu here is delicious. The extra noodles are a liberal serving of noodles. I'll usually get the fresh garlic (free) and add in the spice they have on the table (rather than pay extra for them adding spice for you) to get a tasty broth. It can be a pretty loud environment though, so holding a conversation here can be hard. The busiest that it's been has been a 20 minute wait, and that was a Friday night. The other two times I've been have been no wait at all. Worth a try if you haven't been already!
