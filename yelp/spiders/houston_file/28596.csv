The Pit Room////The BBQ is great considering the inner city location, but the service is beyond poor. First, they don't have a measurement on meats that come in a plate. If the dude likes you, you look nice, you're a girl, maybe you'll get more... Or maybe you'll get less. Which was the experience my friend had when we came here once.
