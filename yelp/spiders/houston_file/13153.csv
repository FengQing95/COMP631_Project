JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your feedback.  I do apologize for your seat time but tonight we did indeed experience equipment issues with our ramen line.  What you were told as our “fryer” going out is indeed a double capacity Frymaster fryer.  We use that as our noodle cooker as traditional pasta cookers do not work well with ramen noodles.  Temperature doesn’t get hot enough.  During this time of year after Xmas, many people are off from work, school is out and this is probably the busiest time of the year for restaurants.  We had a line out the door all day and a vital equipment breaking down in the middle of dinner rush made things worse.  I apologize for that.  It’s not something we can prepare for nor expect to happen on a regular basis.  That being said, I understand your dissatisfaction from a customer’s point of view.  I’m more than happy to make this right for you.  Pls reach out to me at 650-906-6308.  Happy Holidays to you and I look forward to hearing from you.
