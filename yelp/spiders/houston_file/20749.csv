Uchi////We started out with the hama chili. It was a yellowtail paired with orange. It was delish. The orange gave it a sweet taste. It came with a light sauce so no soy sauce needed. The fish was fresh. Next dish was the brussual sprouts. It was fried with a sweet chili sauce. Anything fried is good including Brussels sprouts.
