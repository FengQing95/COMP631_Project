The Pit Room////The food, I would say the weakest thing is probably their sauce and their sides.  Because  I live so close, i always buy carry out, and use my own bbq sauce at home, either stubbs/salt licks sauce.  The sides i always get the roasted okra, the mac & cheese is only ok, and nothing else catches my eye.  The meats, ive had the sausages, brisket, beef ribs, pork ribs, tacos.  The meats were good. highlights are brisket and beef ribs as others have pointed out.  Good salty crust, great smoke ring, flavorful, tender, juicy.  Pretty much all the good things you want in BBQ is here.  (have not been to Franklins)
