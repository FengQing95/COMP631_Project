Uchi////Jon suggested that we get one order of every dessert and my favorite would probably have to be the Fried Milk. The concept really baffles me, but man was it good on my tongue. I absolutely enjoyed it so much. Thank you Jon for the recommendation because now I was able to try one of every dessert.
