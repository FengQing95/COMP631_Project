The Pit Room////Went to the pit room last night and got 2lbs of Brisket and some Mac and cheese to go. The Mac and cheese was fantastic, as always. But not sure what happened to the brisket. As we have been here before and loved our experience. However, this trip the brisket was severally under cooked. Rubber. Not good. Not sure if this place is on a downward spiral. But that was bad. I felt cheated when I'm served that poor of a quality Brisket at $20+ a lb. We will not be returning after being served that.
