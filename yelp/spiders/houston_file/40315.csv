Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Hubby and I came for a late lunch on a Monday and found the place rather empty. We settled down comfortably and got some drinks: Moscow Mule and Bosslady. We really enjoyed the drinks! So much that we wanted another! So we got the Bosscat and thoroughly enjoyed that too!
