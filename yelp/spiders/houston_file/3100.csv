JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////If I had to complain about anything it would be that the bok choy add-in, while well cooked, is incredibly tiny. But that's a very small complaint compared to how great everything is overall. Place is packed on a weekend and no reservations, so best bet is to go on a weekday.
