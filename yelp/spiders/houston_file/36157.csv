Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food was delicious, inventive and balanced. We hadn't expected the club style music and atmosphere. It definitely made it lively and fun, but a bit hard to talk. You really had to almost yell to be heard. We visited during brunch so I'm not sure if dinner is the same. We are interested to try their dinner menu. The service from our waiter was okay. He took the drink orders from everyone in our table but forgot to ask me and my daughter. He did forget to order a drink from someone in our party. He was friendly and informative. The busing staff was excellent and refilled waters on time and removed empty plates almost immediately once we were done. Overall it was a good experience and the food is really excellent and made up for the other shortcomings.
