Local Foods////I've never had a sandwich here that wasn't high quality, somewhat creative, and all around delicious. My favorites are the lox and crunchy chicken sandwiches, but I also love the egg salad and my friends rave about the duck confit and banh mi, so basically you can't go wrong no matter what you get. The sides are all heavenly - just like the sandwiches, I've never had one I didn't love, but my favorites are the kale and tabouleh salads. It's all pretty healthy and (hence the name) local, which makes it even better. The people are always friendly and talkative when you order at the register, so the service is also great.
