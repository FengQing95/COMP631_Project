Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Would give 0 stars if possible after the experience we had. Came here on Sunday, August 13, 2017. Waited an hour and a half to be seated (I get it, Sunday funday/ Sunday brunch a long wait is expected, but that's not why this review gets a 1 star). The waitress that served us (did not get her name and the receipt has a guy servers name on it, Saul) was rude and inattentive (had to ask multiple times for a straw, napkins and condiments EACH time). But you know what? I get it. It's Sunday, it's packed, maybe she has more tables assigned to her than she can handle? The reason why I'm giving snooze such a low rating is even after putting up with ALL of that I still gave her a 20% tip (in cash which was written on the tip line as "CASH"). I guess she felt that she deserved more than 20% for her "excellent service" because she tipped herself an additional 20% ontop of the cash tip we left. Very disappointing as we were avid snooze goers (even with the wait). While waiting an hour and a half for our table we ordered mimosas from the bar. Evidently the bar tender had more morals than this waitress. Nonetheless very disappointed, expected better from an establishment like this. Will not be returning. To anyone visiting that's paying with a credit card, keep your receipts and a look out once your payment has posted.
