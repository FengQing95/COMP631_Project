Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////On a recent weekday (March '19), I ate lunch with a friend and ordered the "Ancient Grains with Chickpea Croquettes" salad. This is a hearty salad that contains farro, kamut, baby spinach, romaine, cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, roasted sunflower seeds, sheep's milk feta, and sun-dried tomato ranch. I like that the salad was not overly-dressed and the chickpea croquettes added such a pleasant texture to the salad. I would order this again, however, I feel that $14 is way too much for a salad. In fact, the food prices are the reason I can't give Common Bond 5 stars.
