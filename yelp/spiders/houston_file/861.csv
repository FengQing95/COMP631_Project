JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I usually like noodles so i traveled over 40 minutes to try this place. However, I am very disappointed. I went on a Thursday right before lunch time to avoid the crowd. I ordered Cha cha cha as recommended by other reviewers. The noodle came out very fast and looked just like the menu. I was excited. However, the broth was only luke warm, the egg while cooked perfectly was COLD in the middle! Is this how it suppose to be? I hope not. My girl friend's black ramen was also luke warm. I was tempted to wave at the waiter to ask if the tempearture was off but my girl friend didn't want them to spit in our replacement bowl ( I think she watches too much TV). Anyways, until I know the noodles are suppose to be piping hot and they fix the issue, I will not be returning.
