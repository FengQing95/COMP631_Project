The Pit Room////I have to say- we received AMAZING customer service from Juan-- he worked the patio and he was extremely, friendly, attentive, and kind. If I decide to go back it will be because of him. Honestly the guys chopping the brisket and serving the sides were pretty cool too. If you're looking for some good bbq and happen to be in the area, stop by The Pit Room. I definitely recommend it.
