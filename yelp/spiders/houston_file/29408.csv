The Pit Room////Atmosphere when first walking in was great and very welcoming. The man behind the counter was extremely helpful and told us better ways to order to get the most bang out of our buck. He even offered us samples when we had trouble deciding on which sausage to get. My boyfriend and I aren't big on sausage but opted to order it since it's so highly reviewed. It was good but didn't blow our minds or anything. Perhaps we just don't understand how to appreciate sausage.
