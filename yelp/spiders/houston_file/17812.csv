Uchi////This is one of my favorite restaurants in Houston. It's a fun casual atmosphere with delicious sushi. My favorite part was the fact that they have an extensive vegetarian menu and fabulous drinks. The Brie dish and the eggplant were my favorites - quite memorable. The service was top notch with a friendly and very knowledgeable server plus great tips on amazing dishes to order. Great spot!
