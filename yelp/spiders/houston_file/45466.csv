Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Had the Black Forest Cheesecake and it was so decadent and delicious. There are large cherries running through the actual cheesecake and they were a fun surprise burst of sweet. Every bite has to be enjoyed as slowly as possible as to make the whole treat last longer.
