Uchi////Scallop nigiri is awesome! The seaweed wrap tastes crispy and fresh, mixed with their awesome vinegared rice(I just created a new word), it triggers your childhood memory which deeply rooted in your brain and heart! Yea im over exaggerated...but anyways, that taste I would never forget about..details details Japanese food is all about the details, from rice to sashimi..
