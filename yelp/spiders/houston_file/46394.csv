Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We dropped by with a party of 5. We got several pastries, coffees and soft scrambles. It was all great. Nothing left to improve on. From the strawberry preserves to the potatoes hash brown/ quiche everything was great. We will definitely try to make it back tomorrow morning. It's worth it.
