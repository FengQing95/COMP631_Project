Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We were fortunate to get a reservation at the charity soft opening of the new Snooze brunch restaurant that just opened in Montrose. Great concept for breakfast anytime lovers! Food was amazing and service was exceptional. The best part was that everything you orders was FREE and they encouraged you to keep ordering because they were testing the kitchen. Â Needless to say, we kept ordering! The pancakes were killer, particularly the pineapple upside down pancake and the peanut butter cup pancake. You can order a 'Flight' of pancakes, which is three pancakes of your own choosing. They have several Benedicts and a breakfast sandwich that is off the hook. Highly recommended!!!!
