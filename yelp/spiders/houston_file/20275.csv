Uchi////I was dying to eat sushi at Uchi.I didn't have money.My friend invited me to dinner.It was time to eat at Uchi.I walked around Uchi. The most of the guests were white people.I couldn't expect any diversity around Montrose& Westminster.I was not in Chinatown.Apparently, this restaurant was a hangout place of white guys.Our server was a white male.He brought a "Japanese oshibori", which was a hot towel. I checked the menu.Uchi was more expensive than Kubo's cafe in Chinatown.There were some Japanese characters on the menu.I asked the server if I could work at Uchi as an translator.He said "Yes you can". I hope I can work at Uchi.The server started bringing food.They claimed Japanese restaurant.I am from Japan.But I could not recognized some of the food.I have never seen duck sushi.To my surprise, it was good, The duck sushi made me feel like being the emperor of sushi king Duck dynasty or something like that. No matter how strange they were, the foods were great!
