Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Loved our waitress, she was so friendly and welcoming. Service was a bit slow, but I attribute that to them being understaffed - she had a lot going on. She was gracious enough to send out a cinnamon pancake on the house for us to try, because it was our first time there and she insisted that we just had to taste it.
