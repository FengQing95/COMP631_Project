The Pit Room////Came here at 7 on a Monday night and it was pretty packed. Friends and I all got the dinner menu with either 2 meats or 3. I got the last order of brisket which was delicious. I love that the BBQ sauce is on the side and not slathered on the meat like some places. Found the pork ribs to be a bit dry. The giant beef rib however was great. Love the little salad bar on the side with tons of pickled veggies. The garlic and jalape√±os went great with the meats.
