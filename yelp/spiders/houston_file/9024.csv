JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I appreciate your suggestion that we "calm our atmosphere." We try our best to do so, but we are only human, and sometimes mistakes by the front of house and/or back of house can compound delays, and without going into detail, we suffered some of that today. The result was an extended wait time for some of our food to reach the tables. The knock-on effect is that sometimes servers and bartenders cannot spend as much time as they normally would with each customer. Again, we do our best, and for the mistakes we make, we try to make amends.
