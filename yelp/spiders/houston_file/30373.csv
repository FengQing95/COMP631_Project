The Pit Room////We went onsite on Friday night. Love this place. Friendly staff. Cold night otherwise the outdoor area looked inviting. Wife had the brisket tocos and loved them. I had pork ribs and jalape√±o sausage. Very good, great smoke flavor. BBQ sauce is spicy and flavorful the way we love. Best Charro beans anywhere! Can't wait to swing by there for a breakfast taco.
