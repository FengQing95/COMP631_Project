Kata Robata////Came here on a Monday, they open @ 11:30 . So we came here a little early because we know they will have a line waiting for them to be open . The place got fill up fast ! ! Everything is fresh , if you like sushi this is a must if you are in Houston. All the dish that we order taste spectacular. Service was top notch . Our server was wonderful!!
