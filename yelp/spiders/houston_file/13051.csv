JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We arrived sometime after 9 on a Saturday night. Waited for probably 20-30 minutes but that was no problem for us. We got a drink and stood to the side. A lot of people were waiting outside because there is no real waiting area by the entrance. It sounds like there always is a wait and the dining room is a little crowded. I wouldn't recommend bringing a big group here.
