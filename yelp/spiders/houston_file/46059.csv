Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'm actually a bit disappointed. I loved how fresh everything was. I loved the care that goes into making everything. You can tell it doesn't taste like it's just frozen stuff they toss out every morning. The space is beautiful, the layout a little odd, the windows and space have a wonderful feeling to it. The flavors, they mixed together didn't seem to blend very well. Â We got the rose and strawberry one, the Black Forest cheesecake, and I know the last one had passion fruit and chocolate and a pistachio sponge cake it was sitting on.
