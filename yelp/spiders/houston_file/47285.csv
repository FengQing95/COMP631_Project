Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've been to Snooze several times. The pancake special has been excellent everytime, I love the breakfast pot pie, corned beef hash, Â cocktails are delicious. It can be a long wait...but visit with the others that are waiting to help pass the time. And service is always friendly and good.
