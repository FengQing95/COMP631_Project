The Pit Room////My friend and I decided upon the Pit Room. There were a few options for indoor seating as well as some benches outside. From the outside, there are windows that you can peek into and get a glimpse of the smokers first hand. The inside was exactly what I expected it to be (air conditioning is a beautiful thing). I wish I had known about the whole take a koozie, leave a koozie situation because I would have came prepared. I did not take a koozie cause I didn't want bad koozie karma.
