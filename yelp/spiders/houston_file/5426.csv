JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Whenever we have to implement a waitlist, we must adhere to our strict seating policy. Whenever that happens, we can provide a rough estimate if your party is complete. But if your party cannot arrive in full for an indefinite amount of time, that will always prevent us from offering an estimate. If we were to provide an estimated wait time in such a circumstance, then customers would get upset that we misquoted their wait time. Regardless, there's absolutely nothing simple about seating patrons in a timely, and most importantly, fair fashion.
