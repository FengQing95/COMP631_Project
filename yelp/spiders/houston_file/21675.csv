Uchi////The cons: the food.  My fiance and I went craving top notch sushi, and we walked away unsatisfied. I don't know what is worse: their claimed tapas style dishes to be shared that turned out to be a meager bite per person, or their "sashimi" that wreaked of a fishy taste. Two dishes worth mentioning. First, the Yokai berry, which actually contained a surprisingly delectable citric flavor. The Salmon, asian pear, and kale combo meshed very well together. Au contraire, the chef's selection sashimi tasting was an utter let down.  Each piece of fish wreaked, and tasted like it had been sitting in the freezer for days.
