Local Foods////The environment is adorable. It's got a chill, earthy, and modern vibe. The menu is simple, delicious, and unique. The sandwiches are decadent and so filling! Come with an appetite for their sandwiches! These aren't your ordinary run of the mill turkey and swiss. I order the Shrimp and Crab sandwich on Ciabatta bread and oh my gosh... Loved! My boyfriend got the Roast Beef and he said it was definitely one of the best sandwiches he's had. The sides were just as good too. They do have house made chips, but their other options of acorn squash, olives, quinoa, and others alike make the entire order way better than your ordinary sandwich shop! I could barely decide, but I ended up getting the acorn squash and cabbage slaw. I'm not typically a cole slaw kind of gal but I love the edamame mixed in, and some Asian dressing I think. The acorn squash was delicious too!
