JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi J.L. - Thank you for the great review. We understand our community tables aren't necessarily for everyone, which is why we do have booth seating (if you're willing to wait a little bit longer during peak dining hours). Our only intention from the outset was to be able to accommodate as many folks as possible at any given time. We thank you for your understanding, and we hope you'll come through again in the near future.
