JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Last night we're in Houston for a volleyball tourny, and found Jinya. I ordered Tonkatsu Black, while the kid ordered Premium, and we both ordered gyoza. The gyoza was delicious - not as good as my mom's :) but yummy.  As for the ramen - the last time my daughter and I had ramen was in November. . . in Fukuoka (Kyushu) Japan.  Jinya's version was yummy!  Thick savory broth, noodles just right. I should have added extra toppings (out of greed), but what I had was more than enough to fill me.  Daughter was happy slurping hers. In my opinion, the flavor reflected slight modification for the western palate, but I can't put my finger on how it was modified. Regardless, the ramen was quite good - 4 1/2 stars. Note, however, that IMHO it is nearly impossible to earn 5 stars here in the US for someone as particular about tonkatsu ramen as I am.
