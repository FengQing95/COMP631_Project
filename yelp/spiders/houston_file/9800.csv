JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////3201 Louisiana-One of our two go to places for Ramen in Houston.  Park in the garage next door,  free self park or valet.  Average wait is 20-30 minutes unless a larger party.  There are about 8 two person booths,  8 or so tables, and two large communal tables.  Often we sit at the bar where you can generally find a spot in less than 15 minutes.  Great fun with friends or just for two,  contemporary pop music playing,  a couple of flat screens in the bar playing the game.
