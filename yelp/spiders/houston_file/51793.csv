Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Very dissapointed as I expected another over hyped breakfast spot. The one thing that saved our meal was the regular buttermilk pancakes. We got the regular breakfast plate that came with eggs, hashbrowns, and sausage. We had the pancake flight and omg french toast. Hash browns were untouched after our first bite. It tasted extremely over seasoned. Eggs were under average. Sausage was ok. Flight of pancakes cane with a sweet potato, blueberry, and pineapple one. Sweet potato was and blueberry were alright but would not reorder those. The pineapple was better tasting, but nothing to rave about. Omg french toasts was good. But in the end i'd say only the buttermilk pancakes were worth getting and MAYBE the french toast. Service takes a long time so be prepared for the wait...
