Baby Barnaby's////My favorite dish on the menu is the Green Eggs. If you love eggs, spinach, artichoke, and cheese YOU NEED TO GET THIS. It is creamy, flavorful, melt in your mouth amazingness!!! This dish is served with chicken apple sausage which is good but too sweet (IMO) for me so I usually substitute it with a side of bacon. This plate also comes with crisp breakfast potatoes and they are soooooo delicious and addicting- it's seriously the best part of the meal.
