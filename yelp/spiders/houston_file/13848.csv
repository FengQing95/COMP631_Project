JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Let me just say being vegan for the last few weeks have been awesome and my taste buds definitely opened up, this ramen bowl has so much flavor and the veggies add just the right touch. I sub the tofu with mushrooms this time around, didn't care for the tofu much but in other words this definitely can compete with all the regular ramen bowls.
