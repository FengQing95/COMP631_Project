Kata Robata////Kata has continued to be one of my favorite places to enjoy Japanese food in Houston. The service is always friendly and fast and the food always incredible. I recently celebrated my birthday here and had a few of my favorite things here: the Japanese amberjack with foie gras and the Chefs Sashimi. I was blown away as always by the freshness and flavor of the fish (that medium fatty tuna is so good) as well as by the amazing service. Our waitress was so sweet and really helped us celebrate and enjoy the evening. 5 stars. Will definitely be back one day for the omakase!!
