JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I am always wary when folks try to put their own spin on classic amazing dishes but Jinya Ramen has done an amazing job on putting their own spin on Ramen. I had the Jinya Black Tonkatsu. OMG the Broth was of the charts on the flavor scale and the egg was cooked perfectly with that signature runny yolk. Noodles had the right amount of firmness and held on to the Broth perfectly. Very complex flavors coming out of the Broth. The pork had amazing texture and flavors it had perfect fat to lean meat ratio. Lets talk about customer service. I came in and sat at the bar and Nhu was the young lady who took my order. She was super friendly helpful and made excellent recommendations. She advised me to try the Spicy Tuna Tacos which I did and boy I wasn't disappointed. The Tuna was super Fresh just the right amount of spiciness and their home made shells was just perfect. All and all Fantastic place and worth every penny.
