Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We frequent Snooze as this is our favorite brunch spot in Houston. The weight can be anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour, coffee is offered during the wait free of charge. Service is always exceptional, the RumMosa was pretty strong if that's what you're into, the Mimosa has a good balance to it though the orange juice does have pulp. I order the corned beef hash each time, it's fresh and full of potatoes. Eggs are eggs a but salt and pepper help. My wife ordered the spuds deluxe with ham and she ate all of it. All in all, it's a cute, trendy place with excellent food.
