JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As the JINYA Ramen website says: "Anyone from Japan can tell you: Real Japanese ramen isn't about the noodles, it's about the broth."   Since JINYA opened up, I can tell you, we have been looking to sample their broths and see if LA really has come to Houston. However, with three kids under the age of 5 and a busy life, we are never in the Midtown area (yes we need to get out more).  Thankfully, after a couple hours at Children's Museum, we were craving JINYA and it was only 9 minutes away.
