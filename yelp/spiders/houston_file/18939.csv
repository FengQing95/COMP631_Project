Uchi////Overall, an exceptional dining experience.  The overall ambiance and dining experience provides gastronomically savvy Houstonians with a culinary gem in the heart of Houston.  If this review fails to send a message that this place is something you need to try, I'm sure the fact that I've been here three times within a span of two weeks will.
