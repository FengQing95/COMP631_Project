Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I ordered a Caesar salad, the soup of the day - which was French onion, and a lemonade. This totaled out to be almost $20, which is pretty much not worth it. The salad was pretty good, but it comes a special topping. The French onion soup was OK, but the portion should have been way larger than what it was. The lemonade is nothing special.
