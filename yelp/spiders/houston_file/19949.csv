Uchi////Wow!  This place is just, wow.  I have been to both Uchi and Uchiko in Austin and have always been impressed with the quality of food.  I think Uchiko is slightly better than Uchi Austin, but only by a small margin.  However, Uchi Houston is the clear winner out of the three.  This place is incredible.  Our very first visit was just 2 weeks ago and we have been back 6 times since.  Yep, you heard me right, and we're going back again tonight!  It's just that good.
