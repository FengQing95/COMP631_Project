JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love the decor of this place, it's dark and very hip especially the seating in the middle of the restaurant where they have rocks on the table that divide it up, the ramen is good, not the best ramen I have had but still good, flavor of the broth is just about right in seasoning and the pork was really soft, great service and has free parking
