Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The pistachio croissant was screaming my name when I stumbled across this place on Yelp. Common Bond has been in my bookmarks for way too long. So of course, I was beyond excited when we just happened to be in Montrose and decided to stop by after getting coffee next door at Agora.
