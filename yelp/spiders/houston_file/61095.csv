Baby Barnaby's////Hope in the wall breakfast place next door to Barnaby's. Great energy from all the staff who were fun and informative, but kept the traffic moving so that even on a Sunday the wait was very reasonable.  Everyone at my table which included a teenaged boy cleaned their plate with a smile.  Definitely will return.
