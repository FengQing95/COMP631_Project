Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I like this place! Food is fresh and good quality I like the atmosphere too, the stuff are nice but the manager was really rude!!! I don't know maybe he had a hard day or whatever, but he's job is really important and his behavior is the point to choose a place for next time or select somewhere els has good food and good manner of stuff.
