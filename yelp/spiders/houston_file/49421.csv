Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////pancakes- How do they get them so soft and fluffy? for some reason, we got a free pancake, compliments of the chef, but I'm not biased when I tell ya that these pancakes were amazeballs. Although, I'd prefer if they had less chocolate/syrup/sweet stuff... just a little overboard for me.
