JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////However, the other components of the ramen are done excellently. The egg is very well marinaded and soft boiled. They also give you a whole egg which is just awesome. The pork is good and the toppings were fresh. I got the tonkotsu black and I loved the inclusion of the garlic oil and garlic chips. Definitely a necessary addition to any ramen at JINYA.
