Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So good!!!!!! I cannot wait to go back! My husband and I shared the pancake flight, every one was wonderful. My favorites were the lemon and blueberry. Also enjoyed Benedict, next time will be sure to ask for the hot sauce though. Every one was hospitable and kind, checked in on us even if they were not assigned to our table. Such a great place!
