JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////If your a fan of traditional japanese cuisine you will like this place. The atmosphere is good and the food was delicious. Though not everything is 100% authentic, I guarantee its the best ramen and japanese fare you'll find this far south. It was a bit pricey which is probably my only complaint but definitely worth a visit.
