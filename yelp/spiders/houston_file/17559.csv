Uchi////out of the those dishes, my favorites were the hama chili, foie nigiri, and ham and eggs roll.  the hama chili featured one of the tastiest yellowtail sashimi ive ever had.  the foie nigiri was out of this world.  the ham and eggs roll is unique in its own way.  the sushi has ham wrapped with rice and seaweed.  there are 2 sauces that come with it, 1 based on the eggwhite and 1 based on the eggyolk.  dipping the roll in the sauce was amazing.
