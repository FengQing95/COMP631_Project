Baby Barnaby's////The restaurant is a bit small so it probably wouldn't be a good idea for a large party of people unless you called ahead (if they do that). When we walked in, I was confused as to how to get a table. Do we seat ourselves, talk to someone, which door do we enter through? There was actually a clipboard that you're supposed to sign in on and then your name will be called. I don't think that's the best idea because not only did we do it, but countless amounts of people walked in to only be told they had to go back outside to sign in on the clipboard. Maybe that's not an everyday thing? If it is, signage needs to go up at the very front. If theres already signage, it needs to be more attention grabbing.
