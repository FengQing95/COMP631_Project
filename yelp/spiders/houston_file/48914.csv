Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Love this place!! It's right on par with the Breakfast Klub, but with lots more options and alcohol! You have to try the Bloody Mary's and the OMG French toast!! Great ambiance, fantastic wait staff, incredibly unique food and beverages. Highly recommend!! Will definitely be back time and again! Be sure to get there early cause the parking lot fills up quick!! A sure sign you have come to a great A.M. Eatery!!
