JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I like the Spicy Chicken Ramen, which I guess is one of their popular bowls because there's a big fat picture of it on the menu and not all bowls have a picture. (You go Glen Coco!) I also love ordering the curry rice. I looove Japanese curry, but I'll only order it if I know I can share it with someone else because I can't finish both dishes by myself. You can definitely get filled up here, which I know sometimes isn't achievable with noodles.
