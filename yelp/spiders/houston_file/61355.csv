Baby Barnaby's////Tried the smoked salmon and the egg white meal with chicken apple sausage. You could actually see the apple chunks! That and the salsa was a bit sweet for my taste, but I loved how fresh everything tasted. Every piece of fruit in the fruit bowl was perfect (compared to the 70% standard at other places).
