Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I love how they have healthy choices and gluttonous choices. Plus a boozy drink list. You can't go wrong with anything here on the menu....except for their salads. Then again, who orders a salad in the AM?‚Äç Go for their quinoa breakfast bowl if you're looking for a hearty healthy vegetarian bowl (minus the egg).
