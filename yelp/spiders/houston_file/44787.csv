Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond is a counter service bakery that offers a lineup of can't-beat pastries. The ceilings are high, the coffee bar is always going, and a Square reader that takes chip cards doesn't stop running (first time I've seen that). Guess it really is 2016. They (shout-out to singular they) sell an array of breads that make you wonder why people ever ate Wonder Bread. Common Bond also has interesting seating: counters line the exterior windows, and a large community table sits in the center.
