Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Thank you for setting up your team meeting in our little restaurant. We appreciate you letting take care of you. For your review, it sounds like our service last night failed to impress you. I apologize for that. I'm going to investigate first thing when I get in today. Our service is an area of personal pride for me. Anything less that stellar service is unacceptable.
