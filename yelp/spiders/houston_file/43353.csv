Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////With the air of a 60s luncheonette, and stylish with stone and natural light, Common Bond makes me feel like indulging upon entering. Then, I enter a hurried line which takes me to the five different treats, displayed like jewelry in a case. While there are only five different kinds, there are many of them. I order three: earl grey tea cream puff, pistachio delicacy, and a dish of lemon cream. I order a cold latte and the BF ordered a cappuccino. Once we sat down, I felt a little less overwhelmed about the crowd. Our coffee drinks were smooth and rich and our barista was helpful and attentive.
