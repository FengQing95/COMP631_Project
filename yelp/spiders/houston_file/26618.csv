The Pit Room////Very cute place- went for lunch on the weekend with my carnivore husband. I don't eat red meat so it was nice to see that they had turkey and chicken options. GO WITH THE CHICKEN TACOS!!! They will melt in your mouth with the juicy chicken, full prices of roasted garlic and melted cheese to die for. I can't wait for an excuse to return for a "cheat day" and load up on the yummy sides like Mac and cheese!
