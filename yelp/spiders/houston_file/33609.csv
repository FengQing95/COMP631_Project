Local Foods////I love Local Foods. The decor, the seating, the atmosphere, the parking availability, the food, the drinks, and the list goes on. I've been here quite a few times and it's always exactly how I remember it. The sandwiches are my favorite and I have a few go-tos. THE TRUFFLED EGG SALAD SANDWICH. I'm not joking. Believe me, I hate egg salad. The only reason I ever ordered this sandwich in the first place is because my mind usually goes blank and I stop reading anything and immediately order after I hear the word 'truffle.' This sandwich is my favorite. The egg salad isn't too 'strong' and the truffle flavor really comes through. Also, I'm a huge fan of anything on that pretzel bun.
