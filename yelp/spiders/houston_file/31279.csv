Local Foods////I died and ended up in sandwich heaven yesterday. I had the pulled pork sandwich with blue cheese and my mouth sang a song of joy. The pork was tender and not over seasoned or tough. I normally don't like blue cheese, but combined with the fresh greens, fig gastrique, and onion jam, I savored each bite! The quinoa salad was crisp and refreshing, each bite was loaded with flavor. It really seemed magical. My girl had the gulf shrimp and blue crab meat sandwich. She kept saying how fresh and delicious the shrimp and crab was. She said it was everything a seafood sandwich should. I think Local Foods just earned some regulars.
