Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We only ordered dessert and brought several croissants home.  I got the turtle brownie it was a little rich for me but still good.  The 5 stars is for the croissant!! They are huge and I thought I wouldn't be able to eat the whole thing but I devoured it.  They were so light and buttery, perfect!
