JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Well actually this took place about a month ago and we are over the situation , we just definitely won't be going back. Also, I doubt your staff would openly admit to doing anything besides what their supposed to do. Lastly, there were NO social distancing at all, usually you have an empty table between each person and the capacity of the building should be cut in half. I wish I took pictures. If I find the receipt by gods grace I'll definitely post it. I wanted to actually call the day it happened but I decided to drop it.
