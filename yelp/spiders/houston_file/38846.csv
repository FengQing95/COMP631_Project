Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a detailed review of your most recent visit. I am so sorry that we did such a poor job executive our menu during your visit. I strongly believe in our menu and offering and I know that we are capable of a much better culinary experience than the one you received. If you would be willing to give us another chance I would love to have you back. Please accept my offer of dinner for two on me and I will personally make your reservation for a day and time of your choosing. If given another chance I can assure you that we will leave a much better and lasting impression. I hope to hear from you soon.
