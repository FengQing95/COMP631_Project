The Pit Room////That being said DO NOT SKIP OUT ON THE BRISKET. That was hands down my favorite, SO TENDER. SO FLAVORFUL. AMAZING. But!!! The recommendation from the gentlemen behind the counter was foe the Turkey. Honestly, I was iffy about it. Not really excited. IT WAS AMAZING. I HIGHLY recommend you try it. I can't believe that would have been one of my last choices here.
