Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great environment and awesome mixologist. I'm a whiskey/bourbon girl so I truly appreciated my drink...I can't remember the name but it has a citrus flavor which complimented the whiskey very well. The heirloom tomato bisque served with the grilled cheese sandwich was amazing.
