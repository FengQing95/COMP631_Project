Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Delicious bakery goods. I got here around 10:00am on a friday and they were out of a lot of items in the bakery. I got a fruit croissant a delight for a sweet lovers. There is not actual fruit in it but instead it has fruit jelly and almond sprinkles.i had some orange juice freshly squeezed. Parking is a problem I had street park. Customer service is awesome!!! Ambience is upbeat they even had one of my favorite sings 'I got sunshine'.
