The Pit Room////The portions are great, and I felt like the service was great too! I feel like even though there were a lot of people there at the time that we went, seating wasn't a huge problem because people ate and left. By the time we finished ordering our food, someone had left and we were able to get a table. It definitely hits the spot if you're craving BBQ.
