JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This spot is a gem. Thought we were lucky because we came here on a Wednesday evening and got seated right away. I ordered their #2 famous hot spicy chicken ramen and upgraded it with an egg. The broth was very tasty. My friend ordered the wonton ramen and she loved it too. Definitely my favorite place for ramen!
