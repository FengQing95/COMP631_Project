JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love this place. The atmosphere is fun with community table seating. The ramen was delicious.  The broth is outstanding and the pork belly and soft eggs are perfectly prepared. My favorite Houston ramen restaurant. Be prepared to wait a bit for a seat.  It is totally worth the wait.
