Kata Robata////Wagyu Katsu Sando - When I spotted this on the menu, I immediately wanted this. Thank goodness I ordered it, it was pure deliciousness! The meat melted in your mouth and the bread was so soft, yet crispy on the outside because of the toasting. It was the best sando I have ever had in my life.
