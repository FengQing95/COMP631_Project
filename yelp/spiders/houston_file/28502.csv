The Pit Room////Hitting several BBQ spots while here in Houston and The Pit Room has been my favorite so far. This place is simply amazing and the service was very fast and friendly. They had several different sauces to accompany your meat if you so desired and each one was delicious. Also their pickled bar had lots of options and were spot on bursting with flavor.
