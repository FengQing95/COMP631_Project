JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA is probably one of the top ramen restaurants in Houston. I've sat in the booths and community tables before when dining here and find both experiences pleasant. You can also meet other people at the community table which is a neat experience unless you're antisocial and don't prefer sitting with strangers and sharing a table. I love the light fixtures and ambiance of the restaurant.
