JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////By the time we sat down we were so hungry and just ready to order but our waiter wasn't around. They seemed to have been short staffed that night or something...I'm not sure. I also noticed they increased the price of all their dishes which was really disappointing, but what can you do.
