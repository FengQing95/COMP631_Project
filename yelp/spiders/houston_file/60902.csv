Baby Barnaby's////Just average brunch food. I got the green eggs and tried a bite of the French toast. With the green eggs, I asked for the chicken sausage which was really flavorful. The breakfast potatoes were bland and nothing special. The French toast was subpar. I'd definitely try something else here, but if you're looking for normal breakfast food come here!
