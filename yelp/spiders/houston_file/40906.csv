Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I went ahead and ordered the Carolina BBQ salmon, the fish was cooked perfectly, pink & glistening in the inside. My spinach complemented the salmon; I didn't really enjoy the BBQ sauce, so next time I'll just ask them not to put it on. I will say that I enjoyed my salmon 10 times more than the shrimp & grits. I'm not a chef but my advice is whoever is the chef needs to reevaluate that tomato sauce because it was out of line. It literally overpowered the entire dish.
