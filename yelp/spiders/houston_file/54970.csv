Kata Robata////-- Miso Lobster Mac n' Cheese: YOU GUYZZZ, you were so right. This dish has been praised a hundred times over by Yelpers and I whole-heartedly agree. It's rich and velvety, not overly cheesy, and there are chunks upon chunks of sweet lobster meat. My man is usually a gentleman when it comes to letting me have the last bite, but I swear, we were having ourselves a good ol' fashioned stare-down.
