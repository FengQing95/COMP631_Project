Local Foods////In our usual fashion, we were all waffling between several dishes. The reviews for basically everything this place serves are stellar. Eventually, we settled on ordering three different sandwiches and sharing part of it. The young man behind the counter sported some overalls. I had to inquire after them and he said he even has a dress pair. Ladies, he's looking for a special someone that will embrace his fashion choices. Just saying. He was a delight at the counter and made my experience ordering quick and easy.
