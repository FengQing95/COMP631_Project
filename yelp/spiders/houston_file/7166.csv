JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We came here on Saturday around 1:30 PM and luckily there was no wait around that time. Right after we came in though, there seems to be a wait. We got a table for 3 in the crowded restaurant. We ordered the tonkotsu ramen and spicy miso ramen. Both tasted delicious! But my favorite got to be the tonkotsu, which is a surprise to me since I typically like miso better. For some reason, their miso ramen is more salty than the tonkotsu one. I also like the thin noodles of the tonkotsu one more. We also got to pork buns to try and the meat is so soft you can't even tell that it's pork!!! It tastes like butter. We also got the tacoyaki to share and those were both beautiful and tasty! One of the best tacoyaki I have ever had! Everything came out pretty quickly, and our waitress was also quite attentive. There is just one little thing to note - we asked for 3 small bowls to share the ramen, and they brought out 3 that seem to be not that clean, so we asked for 3 other. And they quickly gave us 3 other clean one. But overall, it's definitely worth coming back to for the food quality.
