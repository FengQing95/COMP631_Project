Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I was surprised by the flakiness and softness of the croissant! Easily the best I've ever had. The latte was great, light and relaxing. I would to come again, however I went with my baby in her stroller (chicco) and it was a pain! It's a spacious space cramped with too many tables and chairs. The line to order was too skinny and I had had this round mini posts which I had to keep lifting my stroller over. By the way it was around 12 on a Tuesday and it was a full house. I found a table on the back but I could sit there because there was space to put the stroller close to the table without blocking the way. (Mind you, I was looking for a table with one of the cashiers because she was holding my croissant-I couldn't make up my mind in the beginning of the line if I wanted pastries or not, the lady behind the pastries area seemed miserable and unfriendly. The cashier girl was actually nice and patient) So we then spotted a good table with space around for the stroller but it was dirty, so the cashier cleaned it quickly and that was that. Loud atmosphere, don't go there by yourself if you're looking to enjoy a relaxing cup of coffee. Go with your friends, coworkers, it's definitely a place to go and chat. Not so much for relaxing or getting work done
