Kata Robata////Only had time to pop in for a lunch. Walked in and there's business people everywhere. I like it already! I was on a time crunch and had to get going fast and ordered a sashimi bento box. I like variety in my meals. 6 pieces of sashimi, agedashi tofu, seaweed salad, california roll and some grilled chicken. The sashimi is extremely fresh. Tuna melted in my mouth. I loved the agedashi tofu the bento box came with as well. It was fried perfectly.
