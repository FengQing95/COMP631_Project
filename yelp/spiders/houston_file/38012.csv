Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////It was okay. I wasn't blown away by brunch. I feel like our waiter could have been more descriptive about their unique menu and ways of making traditional meals not traditional. That would have prevented us from sending food back. Other than that the ambiance was good and the service was pretty great as well.
