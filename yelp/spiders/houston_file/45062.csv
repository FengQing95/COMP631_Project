Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love Common Bond! A friend brought me here to grab some pastries on my latest visit to Houston. I got a pistachio croissant, a goat cheese and fig macaroon, and a strawberry patchouli macaroon. I liked the strawberry macaroon and the croissant a lot, but I was not a huge fan of the fig macaroon. The goat cheese aspect of it was great, but the fig was a little strange for me. The atmosphere of the place is lofty, open, and clean, but it fills up very quickly. Especially on weekend mornings! It is worth waiting in line for.
