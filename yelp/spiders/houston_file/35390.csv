Local Foods////I loved Local Foods in Rice Village! Order yourself at the counter, not much wait time, ample seating with an elevated feel to it. Nice option for last minute brunch. Tons of vegan options (eg vegan sushi, vegan sandwiches, vegan brownie) & a local grocery inside w food from around the world -- lots of organic & vegan items
