Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My Wife and I had an amazing weekend in Houston and was well complemented with our visit to BOSSCAT!! It was the 7th game Astro's VS Yankees and we stayed for 5 hours drinking and eating our fill! The food was phenomenal and the whisky flights made everything that much better, great recommendations. We were welcomed by the entire staff and the bartenders made us feel like locals being that we are from Minnesota. I highly highly recommend this establishment to anyone looking for the complete dining experience. Cheers!
