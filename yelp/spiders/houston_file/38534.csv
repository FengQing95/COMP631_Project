Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Okay, so my brother in law had his birthday dinner here Monday (June 10th). The location is cool and the ambience is nice. Tv's, lots of whiskey (but I don't drink), and just a fun atmosphere with the right people with you. The food? Horrible! People must go here to drink and drink only. Service? Our particular waiter absolutely took advantage of the automatic gratuity (due to our party size I assume) because we would see him every 25-35 minutes. We had to summon a random waiter to tell our waiter we were ready to order. And I believe they forgot to put my order in (I ordered the lump crab pasta in a vodka sauce) because they ended up comping it. (I didn't eat it, because it was horrible). Too much tomato or something it had a very weird after taste and flavor altogether. My husband and also ordered fried oysters. Okay, yuck, it was gritty and basically mushy so they were probably from frozen. Smh. Our tab was still almost $100. My husband ordered the $20 steak because it was steak night. He said it was ok. Not all places will satisfy your pallet, I get it. But for the prices and automatic gratuity with a half filled restaurant, COME ON!! Make sure your service is on point!! I use to wait and bartend I know how this game goes.. he didn't seem to have other tables because most of the guest were sitting at the bar! Anywho, as much as my husband and I dine out, we will NEVER come back. Unless there's another birthday and we will know to eat before we get there. Husband did like his drinks. And I had a seasonal lemonade that was good. Poor, poor service, very subpar food, but drinks and atmosphere beautiful .
