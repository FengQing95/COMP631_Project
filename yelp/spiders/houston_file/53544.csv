Kata Robata////we ordered calamari as an appetizer and it was surprisingly good. I wasent expecting that. The waiter was very excited and gungho about this Sapporo beer bong and sold it to us pretty well. Having been a stereotypical binge drinker in college I was expecting a funnel with a tube and got really excited, but I was still equally excited when we got the arrangement at the table. To give you a rough idea, it was like the water cooler at work. but filled with beer.
