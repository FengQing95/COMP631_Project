JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have never had bad food at Jinya, whether it was at this location or others. I always get the same thing, the Vegan Spicy Creamy Ramen, and I always have at least half left over to take home. There had been one time recently where service wasn't the best but the server was very sweet and corrected the errors quickly. Definitely will be back over and over again!
