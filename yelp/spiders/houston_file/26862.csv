The Pit Room////We bought the brisket and sausage with charro beans. Had more than enough food for three adults! My daughter even made a sandwich for lunch the next day with the remaining meat. Very delicious and tender! The sauce (on the side) was delightful, too! The sausage was nicely seasoned. We didn't ask for the bread, but that would have been nice to have.
