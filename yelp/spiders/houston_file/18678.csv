Uchi////lets take a quick aside.  $12 for a carafe of coffee.  I am perfectly ok with this.  generously sized (that was nice), french press, filtered water, generous cups, creamers at the table.  wish they provided more raw sugar packets, but hey, who ever does, right !?  in theory, everything sounds good with the world.  except that the coffee is complete garbage.  its thin as the water itself but still finds a way to ruin the palette.  they might as well be using sysco.
