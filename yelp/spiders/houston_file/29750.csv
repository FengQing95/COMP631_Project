The Pit Room////If y'all can see in the video, this beef rib was cut from a healthy beefy cow, that cows life was sacrificed with honor and the cow was ready to be served to fill someone's stomach... and it was my stomach that was filled. As me and my nephew tore into this beef rib, juices poured down the side and while I tore a piece of the fatty part of the rib all I could do was just prepare for my taste buds to get a Mike Tyson short right hook because that thang was oozing with flavor! Packed lunch with every bite, we took some of it home because we couldn't finish it all but I almost held my nephew at gun point to see who would take the rest of it home Â
