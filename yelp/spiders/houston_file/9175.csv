JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Chidinma - Thank you very much for the 5-star follow-up review. Your words are supremely valuable to us because it means one thing: We are consistent with our food and service. This is every restaurateur's goal. That said, regular customers such as yourself also keep our lights on and our families fed, so on behalf of the 50+ employees who work at JINYA-Midtown: Thank you!
