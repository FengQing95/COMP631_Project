JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Kunal - Thank you for your great review. And for understanding our extended wait times for large parties during peak hours. We only have 89 seats in our house (including the nine first-come, first-serve stools at the bar), so we have to do our best with what we have available. Thank you, though, for your kind words, and we hope you'll visit us again soon.
