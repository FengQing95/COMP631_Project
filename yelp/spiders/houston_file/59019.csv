Baby Barnaby's////Our server was friendly and quick. Our drinks (fresh squeezed OJ with one of those orange-squeezing machines!) and our orders were served to us really quickly. In fact, some of the people who were seated right before us were already chomping down on their food when we finished ordering, so I felt assured that our food would be out soon.
