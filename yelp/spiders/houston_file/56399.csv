Kata Robata////Nice place and very busy for lunch so if you want to come for dinner, I would recommend a reservation.  Had the Longhorn for $17 (fried shrimp, freshwater eel, avocado, spicy mayo, three kinds of tobiko, unagi sauce), the Rising Sun $18 (yellowtail, avocado, peppercorn tuna, truffle vinaigrette), and the Texas Hamachi $18 (yellowtail, spicy tuna, freshwater eel, fried shrimp, yuzu juice, jalapeños, sea salt).  All were excellent and I would highly recommend!  A nice plus was that Jeff Bagwell, the Astros Hall of Famer was there picking up an order!
