Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First time dinning at Bosscat. The food and service was excellent. Omar was our server and treated us well. My husband is always on a hunt for hard to get Whiskey and this place has a Whiskey room. Omar gave us a tour of the Whiskey room, and inside we met Chef Rich who was working but was more than happy to talk to us about the bottles inside this special room. If either one of you is reading this, thank you for the awesome service, food and taking the time to talk to us. Enjoy a Damn Good Whiskey!!!
