JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////What better to have for dinner; Ramen!!! I had the Spicy Chicken Ramen with extra Spinach and Crispy Chicken. My total was $17 and change! It was delicious!!! The Ramen was delicious!!! The chicken on the side kind of reminded me of chicken bites that were dark meat; they were ok. Could have probably done without. The way it's package there was a side salad of some sort on the side which my chicken was sitting in. I ended up having to get my meal to go because this place was slammed packed! There were people everywhere outside just waiting to be seated.
