Uchi////I love Uchi for their social hour (5-6:30 daily) - great way to try a lot of items for a cheaper price (the portion is smaller as well). I love their food but I will say, we usually spend about $100 when Kyle and I go and still leave a little hungry. However the food is absolutely amazing and I will keep coming back forever. When we got there at 4:50 there was already a line waiting to get in and even with reservations for 5:00, we had to wait in line. However, it moved quickly and we were sat at 5:03. The place filled up quickly which caused some dishes to take a little longer but it was fine. Great meal every time.
