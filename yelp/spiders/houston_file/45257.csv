Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I came prepared to wait as previously mentioned by other yelpers ..the line moves but it is a bit confusing that they take your food and drink order separate. The tip on the extra parking lot was super helpful as well! For the amount of people in the restaurant we got a table pretty quickly outside under an umbrella however I had to buss it myself.
