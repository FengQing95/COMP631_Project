Uchi////Tonight we dined at Uchi for the second time and it definitely passed the test for consistency of a gourmet 5 star city restaurant! Superb! The flavors in each dish are exquisite! The service is impeccable. Make a reservation, arrive on time, order away and enjoy! I would recommend 5-7 dishes per person minimum as the entries are very small. Take your time with each one and indulge ;-)
