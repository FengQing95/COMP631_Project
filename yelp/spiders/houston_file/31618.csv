Local Foods////This trendy little restaurant is a sure bet for delicious and fresh soups, salads and sandwiches. I ordered the truffled egg sandwich with kale and beets as my sides. Everything was phenomenal. I think my favorite part of the meal was the kale...absolutely delicious! The menu is fairly small, but the variety is good.
