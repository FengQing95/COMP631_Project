Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Drinks: I was very disappointed by the espresso drinks here--you're much better off going to one of the many coffeeshops nearby. They do serve Boomtown's brewed coffee, so black coffee may be the better selection if you need your caffeine fix with brunch. The morning cocktail selection is sure to satisfy your basic brunch girl needs. Lots of mimosa flavors, peach basil bellinis, morning margs, and even boozy coffee.
