Uchi////I seriously do not understand the hype to this place. I thought the food was ok at best especially considering the price despite going during happy hour. Maybe because I'm comparing this Japanese-Western fusion restaurant to the ones we have in Toronto but still doesn't explain why they have eggplant on a ball of rice..
