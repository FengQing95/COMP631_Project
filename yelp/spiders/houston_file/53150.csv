Kata Robata////All in all, this place is a winner. It is pricey, it is often crowded, the service is at times slow, there are times when they don't have what we want and even times when what we've ordered never makes it to the table. These are all small inconveniences that I'm willing to overlook for the sake of EXCELLENT food. No place is perfect, but the quality of the food here comes pretty darn close!
