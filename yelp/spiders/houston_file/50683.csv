Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Now for the food, the reason we're here. I got the OMG French toast. Very delicious BUT dry compared to the thousand pictures I had seen online. The gang got the flight pancakes to share and the ratings were: #1 chocolate chip, #2 danish ("too much happening at once"), and #3 sweet potato pancake (was only half way eaten). All in all the food was ok. Would I return and wait an hour standing for it? Naaaaa.
