Uchi////The rolls here were so unique that I couldn't even remember the names or how to describe half of them, but the flavors were out of this world. I'm not a fan of Uni, and never have been, but the uni here was spectacular. The chefs found a way to enhance and mix in complimenting flavors so the "oceany" and "fishyness" of the uni did not overwhelm the taste palette like it typically does on its own. Hints of citrus along with a scallop foam complimented yet didn't entirely cover the uni flavor. If uni always tasted this way, I would literally eat it every day! It takes talent to bring out the best in dishes that people may normally be too shy to try.
