Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Their mimosas are good!! Breakfast was... generic at best. We went there because if their ratings on Google and... well... they were ok. The hash browns were soggy and the omelette was bland. Their candied bacon was ok. I had the pumpkin pancake which was good. Â Not my favorite place but in a pinch it will be fine.
