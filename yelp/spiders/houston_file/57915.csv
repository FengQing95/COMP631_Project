Kata Robata////Let me start off by letting you know that Katie Velez was a great server. She made sure that we were comfortable and ready to take our order. When we walked in automatically greeted as it should be always. We love this place for the food and ambience. Social distancing rules enforced as well as mask which was great. This day we wanted to try the Wagyu sando which we've heard only great things about it. They also have a lobster version on the menu. Since they have real Japanese Wagyu we had to get some of that before we left. As a dumpling lover I had to try the Wagyu Shumai as well. If you haven't had Japanese Wagyu you are missing out. La pièce de résistance was the Wagyu nigiri that just melts in your mouth. Our final item was dessert. We ordered the banana crème brûlée with extra Nutella foam. This place has been in my top restaurants choices for years now.
