The Pit Room////Now on to the food, I tried the brisket, pulled pork, sausage. Brisket was really nothing special, almost borderline tough. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to request for fatty brisket. Sausage almost felt overcooked, the sausage liner was more chewy than snappy, and hard to bite through. I enjoyed the pulled pork, definitely flavored different from the pulled pork I get at other establishments, and it's a good thing.
