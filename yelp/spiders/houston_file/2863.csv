JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Much better as "dine in". Many variations of ramen to fit your craving for the day. My favorite is still tonkotsu but my wife prefers miso. Service was excellent and they're very accommodating if you want something swapped or removed. Green tea mochi was also excellent, one of the best in the city.
