Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The atmosphere is light and sunny and the servers are friendly. Parking is a hassle but I've been fortunate enough to either find a spot out front or around the block. I've gotten in without a wait and I've also had a 20-minuteâ€‹ wait all dependent on the day and time that I visit. All in all, it's a cool spot!
