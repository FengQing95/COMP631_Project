Kata Robata////We started off with the Texas Kobe beef skewers and foie gras and duck cold soba. The beef skewers were so juicy and flavorful! It had a perfect sear on the outside and was tender on the inside. The cold soba noodles were great after the skewers. The vinaigrette helped break down the fattiness of the beef from before and was very refreshing. However, we found the duck breast to be a bit tough and chewy.
