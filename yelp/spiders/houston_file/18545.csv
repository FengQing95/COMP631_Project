Uchi////This place is amazing!  The food and service were both exceptional.  If you can, do the chef's tasting menu.  OMG.  The flavors are so clean and pair so nicely together.  The waiters will bring you plate after plate and explain exactly what you're about to enjoy.  If it wasn't for the long wait time and it being quite expensive, I would be here all the time.  Definitely a splurge for a special occasion.
