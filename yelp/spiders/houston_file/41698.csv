Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So far, I've tried the almond croissants, the kouign amann (pronounced queen amann), and the sugar brioche.  All have been fantastic, thought I think the kouign amann is the best of the three.  I've had a cappuccino as well, and that was also great.  I just love the look and feel of the place, though the lines can get a bit much if you're going at morning rush.  I just feel lucky to have a bakery like this in the area.
