Local Foods////First of all, I really dig their decor. It's sort of industrial-vintage chic meets IKEA. LOL When I went in (it was a weekday at lunchtime), it was really busy, which is always a good sign. Their service is a walk-up counter at which you place your order, which is not uncommon these days. I think it helps speed things along and it's nice to not have to tip any servers.
