Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Definitely highly recommend their chocolate chip walnut cookies!! We've seen people grabbing two of those per person when we visited and soooo glad we got those as well. Surprised that not many reviewers mention them here. It hit just the spot for my chocolate chip cookie crave and they look just like the trendy thicc Levain Bakery's NYC chocolate chip walnut cookies!! So so good.
