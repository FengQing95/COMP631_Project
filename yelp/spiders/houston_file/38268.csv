Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First off the service was amazing !! This is my first time visiting this restaurant and I will be back very soon. Our waiter Victor was spot on with his description of the food. He was also very nice and made us really enjoy our night. I had the quinoa and mushroom burger and it is one of the best veggie burgers I've had. The comeback sauce was so good as well. One of my new fave restaurants in Houston now.
