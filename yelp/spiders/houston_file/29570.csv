The Pit Room////I knew I was gonna love it when I was greeted by a staff member with a mouth full of golds. He looked like someone i could trust to recommend good bbq! I had the two meat dinner and got venison sausage and pork ribs. The sausage had so much flavor and the perfect amount of spice and the ribs came right off the bone! So much tenderness. For my sides i chose the green beans and macaroni. The green beans were blistered with tomato and either shallots or onion and perfectly flavored. The macaroni was a stove top type so not my preference but still pretty decent. I'd definitely come back on a future visit to Houston.
