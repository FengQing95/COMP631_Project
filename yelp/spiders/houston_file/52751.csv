Kata Robata////It was Saturday in night in Houston and we were seeking a sushi place. We had originally planned on going to see Furious 7 but it was sold out so we were disappointed. We found Kata Robata on Yelp and figured it looked OK, and there was no wait. We were promptly seated and ordered the shumai to being with. Our waitress (Kellyn?) was amazing; she was very personable, knowledgeable and radiated positive energy. She recommended some rolls for us to try next, including: the Toro and Short Rib, the Texas Hamachi and the Tropical Spicy Tuna...WOW, they were absolutely AMAZING. The flavors were spectacular; honestly, probably some of the best sushi I've had (and I've been all over the world). We finished the meal off with the chocolate mousse, which was equally splendid. All in all, it was one of the most fulfilling spontaneous dinning experience I've had...I had been so disappointed to miss Furious 7 but ended up finding this gem of a place. Great atmosphere too, nice lighting, decent pricing and good ambiance. Expect to spend about $100 for two if you order a couple of drinks.
