Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place was the BOMB.  First, selection of Whiskey is awesome!  Atmosphere great.  The Menu... wow.  We never got past the appetizers.  We'll have to go back.  Had the Poutine... soooo good.  Pig Candy was delish. Husband said Kimchi was a bit fishy but I loved it.  Had the chicken flat bread pizza. Didn't like the large piece of tomato, but still yummy.  This place was soooo good and and waiter was great.  Can't wait to go back.
