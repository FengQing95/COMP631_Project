JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place was REALLY good, the server was super nice all around but wasn't really attentive and made the experience kind of disappointing. We had to ask about 3-4 different people for water, hot sauce and other things. It wasn't terrible but servers should be attentive to all customers. She only really cared about the bill and that's it but I will be back. (Food is five stars)
