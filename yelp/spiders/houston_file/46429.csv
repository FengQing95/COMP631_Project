Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been to Common Bond several times to do work during the afternoon. I love the atmosphere at this bakery - large windows with lots of light, plenty of tables to work, and the wonderful smell of baked goods. I had only ordered tea and pastries before, but I finally went there for breakfast the other day. For a Wednesday morning, there were a lot of people around. It was about half full when I got there around 8, but it was pretty full by the time I left at 9.
