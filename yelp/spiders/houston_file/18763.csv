Uchi////In addition to the sushi menu we also tried the foie gras nagiri which was very flavorful and a great way to end our meal.  We sat at the sushi bar and the chef also made us a special roll that was amazing.  The staff was super prompt, and the sushi chef really guided us through our experience.  This was honestly one of the few times in my life I was bragging to friends and family about my meal as I was eating it.  I can't wait to eat here again.
