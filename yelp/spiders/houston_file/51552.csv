Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great food! Loved their food at their Fort Worth location and this place puts out great stuff as well. The breakfast burrito with bacon and egg can feed a small family of four and be sure to ask for extra green chili sauce. You can't go wrong either Â if you decide to split the pineapple upside down pancake with a friend.
