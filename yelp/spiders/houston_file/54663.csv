Kata Robata////I really enjoyed lunch at Kata Robata. The food was phenomenal. I ended up getting a ramen noodle soup, which they gladly made without meat to accommodate my vegetarian needs. My server was Lily and she was very sweet and helpful. My only complaints were that my food came out several minutes before my sister's food, which is a huge pet peeve of mine, and the hostess was not very helpful. When she saw me, she just stared until I spoke. When I walked in, I told her I was looking for my sister and if she could guide me in her direction that would be great. The hostess said she didn't remember anyone coming in and to just look around. I used to work as a hostess and that's not the optimal response, but other than that, it was great food and a very trendy atmosphere.
