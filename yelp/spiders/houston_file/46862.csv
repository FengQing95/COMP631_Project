Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Ultimately restaurants eat what they serve (as in reap what you sow)...and Snooze should be well-fed....as they are excellent at purveying yummy food with stellar service.  Anyone seeking to join the ranks of restaurants should dine a few times here.  We braved the postage-stamp parking lot and commensurate wait-list to be rewarded with gentle, cordial and well-trained service.....and an extensive menu of interestingly inventive breakfasty delights.  I suspended my veganness for the Early Harvest Benny (as in Benedict), which is a savory delight.  Also tried the Snooze Spuds Deluxe including soy chorizo....also well-crafted.  The service is so superior that....when a new hostess erred, seating us in an outdoor 'waiting' area...several staff rushed to smooth our (unruffled) feathers....also comping a Pineapple Upside Down Pancake slathered with cinnamon butter!  The outdoor tables share space with a  parking lot, which can sometimes be unpleasant....so they also provided an 'Oops!' credit on the check.  No wonder these folks have built a score of restaurants in a few years.
