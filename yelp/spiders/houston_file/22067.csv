Uchi////Just very disappointed with our waitress Lori and the common enjoyment of eating sushi. The people in my party drink but I don't drink. It was frowned upon when I asked for an ice tea to say the least. She was rude when she didn't describe into detail of the sushi item to my friend when ordered and when it came it wasn't what he ordered. Than told him he was wrong and it was his fault. The pride these people have is more of an Arrogance and Snob demeanor. They tell you how to drink, when to eat, and how to eat... if you are into the kind of thing... I am not. I felt the menu was weak and mediocre for the price you pay. I Do Not recommend this place one bit. You will get better services and food at less of the price somewhere else.
