Uchi////As for the other dishes, I wasn't wildly impressed, but I could tell the fish/meat was all very high quality. I ordered the yellowtail happy hour sushi, which was ok, and the daily special beef tartare, which was also ok. I also tried the hamachi nabe, which I did think was very tasty (and the most substantial of the dishes we ordered) but nothing out of this world.
