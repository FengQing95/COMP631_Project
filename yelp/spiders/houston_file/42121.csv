Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////When I first discovered Common Bond and had to describe it to friends, I said it was "like if J.Crew opened a coffee shop." And I still stand by this description. Interior design-wise, the colorful stripes look like something right out of J.Crew's catalogs and the prices are just as high.
