Uchi////TL;DR: The Verdict?  Uchi is like an expensive 25 year old bottle of Scotch. Unless you're rich out the ass, you only drink it when the mood strikes or if there's a special occasion.  You can drink it to get drunk, but it'll cost you dearly.  It's a bottle you whip out to impress a cute date or a group of out-of-town friends.  It's something you've got to try at least once, but there are plenty of substitutes and alternatives available if it's not your thing.
