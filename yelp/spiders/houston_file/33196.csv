Local Foods////In support of the local breweries around town you will find your typical Karbach brews like "Weisse Vers" and "Hopadillo IPA" and they even support ATX (Austin) beers too with the 512 brewing co. on tap and bottles of "Convict Hill Oatmeal Stout" from Independence Brewing Co. available near the front counter! Now that's love. They also have wine for sale, but the best beverage of all is that oh so sweet, gold goodness that is Mint-ade, made with fresh orange, lemon, lime and grapefruit juice and mint leaves - It's a MUST TRY! (mix with the unsweetened tea for a real treat). I couldn't leave without getting some to-go a.k.a. "a roadie".
