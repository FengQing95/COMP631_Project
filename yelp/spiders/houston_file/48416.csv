Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We should have known better than to arrive at a brunch spot on Saturday morning with no reservations, but the staff at Snooze seated us within 15 minutes of our arrival. We had some delicious mimosas while we waited-- I had the Garden mimosa, which was mostly sparkling wine... what a way to start the day! Despite sitting outside, our experience was very pleasant. The coffee was excellent, and the diverse menu made it difficult to choose. I settled on the Benny Goodman, a mashup of the classic cream cheese and lox and eggs Benedict, and my partner had (admittedly average) breakfast tacos. We will definitely return to try the more unique breakfast items, as it's clear that's where Snooze shines.
