Kata Robata////Made reservations through Open Table on Yelp and had no problem finding a table for 3 on a weekday evening. Our service (contrary to other reviewers) was excellent; our waitress was incredibly friendly and professional, she brought all our dishes out quickly and explained each one and how to eat it properly (otherwise I would have eaten it like a caveman would, I guess). At one point we even saw 2 other fellow waiters helping her clear dishes from our table...seeing such camaraderie warmed our hearts.
