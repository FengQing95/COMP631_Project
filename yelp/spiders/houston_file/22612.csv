Uchi////My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner and I can honestly say that I have not forgotten about the zero sen. Though everything else was amazing, it was, hands down, the best thing I've ever tasted. I'm only disappointed that it was the first dish that came out because it kinda ruined the others that followed.
