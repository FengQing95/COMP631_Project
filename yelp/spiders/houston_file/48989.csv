Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I'd give the food a 4 stars rating, however the lack of parking and long wait time really knocks it down for me. I came around 10 am on a Friday and had to wait about 45 min for a seat and another 45 min for the food. We parked in the street. However the staff was very nice and accommodating.
