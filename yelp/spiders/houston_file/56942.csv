Kata Robata////Second time here . Had reservations and it's packed inside. Seems like all the staffs running around like it's a race to win it all. We were seated down after a drink at the bar while they set everything up. Drinks are on point but a little overpriced as their food also. We ordered a bunch of items and it was high quality and we are pretty satisfied with the items we ordered. It's one of the best I had so far in Texas. Staffs are friendly and informative.
