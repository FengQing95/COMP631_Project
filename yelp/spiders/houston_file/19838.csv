Uchi////On to the menu....you need someone to walk you through it especially if you have as many limitations at your table as we did.  We were dealing with kosher, gluten free and no raw fish...the waiter was able to help us find great dishes to share and make everyone happy.  The menu is hard to navigate without help, so come prepared to explore and ask a lot of questions.  Everything is intended for sharing, so everyone had a few bites.  There is something to be said about having an entree to devour yourself, but Uchi is a food adventure.  It's fun to have a few bites, but it does leave you wanting more of the dishes you especially love.
