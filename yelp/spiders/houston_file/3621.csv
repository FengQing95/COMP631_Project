JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was very skeptical about coming here. I've been seriously disappointed by trendy restaurants here on Yelp. Ramen seems like the newest fad and the place is in midtown. This screamed over hyped, overpriced, underwhelming experience to me. But I was intrigued, browsed the menu and was drawn in. Fortunately, I was completely wrong about ramen and this place in particular. The prices were reasonable for a nice dinning experience and the food was fantastic. It was busy, but not crazy. The portions were huge to me, but it's mostly broth and veggies so I gorged myself without feeling bloated or disgusting afterwards. The service was good (though I was pretty much alone at the bar so who knows). If you've never tried ramen before and are curious what the fuss is about, this a good place to start. Most of the other places I looked at seemed overwhelming, like they were designed for people with very particular ramen tastes to design their own recipes. This place just recommends combinations that work well together and I think they did a fantastic job. The free parking garage is also a huge plus as it takes the pain of parking out of the equation. Highly recommended!
