Uchi////Uchi's philosophy is to "local seasonal ingredients with an infinite spectrum of seafood from around the globe" and "we invite our diners to explore their gastronomic boundaries by pairing traditional Japanese offerings with new and refreshing flavors and textures" My dining experience spoke directly to Uchi's philosophy. The freshness of each ingredient, unique flavor combinations, and sense erupting textures and smells made Uchi one of the most amazing dining experiences that I have ever experienced. Everything aspect of the experience from start to finish was truly amazing. And this ladies and gentlemen, was only the second night that it was open. So Uchi-Houston has not even yet to hit its stride!!
