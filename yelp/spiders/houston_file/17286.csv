Uchi////Definitely "an experience." Take your waiter's lead on his/her recommendations - they will steer you right. The most memorable bites include the ham & eggs (pork belly) and hama chili. The hot rocks were neat (again, the "experience") but it is hard to justify the amount of food with the price.
