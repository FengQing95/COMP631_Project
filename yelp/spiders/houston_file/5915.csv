JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As a former Austinite and frequent visitor of Ramen Tatsu-Ya, my tastebuds have been on the search for a good ramen spot in HTX to no avail. Came here on a Thursday night around 6:30 pm and it was poppin'. My friend and I were surprised to be seated right away in a small booth and the waitress came by to take our orders shortly.
