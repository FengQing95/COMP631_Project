Kata Robata////I come here ALL the time and love everything about this place. The food is very fresh and creative. My new favorite roll is the toro and beef..think surf and turf. I've had pretty much everything, but my usual order consist of miso cod, Kobe beef skewers, toro and short rib roll and the Texas hamachi roll. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu!
