Uchi////OMG!!  This is probably the best meal I've had in a long time!!  It lived up to all the hype and surpassed it!!  Everything was perfect - the food was super fresh and delicious, the wait staff was amazing and knowledgeable and the place looks fabulous!!  They take every dish you've had at other sushi restaurants and take it to the next level!!  Everything we had was amazing but I recommend you don't miss the scallops (was a special that night), hama chili, walu walu, the brussel sprouts and the fried milk - SO good!!  Even the edamame has a spin in that they grill it - I'll never eat plain steamed edamame again!! Cannot wait to go back!! It is pricey, but oh so worth it!!
