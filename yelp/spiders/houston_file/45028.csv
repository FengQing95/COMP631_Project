Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It's not a complete morning in the H without a few breakfast essentials. Croissants, kouign-amann, baguettes, and so many more baked delights that are simply to-die-for. I loved this place so much that I came back to pick up breakfast treats three days out of the five that we stayed in town.
