Baby Barnaby's////They have the classic diner Breakfast Plate with 2 eggs, grits or potatoes, bacon or sausage, biscuit or toast. This is my default - with eggs cooked to order, crispy bacon, thick creamy grits, and wheat toast - but with so many great options, it's hard to just stick to the usual. The Corned Beef Hash comes out in a large cast iron skillet packed with everything but the kitchen sink, with peppers, onions, potatoes, and topped with eggs. Breakfast Tacos are practically the State Breakfast of Texas, and Barnaby's are deliciosos. Those after a healthier petit dejeuner can go for Bob's Healthy Plate with egg whites, or Annie's Low-Fat Breakfast Burrito. Even Dr. Seuss fans can get their Green Eggs, scrambled with spinach, and though it comes with sausage, I'm sure you can switch it out for some ham, Sam I Am.
