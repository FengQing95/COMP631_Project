Baby Barnaby's////If you follow me at all, you know I'm a sucker for Barnaby's breakfast. Breakfast is my favorite meal and they have my favorite dish. It's basically all I get at any of their locations. I'm not sure if this is their OG spot but  it's definitely their most reviewed.  This location looks like it was a house turned restaurant. Super tiny but lots of character. If you come on a weekend, prepare for a long wait and hard to find parking. The staff here has lots of personality and always makes you feel at home.
