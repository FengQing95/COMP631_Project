Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////When we went the firm alarm was going off. Not because of a fire which meant no one left. It went off for 20 minutes or so. They operated like nothing was happening. And no one seemed to leave. We did wait in line for a while and it's "all the rage" lately so we stayed as well. When it was all over the manager come by to apologize with a coupon for pancakes. But he only seemed to do so when he saw the people who looked annoyed.
