Uchi////The food quality was very good but all of the flavors were very delicate. I can appreciate delicate flavors but not when the service is rushed. We had no time to digest and enjoy the flavors. We got the first 7 courses in about 30 minutes. At one point we were served 3 dishes at once! This was doubly frustrating because we were at a small table. Then there was at least a 30 minute wait before we got the last 3-4 courses. It was a confusing and annoying experience and each dish was served by a different waiter so the service also seemed impersonal.
