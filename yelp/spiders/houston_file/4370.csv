JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place was surprisingly nice, modern and contemporary decor with a very upscale feeling to it.  We had the takoyaki to start off with and ordered a bowl of the tonkotsu black.  The takoyaki came out pretty quickly and looked very appetizing, better than they actually tasted.  The ramen, on the other hand, had a nice, flavorful broth that was just the right amount of richness to it.  I like the broth at ramen tatsuya in Austin, but it gets a bit heavy midway through the bowl.  The chashu just melts in your mouth, and the egg was cooked with a gooey center.   I think a few extra toppings would have been nicer, so I'll be sure to add them next time.  I really like this place since it's open late, so I can satisfy my late night ramen cravings whenever I want and without a long wait! Actually, we came in a little before 1am, so there wasn't a wait at all!
