Local Foods////I just ate here for the first time. Firstly, I will say that the place is very pleasant. It has one of those Austin alternative vibes that I enjoy, compared to the ho hum chain restaurant look that so many places have now. Secondly, the menu: the foods are all sourced from local farms which I like. The choices for lunch were mostly salads and sandwiches.  I ordered a Capered Tuna Sandwich that came with 2 sides...I ordered a white bean and bacon salad, and a kale salad.  The sandwich came out relatively quickly and was (a) very attractive on the plate and (b) tasted delicious.  It was on a fresh ciabatta style roll, a layer of a pesto type dressing, tuna, tomatoes, bacon, and a whole boiled egg. It was really one of the best tuna sandwiches I've had in a long time. The salads were both very fresh and tasty.
