Kata Robata////All I can say is WOW!!! We always stop by Kata Robata each time we visit houston. With each visit, our experience progresses. I highly recommend Sean as your server is you need guidance - he will direct you accordingly and will ensure you have a diverse set of dishes. For 5 star service, I recommend Edward. Both very good servers. The owner Yun knows how to run his operation! The line is always out the door and it's evident why! The last few times, we came to Kata Robata, we sat at the table and ordered dishes a la carte. For my next visit, I will do omakase at the bar with Chef Manabu Horiuchi.
