Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I liked this place. The pastries were really good.  I came in on a Sunday around 230 pm and there was really no line.  I actually like the set up, as you can buy with your eyes first.  We ordered the pistachio croissant, the almond croissant and a few other pastries.
