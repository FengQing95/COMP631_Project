JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Samantha - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry this happened at our Midtown location. I have asked my team to stay on the lookout for this individual in the future and to notify the building's security if he re-enters our establishment. You are correct, though, someone who was working at the front of the business should have notified a manager.
