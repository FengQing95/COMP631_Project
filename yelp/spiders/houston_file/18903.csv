Uchi////One of my favorite items on the menu is the Ham and Eggs: Katsu Pork belly in a roll with espellete powder and served with three tasty dipping sauces. Now the way I like to think about it is: Fried Pork belly (yum) wrapped in rice and served with three flavor enhancing sauces. But the fried pork belly by itself is enough to make my mouth salivate a little. It is one of those dishes that looks so simple and when you bite into it you want absolutely savor every single flavor and you wish that the experience will never end.
