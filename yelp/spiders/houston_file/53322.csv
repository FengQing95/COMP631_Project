Kata Robata////For the second go around, I got the kimchi grits, kobe beef, and the strawberry shortcake. All were delish. Maybe it's b/c customer service was better, but I def felt like my food selection was tastier than last one. I could see why ppl order the kimchi grits for itself. My sister described it as kimchi mashed potatoes. The kobe beef, while small on portions, melted in my food. My favorite portion still is the dessert. I agreed with baby sis that the strawberry shortcake tasted like strawberry yogurt (in a good way!)
