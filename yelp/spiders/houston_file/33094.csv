Local Foods////YUM!! In Houston for a few days...decided to embrace my inner lazy one night and grab take-out to bring back to my hotel. I ordered the falafel sandwich with orzo and cabbage slaw as my sides. Highlight by far was the sandwich...warm and full of a myriad of delicious flavors. The sides were okay...first thought on the orzo was OMG amazing, but the lemon gradually became a bit overwhelming and I had to set it down. I tired of the cabbage slaw as well, though it was fresh and otherwise well-done.
