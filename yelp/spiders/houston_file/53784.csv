Kata Robata////Both of the rolls were pretty tasty. Pretty pricey. We split the ramen and our server split it into two bowls which we thought was super nice (got charged for it, not so nice). But the ramen was really subpar. Actually, it sucked, no need to mince words. Probably because everyone says its awesome and to go try it. Probably because it was lukewarm. Probably because the broth tasted like they threw a bunch of bones and created some mystery stock that simmered for too long, got too concentrated, and they poured water into it and served it.
