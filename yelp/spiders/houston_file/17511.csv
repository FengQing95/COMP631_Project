Uchi////Uchi is one of my favorite restaurants.  The only problem I have is branching out from my 10 favorite items to try new things - but I am always glad when I do.  Machi cure is my favorite dish and the zero zen roll is fabulous as well.   The brussel sprouts and yokai berry are both great....I could go on and on.  I can't say enough good things about the sushi dishes at Uchi.
