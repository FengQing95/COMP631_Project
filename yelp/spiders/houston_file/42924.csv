Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Hands down this is the best bakery in Houston!  I have only tried their pastries so I will only comment on those.  The Kugelhopf is my favorite pastry they have with the Almond Croissant and Kouign Amman coming in at a close second.  Their macaroons are good, especially their salted caramel one.
