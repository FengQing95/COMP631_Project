Baby Barnaby's////this is my go-to place. the food is good, affordable and the atmosphere is laid back (i like that). I make my husband take me to Little Barnaby's (there are two others that are also close to us) because I think it has the friendliest service. green eggs is good, salmon, the lebanese salad is killer, blue cheese/waffle side is yumm and spinach/artichoke dip is another one of our orders.
