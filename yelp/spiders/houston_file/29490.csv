The Pit Room////Because it was my first time having TX BBQ, I really wanted to try brisket. However, they'd sold out all their brisket that night! Nonetheless, I had the chance to try their turkey, venison, and pork ribs. The turkey was surprisingly good (flavorful, and definitely not dry). The venison was delicious, savory, salty, and spiced--it was fantastic in the BBQ sauce. The ribs were *delish*, and definitely my favorite of the items I tried. It was fall-off-the-bone, charred to perfection, and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. 10/10 would recommend.
