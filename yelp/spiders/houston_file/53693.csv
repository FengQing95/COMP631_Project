Kata Robata////Over priced and pretentious. I eat a lot of sushi. This is the first sushi restaurant I've eaten at that serves only a half order for full price. I sat at the sushi bar expecting to be served by the sushi chef, but the sushi chef ignored me and I had to place my order with the wait staff and the sushi was delivered from the kitchen, not the sushi chef. Sushi was decent, but I've had better.
