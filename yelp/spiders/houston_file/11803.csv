JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food that I always ordered would be the JINYA Tonkatsu Black with no green onions and their parmesan fries with truffle ketchup. But recently, they stopped the truffle ketchup, and that made me really sad. Though, the parmesan fries themselves are still good! Their ramen portion, in my opinion, is enough to make a person SOO full!!! The seasoned egg is probably my favorite part of the ramen, because when I split the egg in half, the yolk is still melting! SO DELICIOUS!
