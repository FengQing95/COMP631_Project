Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First timing coming here and I was instantly impressed with the live DJ, the decor, and the ambiance they created with the space. This definitely brings a fresh and west coast style to brunching in Houston. It feels like the perfect Sunday Funday with great music, bottomless mimosas, delicious Latin influenced breakfast dishes. Chef Peter Petro did a great mix of flavors for their brunch dishes. If this was only brunch, then I am excited to attend a dinner here and possible get a chance to tour their whiskey room and try their whiskey selections !!
