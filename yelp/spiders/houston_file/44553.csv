Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have been a regular customer for several years, but the quality as of late has gone downhill. Today, I ordered quiche Lorraine for lunch and a blueberry muffin. The muffin was delicious, but the quiche crust was soggy and grease soaked. I sent it back in hopes that it was an oversight and that I would be brought a quiche with a properly crisp crust, but no. Another soggy crust that made the meal unappetizing, and the girl that brought it to me stated that "they didn't know why." Well, the fat in the pastry has gotten too hot before going in the oven. That's why. The manager saw me send it back and never once came to check on the replacement that was brought out. $14 for an improperly baked quiche and a salad with a drizzle of dressing... Not ok. I think I've finally lost my love affair with this place. Giving 2 stars for the blueberry muffin.
