Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////There are two things to talk about this place. One is the social milieu and the other is the food. This place probably would have been better off opening in the Galleria area as it tends to attract the sort of well to do citizens of the world that one finds shopping in Saks and Nordstrom. People with nannies, second homes and who travel extensively. Inside this place you could be in an airport in Frankfurt, the Upper West Side of Manhattan or in the vicinity of Beverly Hills. That said, scruffy, ill considered attire will make you feel a bit awkward here. Past the crowd that is impressed with itself and its money, is a fine bakery that makes a few missteps Many who have lived here for years will remember Andres bakery over near River Oaks and also have probably fed their bakery addictions at the French Gourmet bakery over on Westheimer, also near River Oaks. This place doesn't replace either of those but is more like a bakery version of Underbelly, which translates to you paying a lot more money for trendy things you've been salivating over on the Food Channel. I am an addict of good baked goods so am generally very happy here. The items mentioned in other reviews
