Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Yum, yum, yum! Â The salmon lox Benny was delicious! I highly recommend it, but it can be a tad salty. The blueberry pancakes were very blueberry. Just as they should be! The danish blueberry pancake was sinful! I ate every bit! If you're in the area you should check out this place. It's a winner!
