Uchi////Zero Sen - was my second favorite dish of the night. Zero Sen is described as a [oiece of yellowtail with avocado, shallot,cilantro, tobiko and yuzu. I believe Cilantro is totally what makes this roll. A normally overpowering herb,adding the few crisp stalks of cilantro in each bite ended up making a refreshing roll that didn't weigh you down.
