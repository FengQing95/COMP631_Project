Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We got seated outside and I recommend telling the hostess to seat you under a shaded area. Unfortunately not all tables are under umbrellas so at a table facing the east you can imagine trying to converse and even see your food. We asked the waitress and another gentlemen working if we could move the umbrella closer because they easily could cover two tables. They said they would "check on it" and then never had the decency to come back and say no or F off or anything. As stated earlier this place is super busy so I understand things slipping through the cracks but it really took away from the experience and that is why I am taking a star away.
