Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////There is a reason this place always has a long lines. The pastries and the bread are some of the best in Houston and cannot be missed. Highly recommend they daily bread selection: Â almond croissants, cookies, kouign amann (my fav), great jams and butter accompanied by incredible breads.
