Kata Robata////I went here for for the first time during HRW 2013 and I'm still drooling over what I ate! I made a reservation for 6:30 for 4. Unfortunately, one in the party didn't arrive til 7:15, but they were very nice about seating us before everyone was there. I guess it helped that it was early in the evening when we went. Also, we were ordering off the regular menu while we waited.
