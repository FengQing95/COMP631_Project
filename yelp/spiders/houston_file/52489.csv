Kata Robata////Kata Robata takes Japanese tapas-style cuisine to an entirely new level.   Besides our standard miso soup, everything we ordered was truly original.  Items of particular note were the Smoked Duck Salad, Miso Lobster and Macaroni and Cheese, Big Eye Tuna Tar Tar, and Gyoza Dumplings.  The sashimi was also fresh and artfully presented.
