Baby Barnaby's////I ordered the low fat, egg white bean burrito. This thing was Chipotle size. It was good, and I liked how they used beans, egg whites, wheat tortilla, etc. But it didn't blow me away or anything. All of their food seems borderline bland. Take my salsa and guac. Bland. And I never add salt to my food, so I can take bland. But this was season-less and bland. I tried some of a friend's potatoes. That was pretty good.
