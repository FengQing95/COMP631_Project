Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////That being said the pastries are perfection. PB&J macaron was an interesting twist and the raspberry pistachio tart was almost too beautiful to eat. Can't wait to visit again and see what other creations they offer. Maybe over time I can prove my taste to be "sophisticated" enough to merit a response from the staff :)
