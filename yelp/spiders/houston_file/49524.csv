Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've only been once but I'm not quite on the bandwagon. I had heard such wonderful things about Snooze, and was SO excited to try their pancake flight, but didn't feel like they were outstanding or unique. The rest of their menu seemed somewhat standard as well. I will be going back to give this place another shot and see if other menu items really stand out!
