Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My FAVORITE place for breakfast. I make sure I get there very early to avoid waiting & the line.  I've gotten the Benny's 2x & I've been happy every time.  The hash browns are well seasoned & delicious. I went with the smashing pumpkin pancake a la crate this time...DAMN GOOD!!! The service today was a bit slower this time but the food soooo made up for it. Our timing was good because the line & wait was long when we left.
