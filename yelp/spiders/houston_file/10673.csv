JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I personally like the thin noodles at Jinya better than the thick, so I always ask them to substitute it. I feel like the thin noodles are more comparable to ramen shops in Japan. This is probably my favorite ramen spot in Houston now! I would highly recommend trying it at least once.
