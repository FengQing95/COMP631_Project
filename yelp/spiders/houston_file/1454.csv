JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My favorite ramen place so far in Houston. I almost love everything about this place. Love the decor and atmosphere. Love the service. Love my Tonkatsu Black ramen. The pork chashu had a good balance of meat and fat. Only thing I wish Jinya have on their menu is some yakitori option like Tiger Den. Either way, I'll be back for more ramen soon!
