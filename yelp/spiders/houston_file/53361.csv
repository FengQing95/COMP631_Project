Kata Robata////Great restaurant from the minute we were greeted at the door until we left. My wife and I showed up on a Friday night without a reservation so we did have a wait so we decided to try out some drinks at the bar. Â My wife had one of their specialty drinks, Abuela, and I was drinking gin martinis. Both were great. A pub table opened up in the bar so we set down and then found out we could eat there. It was perfect. The Miso Gyoza was fantastic as well as the Ocean Picante. We tried a bit of everything but the bartender made several recommendations and we tried them so I don't remember all the names. I do remember the Wagyu Beef sushi was incredible and the fresh fish was a fatty tuna that just melted in your mouth. Highly recommend checking this place out but learn from our mistake and make a reservation.
