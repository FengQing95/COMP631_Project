Baby Barnaby's////Green eggs platter: My favorite out of the 4. A popular item on the menu. It also comes with tater tots, sausages, and 2 toasts. The green eggs were the best because of the way it was cooked with the spinach. The tater tots were also super crunchy and plentiful. I didn't have room in my tummy for the toasts after all the food.
