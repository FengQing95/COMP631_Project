Kata Robata////In terms of the food - this place never disappoints.  My friends ordered the duck dumpling ramen, which was an off-the-menu item, and I ordered the Rising Sun roll and some fresh salmon sushi.  They loved the ramen, and I loved my sushi - everyone was happy.  :) The peppered tuna was perfect with the truffle vinaigrette, and the salmon sushi was melt-in-your-mouth awesome.  For those with a gluten free allergy, this place definitely accommodates you.  You'd be surprised to find gluten lurking in soy sauce, certain types of rice, ponzu sauce, miso, etc... so this place labels their menu to depict whether or not it's gluten free.  They even have gluten free soy sauce; just remember to ask for it.
