The Pit Room////Food was great. Service for the most part was great. When we were inside we were told that we need to split our party up when we ate to have no more than 6 to a table. When we came outside a lady came up to us very aggressively and rude and told us we could not add a chair to seat 6 at our table. We told her we were told inside that we could sit no more than 6 at a table. The lady told us no. We said just inside they told us we could, she was rude and told us no. Aside from the rude lady everything was great. It's hard to enjoy a dining experience when we are getting conflicting rules and not poor but rude service.
