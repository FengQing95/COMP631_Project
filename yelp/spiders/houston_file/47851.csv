Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The host, whom was very nice, escorted us to our table, and this is where so many of our problems could have easily been avoided: Since it was busy and it was obvious that the proper amount of help was not hired, the host should have made sure we had place settings, basic salt and pepper, menus, and a drink order if we were ready to give to our waiter. So that he could avoid making more trips. Very easy things for the host to do that would make everyone's job so much easier.
