JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////DISCLAIMER: My palate likes dishes highly-flavored dishes, while my coworker prefers things a bit more mellow and she thoroughly enjoyed everything, so this review may be a tad bit harsh on the flavor aspect. Jinya is much cozier than Kata Robata and the staff is totally attentive, friendly, and appreciative of its patrons.
