Uchi////I just got back from Uchi, and I hate myself for giving the place 4 stars and not 5 but I just can't.  I went with a friend and we opted for the 10 course omakase.   As we talked about it, we thought about all the things we didn't really want to have but then decided that omakase means to trust the chef, and so we did.
