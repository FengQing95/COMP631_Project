Uchi////The final tasting we had was thekinoko nabe (seasonal mushroom, koshihikari rice, tentsuyu, egg yolk, gyutoro) for me and the veggie nabe (seasonal vegetables, koshihikari rice, soy broth, egg yolk). Again the whole mirrored experience in terms of food. This had the crunchy rice from the stone bowl mixed with mushrooms and beef. Hers had the same flavor and texture on her side.
