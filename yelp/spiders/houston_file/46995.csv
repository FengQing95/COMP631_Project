Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Good food (breakfast is hard to mess up) their pancakes are delicious. Try them all! The Wait staff is like the liberalist Starbucks had a hipster contest and the winner is selected to work here. Overall good place if you don't mind waiting 20-30 minutes for a table to eat breakfast
