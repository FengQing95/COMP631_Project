Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was told there would be a wait time of 1.5 hrs but the bar seating is up for grabs on a first come first serve basis. I felt like a stalker but I snagged a bar seat easily being solo on this occasion. The bar seating was cool as I was able to chat with the bartender and ask about menu item recommendations and their interesting assortment of brunch cocktails.
