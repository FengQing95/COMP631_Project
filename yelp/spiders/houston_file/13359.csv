JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The Tonkotsu black ramen was delicious. It had an egg that had runny yolk which was a good compliment once it mixed with the broth. The pork belly was cooked perfectly and the broth was the perfect median between thick and watered down. Its served with the regular thin noodles.
