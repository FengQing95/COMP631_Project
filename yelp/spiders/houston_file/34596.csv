Local Foods////It is way too cold! What is up with Houstonians making it so cold...which in turn makes the heat feel worse when you go outside again. Recently, on a day pushing 100, i moved outside at the Upper Kirby location to thaw out and was absolutely fine in the shade. It's just unnecessary, exaggerates the heat more, and wastes energy. Figure out a way to focus the cold air into the kitchen area, which is presumably why it's kept low throughout the restaurant.
