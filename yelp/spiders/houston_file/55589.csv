Kata Robata////In my opinion, KR has one of the best places to get ramen in Houston. I will admit, I haven't tried Soma, but I have to visit soon (Sorry Anthony N.)!! Maybe, just maybe, it's not as good as NYC or Japan, but delicious according to my humble tastebuds. Even better, their sushi really shines - fresh melt in your mouth fish. Fresh fresh fresh!
