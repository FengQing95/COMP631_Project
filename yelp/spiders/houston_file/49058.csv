Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I'm really torn on this review because the food is truly incredible, but the wait time for brunch is just insane. On average, it's a 2 hour wait on the weekends. That has been my experience and most all of my friends who've been here. Just wanted to throw that out there so you know what to expect. Now, let's get down to business on the food.
