Local Foods////For $12 we each got a hefty salt n pepper roast beef sandwich generously stuffed and included curried cauliflower :). Two sides were also included and I chose the kale (which wasn't my favorite w the Parmesan cheese combination) and the beet salad (which had a delicious citrus kick and refreshing crunch to it). I also tried the homemade chips and Thai flavored coleslaw which were also quite good as well. Definitely a good post workout meal if you're leaving the 24 hr fitness next door; just be mindful of what you order...organic doesn't always mean healthy ;)
