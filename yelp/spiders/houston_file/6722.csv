JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Good tasting ramen! Thick, savory and approved by my friend who lived in Japan.  I really like the Spicy chicken ramen because I'm not a huge fan on pork broth.  I wish the seasonal karaage ramen would come back because that was my favorite.  The Yatai ramen is pretty good too, but it includes pork and chicken broth.  The appetizers are great too! I like the brussel sprouts.  I always ask for extra broth and/or extra meat.  The combo deals are perfect for the full meal.
