Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////For their breads and cafe-style expressos, this place deserves a 4. However a couple of big detractions overall grants Common Bond a 3. First: the spoons (yes really) were all gone by the time we got our food, and the meal was served in a very deep bowl. We were therefore sentenced to try and scrape all our grits out of a deep bowl with a fork. Less than ideal.  Two: I was not a big fan of the watery grits that came with my meal. Overall a nice place to visit every now and then,  definitely better for coffee and pastries than for an actual meal.
