Uchi////I do not care that people think Uchi is so wonderful because the only way I could afford ever dining there again is by taking a second mortgage.  Yes, their food is very good and their staff are skilled, personable and proficient.  At the end of the day for me it's all about cost.  If I want sushi I am going to Genji's on Westheimer where prices are reasonable.  I've a decent job but I also have a mortgage and bills to pay every month therefore I'm not about to pay exorbitant prices at Uchi so they can cover their overhead.  If you drive a Mercedes or a BMW, have an income in six figures or are a trust fund baby then don't worry because a $ 100.00 tab for two with drinks will be nothing more for you than "Chump Change".  Sorry, Uchi I'm just calling a spade a spade.  You guys put out a decent product just make it affordable for the proletariat.
