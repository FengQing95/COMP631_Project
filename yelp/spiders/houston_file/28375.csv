The Pit Room////Our food was ready within minutes, and for the two meals and a drink, our total was a very reasonable $33.56!  I first went to the condiment bar, and they had a variety of items ranging from pickled vegetables, a rojo salsa (very thick, spicy salsa) and other offerings.  We sat down and began eating.
