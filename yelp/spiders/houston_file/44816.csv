Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////-THE CROISSANTS. The croissants at Common Bond are like the size of your brain, probably. They are a voluminous heap of so many buttery, flaky layers that you can't really even fit your mouth around it. It's also kind of pricey, but ok, you should just splurge on this one. It's huge and so, so worth it.
