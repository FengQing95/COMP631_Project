Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Our experience at Bosscat was terrible! I was hoping for a great meal at such beautiful restaurant  with great ambiance; however, our experience was far from it. They ran out of half of the food on the menu... croissants, donuts, and tater tots (DURING BRUNCH  time!). A carafe of mimosa cost like 40$ and it was brought half filled. Overall the food was not that great, but the restaurant looks beautiful! Better luck next time?
