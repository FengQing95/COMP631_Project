Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The first thing we ordered was a drink (sidenote: this place is known for their whiskey/ whiskey/ bourbon Â cocktails) we both had the bourbon sweet teas and asked that they kept coming. I'm not sure if it was a promotional drink as last time we ordered a different drink, but they were to die for. Even for me, I'm slightly sensitive to whiskey drinks.
