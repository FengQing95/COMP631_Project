Uchi////This past friday was our second time going to Uchi, and both experiences have been wonderful! My boyfriend and I love going to Houston since we're big foodies and Uchi never disappoints. From reserving the table with their helpful greeter, to the valet, the food, and the service, it's one of the things we always look forward to when coming to Houston!! Our first time in december was our first time trying it, and our server let us have foie gras on the house and my bf who is super picky loved it! On our second visit, i ordered yellowtail sushi and our server brought out a complimentary plate of yellowtail sashimi with ponzu!! She even brought us desert when we said we were too full! I will always recommend uchi to anyone coming to Houston for the AMAZING experience and equally wonderful food! The bluefin fatty tuna is to die for!! Thank you so much for always being the greatest and we will definitely be back on our next visit!!
