Baby Barnaby's////The one time I tried something else, it was the seasonal fruit pancake. I believe my fruit was the banana walnut. When the menu says "pancake" in the singular form, it means it. You only get one pancake. One giant pancake. One giant pancake the size of a hubcap. At first I rather enjoyed my banana walnut hubcap pancake -- it was fluffy and packed with barely warmed-through bananas and soft walnuts. But by the 30th bite, I was over it. I imagine this is what that guy from Man Vs. Food feels when he has to chew through a six-pound burrito. Maybe if I had someone (or somethree) to share it with, it would've been more enjoyable. Lesson learned.
