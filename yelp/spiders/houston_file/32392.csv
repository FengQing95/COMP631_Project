Local Foods////I had the crunchy chicken sandwich.. It was pretty awesome. I had high hopes for the pretzel bun (huge fan of anything pretzel!) and was not disappointed. The blend of flavors of the chicken went well slight sourness of the pickles and the salt from the pretzel bun. Just beware it can be a tiny bit messy. It comes with two sides or soup, so I got the lemongrass soup which wasn't bad either. They have lots of cheap bottled local beer.. though the $6 for draft is a bit steep in comparison.
