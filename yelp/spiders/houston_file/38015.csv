Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////both really enjoyed our food and the atmosphere is fun.  There was only one negative about our experience:  when we were seated at our table (we had a reservation), the hostess proceeded to tell us what time they would need the table back for their next reservation.  I felt that was very inappropriate and did not make me feel welcome. For a pricier restaurant the staff needs to treat customers with more respect.
