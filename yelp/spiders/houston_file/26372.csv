The Pit Room////Unfortunately, because this is a place no where near my house, I can't sit down to eat a big meal, like they would like, with sides and condiments.  I can't leave a restaurant that full and go to work.  The portions are very large, so you get what you pay for - you just have to be down for the count after eating this food. It's heavy...They don't allow you to just come in and have a BBQ sandwich - you're expected to sit down and EAT. So if you come to this establishment, come hungry or ready to take a togo plate, or be a big man, because that's what this restaurant is catering to.  I know that's a ridiculous thing to complain about, especially in Houston, and the fact that everything is al la carte otherwise, is just because this area has become super high rent. Forget the fact that this used to be Talk of the Town, since at least the 80s, and if you know 80s Montrose, you know what went on here before, which is why it took so long for me to come to this place in the first place.  It's clean, and a decent restaurant.  I'll be coming again.
