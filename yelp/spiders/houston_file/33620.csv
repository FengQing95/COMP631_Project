Local Foods////My go-to place to eat when I'm at Rice Village. Though it's pricey for a sandwich, the meal comes with two sides or a cup of soup. The ingredients taste very fresh and I have tried almost all of the sandwich options on the menu. They change the sides every now and then, but the quinoa, beets, and soba noodles are my favorites. Overall, really fantastic sandwiches!
