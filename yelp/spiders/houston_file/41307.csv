Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been to Common Bond several times now, and have yet to be disappointed! The ambiance is fun, the decor is super-cool, the service is great, and the food... oh, the food! I've come for lunch each time, and have been intrigued by the inventive ways they prepare each dish, and delighted by the results. I had the charred romaine salad today, and I savored each bite. Then, it was time for dessert - magnificent pastries! The challenge is choosing just one.
