JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Wanted ramen and a friend recommended Jinya, so my S/O and I decided to check it out. We went on a Sunday night, and there was about a 15 minute wait. So if you decide to go on a busy day, expect to wait longer. We were seated, and the server was very helpful in explaining each entree. I ended getting the Tonkotsu white, and she got a Tonkotsu black (white has a mix of chicken and pork broth, and brown has only pork). The expectations were met for this bowl of ramen, as the broth was just right. I ordered an extra egg in my ramen as Tonkotsu eggs are amazing in general, and this place delivered. They gave two slices of meat, and they were very tender and delicious; the beef absorbed the broth that complimented each bite. Needless to say, there was nothing left in that bowl after I finished. Great place to go with friends, or even on a date!
