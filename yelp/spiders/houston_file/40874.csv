Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Scene: Saturday night. I'm looking for a new place. Up pops Bosscat. The ambiance is pretty jumpin' this place is doing it all for really reasonable price. As soon as you walk in there's a DJ who is spinning a really good mix playlist through the decades. If you're a fan of good music you'll love it. It's probably best to make a reservation unless it's you and a friend then you may grab a seat at the bar. If it's more about the scene, this is pretty upscale casual. Good enough to bring a date, fun enough for a large crowd, relaxed enough to be in a t-shirt and grab a drink with your friends. The food is really good. I recommend the shaved pork chop
