The Pit Room////By the time we got here, midway through a dinner rush, the line was outside the door, wrapped around the porch entrance. And who doesn't stand in a line for BBQ goodies? But you have to get there fast, they do run out of yummy items quickly, such as their Beef Ribs (Flintstones size!). Too bad, I am a huge fan of Beef Ribs and judging from the pictures in other reviews, they looked amazing.
