JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm usually pretty suspicious when people say rave about good ramen.  I've had places that people say that the ramen is great and then come to find out that it was instant ramen.  Jinya really blew me away.  With great ramen, it really starts with the broth.  It is absolutely amazing, really thick and flavorful.  A lot of places will have watery broth but not this place.  I got the Tonkotsu Black and it was amazing.  The second item I look for is fresh noodles that are not under or over cooked.  Score here as well.  And the final item is the pork.  It was amazing.  I could have eaten that just by itself.  Wish they had one of these in Dallas.  Thank you Jinya!!!
