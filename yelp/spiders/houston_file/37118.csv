Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Good drinks. Food was okay. We ordered spicy chicken dip, crab pasta, Mac and cheese, chicken burger, boss cat fries. The quantity serves for 4-6 people. The service is good. We had a table for two but the went there with four. They accommodated us without any delays even though they said the wait could be 45 min long. Will try to make it to brunch and see how it is!
