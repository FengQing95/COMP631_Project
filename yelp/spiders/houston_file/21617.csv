Uchi////The food was very little in portion and tasteless. If you are looking for a place to go for mini bites with an expensive taste then this is the place. They give you a child size meal for a price that is not even worth it. However, the staff were nice and the ambiance was great. It was my first time here so having the staff explain the menu was pretty helpful. Ordering was easy without any pressure. The ambiance was great and the wait to be seated was not long. It's located right across the way from Katz which was quite easy to park and go. I don't understand their take with the menu and why they are so high priced for a bite size meal.
