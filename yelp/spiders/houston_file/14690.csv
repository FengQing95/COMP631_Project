JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Christina - Thank you for your 5-star review. We greatly appreciate your kind words, especially since you're an elite Yelper; your opinions are quite valuable to us! Above all, I'm glad we have been able to provide consistent quality in terms of food and service for your visits. Needless to say, that is a challenge for any restaurant that has more than one outpost. Thanks again, and we look forward to serving you again soon!
