Uchi////First visit was disappointing to say the least. Overpriced is an understatement- $135 for 4 small veggie dishes and 1 meat dish. Our order was 'miscommunicated' resulting in a 45-minute delay between dishes. Waitress grabbed my plate and chopsticks before the end of the meal and, when i informed her we weren't done, she just put it back after having her hands on it. No offer for service recovery. Definitely not going to be a return customer.
