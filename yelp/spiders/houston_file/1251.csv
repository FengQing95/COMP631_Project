JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////my best friend brought me here and we all ended up eating a bit of each others ramen. The only reason that its not 5 stars is because the parking is terrible. As you have to go park in the 2nd or 3rd level of the parking garage and the wait can be anywhere from 5min to 45min.
