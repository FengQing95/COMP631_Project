Local Foods////I am the kind of person that listens to a whole album in loop for weeks.  It's with the same enjoyment that I enjoy local foods.  Prices are a little rich but where aren't they these days? Food tastes great and I cycle between a few favorites probably visiting this place 3x/mo.  Crispy chicken, harvest salad, seafood sandwich, and a bahn mi that is respectable despite it's high price relative to other shops in town.
