Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Don't think twice, go eat here! If you go during the weekend it's definitely going to be at least a 20min wait. Luckily I live within walking distance and during the weekdays it's no issue. To start off the food is very original and delicious. After we ordered our food our waiter brought us a complimentary sweet potato pancake which was surprisingly delicious and we left that plate clean! When our food came everything was fresh and tasty. No complaints other than the wait time (during weekends). This place is my rotation.
