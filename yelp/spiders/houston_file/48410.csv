Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I have been here several times now, since my best friend lives in Houston and we always come here for brunch when I am in town. This past time I visited Snooze I thought I'd switch it up and I got the Avocado Benny, AND BOY I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. The eggs were poached to perfection and the English Muffin was to die for. The presentation of the dish was also cute. Sometimes hashbrowns can be underwhelming so you gotta drown them in ketchup, but not these, meaning they were seasoned well. I like to add a little bit of spice to my dishes so I always ask for the Serrano, Yellowbird hot sauce and there's another red hot sauce I mix with but forgot what it's called, it's such a good combo for any dish. The only downfall and why I am giving them 4 stars.....is because there is ALWAYS a wait, typically around 45min to an hour. Since Snooze is a well known place and very highly reviewed, it brings in a crowd. They do have a bar area, so you can order drinks while you are waiting but it's still very annoying to have to wait that long. All in all, if it's your first time trying and you are on the fence about waiting, DON'T SNOOZE ON IT! Highly recommend.
