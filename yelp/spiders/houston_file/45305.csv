Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Such a cute trendy bakery! The kouigan aman and chocolate chip cookie was amazing Â I also got the lavender latte which was delicious. The service was great. Only thing I'd point out is that seating is limited. I came on a Wednesday morning and it was still pretty busy around 10 AM.
