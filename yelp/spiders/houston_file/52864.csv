Kata Robata////We ordered so much food I'm struggling to remember all the dishes but everything was up to par. Seaweed salad was good, Hamachi Kama was awesome and meaty, spicy tuna was good and had just the right amount of spicy-ness, the rising sun roll was had very interesting flavors with the pepper tuna and truffle vinaigrette, and to my surprise, the king crab california roll was actually my favorite item of the night - so much delicious crab meat stuffed in there! Â We got the green tea creme brulee for dessert (I thought Pagoda was the only place in town that offered this so it was a pleasant surprise), the dish very well done and even came with a serving of green tea ice cream.
