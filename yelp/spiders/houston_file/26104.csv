The Pit Room////The brisket here was cooked perfect, but the ribs were SO GOOD; some of the best I've had. One recommendation that is totally my personal opinion is to serve the corn off the cob with all of the cream and toppings but the potato salad was off the chain! Cole Slaw and macaroni we're okay. Great beer selection and wonderful side bar to fix up your plate. The sauces (Coffee Bourbon sauce) and Habanero sauces were tasty, definitely makes this place unique. Ambiance was perfect.
