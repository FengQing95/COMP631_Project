Kata Robata////This is just a quick review. Let's face it, Kata Robata is known for great food so I'll just say yes, the sushi was wonderful, fresh, delicate and beautifully presented. All as expected and the reputation is well deserved. The thing that impressed me, however, was our server. She was WONDERFUL. Knowledgeable, friendly, took time to chat, never seemed stressed or hurried even with a full load of tables. Food arrived faster than I'd ever seen or expected. Seriously one of the best service experiences I've ever had. Kudos to Kata for having her (and she said she'd been there about 10 years, so that says a lot about the business). Â I'll remember the food but I'll remember our wonderful server even more.
