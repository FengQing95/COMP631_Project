Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////5 stars as a bakery, no doubt. We got the almond croissant, the scone, and chocolate brioche. The croissant was light and flaky (I usually don't like croissants because they are usually greasy and make me feel fat afterwards), the scone was ?orange and delicious, the chocolate brioche was decadent and rich.
