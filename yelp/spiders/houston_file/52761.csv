Kata Robata////I've been wanting to try out kata the longest time and I got the chance too. I'd heard from multiple people that they have the best ramen in town. So, I def had to see for myself. I got the spicy miso ramen- the broth was really creamy and dense and I love that in a ramen. The noodle were a good texture but the egg was just a plain half boiled egg. I've had a better egg elsewhere. But, overall it was a pretty good ramen. And my boyfriend had the duck ramen which was I thought the miso ramen was better but my boyfriend thought the duck was better. But, to each his own, right? We also had the bone marrow which was really good and it was a pretty hefty portion. We wanted to try other things too but we were on a time crunch because we were running late to the Rockets game. As we were leaving our waitress asked us if we were going there and she wished us a good time. Which, was nice but she wasn't that great of an waitress. She took forever to greet us and as my boyfriend was ordering his beer she walked away as we were talking and didn't even ask if I wanted anything.. But, the bussers refilled our waters more than she did and I saw them at our table more. But, whatever she was nice just wasn't that attentive. I might return to kata one day. But, for now it was okay..
