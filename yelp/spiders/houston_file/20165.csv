Uchi////As we walked in, I could see that it was a very popular restaurant in the Houston area; the ambiance was great, and the place was bustling. We were sat by the sushi bar, and started ordering left and right. Let me just say that the service at this place deserved a 5 stars on its own; everyone was friendly and helpful, and they were all smiling, even brought out the dishes in intervals (which was a very nice pace, but not for a hungry stomach).
