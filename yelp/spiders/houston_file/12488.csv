JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the JINYA No.1, tonkotsu black. It consisted of pork chashu, kikurage, green onion, seasoned egg, thin noodles, and my favorite nori dried seaweed in pork broth. Broth flavor was good and presentation was noticeable. You actually get the whole egg without paying any extra and was runny the way it should be. Everything put together blended well, would recommend for ramen first-timers! I also got a chance to try the No.3, tonkotsu assari. With it being $3 less and what had seemed to be the same ingredients on the menu besides the thick noodles, some opted for that option. There is a difference in the broth flavor between the No.1 and 3! Assari wasn't bad, but didn't have as much of a flavor kick as No.1, no nori and only came with HALF an egg. We preferred the tonkotsu black between the two.
