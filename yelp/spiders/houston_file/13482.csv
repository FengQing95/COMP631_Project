JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////- Spicy Chicken Ramen ($11.50): Mildly spicy broth with flat pieces of chicken breast, bean sprouts, spinach, welch onion, and thin noodles. The ramen and it's ingredients were all very well made and mixed nicely with each other, no complaints. The broth was very warm and soft to the tongue, and combined with the spiciness, it really gave the Ramen an extra kick.
