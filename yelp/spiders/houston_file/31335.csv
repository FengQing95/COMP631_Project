Local Foods////Great Food spot in Rice Village.  It's all local market foods.  The Crunchy Chicken sandwich was as good as everyone was saying... and the Pretzel Buns are incredible.  I had the Tuscan Kale and Quinoa as the sides.  I've had better at Whole Foods but still tasty.  The thing I kept going back for was the Mintade.  It was the best drink I've had in a LONG Time.  I had about 5 glasses!  It's a mix of citrus (grapefruit, lemon, orange, etc) and club soda with sugar and mint.  It was GREAT!!
