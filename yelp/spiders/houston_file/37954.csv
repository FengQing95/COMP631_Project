Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Terry is by far the best around!!!!! He knows the drinks and menu better than I know myself. He had our whole group laughing the entire time. Ask for him if you want beyond the normal service. The Chorizo and Â Potato Benedict was more than I could handle. Sooooooo delicious. I did sneak a few bites of the Fruity Pebble French Toast.
