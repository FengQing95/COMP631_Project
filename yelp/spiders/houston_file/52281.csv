Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We got the snooze classic with scrambled eggs and the strawberry shortcake pancakes from the summer menu.  Our friends got the spuds deluxe and a lox-n-latke benny with the signature pancake flight for the table to share.  The strawberry pancakes were delicious, a bit sweet if you're eating earlier in the morning but still good!  No complaints about the snooze classic or the entrees from our friends either.  The pancake flight was pretty cool to have and I would recommend that for a small table to share.  It's a good mix of flavor to try quickly and all at once.  Would come here again!
