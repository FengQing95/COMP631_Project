Local Foods////Wanted to check new place for lunch came into this nice location . Was really hungry so I ordered the gulf seafood and chicken sandwich. I tried the gulf seafood sandwich it was awful. The homemade side chips had so much salt it was not edible. The only good thing was the presentation of the food . Chicken sandwich was ok but not worth $40 for 2 sandwich.
