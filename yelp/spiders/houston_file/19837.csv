Uchi////We were asked to wait briefly upon arrival. Â There was hardly a place to stand, but they did help us out with a round of drinks (standing awkwardly in the traffic pattern of wait service drinking wine can be problematic, but I didn't get red for that reason, and thus staining my clothes from spillage was less of an issue). :)
