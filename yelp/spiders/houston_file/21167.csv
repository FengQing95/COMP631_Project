Uchi////This is my favorites restaurant in the country. We moved here to the Houston area 2 years ago and finally made our way here to celebrate my birthday with a nice evening out. We used to travel across the country to come here. The reason we don't go out to nice restaurants as often is due to parenthood. I really wanted to get here though and we decided to take a risk and come with out 2 year old. We made the reservation early and arrived promptly at 5. We were sat in a booth with a nice view of the sushi bar which thoroughly kept my daughter entertained throughout our visit. I was pregnant at the time of our visit which didn't stop me from trying so delicious bites. I didn't do any raw fish but my husband was able to and everything he tried was excellent. My go-tos here are always the Brussels and edamame. The Brussel sprouts here are the best I've ever had and are the reason I eat them now. Their edamame is done on the wood fires grill and it's irresistible. My daughter probably ate most of it too! I had the hot rock, Walu, walu and some of their daily veggie sashimi. Surprisingly the veggie sashimi were all my favorites. The walu walu is yummy though and has some great flavors. I can't remember what my husband tried but they were recommended by the waiter and were excellent in his opinion. We finished with an awesome fried dough ice cream dessert that was out of this world. I loved the flavors and all the uniqueness of the dish. Really you can't go wrong with anything from here. Oh and we had an awesome time with our daughter. She had a blast and ate several avocado rolls. Our waiter was very nice and helpful. The service is always impeccable as they explain each dish, give suggestions and clear plates as soon as you shake your last bite. I can't wait to visit again when I can do the fresh seafood!
