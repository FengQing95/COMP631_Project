Kata Robata////We had dessert because we sorta know someone who knows someone who knows the dessert person...and I'm not going to say it sucked... but only because we know someone who knows someone who knows someone. It was truly a pretentious dessert and I only save the P word when I have to use it. All I remember was there were dots that tasted like space ice cream, possibly bananas, and it was bad.
