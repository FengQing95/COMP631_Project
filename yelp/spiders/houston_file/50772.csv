Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We attempted to get some drinks at the bar while we waited but after standing under the "order here" sign for over 20 minutes, we decided to simply wait it out sans cocktails. The bar seemed to be only able to handle the drinks for those seated and not for those waiting. When I walked away from the "order here" sign, another girl took my place and I saw she resigned after similar difficulties.
