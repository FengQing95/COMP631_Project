JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Valarie, Thank you for your review. Although it's not listed on the menu, there is a "less salt" option for all of our ramens. And I'm sorry you did not like our tapas dishes. Would you be willing to explain further what specifically you didn't like about them? Regardless, we appreciate your giving us a try, and above all I am happy to know that you are one of the growing number of supporters of the "ramen scene" here in Houston.
