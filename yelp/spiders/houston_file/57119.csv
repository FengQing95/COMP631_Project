Kata Robata////After months of quarantine my roomies and I needed great sushi. I ordered the papaya pork belly salad along with two traditional maki rolls. The salad was large enough to share with the 3 people at my table. I appreciate that the sushi bar will make a simple yellowtail roll or salmon roll, because I love simplicity. All items hit the spot. My boyfriend got his beloved Kobe skewers, and we both had our own carafe of house hot sake. I always aim to get a little tipsy when we come. The only cons were miscommunication. I checked online and still saw happy hour menus, but once there was told they are no longer doing happy hour or the half price sake flights for Tuesday. Overall very satisfied with our first post quarantine sushi.
