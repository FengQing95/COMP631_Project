Kata Robata////I was in for their happy hour and had a hokkaido's sunset to drink. The drink was very fruity and super sweet, not really refreshing like I imagined. The waitress actually recommended a cucumber drink so maybe next time I will try that instead. My boyfriend ordered green tea which they never did bring. Also off of the happy hour menu we ordered the pork buns, california roll, spicy salmon roll and the tuna tar tar. Besides the pork buns which were super juicy and perfectly seasoned everything else you can probably find at the sushi counter at your local grocery store.
