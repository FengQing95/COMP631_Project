Uchi////I would just stick to ordering their cold and hot dishes as well as their rolls. One of the highlights of our night asides the Walu Walu dish was the ham and egg roll. I'm not usually a fan of rolls as I usually opt for nigiri and sashimi but don't let the name stop you from ordering it. Savory and crunchy, harmonizing well in our mouths we ordered another one! The fried milk dessert is also another item whose name should not let you stop you from ordering it. They actually gave us two free desserts for my boyfriend's birthday which was actually pretty nice as most places usually give you just one.
