JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Personal experience: The only thing I wish they would change is to have an option for gluten-free noodles. My mother unfortunately is Gluten intolerant, and we tried to take her to JINYA. I was under the assumption the spinach noodles were gluten free, but the waiter kindly informed us the only thing gluten free was the edamame. While I understand gluten-free people are usually gluten-free by choice, and it really isn't in a restaurant's best interest to have gluten free noodles for 1% of customers ( this isn't California I guess), I would really have liked to have her try Ramen for the first time at JINYA, but I guess I will be taking her to AGU ramen, since they have gluten-free options.
