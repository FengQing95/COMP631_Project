The Pit Room////This has to be one of the best BBQ places in town.  The brisket and sausage are AMAZING with lots of flavor and yummy BBQ sauce.  We had the mac and cheese and potato salad for sides which were both good. They only serve until they run out so don't get there late and miss out.  Definitely a favorite for BBQ.
