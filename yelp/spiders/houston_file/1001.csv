JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Richard - Thanks for your review and feedback. We're always happy to offer customers a different dish if they are severely underwhelmed. And as we prepare upwards of 1,000 ajitama (seasoned eggs) per day, there will be a certain percentage that don't come out flawlessly. And by the nature of eggs themselves, there's no way to determine yolk consistency without breaking them open. Again, we're always happy to replace eggs if customers are not 100% satisfied. Thank you again.
