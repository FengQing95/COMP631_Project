JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ive been coming to jinya for about 4 years now and it is by far my favorite ramen place. I first started going because of the vegan ramen and i was immediately hooked. Even after i went back to eating meat i still go back frequently just for that. Again, my favorite ramen place thus far.
