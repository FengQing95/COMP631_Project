The Pit Room////The beef rib (5/5!) is just about as good as it gets -- you do not want to miss this. In fact, it is literally the one meal I continuously come back for and highly recommend it. The venison sausage (5/5!) and Mac n cheese (4/5!) are two other recommendations I would encourage you to go for.
