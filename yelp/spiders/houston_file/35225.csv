Local Foods////Got the truffled egg salad sandwich with the cucumber salad and potato salad as sides and everything was amazing. My friend got the crunchy chicken salad sandwich with a kale salad and potato chips and she also said it was all great. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because I ordered to go, and they must've missed placed my ticket or some thing, and took over 15 minutes to make my order. I was on a time crunch because my friend was on her lunch break, but other than the mishap everything was great. Will definitely return
