Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We saw all the Yelp reviews and wanted to try for ourselves to see if this place was all hype!  May I say, that I use to eat out 3 meals a day for 5 to 6 days a week for 17 years of my traveling life.  I had the "Toad in the Hole" (blacken redfish, horseradish hollandaise gravy, Paine de mie) and my girlfriend had the almond croissant and some macaroons.
