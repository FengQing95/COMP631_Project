Uchi////And I must say that I saved the best for last, the Hamachi Nabe: Steaming Koshi Hikari Rice with baby Yellowtail, a farm egg, served in a soy broth. When the bring this to your table you are immediately enamored because their are little pieces of tobiko that are dancing around the Yellowtail and the rice. However, I must say that Â this dish was probably the least visibly appealing dish that we ordered. However, this dish totally made up for it in aroma. The smell of the soy broth and the steaming rice and Yellowtail totally overtakes your senses. The various flavors and textures really make this dish a truly unique and special experience.
