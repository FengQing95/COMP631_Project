Kata Robata////I especially loved the tropical roll I ordered - was topped with avocado and salmon, with spicy tuna and mango inside. Mango! I have no idea why I've never seen this on a sushi menu before, but the flavor popped - was just the perfect addition to the roll, and didn't overwhelm the other flavors. My friend was a bit less wowed by her smoked salmon rolls, but the fish was fresh; she'd just ordered something more boring.
