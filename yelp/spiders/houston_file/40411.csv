Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////When we were seated our waiter recognized us from our last visit, which made us feel more welcome. It was a Saturday during brunch so the wait was over an hour, but we expected that. You can sit in the park across the street or get Bubble Tea next door. We came in for brunch and started with the Wake Up Call cocktail, which was an exceptional coffee cocktail with Irish cream and Tito's. The taste of alcohol was subdued and it struck a delicate balance of coffee notes with sweetness from the cream. Next up we ordered the Totchos! They are a tasty blend of texture and flavor. The tots are fried to a perfect level of crispiness, then smothered in nacho cheese and Spanish chorizo, and then topped off with a fried egg and jalape√±os. The heat level is moderate so a wide range of spicy thresholds could enjoy this dish. It's perfect to share with the whole table! Once you break the fried egg each bite is gooey, melty, spicy, and savory. Finally we split the smokehouse Benedict! This dish had freshly made biscuits as the base, then covered with a very generous portion of pulled pork, smothered in fried chicken hollandaise, and topped with poached eggs. It's a very rich and flavorful plate! Easily shared between two people. Our only thing we nitpick is that the restaurant is very loud. If there were some acoustic treatments that would help. If you're there for more than an hour the noise level can become overwhelming. A very satisfying brunch bursting with flavors!
