Local Foods////The duck confit was good with a Willy Wonka flavor profile of multiple flavors throughout the eating, the cranberry was almost jelly tasting and it paired nicely but it def did not wow factor me. The roast beef was excellent and I guess I'm not a fan of horse radish since that really killed it for me but it was a good sandwich and both of these were all new flavors for me mixed together sandwich style. The best part of the entire meal was the lemongrass chicken soup... like wow I could eat that in the gallons everyday! We dipped both the sandwiches in it, and the Vegan chilli but it seemed the sandwiches were better off without any dipping going on.
