JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My boyfriend got the tonkatsu black in hot. They charge you to make it "hot" (spiciness level) which is a bit odd to me since it's a chain restaurant. The broth was thick with thin noodles. My boyfriend liked it but we both agreed that the broth is too thick making it seem more like a sauce than broth.
