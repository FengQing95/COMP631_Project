The Pit Room////Came for an early lunch around 11:30 on a Saturday. There was a small line but it moved very fast. There were plenty of sitting areas and the place was clean and in great shape. Now on to the main attraction - the food! I got the one meat dinner plate with Brisket, mac n cheese and green beans. This brisket was probably the 2nd best brisket that I've had since being in Texas (Lockhart in Dallas has my heart). The Mac and cheese was pretty good. Could have gone with a different side other than the green beans. Those were so-so. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because I wish they had other sauce options. The one they provide is a bit spicy and a little less sweet than I prefer. But, still tasty. I just like options ;)
