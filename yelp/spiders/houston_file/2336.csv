JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////YUUUUMMY! I'm so happy to have found a new soup spot. We always want soup/noodles on Sunday. We've been getting Pho Saigon for a long time now but it's so bland and they give you sooo much crap to go. So yeah we tried Jinya this past week and I'm hooked! A lot of veggies in the vegetarian one, and the spicy chicken was what will keep me coming back!! See you Sunday, JINYA!
