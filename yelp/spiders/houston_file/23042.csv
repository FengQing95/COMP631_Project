Uchi////Been here on a number of occasions-2x for normal dinner and 2x for happy hour dinner. We always order the 6-course tasting menu when we come for normal dinner, and it is absolutely exquisite! I really enjoy the ambiance, service, food, and more importantly, the overall experience. For happy hour, we always get all 3 rolls (enjoyed the pork belly most) and a few of the other options. Fave dessert here is the fried milk. Presentation of food is beautiful and innovative!
