Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Holiday plans got cancelled last minute due to flight issues so had to go out for dinner. Best Thanksgiving dinner ever! Seriously. Food was delicious, full of yummy flavors and cooked perfectly. You could even cut the turkey breast with your fork. Can't wait to go back and try more of their menu!
