JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////One of the few places I've found that has a vegan and vegetarian ramen option that is actually tasty! I've enjoyed their spicy chicken noodle ramen as well. Love their pork steam buns, though I personally didn't care for their beyond version of the same. The prices are high, but their food definitely hits the spot every time we order from here (or dined in person pre-pandemic). Â There's a menu item for every palate. Worth checking out!
