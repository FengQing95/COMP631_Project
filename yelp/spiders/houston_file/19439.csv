Uchi////Additionally, our party sat there, waiting for a server to come and introduce themselves and do what Uchi does best and is known for.  Nope.  Every server that walked past us just simply looked over our table and ignored us.  No acknowledgment of existence at all.  We literally had to HUNT DOWN a server to wait on us and this was Tristin if I have his name correct.  And he seemed like the ONLY one remembered me since I came with a group of my co workers.  He was a great server, however it was hard to track down any waiters if we wanted to add onto our order.  We also wanted a split check which in turn never happened.
