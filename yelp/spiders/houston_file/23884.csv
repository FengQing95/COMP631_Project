Uchi////Botan Ebi - one of the items we got gratis. They were experimenting with a new dish. It seemed to use a lot of the shrimp guts to make the sauce, to the point that it was slightly overpowering. The fried portion of the shrimp was rather bland by itself but worked well with the sauce. The tender, raw portion was strange, but I didn't mind it. The lotus I felt didn't really add much to the dish as it was rather bland and neutral.
