JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The service was impeccable! The food was delicious!! Definitely worth the drive and wait this Saturday night. Even though the place was busy, our server and others didn't miss a beat. I got the Cilantro Ramen Â and my daughter got the Spicy Chicken Ramen . Dessert, delicious green tea and refills right on time.
