Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I really enjoyed the food here and this review could be 5 stars if it weren't for a couple of small issues I had with my dishes. They weren't big issues, but the server didn't make an attempt to correct them. Â Which is to say... Not enough of a problem to prevent me from going back, I just hope it was a one time lapse in customer satisfaction.
