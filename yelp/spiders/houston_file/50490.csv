Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////As I studied the menu, I noted the ingredients in the OMG French Toast looked interesting enough to investigate further. We snagged an order of that, and some breakfast tacos for the table (because Texas). About 20 minutes later, I retracted every snide comment I'd made about waiting 45 minutes for a meal that, "I could make myself". There is no way I could ever hope to make french toast that good. Not on my best day, not in a million years. People. PEOPLE. This french toast will end wars. It will cure diseases. It will solve your problems. It's incredible. It was even incredible a day later, reheated in my own oven.
