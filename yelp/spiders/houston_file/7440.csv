JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We finally got a seat at the big table. Yes it's a big long table that takes the length of the main dining room pretty much. It's like family style seating. We sat with other people as well. It's not s round table or like a hibachi grill table. It's just a long big marble top table. There were pretty lights hanging above the table which gave a nice relaxing vibe. The setting was comfy and casual. It would be bad if you dressed up a little more, but for a Tuesday it was dressy casual/ casual. I ordered the spicy chicken ramen with a seasoned egg. The ramen was tasty, spicy, and had good soup to noodle ratio. That's important!
