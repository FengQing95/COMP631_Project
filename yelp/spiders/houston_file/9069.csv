JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Quang - Thanks for your great review. And I'm especially glad we were able to change your opinion about bamboo shoots -- that doesn't happen very often, so it's always nice to hear when something works in our favor. Also, yes, as a franchise concept, we are required to keep our lighting low and our music loud. JINYA Ramen Bar is geared specifically for a younger clientele, though we obviously welcome everyone. And to be perfectly honest, a quick look at our Yelp page and you'll find more than 2,100 uploaded photos ;-D
