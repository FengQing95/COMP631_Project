Local Foods////I had a great outdoor lunch, my first visit and what a great meal. I had the PEI mussels, their special of the day and it was so flavorful. It was a bouillabaisse flavor with a large bowl full of yummy veggies. They didn't have fries w it but their homemade potato chips were just as yummy. I can t wait to return and try something else, but if this special is back on the menu I might have it again.
