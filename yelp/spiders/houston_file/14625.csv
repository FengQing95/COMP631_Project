JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////When my ramen came out, my almond shaped eyes turned into heart shapes. Food shouldn't be this beautiful. But sometimes it's more beautiful than you and me, and most of the time, that's acceptable. I added a seasoned egg because come on, egg. And asked for lots of fresh garlic. They bring you your own garlic grinder and peel garlic and I went to town with that. Bad breathe, don't care.
