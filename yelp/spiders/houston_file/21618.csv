Uchi////I should begin by saying I don't typically like sushi or seafood for that matter. I agreed to go to Uchi because my wife had always wanted to go and it was her birthday dinner of sorts. We were able to be seated at the bar right away on a busy Saturday night. I would highly recommend sitting at the bar if you have the chance. We opted for the six course dinner to be curated by one of the sushi chefs who was directly across from us. He was friendly, funny, and very talented. I didn't expect to like anything as I was just trying to be a good sport but I loved everything he presented to us. One of the best dining experiences I've ever had to be honest.
