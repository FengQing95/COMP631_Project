The Pit Room////This place was everything I hoped for when visiting Texas. I split a pound of beef ribs, half pound of pork ribs, half pound of brisket, Mac and cheese, and two chicken tacos with my buddy. The chicken tacos were below average but the beef ribs made up for it. Beef ribs----pork ribs---brisket. Boom!!
