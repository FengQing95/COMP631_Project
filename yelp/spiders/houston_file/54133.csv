Kata Robata////We ordered a couple of items off the happy hour menu (kobe beef tacos and pork belly buns), some sashimi as well as the Spicy Soy Ramen. The ramen is pretty darn good - the broth is made with soy milk, which I've never had in any of my ramen before, and it gives it a light creaminess.
