The Pit Room////Delicious! We loved the pulled pork, the queso, and the smoked chicken tacos. Portions are large and the food comes out quickly, if you come in hungry like we did, it won't be long until you're chowing down. We were there for an early lunch on a chilly, rainy Saturday so we sat inside the main restaurant, but on a nice day the patio would be a great spot.
