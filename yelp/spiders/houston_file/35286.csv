Local Foods////The food here is fresh and consistently good. It can be pretty pricey for a sandwich and sides (especially considering that the fresh fruit I got was a small clementine one time) but it's good and I keep returning. I'm obsessed with the pretzel bread. I like the seafood (crab/shrimp) sandwich best. I ate The crunchy chicken one before as well but it's just OK in my opinion.
