JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is definitely one of my favorite ramen places. It can get really busy during peak hours, but I can usually get a seat most of the time. I've taken almost everyone I know here; the ramen here rocks! Parking can get kind of tricky as it's dependent on the garage near it, but I've usually been able to find a spot. Every time I've gone here, I've ordered the Tonkotsu Black and it has never disappointed me. I also recommend the Takoyaki as an appetizer, it's hot and delicious! The place is clean and the service is also great.
