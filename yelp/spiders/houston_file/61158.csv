Baby Barnaby's////Absolutely, hands down worth the wait for Sunday brunch in Houston! This is a very small but quaint restaurant in the heart of the gayborhood. The servers had outstanding wit and banter with great suggestions for the menu. They had both very healthy and very indulgent food options and I was excited to see some the variety. Based on a friend's recommendations, I ordered the green eggs with chicken sausage and potatoes. And let me tell you...it did not disappoint. This was so freaking good! If I lived in Houston, I would eat here every weekend.
