Uchi////Service, Service, Service, and excellent food.  Uchi is the Four Seasons of Houston restaurant service.  The food, without a question is also excellent.  Don't expect your typical Americanized sushi experience with soy sauce, ginger and wasabi.  Uchi is a sushi fusion experience.  For first time visitors, consider the chefs special menu to experience the best of the best Uchi has to offer.  Make your reservations well in advance.
