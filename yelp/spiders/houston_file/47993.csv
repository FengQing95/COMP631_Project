Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We visited Snooze this morning and found the restaurant disappointing. We had a great waiter with a great smile and she took our drink quickly, two cappuccinos. It took about 20 minutes to get our morning joe and to say the coffee lukewarm would be a stretch. We're waiting and waiting and our food was slow to appear. Finally over 20 minutes later the food arrived. I had ordered my eggs sunny side up and the eggs were cooked so hard, i had to use a knife and fork. The corned beef hash was overcooked and crunchy. We wanted another cappucino but it took so long to get the first ones we would not have received
