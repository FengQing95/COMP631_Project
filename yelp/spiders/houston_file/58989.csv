Baby Barnaby's////Cons: biggest one would be the weekend wait. I figured I might be able to bypass it by going relatively close to their 2pm closing time. Bzzzzt, thanks for playing! I still had to wait about a half-hour. This didn't particularly bother me, since they nicely (and intelligently) offer waiting guests unlimited coffee access, but I would almost certainly feel differently if this was 95-degrees-by-1pm August instead of a cool, sunny December day. (FYI to newbies: the waiting area is outdoors.) Also, I don't mind limited menus in some places, but -- having been spoiled by places like Magnolia Cafe in Austin, with sometimes a half-dozen or so different options for pancakes and at least two for migas style -- I thought the one-pager here was nevertheless a little ... condensed? Finally, there's the list of can't-be-avoided-unless-we-relocate-the-entire-restaurant cons like a complete lack of on-site parking, and at the moment street parking is hindered by ongoing construction on Fairview, as well as the restaurant's petite size ... which I guess goes directly back to my first complaint, so perhaps I should discount it a bit more.
