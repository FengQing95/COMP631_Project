Uchi////We were sat at our table after about 20 min and the service was superb. Travis, our waiter, was very knowledgeable, friendly, and patient. Our 10 yr old was with us and he brought out some fried chicken. Unfortunately there was a bit of spice which didn't work for her. He was very pleasant and had a new order made up without the sauce. I thought it was delicious though.
