Local Foods////Read reviews on yelp before I went and decided to try the Crunchy chicken sandwich, it did not disappoint. Very tasty meal, it was a bit big for lunch, I ended up taking half the sandwich home. Chips were a bit too toasty for my liking, but not too bad. The other side I got was the quinoa salad which I enjoyed very much.
