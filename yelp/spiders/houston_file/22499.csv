Uchi////This is a place to see and be seen, very trendy inside and you are paying for the ambiance and the quality of the food. If you are hungry and like a lot of food, but don't want to spend a fortune, this is NOT recommended. The quality is superb and the presentation is art on your plate, but the portions are small. I personally, enjoy paying a little less for a lot more food with still decent quality, elsewhere.
