Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have posted a photo. CLEARLY the old croissants were crispier, flakier, and had much more layers. The new ones are soft, don't flake at all when I take a bite into them and definitely have LESS layers. This wasn't a fluke. I've been to common bond many times hoping that it was just an OFF day.
