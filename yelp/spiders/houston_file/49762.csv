Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////After three tries, we finally made through the door without being told there is a 45 minute wait.  Came on a Friday morning and we're delighted to find parking and no wait.  Coffee was fresh and not bitter. Mae, our server, was prompt and offered great answers to all of our menu questions.  The pancakes were what we had hoped, fluffy and flavorful.  Breakfast tacos were flavorful, but was disappointed the tortillas had a prepackaged consistency. The spuds deluxe was my favorite item of the morning.  The hash browns were crispy but not dry.  I decided to have them with a runny egg and it was a delicious!!!
