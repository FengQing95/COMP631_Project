JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food itself took at least 35 minutes to get to us (we were slowly turning to starving statues and made us late to our movie) and I grabbed flustered kid again and begged him to check on our food. (It wasn't busy, wtf was going on?!) He said "oh right, your food, I'll go see if it's ready" lol like as if he forgot we were there to eat. It was warm, not hot, so obviously was sitting there for awhile while we died of neglect lol.
