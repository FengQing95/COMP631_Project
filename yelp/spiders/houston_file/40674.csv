Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////So many great things about Bosscat!!! The service was absolutely perfect! Our server, Maylet, was so great with her ability to answer my menu questions and communicate with the chef my dietary concerns and he came out with the perfect meal for me. (And he came to our table to make sure it was right). All four of us LOVED our food choices. Portions were also great for the price. Our drinks were always attended to and dirty dishes were quickly removed.  Tables were far enough apart to feel comfortable during Covid or just to have conversational privacy. The outdoor area is really nice, too.  We will be back often for sure.
