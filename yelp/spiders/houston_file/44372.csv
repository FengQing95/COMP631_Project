Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Parking can be a doozy because they share the lot with other retail stores. However the service is great. A little pricey but I didn't mind. They serve an array of delicious sweets and treats. As well as some great food. It's small but has adequate seating if you go during off peak times. The mocha is divine. Chocolate walnut cookies are delicious as well as the strawberry passion fruit cake.
