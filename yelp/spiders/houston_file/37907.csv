Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First time here in Houston and decided to check out Bosscat! We got here in time for happy hour which was PERF!!! The decor of the place was super cute, we were greeted by a guy named Terry who turned out to be our waiter. He was super nice and very knowledgeable of the menu. We started out with the Pig Pickin' Tacos , which were THEE BEST tacos I've ever had! Â Terry suggested my boyfriend get the "The Bosscat Burger" and I got opted for an open face turkey sandwich which was covered in a monray sauce and had bacon as well. We also had whiskey and cokes as well since it was happy hour of course! Who doesn't like a good whisky and coke for only $5!!!! Our food was great, service was impeccable all thanks to Terry! I will definitely come back next time I'm in Houston!
