Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is a great place to go for brunch, if you don't mind the wait! They have several drinks to choose from, and they keep them coming!  They also have knorks(heavy-duty forks made to cut through meat)!  If you love pancakes, you must try the Blackberry Crumble(?) Pie pancakes!  They are superb!!!
