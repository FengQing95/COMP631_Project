Kata Robata////"You get what you pay for" most definitely applies to this restaurant. Kata Robata isn't a cheap sushi place where you'll be served complimentary anything... but what you will get is great service, and some of the freshest tasting sashimi and award winning food you will have ever tasted. With that said, you should come to Kata Robata with an empty stomach and more importantly, a (very) full wallet.
