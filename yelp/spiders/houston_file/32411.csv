Local Foods////I regularly visit Local Foods for lunch and am definitely a fan!  Whenever I take people there, I first recommend the truffle egg salad sandwich.  YUM!!  I've tried many sandwiches here and that one's always stood out the most.  The duck confit sandwich is also great though it hasn't always been on the menu when I've gone.  I'm a fan of smoked salmon, and this place does not disappoint with their smoked salmon sandwich!  The sandwiches come with an option of two sides-- they're all pretty healthy though I like some of them better than others. I've tried some of the salads although they haven't been as memorable.
