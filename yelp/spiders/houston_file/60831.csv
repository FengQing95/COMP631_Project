Baby Barnaby's////Service can be a bit snippy and I've felt rushed to pay and leave every time I've been. I realize they are trying to turn over the tables but we were approached twice in 10 minutes after paying the check and "encouraged to leave." While Baby Barnabys is good food at a good price, I'm just not willing to brave long lines or pushy servers, especially when Houston has so many other places for brunch.
