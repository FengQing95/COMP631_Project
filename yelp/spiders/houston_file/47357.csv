Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze has a very contemporary upbeat atmosphere with a retro style The food remind me of a breakfast in bed and Landon and a very romantic way the food is delicious very flavorful you have to go early be in line before they open there's always a long wait anywhere from a hour to three hours of awake time be prepared to stand outside maybe in the rain like I had to there's only a limited of seating outside some people said it is worth the wait me myself I don't think so there are other places in the city that has way greater food then this one and I would rather wait that time with them not meaning it in a negative way just that I don't care to wait three hours anywhere for food I am a chef myself and I wouldn't want to wait on my food that long and I know mine damn good but I love the place everything was wonderful out besides the wait time and it was my birthday weekend and I had to wait till my Complete party get there to get a seat unfair and it took forever to get our food once we got in and got seated and there was 4 mistakes so I sought my whole plate back and just didn't get anything had lost my appetite by this point but everyone else enjoy their food they said the Momosa was great we had a very friendly waiter
