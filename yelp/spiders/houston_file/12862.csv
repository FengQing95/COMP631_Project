JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had bookmarked this place quite a few months ago and finally got a chance to visit this weekend! To be honest loved everything about this place. We went early for dinner, around 5:30pm so the waiting time was about 5 to 10mins. (Try and go early as this place is mostly packed on weekends).
