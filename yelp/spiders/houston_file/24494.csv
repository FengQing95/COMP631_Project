Uchi////The baby yellowtail my mom got (inada) came out and she seemed uncomfortable with the way it looked.  After a nibble, she gave it to Eric R. and I to split - it was nothing special and not fatty or soft like expected, compared to the hama chili.  The brussel sprouts were over-sauced and intensely salty.
