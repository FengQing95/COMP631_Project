Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Second time going here. The service is great. Music is good, although sometimes can get a bit too loud if you're there to actually talk to people. It's just the food is not good. We started with the bourbon chicken flatbread. It was room temperature when they brought it out. Something about the chicken just wasn't good. And then I ordered a salad. Seemed like it was just a bag of baby spinach and whoever made it, didn't add many toppings at all. I ordered it with chicken, and someone just slopped the chicken on the side of the salad as opposed to mixing it in like normal. Problem is, it was the same exact chicken that was on the flatbread. Some weirdly sliced, randomly seasoned, questionable meat. It actually looked like frozen sliced turkey that had been thawed and dipped in some random sauce. Not appetizing at all. Once I saw the chicken I was actually thankful they didn't mix it in. But really, it was just a bag of baby spinach with a sprinkle of corn kernels and peas. I have no problem coming back for the atmosphere and drinks, but I'm gonna leave it at that, the food is just not good and definitely not worth the price.
