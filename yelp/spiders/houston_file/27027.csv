The Pit Room////I came here on a weekday to meet one of my friends for lunch. The parking is super limited but I managed to snag a spot before it was all full. The place was super packed with a line almost out the door but it went by really fast. You order your food at the front like a lot of bbq places, cafeteria style. My friend and I split the texmex dinner with two tacos and two sides. We got the brisket taco and chicken taco and a double side of mac n cheese.
