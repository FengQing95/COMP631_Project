Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////3. The servers must all be new.  I ordered a chai off the drink menu on the table before I got a menu.  When I did get a menu, I ordered quickly.  The waiter left, then he came back to ask if I wanted butter or jelly for the toast.  I asked for butter. I was asked if I wanted it on the toast or on the side.  I said on the toast was fine.
