Kata Robata////Anyway, onto the food. We came just as happy hour was closing, but our waitress encouraged us to go ahead and order off the HH menu, so that we did. From the happy hour menu we order the tartar (super flavorful and fresh, good sized portion too), ceviche (um, what was this, ceviche for ants? it had beautiful plating/presentation but beautiful isn't gonna fill up my tummy), and a few rolls (nothing extraordinary here, it is a happy hour). I'd definitely come and fill up on a few cheaper rolls to start then tuck into their main menu items, esp their sashimi.
