Uchi////It seemed like our waiter was a bit peeved that we didn't order any drinks. Kind of like he was rushing us out. As we were eating dessert, he brought our check out, which is fine. What is not fine is to come back to get it while we were still eating. Am I supposed to stop eating and go into my purse and pull out my card? Â He came, got the book, did a double take when he saw that nothing was in it, and we said "oh we didn't put anything in it"(b/c we are still freaking eating!!!). Then he put it back on the table and went away. Come on. Let me enjoy my food.
