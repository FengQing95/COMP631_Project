Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I also ordered a caramel latte, which I was disappointed with. I think that somehow the coffee barista failed to mix the caramel syrup adequately with the rest of the latte which resulted in me getting a bad latte. Although, it did have a pretty design on the top. It was so bad that I didn't finish my latte, which is a first. Who doesn't finish their latte/coffee?!? I didn't have the audacity to complain because it just didn't seem worth it based on the experience with all of our other food.
