Baby Barnaby's////I ordered the migas, because they were mentioned a lot in the Yelp highlights, and I'm a sheep. The thing about being a Yelp sheep though, is this: it almost always plays into your favor. You see, I let a bunch of other people visit a place 5 or 6 times to determine what's the best. Then I swoop in once, order the best, and walk away feeling like a regular in a town I don't live in.
