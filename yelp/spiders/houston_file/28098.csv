The Pit Room////The brisket was tender and flavorful - just the right amount of fatty meat; the pork sausage was very tasty and a good punch of flavor; the pork ribs were just ok - I could have skipped those - the flavor was good, but not stellar, and the end piece was extremely dry. The mac n cheese was delicious! Yes as some people mentioned it does come in a rather soupy sauce, but that just made me want to drink it TBH. The charro beans were very good and flavorful as well. The BBQ sauce that came on the side was tangy and a little spicy, which was perfect to me. I tried their coffee bourbon BBQ sauce which had a nice flavor but a bit on the sweet side. It tasted good mixed with their house BBQ sauce. I love love the pickle bar - I had the pickles, jalape√±o, and onions - you can tell it's all homemade pickles and it was a great accompaniment to the meats.
