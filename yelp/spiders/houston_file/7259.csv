JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The venue was small and we sat at a large multi seat table that was around where the glass rocks were. The stools got pretty uncomfortable after a while but I assume that is also a tactic to get asses out of chairs in a timely manner to accommodate more patrons. Â We showed up at about 1:30 on a Sunday and I was sure we were going to wait. Nope, walked right in.
