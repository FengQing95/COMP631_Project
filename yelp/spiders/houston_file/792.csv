JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Earlier, when the semester started, before all the pressure and late nights prepping for exams I frequented this ramen bar for lunch. I usually enjoy the short walk from the parking garage to the restaurant. Usually, that's when you'd see me walking in midtown, when in search for food. This is totally different and much more pricier than the dorm room microwavable ramen noodle cups. When I am here, ramen is classy food, you're sophisticated when you slurp the loudest and longest without choking. But back at the dorm the kitchen is the microwave, and hardly anything classy comes out of there. Usually, the ramen liquid boils over the cup because I didn't eyeball it properly. I make this painful, choppy slurp when trying to eat the noodles because it is blistering hot and it is-- ramen cups, needless to say. Real ramen is the best, and at Jinya it is pretty good. I usually spend around $25 excluding tips for lunch... the add ons, that's how they get ya.
