Uchi////The last course was probably the worst quite frankly.  The Goat Cheese Cheesecake was actually pretty good, and the Apricot Brittle that dusted the plate was creative and unique, but the Rosemary Gelato was just downright wrong.  Those flavors just didn't belong together at all.  There was also some type of sauce on the plate (I think it was Apricot based).  Regardless, it was bitter and I hope it was just a screw up in the kitchen, because it practically ruined the redeemable parts of the dish.
