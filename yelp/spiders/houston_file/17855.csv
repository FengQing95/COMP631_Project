Uchi////I have to say this is the first time I have to bad a horrible review for a restaurant.  I'm not the type of person to judge a place but place I wouldn't not recommend for dinner.  My first reason why is:  I had gone to the necessary procedure of knowing this place was going to be a full house.  In which I made a month in advance reservation for our anniversary.  I was looking forward to the restaurant since all my friends told me this place was really good, and it really amiable.
