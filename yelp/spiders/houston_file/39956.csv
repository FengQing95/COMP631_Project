Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I ordered the beef short ribs which was super tender with a sweet peppery sauce. The au gratin potatoes underneath were amazingly good! I don't know what's in it - but I don't know if I've ever had potatoes this good! Crazy good! The onion rings are also a perfect match to the dish and green beans to get some green veggies in. It's a generous portion of food so I took home leftovers, and they were still yummy! Â
