JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Rachel - Thanks for your great review. According to my managers, weekday lunch rush usually starts around 11:30AM with the dining room filling up by 12:30PM and usually clearing out by 1:30PM. On the weekend, however, the lunch rush varies, with large groups usually arriving before 12PM, and a steady influx of guests throughout the afternoon.
