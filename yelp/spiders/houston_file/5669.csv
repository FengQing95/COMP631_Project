JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ordered the fried chicken nuggets, it was delicous. They were very crispy but also very moist and it was seasoned well, I would order these again. The takoyaki was also very good, it had a lot of octopus in it unlike other places like kubos. The ramen was alright, I had ordered the spicy miso. The broth was mediocre, I think the broth at ramen Jin is much more rich and seasoned better. I would definitely come again for those nuggets
