The Pit Room////I came on a Thursday mid afternoon and there was no line at all. A few patrons were dining in but plenty of seating. I got a two meat combo (pork ribs + turkey) with two sides (Mac and cheese + coleslaw). I enjoyed both my meats and turkey wasn't dry (yay!), but still think Killens turkey is even juicier. Mac and cheese was yummy and cole slaw was a surprise with the unexpected heat. Probably would try another side next time. Was a bit disappointed to find no desserts since the super heavy desserts are another thing I look forward at Killens, but no biggie. This isn't Killens and they serve what they want to serve, so I will stop trying to impose Killens on them.
