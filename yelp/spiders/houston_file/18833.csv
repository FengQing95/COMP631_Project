Uchi////We told our waiter to take care of us for the night and he did a fantastic job. We had about 12 dishes/plates- some hot, some cold, some raw, and some cooked. I wish I could share exactly what I ate but all I can remember was each bite was so yummy. Although we got pretty stuffed at the end, we managed to order 3 more plates of dessert. I got something close to a lemon sorbet with pistachios and it was delicious.
