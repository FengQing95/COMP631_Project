JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My favorite ramen place in Houston, hands down! I love all the options they give you. The best thing to do is get extra noodles and take your leftovers home...and then have ramen for lunch the next day! While I always have a great experience there with fast service, my last visit I had a waiter named Kevin who totally made my day. He was so sweet and helpful, I will definitely be asking for him every time I go now.
