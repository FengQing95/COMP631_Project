JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is where I first tried bao bun sandwich with pork belly in a sweet sauce with cucumber, the soft bun is divine. Then I had the Tonkotsu Black, which by the mere looks has a lot going on but it plays out so beautifully you'll remember the flavors weeks after (which is why I'm writing this 4 weeks after). The broth is rich, noodles tender, and the kikurage mushroom's crunch all compliment each other. Will most definitely be returning, hopefully soon!
