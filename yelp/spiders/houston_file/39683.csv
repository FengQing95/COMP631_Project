Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I ordered the Maui Meatloaf while my boyfriend ordered the Short Rib Chilaquiles. The flavors in my dish were impeccable, but the texture was so uniform that I sincerely thought that the steamed rice was mashed potatoes. I had to steal a handful of chips from my boyfriend's dish to use as a contrast! My boyfriend's dish was fantastic as well, but we couldn't seem to locate an adequate amount of meat in it (even though lighting is dim in there, we don't think that's the problem).
