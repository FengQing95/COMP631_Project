Local Foods////Thomson raved about the crunchy chicken.  It's also what the clerk recommended.  I was sick so I wanted to go soup.  The clerk brings out two samples and I decide I like them both and get small cups of both.  The Posole was probably better for my sickness, as it was more brothy and bland.  It was ok.  The tomato soup was yummy as a sample, but then when they brought out the cup, it had olives that changed the flavor and it was olive oil heavy.  I found I like the sample version of it more because it tasted lighter.
