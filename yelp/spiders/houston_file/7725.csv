JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////When it comes to ramen, I'm kind of boring and get the chicken based ramen dishes. Wonton Chicken Ramen or the Jinya Chicken Ramen are my favorites. But I tried some of my friend's Spicy Umami Miso Ramen and it was excellent! I really like that any of the ramen on the menu is pretty customizable, with tons of additional toppings available and control over the spice level of most spicy dishes. Plus the portions are huge, I always have some to take home.
