Uchi////My friend was disappointed because he had been to Uchiko in Austin, where the servers really engage with you and adjust the omakase depending on your tastes and preferences. This isn't the case at the Houston Uchi, and they serve based on what the chef wants to serve that day, regardless of your preference.
