Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food is delicious, but it's always a hassle to visit this restaurant. Very busy and there aren't nice, comfortable places to wait for a table. We ended up being seated right next to the parking lot outside. Kind of weird, but again, the food was delicious. I think the overall space is just too small at this location.
