Baby Barnaby's////Quaint little place for breakfast. There menu is limited but all delicious. My favorite is the green eggs breakfast which comes with scrambled eggs with spinach, and something else that I cant recall along with potatoes, wheat toast, and apple sausage. Also ordered the french toast. Expect a wait because this place fills up fast but service and food are always wonderful.
