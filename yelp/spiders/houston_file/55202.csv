Kata Robata////Changing the rating to four stars :( my policy is that 5 stars means that the place is the best in the city...well we tried uchi after this place hehehe. However, still a very strong restaurant! I don't like all the sushi rolls they have though. The rising sun roll is still incredible le and also like the jalepeno something roll a lot. The happy hour is decent..but you could get amazing happy hour foods somewhere else.
