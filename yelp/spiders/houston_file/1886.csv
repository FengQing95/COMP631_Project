JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So my wife and I are driving by on our way to get some Pho' and we happen to see this place and decide to stop in and check it out. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by everyone at once with whatever their special saying is. We sat at the bar and checked out the menu. So your thinking ramen and you have to feel like that's pretty basic. Well its not for sure. They have taken ramen to a whole new level and "Wow" its awesome. I recommend the Ramen Black (comes with a soft boiled egg). Delicious and filling. We also had the French fries with truffle ketchup and the deep fried brussel sprouts with truffle oil and I highly recommend them both. Great atmosphere and great food and very reasonable prices. I have been back 3 more times and it gets better every time I go.
