Uchi////The Happy Hour menu is fantastic.  Service is very attentive; they have a huge staff so there's always someone to pick up your used dishes.  My boyfriend and I even got a free dish to share (not from the Happy Hour menu, so it definitely wasn't cheap!).  I believe this was a promotion for first time customers.
