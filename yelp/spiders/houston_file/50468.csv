Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze Spuds Deluxe (additions: soyrizo, roasted garlic) (3.5/5): Hash browns covered in cheese with 2 additions - I chose soyrizo and roasted garlic.  Unfortunately, the soyrizo did not go well with the hash browns - the textures were weird together, and the soyrizo was a bit too salty with the potatoes.  Although it definitely wasn't a bad dish by any means, there are so many other amazing things on the menu that I would not order this again.
