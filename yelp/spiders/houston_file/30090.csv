The Pit Room////Service- we got our food and beverages and had a seat outside. When we went back to purchase JUST 2 more beers and NO FOOD, the cashier told us we had to wait in the back of the line, mean you the line is about a 10-15min wait. This was after the next person in line said it was fine. This was after we spent $150 and gave them a 20% tip.
