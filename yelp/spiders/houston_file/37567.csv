Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Visited on a Saturday afternoon for a birthday gathering. Disappointed to find that they don't offer their signature brunch on Saturdays. They have a separate menu, which seemed somewhat small in my opinion. They need a mimosa menu. I ordered the "flap jacked" banana pancakes, turkey sausage with egg whites. The cakes where much thicker than expected for protein pancakes, but lacked the banana flavor I was hoping for, overall mediocre, but healthier nonetheless. The birthday girl ordered the steak & eggs flatbread which I also tasted. It was really tasty, and she was pleased. The service was great and the ambiance/decor was really nice.
