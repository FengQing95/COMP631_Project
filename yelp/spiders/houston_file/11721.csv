JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The closest at Jinya that achieve this deep flavor is the tonkotsu black ramen. Please do yourselves a favor and don't order the chicken broth ramen, you would have more depth of flavor at sweet tomatoes. I digress it is not a bad place to get Ramen but if literally there is only one item on the entire menu that is "decent" to me, it can't be that good either.
