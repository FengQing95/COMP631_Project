Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Onto the food....DELICIOUS! Breakfast/brunch is hands down my favorite meal of the day. I got the egg scramble with some of my favorite toppings, feta, spinach, mushrooms, poblano peppers, and tomatoes. AMAZING! Instead of the hash browns, I opted for the chocolate chip pancake for curiosity, and toast. This is so strange, but their bread was so fresh and so perfectly toasted/buttered, I wish I could buy the loaf for home! I just got the chocolate chip pancake. It was slightly underwhelming as the pancake was slightly cakey. I must stay, our friend's son got the specialty pancake sampler, and the cakier pancakes just make more sense for these with the heavy toppings. The pancakes are definitely worth a try! My boyfriend got the tofu scramble (Which we both appreciated very much as we are both vegetarians!). We love this place because it's very vegetarian friendly, even for those who don't eat eggs! He thought it was delicious and according to the table, the hash browns are AMAZING!
