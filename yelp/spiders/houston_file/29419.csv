The Pit Room////Don't believe the hype. Or maybe I should just order brisket. I'm from Memphis and live in Texas. I am a pulled pork guy. Theirs was like a sloppy joe...and daughter got sausage that wouldn't even cut and tasted like ground up ligaments. How this place gets ratings this high is beyond me.
