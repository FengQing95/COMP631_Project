Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze might be the most overrated restaurant I have ever been to.... Honestly, I do not understand the hype at all. Today, Friday morning, we waited almost 40 minutes. Once we ordered the food took 35-40 minutes and, plainly put, wasn't good. I would take Breakfast Klub or Dot's Diner any day of the year over this place! It was overpriced, took too long (maybe hire more cooks?), portions were small, and just plain bad. My cappuccino tasted like it came out of one of those machines they have in the waiting room at a car dealership (you know the one where you push a button and it mixes water and concentrated coffee and tops it off with crappy, thin foam). I ordered the Benny Duo (Avocado Smash Benny and the Chile Verde) and my husband got the Hash. Our friend ordered pancakes for the table and those were actually pretty good, but again, small. I am glad I tried it so I now know that I never ever need to go again.
