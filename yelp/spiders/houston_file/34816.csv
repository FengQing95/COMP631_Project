Local Foods////Came here because it was close to the museum district. My wife likes the food here. The food was fresh and little pricey. However I think the ambiance was excellent. I honestly cannot remember the food anymore because they change the food due to seasonal changes in produce. Nevertheless, I vaguely remember I had a bagel and perhaps lox and my wife remarked how amazing the smell was from the toasted sesame seeds.
