Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place has such awesome deserts and food! The only thing bad about this place is its too unfriendly. The staff there rush you to get out of there so more people can come in. I do not feel relaxed when I eat there. The staff there could be smiling a bit more and welcoming to customers. I've been there a couple of times and none of them ever smile. It maybe because it's so busy there? Stressed out? Â I give a 5 stars for the food and 1 star for the staff and service.
