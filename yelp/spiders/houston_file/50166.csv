Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Wow just wow Here's  more stars to make it a perfect 10!. I had heard about all the hype with this place when it first opened, went on a weekend and over an hour wait, so we left and never made it back. Had a dr's appointment today so took my friend who drove me to try this place. First of all the staff here are fantastic, truly fantastic people who were helpful, friendly, and very on point with service. We received a complimentary sinful pancake with cinnamon buttery goodness, delish bacon bits,  white chocolate chips...food porn XXX rated  ordered the cornbeef hash which isn't like country style mashed up soft cornbeef with small potatoes.... it's almost like pieces of brisket like corn beef with pieces of hash brown.. still very tasty.  The best thing next to the sinful pancake was the....drum roll please..... grilled cheese and tomato basil OMG so yummy... the bread was perfectly crisped on the outside and when you dunk it in the tomato basil you won't be able to stop. Everything is decently reasonably priced and very delish. Would def return to try other items. They have items for vegans too!!
