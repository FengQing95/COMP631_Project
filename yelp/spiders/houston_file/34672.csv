Local Foods////I ordered an egg salad sandwich with kale and couscous, and I also got their mintade. The food came out really quickly, but I took some extra time soaking in the restaurant as a whole. It's simple and beautifully decorated, and has a really relaxed, hip vibe. Â Anyway, the food was awesome. I'm not much of an egg salad person, but this was really something else. The bread really makes this sandwich. I actually have no idea how to describe it, but it's pretty amazing. It elevates something as simple as egg salad into a really delicious lunch choice. The kale really is as good as everyone says, couscous was okay but was better with their homemade chips crushed on top. Quinoa was extremely fresh as well. Next time I come, I'll probably get two servings of kale. Mintade is probably one of the best citrus blends I've ever had, and it had a nice balance between sweet and tart.
