Kata Robata////The wife and I chose Kata Robata on a whim, even though we had planned to go here much earlier. We popped onto Open Table and punched in our 9:00 p.m. reservation. Voila, Kata Robata time. We arrived promptly at 9:00 and were seated post-haste. One of the happiest surprises about Kata (or should I just say Robata? KR. Who knows) was the stellar service. While I'm loathe to admit that I forgot our servers name after grilling him on any number of things, he truly made our night special.
