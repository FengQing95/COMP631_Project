Uchi////1. Waygu Beef Special - Hands down, the best beef I've ever tasted. It tastes like the best Texas brisket you've never had. Cooked sous-vide, it's amazingly tender, wonderfully fatty, and perfectly peppered. If it didn't cost an arm and a leg, I could eat this every day for the rest of my life. It comes with some other accoutrements depending on the day, but I'm all about the beef.
