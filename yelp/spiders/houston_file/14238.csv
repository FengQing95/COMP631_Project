JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Seriously.. what really had me super excited to eat here was when the hostess walked us in and we were greeted by the kitchen staff and servers. That got me smiling and laughing like crazy and I knew I was going to be in for a treat. The place looked wonderful and I wish I would've eaten in the middle of the restaurant where the rocks were.
