Baby Barnaby's////Deehuuuuuddeeeee Baby Barnaby's is definitely a must hit breakfast joint in Houston. You MUST try the Green Eggs. The eggs are perfectly cooked with just the right amount of spinach, artichoke, and plentyyy of cheese (I love cheese). Also, the chicken apple sausage is quite tasty as well!
