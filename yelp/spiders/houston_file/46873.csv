Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I called for a pick up order they said it would be ready in 15 minutes. I got there in 20 minutes. They said it would be 15 more minutes. I waited 30 more minutes. Mind you they arent as busy as usual.(I drive by there all the time) There was no line and people were coming in and being seated but they were a little busy. Â Anyways I ordered the sweet potato hash. I take a bite and the sweet potatoes are still extremely crunchy! Its like they only warmed them up and didnt even cook them not even a little bit! I kinda moved everything around and ate from different parts thinking maybe that was the only one, but NOPE it was all of them. Definately not going back. Definately not worth the wait. everyone was nice but thats not worth my time or money.
