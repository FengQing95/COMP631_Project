Kata Robata////So incredibly disappointed today! Our family came in to visit and we made reservations in advance. Had checked before and they said they had gluten free options. We have members of our family with Celiac and at the time we were seated( which was 5:30) we were even willing to eat early as we have always loved it...when we asked to confirm...the waiter did a horrible job at letting us know that they announced last week that they stopped doing GF options due to supply chain issues. Ate at Uchi yesterday and they handled and entire chef's menu GF without question. If they had handled it nicer it would have been easier to swallow!
