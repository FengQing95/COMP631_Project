Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////For drinks I stuck with my typical Long Island order and I must say they prepared some of the best Long Islands I've had in the city. My drink was mixed to perfection as it was smooth but still had just a slight kick to it. Just off the drinks alone I knew this would be a new a happy hour spot for me. It's not rare to receive good food and drinks in Houston but for the service to be just as great is a hard find.
