Uchi////We started with brussel sprouts, which were amazing.  We tried the chef's sample of sushi  - the waiter brought us 5 random pieces servings that we shared.  They were all good but because of this I don't remember everything we tried.  The one that stood out was the Zero Sen.  We ordered a second round of it.  It had a smokey flavor and basically melted in your mouth.
