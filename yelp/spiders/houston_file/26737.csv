The Pit Room////Best brisket I have tasted, beats anything in Lockhart. Loads of bark, and the fat has gelled into honey. Does not need sause. Only BBQ spot my wife will go to. She loves the brisket tacos. Beef ribs must be special, as was the choice for half the folks in the place. The sides are gourmet quality. The grilled okra are off the chart.
