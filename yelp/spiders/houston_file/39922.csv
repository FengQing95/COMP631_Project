Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The tuna wraps were supposed to contain lightly seared ahi tuna but it was definitely cooked well done. The flavor of the sauce was good but I didn't taste the pickling of the vegetables so the overall taste fell a little flat.  My boyfriend said the chicken sandwich was mediocre and not worth $14 for a sandwich that didn't come with a side of anything (no fries or salad etc).  We did end up ordering a side of the Bosscat fries, and I liked their crispyness but he did not like them at all.
