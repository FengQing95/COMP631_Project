Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is a very solid brunch spot! I don't think it is worth the wait... But if you plan accordingly: place your name on the wait list, have your phone fully juiced so that you can receive the text when your table is ready, and go check out the Menil (or lounge at home if you're close by) while you wait, you will be satisfied. If you wait there, especially if you're hungry, you may be disappointed.
