Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food is consistently good at every Snooze, but the wait is consistently long and the parking is severely limited at this location. There are no reservations, which is understandable but I really don't like their policy to only seat a party once every single person has arrived. It makes for a crowded inside and patio.
