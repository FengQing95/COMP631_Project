Baby Barnaby's////There's a small dirt parking lot right across the street, as well as street parking. There's a small patio on the right hand side where you can enjoy the weather... Once inside we were greeted with a smile. The strawberry lemonade is the BEST I've ever had and they do refills! We got the sweet potato fries which were a nice treat. I got the meat load and mashed potatoes, the portions were good enough to feed two people. I wish I had saved room for dessert, there's also a $1 stimulus brownie (offer is good til the DOW hits 10,000 I think)
