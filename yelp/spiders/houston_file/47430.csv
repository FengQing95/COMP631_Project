Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Long wait since it's the new hype but they do have good breakfast food. I had the pick-two Benny dish and hubby had corned beef hash. Try the yellowbird hot sauce for a nice kick. Friendly and knowledgable waitstaff. Parking was kinda difficult but we got lucky and found a good spot in front.
