The Pit Room////We ordered a three meat plate (three meats and two sides) plus and extra side, and it was plenty enough for two people.  The brisket was ridiculously tender to the point that I don't think I used a knife, the pulled pork was great too.  The sausage was OK, but the other two meats were the winners.
