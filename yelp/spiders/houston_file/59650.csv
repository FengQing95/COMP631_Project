Baby Barnaby's////Bottomless coffee is a must. I LOVE their green eggs plate because I get fond memories of Dr. Seuss every time. The plate also comes with a side of tots, fruit, and chicken sausage. I recommend substituting sausage for bacon because it always comes out a bit too charred for my taste.
