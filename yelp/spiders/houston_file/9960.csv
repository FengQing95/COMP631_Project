JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great Restaurant called Artisan's. A Gem of a place. This entire area seems to be a big Asian Community . I am sure when we go back we will try to eat off the menu and sit down. In this area there are Great Eatery's, More show up weekly. So I suggest looking thru Yelp and find another gem.
