Kata Robata////I've been meaning to try Kata Robata for a while so I hopped on over here one day after work and they were crowded with an hour wait. Um...no thanks. So we left and went over to Aka instead. Next time we decided to go I was smarter and made reservations. The ambiance was bright and cheery with the servers being very attentive.
