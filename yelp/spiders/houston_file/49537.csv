Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Although I love having eggs, meats, and hashbrowns for breakfast, I am always so excited when there is gluten free pancakes at a restaurant. I got the pancake flight (10$). You are able to choose any of the pancakes from the menu and they can make all of the gluten free. I was excited to not choose a plain buttermilk pancake, so I got the blueberry danish, the sweet potato, and the pineapple pancake. It tasted wonderful and it was gluten free!
