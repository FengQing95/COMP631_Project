Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Best kouign amanns in Houston, hands down. What are kouign amanns? A buttery. flakey croissant-like pastry with a caramel bottom. Common Bond has these on display caramel-side up. Actually, I'm not sure where else one goes to get kouign amanns in Houston, but I don't need to know! I've had the kouign amanns as Dominique Ansel's in NYC, and Common Bond can stand their own.
