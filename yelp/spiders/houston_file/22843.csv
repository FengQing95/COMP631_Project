Uchi////I will tell you he was awesome. He made sure to include my only request (Hama chili!!) and everything else was free reign to bring whatever. We loved it all! I think our favs were the 'ham and eggs', foie gras and pork belly. I will say that by doing that 10-course instead of the chef tasting, John saved us about $20 off our total bill. Also for my sister's birthday, he comped us ALL FOUR DESSERTS POR GRATIS. We were dying. Dying.
