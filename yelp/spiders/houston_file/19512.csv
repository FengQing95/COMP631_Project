Uchi////Conclusion - Uchi's sushi is truly excellent, while tasting plates were hit or miss for us (at $15-$30 per tasting).  Quite unexpectedly, the best things we had were the edamame, karage, and the desserts... coincidentally the least expensive things on the menu :)   The desserts really blew me away - You just can't find desserts like this anywhere else in Houston right now!
