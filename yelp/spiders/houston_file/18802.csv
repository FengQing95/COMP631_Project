Uchi////Part of me thought this place would be overrated. It's not. Frickin awesome. I hate these "be there to be seen" places but despite the cost of food there was a pretty diverse crowd. Ok so the food.... Unique and delicious. I've been a few times and have always enjoyed evrything I ordered....and I've pretty much are almost everything on the menu. That being said it's not cheap. But honestly I would pay the prices for uchi over saving money at miyako anyday. I've also been for happy hour which is a great deal. U have to get there before 5 and stand in a line until they open though. Service has always been impeccable...and the little extras they do here really seal the deal.. Hot hand towels...palate cleansing ice-thing... And the complimentary dishes they sometimes give out.
