Uchi////An absolute fabulous, fantastic, delicious dinning experience. The décor is fun and eclectic  with a very warm and inviting atmosphere.  The staff is off the charts!  I don't know how they do it but we ordered wine from one bar tender and as soon as we were ready to order a second   glass, a completely different bar tender already knew our order.  You should expect a wait but even that is a fun and charming experience due to the electrical vibrant energy of this gem.  The food is a layered fusion of deliciousness, expect 4 or more different staff to bring it to you with a very detailed and passionate description of how it was prepared and what each layers consists of.  5 stars well earned!!!
