Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First, let's just get the best part out of the way: This is an instagrammer's dream. All their walls are glass paneled, so natural lighting is eminent throughout the small restaurant. Even the pastries are made literally so perfect, and displayed so prettily that just taking pictures of them in line would suffice as a post. No filters necessary. Their bread looks so pretty, I had to ask if they were real.
