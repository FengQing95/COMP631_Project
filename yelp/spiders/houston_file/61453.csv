Baby Barnaby's////I got the Migas this time, and they were really delicious. They load up eggs with fresh peppers and onions, but it's not at all spicy. The salsa has great flavor but little to no kick, so it leaves some to be desired in the heat department. On the table were also a standard breakfast plate and a plate of steak and eggs. Their scrambled eggs are fluffy and fresh tasting, over medium looked perfect, as well. Nana reported the wheat toast was great and not too dark of a wheat, while the English muffins was not ideal. The steak was a little tough, but had really great flavor. The bacon was a good middle of the road thickness, and not too salty, and was received well. Their coffee was awesome, but nothing beats fresh-pressed orange juice.
