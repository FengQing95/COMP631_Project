Kata Robata////My wife and I ate here on a Saturday night recently and it was outstanding. Our waitress Margaret was so knowledgeable and nice. We had multiple items on the menu from sushi to the Miso Lobster Mac n Cheese and everything was phenomenal! Such a treat to know such great service exists. We will now be regulars to the best sushi/robata restaurant in all of Houston.
