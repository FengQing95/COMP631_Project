Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I really like this bakery and always come here whenever I visit houston. This time a few stars will be taken off because their service has gone downhill. However the food and drinks are still good as always. Atmosphere is good and place is cute and nice. My partner and I took our 2 puppies to have some fun and just to enjoy our breakfast here. Usually pets are not allowed inside so we decided to sit down oustide first and one person will come inside to get a menu to look at and order later. I was sitting outside with my puppies and was unaware of whats happening inside. Apparently, their staff was given my partner a hard time and somewhat pressure him to order now or be gone. That is what their policy is according to their staff. My partner explained to them that we have pets and couldnt bring them inside. How hard can it be to let us bring a takeout menu outside, look at it, and order later? What is exactly so difficult about that for them to escalate things? Then the staff has the audacity to tell him this, "Isn't it common sense for you guys to order first and take a sit later?" Say what?! lol There are many places that let their customers sit down first, BREATH, take time and then order. Only this restaurant pressures you to order first and then you can sit down at a table. So my husband had to order something for them to allow us to sit at the table oustide. Really good food here but even if the food is delicious, I can't really enjoy it when the restaurant finds every reason to not welcome you unless you order and pay them first.
