Uchi////I knew about this restaurant from when the travel channel featured the original location in Austin. So when we were in Houston for a week I made sure to add this restaurant on the list of places to eat there. We tried to do a walk in on a Wednesday night the wait is 2hrs for a party of two. That's how on demand this place is, I made the reservation before we walked out to make sure not to wait the when we come back.
