The Pit Room////Best BBQ I have ever had. This place is a must try in the Houston area. Decided to spilt the entire dish, because as you will see plenty of food to share. Decided to come here twice in one weekend in town. We decided to get the pork ribs, venison sausage (the first day) and the pork sausage the next day. The ribs were fall off the bone good. Small location and not much seating, but definitely worth waiting In line for. Not much parking but who cares with this quality bbq. Also the bbq sauce extremely spicy and amazing probably best I have ever had. The coleslaw was only disappointment it really had no flavor. We got the potato salad on our second trip which was better. Bread was great dipping in the bbq sauce. Must try and you'll be happy you did!
