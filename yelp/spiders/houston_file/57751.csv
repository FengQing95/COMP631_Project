Kata Robata////I have really enjoyed every meal that I have ever had at Kata Robata. I have spent a lot of time at this restaurant over the years and I have never had a bad meal here. Chef Hori and I have had a number of conversations after each meal and he is such a kind Chef. Whose goal is to just make sure his guests are always happy and eating the most innovative and delicious food. His Food is simply some of the best quality sushi I have had. The atmosphere is really a special one that can be amazing for large groups or a couples dinner. Thirdly, they are very accommodating to us as It was a special event and they proved to be just fantastic in providing a special service
