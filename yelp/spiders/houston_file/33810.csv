Local Foods////This place is more than a sandwich shop. They are the special treat I reward myself with at the end of a long week. Local Foods is the place I bring healthy food skeptics to prove them wrong. I was once one of those skeptics. Local Foods has heart. It's a place built on values. All the ingredients are fresh, treated with love and patience. The manager cares sincerely for the place like it's his baby. Even if you don't love it, you have to respect a place that is trying to make delicious, healthy food... but then again, how could you not LOVE Local Foods?
