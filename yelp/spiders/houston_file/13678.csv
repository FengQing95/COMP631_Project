JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went on a Friday night and it was super packed, but I was craving Ramen and in a new city so I decided to wait it out. The service was good, but the extra charges confused me, I ordered the Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen (something to that extent) but then was told that it would be extra to make it spicy. My waitress explained that there are two different types of spices, but if the dish is labeled spicy I would expect it to be spicy. The other thing that I would note is that the option to decide the thickness of the noodle was not presented so when I received my dish I was left with what seamed like an extra thick noodle. That made the Ramen less enjoyable.
