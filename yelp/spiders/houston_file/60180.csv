Baby Barnaby's////If you judge this place from the outside you would not think it was anything special. Boy oh boy this is a Houston gem! I have had breakfast ar Baby Barnaby's several time and the green eggs never fail me. The potatoes (or home fries) are crispy and seasoned to perfection. The other GREAT thing they do is the fresh squeezed OJ. It has so many great health benefits. I would highly recommend this as your breakfast/brunch place! The prices for what you get on the plate are extremely inexpensive.My only recommendation to Barnaby's is get some champagne to pair with that OJ!
