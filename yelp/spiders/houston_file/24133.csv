Uchi////Uchi is my happy place. I've not had a bad meal at Uchi and I've been its loyal customer for years. We love their Sake Social (HH), available DAILY from 5pm-6:30pm. The HH menu varies from time to time; our favorites include Â Spicy Crunchy Tuna, Machi Cure, and Nasu Nigiri. Sake, both hot and cold, are only $3, talk about drink to your hearts content! There are a few items from the regular menu that are MUST ORDER. One of them being the Ham & Egg roll although I really wished they didn't change the recipe; sauce was less mustardy before. And of course who can forget Fried Milk! Can you believe a dessert so exquisite and delicious is only $9.50??! Warm cold, crunchy soft, sweet savory, all in one dish. Really, it can't get better than this.
