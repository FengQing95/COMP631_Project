Kata Robata////Its last time i l visit since they have very bad service. I went there with my husbands. I ordered sushi rolls, sashimi and a omasake. Sushi just was okay but nothing especial with it. Sashimi was good but omasake were nothing but terrible. The food came out late and cold. We asked after all these exprience for the manager all they offered was to warm up our food. Nothing else offered.
