Uchi////Did it live up to the hype? Kinda. The food is fantastic, and the price reflects it. Expected a little more from the ambiance but it was more casual than expected. Having been to Kata and Tobiuo and other high end sushi joints; this is definitely up there with them and probably beats them out in some aspects. Overall, a good date night place for those wanting to try non fusion Japanese cuisine. Maybe see when their happy hour is?
