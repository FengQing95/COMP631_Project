Baby Barnaby's////The service was hilarious - we could tell our waiter would've rather been somewhere else, but he was gracious and exceptionally agreeable and that made me giggle since he, like me, wasn't all that able to hide his true feelings. This is not a complaint at all. Everything came out quickly and was delicious. I had to form a barrier around my perfectly cooked breakfast potatoes to ensure my husband didn't eat them all before I had a chance to enjoy them.
