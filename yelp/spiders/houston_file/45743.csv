Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Don't be surprised that the line is out the door and there are no tables (not even the bar seat) left, so get there early to be safe if you're meeting a friend and plan to dine in. It is really tempting to buy all the delicious looking baked goods as you make your way down the line to the register and pay. Since it is hard to find a table to stay and enjoy the goods, I took mine to go and will have to grab brunch there next time as a reattempt.
