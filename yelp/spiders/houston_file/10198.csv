JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Probably the best Ramen place I have been to.  Atmosphere is lively (although it can get pretty loud at times to where you can't hear the person next to you) and the taste of the ramen and food they have is just amazing.  The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars is because this place is usually a hit anda miss when it comes to servers.  Sometimes when I come it, the service is amazing, and other times I come in, you'll be waiting for your server to take your order 20 min later or be waiting for your check for about 20min after they have taken up your dirty dishes.  There is never an in-between.
