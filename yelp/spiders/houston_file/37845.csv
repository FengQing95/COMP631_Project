Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I am sorry for the failed communication from our team. In all honesty we are not a sports bar and walk a very fine line with our guest as we do want to be causal but also don't want to be to casual . Sports attire as you can imagine can be really subjective and some ( not saying you ) can really go to extremes. Because of that and being fair to all , we do ask that no jerseys or athletic shorts be allowed in for our guest . We do showcase all the games however for your viewing pleasure .
