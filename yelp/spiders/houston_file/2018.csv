JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////In tersm of our food, I regret that you found our Brussels Sprouts Tempura to be lacking flavor, and that our JINYA bun was "nothing memorable." If you're ever unhappy with any of our dishes, please tell your server so he or she can offer you an alternate item or remove it from your bill.
