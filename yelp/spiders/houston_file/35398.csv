Local Foods////Dined in for lunch on a summer Wednesday afternoon and it was perfect, no longer need a mask if you're vaccinated :) .I think they maybe recently did some remodeling but the decor on the inside is very modern and comfortable. Sandwich size is always very generous and pairs great with the potato salad. Ordered at the counter and waited no longer than 15 mins for the food to be brought to us. Will probably be back soon!
