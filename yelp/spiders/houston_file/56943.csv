Kata Robata////The Kobe tacos during happy hour were great, they actually reminded me of a native Mexican dish with the way the authentic tortillas tasted. The service at this place is great as well and I would for sure see myself coming back to this spot. It was nice catching up with my friend here, however the sections for tables and setting can be a little tight so the conversations can clearly be heard with some of the tables being so close together with other diners.
