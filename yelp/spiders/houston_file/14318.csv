JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As for the ramen, I've tried a couple, and each one has been good in its own right. This is basically the only ramen place I think of now when I need to get a ramen fix. The ambience here is also stellar. They have your standard private booths & tables, but they also have a community table where you could be seated across from other ramen-lovers. It's not as awkward as you think and it's very hip.
