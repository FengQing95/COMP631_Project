The Pit Room////In this Texas girl's heart, there is only one place for barbecue, and that is the Barbecue capitol of the world, the holy grail, Lockhart, Texas. However, I may have found a rival for my barbecue affection. The Pit Room was everything I dream about in barbecue. Tender, juicy brisket featured the perfect amount of salt and pepper crust, a beautiful red smoke ring just below the crust and melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. The beef rib, ah the beef rib. A colossal pound plus of gorgeous beefy awesomeness was most definitely swoon-worthy. And then there was the sausage. On our visit, we tried the jalapeno cheddar and the venison and the consensus was both were delicious. The venison link was a little spicy and nicely garlicky, if a bit on the dry side. If I had to grade the meats, the sausage links would still receive a solid A, but the brisket and beef rib were both A++.
