Uchi////I went to uchi with my girlfriend for date night since there were so many great sushi reviews. We love sushi and have been to many restaurants around the US. There was no omakase so we created our own tasting menu. It was ok at best. The rice was underseasoned and the portions were quite small. The appetizers were beautifully presented but again were only ok. Restaurant was beautiful, ambiance was great, service was attentive, food was only ok. We were one of the first seatings and this was the first time a sushi restaurant didn't have o-toro! Disappointing. For this price point, it's got a ways to go comparatively to nobu, sushi zo, Sasabune or pabu.
