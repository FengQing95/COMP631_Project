JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Came on a Monday night and it was busy! Even an hour and a half close to closing. Sat at the bar. The bartender/server was super busy but attentive! She was wonderful! Food came out fairly quickly! Got the shrimp wonton ramen. Added some "hot sauce" and some "seasoning" but overall, really tasty! Had to take some to-go
