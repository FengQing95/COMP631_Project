Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'm writing this as we're sitting at Einstein Brothers because despite two attempts, they couldn't get a simple order right. We ordered the sausage and egg sandwich and specifically asked for it dry with a well cooked egg. As soon as it came out, we could tell the egg was very runny. I went back to the counter and they said they would make another one. Â Well the egg was fine, but it had what looked like the aioli on it. When I said something to the girl that brought it, her comment was that it wasn't aioli, it was mayonnaise! How it that dry? What moron decided that they would substitute Mayo for aioli. At this point we were so disgusted with it, that we just left. So I got to have my yogurt alone, while my partner got nothing.
