The Pit Room////This is an excellent barbeque joint in a good location. We ate the pork ribs (we had FOMO for the beef ribs later), brisket, and a beef link (instead of jalapeno cheddar). The sides were good, especially the uncommon grilled okra. For two of us, with wine and beer, we spent about $60. I expect I'll eat there again.
