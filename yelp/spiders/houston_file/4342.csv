JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jig - Thank you for the 5-star review. I am so happy you consider our ramen authentic and delicious, especially having tried the bona fide stuff in Japan. I always appreciate this type of review because it's the best indication that what we are doing is correct and the intricate formula that goes into every dish we serve is worth the time and energy. Thank you again, and we look forward to serving you again soon!
