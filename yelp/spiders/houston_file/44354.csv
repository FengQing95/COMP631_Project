Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////As for food, I got a roast beef sandwich and she got the fried cauliflower sandwich. Portion sizes were huge and the sandwiches were both tasty. While I enjoyed my meal, I'd have to say that the pastry was the star and I can't wait to come back and try some of the other delicious looking baked goods they have.
