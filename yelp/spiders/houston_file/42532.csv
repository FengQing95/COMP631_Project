Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Kudos to the interior designer! Loved the decor more than the lunch menu. Not much for a vegetarian like myself. Breakfast and sweets, on the other hand, look delish. I had the grilled cheese and it was very good...just wish there was more veggies to choose from.
