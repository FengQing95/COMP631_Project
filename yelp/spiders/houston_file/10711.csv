JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Karishma - Thank you very much for the stars. I'm very pleased to know you enjoyed our ramen and that you were seated expeditiously. Sometimes we have large parties that will arrive complete, but when it's time to walk to the table, they are suddenly incomplete -- it happens, we're not passing judgment, but our firm policy is that we can't seat incomplete parties.
