JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Leigh - Thank you for your great review. We definitely do get slammed during peak hours on Friday and Saturday nights, especially. But we try to keep the tables turning the best we can WITHOUT rushing anyone along. We appreciate your business, and we hope to serve you again soon.
