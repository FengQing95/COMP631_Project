Uchi////As a Texas Ex, I was both excited and saddened to hear Tyson Cole's Uchi was expanding to Houston. On the one hand, it's UCHI: not only a premier Japanese gastronomic experience, but also a top-notch service atmosphere. And now, for Houstonians, it's just 20 minutes instead of 2.5 hours away. On the other hand, eating at Uchi Austin just felt...special. It was something to look forward to, to salivate about, to want longingly. It was a mecca. Now, it's just...there.
