Kata Robata////Their menu changes constantly, but a few things that I highly recommend, if available: The uni shrimp pasta (yes, pasta at a Japanese restaurant, I promise you'll love it!), agadashi tofu, tuna tartare, New Zealand salmon, Longhorn roll. Oh, we recently tried the baked sea bass and when we bit into it, both considered it to be very bland. THEN we dug into the spinach/bacon/onion concoction UNDERNEATH the bass, which completely changed the flavor of the entire dish! I couldn't get over how much better it tasted!
