JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jhoana - Thank you for your review. And thank you for understanding our extended wait times during peak hours. Please understand that we deal with all manner of circumstances when seating our patrons -- it is not an exact science, and our hosts work extremely hard to make last-second changes on behalf of our guests. But you are correct, on the weekends, the wait times can reach upwards of and even more than two hours, depending on party size.
