Kata Robata////We next had two of their specialty rolls - the Longhorn roll and the Caribbean roll, and a California roll. The Caribbean was my favorite. It was delicious, but loosely wrapped so it kept falling apart when I picked it up with my chopsticks. The Longhorn roll was a tad too fishy tasting for me but my boyfriend managed to stomach it. And the Cali roll, well, it's hard to screw that up.
