Baby Barnaby's////Baby Barnaby's is my favorite place to get breakfast / brunch.  No matter what I order I make sure to get the potatoes as a side, which are always perfectly fried and crispy, never soft.  The Green Eggs is a winner, although I will note they are hella buttery and honestly I feel kinda sleepy / crappy afterwards each time I get em.  But I continue to order the Green Eggs because they're that good!  The biscuits are great too, and they have just the right amount of honey on them.  And finally....APPLE SAUSAGE FTW ALL DAY!!!!!
