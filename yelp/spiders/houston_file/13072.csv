JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////On a positive note, there's a parking garage around the corner that's for free, it seems to be busy at any hour but they do seat you fast. This probably the only ramen place I've been too where they took a good while to give you your ramen and the happy hour ends at 5pm...5pm. We work 8-5 so of course we missed it but no fret, go next door to the pizza place for good happy hour specials!
