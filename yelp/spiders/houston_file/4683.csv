JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Wow, I really like this place. This is rare coming from me because I tend to not go to over-rated trendy spots such as this. First time ever, and I even hit up Jinya two days in a row last month. I wasn't so excited about paying $10 or more for a bowl of ramen, but after seeing the portion, with so much care in the toppings arrangement, and the garlic deliciousness of my Cha Cha Cha bowl, the price is reasonable. The following day, I ordered the small Pork Chashu Rice Bowl. Gosh, it was delicious, good serving for only $5!! Both visits, I came for super late dinner - first visit was around midnight, second visit around 9pm - so there was no problem getting seated. Our wait service was excellent for both nights. Super friendly, took our orders at a timely manner, and checked up on us several times. Â Food also came out in less than 15 min. I am definitely coming back here. Great food, great service is what brings me back so see ya soon, Jinya!
