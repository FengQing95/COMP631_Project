Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////2/3 days we had Kevin as a waiter. He was quick and attentive. He even remembered our whole order the next day. The 3rd day we had Kayla who gave us the disclaimer that she was new. Had she not said that we wouldn't have known because she was better than a lot of "experienced" waiters I've had in the past. And I eat out 3-4 times a week. What tipped off this experience is that the manager came out to greet us on our 3rd visit and asked us how everything was. And then, BONUS, she gave us a coupon to return for a free cinnamon roll pancake. See you guys June 27
