Kata Robata////Next we had two house rolls ending the meal with a ramen bowl. I had, lobster the chef's special for the evening, a rich, creamy Â and scrumptious broth with chunks of lobster and ramen. My son had the oxtail ramen which was also amazing. Our server brought two bowls so that we could share. When in Houston this is a MUST!!
