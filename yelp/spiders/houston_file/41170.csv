Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Please, please make the rest of the experience as good as the food, and this place would be hands-down amazing! I will continue to go, but only when I have a small party (3 or less), on a weekday, and when I don't have a baby in tow. Limits the number of times I will come.
