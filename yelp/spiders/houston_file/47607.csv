Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////2. Bella Bella Eggs Benedict - Great selection of eggs benedicts, but my favorite by FAR is the Bella Bella! I'm not even a fan of prosciutto, but it works so so well and easily makes it the best eggs benedict on their menu. Of course try them all like I have, but get at least one of these so you'll know what I'm talking about.
