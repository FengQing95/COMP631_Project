Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The decor was bright and cheery, as were the staff. Everyone was friendly and helpful. This business supports charities and works hard to be green and sustainable. The only down side is that parking is somewhat limited and it gets really loud, but if you are looking for a fun place to have breakfast, Snooze is perfect. It is great to have another wonderful breakfast option in Houston!
