The Pit Room////In nearly every other city, it would senseless to rate 'The Pit Room' with anything less than a five star rating. The number of exceptional BBQ joints, however, within a 2 mile radius of The Pit Room on Richmond Avenue is overwhelming. The competition for good Texas BBQ is tough. Regardless, this is almost unquestionably a five star eatery. I truly enjoyed my first visit after trying a selection of meats including their brisket, smoked turkey, made-in-house beef & venison sausage and more. As good as expected with high expectations.
