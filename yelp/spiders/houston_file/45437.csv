Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////What makes matters worse is that parking isn't very friendly here. The lot is always jammed pack. You are better off parking a few blocks down the neighborhood and walking here. Even getting into the parking lot from Westhiemer is hard because of the opposing cars waiting for the light to turn green.
