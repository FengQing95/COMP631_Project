Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Great place to chill out! I liked the ambiance and the seating. I went around 4pm and there are not many pastries left. I tried their mocha along with some desserts - the raspberry pistachio macaroon was yummy; shortbread pudding was a disappointment, whereas the Kugelhopf was truly amazing! Will definitely visit another time. Their service was also noteworthy to mention.
