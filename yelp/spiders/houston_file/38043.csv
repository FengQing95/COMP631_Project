Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I came here for my best friends brunch and it was a great move. They have a live DJ and play great music. It was a party of 6 and we were seated in about 20 minutes or so. Our waiter was very helpful in choosing our meals. I got a mocktail pineapple elixir and the short rib chilaquiles. It was really good! It came out pretty quickly and filled me to the brim. Will definitely be back during dinner or lunch to try something new on the menu.
