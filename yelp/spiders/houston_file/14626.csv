JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The spicy chicken ramen was both rich and flavorful without being overwhelmingly fatty. It made me feel better about eating it yet it was insanely satisfying at the same time. I cleared my bowl out because 1) I don't waste food and 2) how am I supposed to sleep at night knowing I wasted a $11 bowl of ramen?
