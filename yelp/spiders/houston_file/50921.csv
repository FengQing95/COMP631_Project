Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I'll describe all the cons before the pros. First, I'd like to say that their parking lot is tiny so anticipate looking for street parking. Second, the waits are long so come ready to be hangry by the time you are seated. Third, they really need to add some kind of tint to their windows - the sunlight is particularly unforgiving if you get seated facing it.
