JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Very, very solid ramen place. The ramen is consistently good. I usually go for the tonkatsu white and I almost always get the fried brussel sprouts. Even my husband that hates brussel sprouts with a passion eats these and likes them!! Service is always good. This is my go-to ramen place.
