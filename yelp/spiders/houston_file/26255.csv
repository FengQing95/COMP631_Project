The Pit Room////My absolute favorite brisket!!! I love the Brisket tacos.  Always a super long line but always worth the wait.  I have been several times and it is a consistent product. The rest of the BBQ is extremely good though the sides are mehhh.   However, even with the meh sides the meats are so good I'll give them 5 stars.
