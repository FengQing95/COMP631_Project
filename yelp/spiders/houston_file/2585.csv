JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Lauren - Thanks for your review. We're never going to be all things to all people, but will continue to strive in our culinary niche. As far as price goes, the majority of goods and services you will find in Midtown will tend toward the pricier side, largely due to popularity of location and average rental prices. What our establishment, and surrounding estsablishments, must pay in terms of rent and basic services is remarkably higher than if you were to travel just five miles in any direction. For instance, my general manager who lives across the street pays $1,850 per month for a one-bedroom apartment.
