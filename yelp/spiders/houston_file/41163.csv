Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////As an architect, I find the layout awful to navigate and inefficient. I understand that it is a tight space, but the flow of customers doesn't make sense with the placement of the coffee bar and food counter - which are separate and stick out into the restaurant awkwardly. The location of water and utensils takes up valuable floor space, and the choices for how food is served also necessitates dedicating precious space to serving rather than seating. Finally, a word on the communal tables: don't do them. It's a nice idea, but it doesn't work in reality. No, I don't want to eat my lunch with strangers. No, I don't want to have them listen to my conversations. The idea is larger parties can utilize them (which is a very rare occurrence), and that you can fit more people in by eliminating gaps between individual tables (not in reality, since everyone leaves a seat empty between parties). Get rid of the big communal table and replace with individual 2-tops. Reposition the coffee bar/counter service to eliminate the awkward U-shaped corridor to nowhere. Serve drinks at the checkout counter instead of a self-serve bar and replace the water bar with seating. Get rid of the random 'extra chairs' that line the few free corners so that people with bags or babies have somewhere to park a stroller or put their to-go bags. So many things could be improved here.
