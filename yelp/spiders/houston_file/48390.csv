Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came to your restaurant this morning at approximately 6:55 am on 10/23/19. I placed a take out order for an omelet with no toast or potato's and a side of sausage. I told the hostess that I would sit at the round table immediately by the front door. I sat down and read my book waiting on my order. At 7:25 I went back to the front desk just a few feet away and asked about my order. Now a different young woman was at the desk and said "Here it is on the shelf" next to the front.
