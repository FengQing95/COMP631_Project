Baby Barnaby's////We went for breakfast and I had the green eggs which was delicious.  Hubby had French toast and it was also a solid yes.  This location has a funkier Montrose vibe that I like and is not as whitewashed as the other locations.  They have freshly squeezed oj machine...awesome. I don't get to go often because of location and also because really you have to go early for parking.
