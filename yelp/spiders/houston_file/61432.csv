Baby Barnaby's////Here we are on MLK Day. I arrived at 12:10 and was refused service because lunch apparently stopped at 12. The host was still calling people to be seated and seating them. One man even said 'we have decided to go elsewhere' when his name was called, the host very well could have seated us in that parties place but he continued to be very rude and dismissive. I have come from out of town especially to have breakfast at Barnaby's because of the rave reviews. Never will I ever suggest this place simply because of the awful management. I mean c'mon how rude can one be especially a holiday? And I'm sitting here at 12:38 and people are STILL being seating. I'll let you be the judge but I highly suggest not coming to this specific location.
