Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I was trying to be good and only order an espresso drink here. But, the person taking my order asked me if it was my first time here. And I said yes. Boom! He brings out some delicious looking and huge croissants with a crispy caramelized sugar glaze around them. He states that I can have a "sample" and gives me one whole croissant. Whoa! Now, that's just beyond generous of him and CBB. How can I say no to this?! Safe to say, the croissant was buttery goodness. Of course, I couldn't finish it myself! I also ordered their Cortado, which was strong and fragrant. I would recommend ordering this, since it went great with the croissant.
