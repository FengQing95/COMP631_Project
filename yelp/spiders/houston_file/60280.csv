Baby Barnaby's////Now the the food at Baby Barnaby's is pretty good and this one experience will not diminish the memory of probably 30 good experiences I had dining at Barnabys over the years, but we all left Baby Barnaby's a little appalled with the melodramatic and rude antics of a hostess (ahem)..server who was far less than accommodating.
