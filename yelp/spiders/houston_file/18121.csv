Uchi////We went there few months ago. Thinking this place is awesome, but turned out to be Sucked!!!! Fatty tuna sashimi wasn't fresh is been in the freezer for along time. Food were ok not that great. I been tried so many time to reserved for dinner but they alway said is all booked lol...by the time we got there. The place wasn't busy and still have plenty of tables. The reason I gave 2 star just because I liked their deserts. (fried milk)
