Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////As expected the wait was pretty long but not too bad (about 30 minutes). Free coffee while you wait! Once we were seated we didn't get waited on for another 15 minutes or so. I got an egg white scramble which was a bit lacking on flavor. The hash browns were pretty good but I would've preferred them a bit more crispy. Overall a decent brunch with a hip atmosphere.
