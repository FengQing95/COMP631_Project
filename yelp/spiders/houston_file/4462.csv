JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We are in the mission of searching of best ramen in H town and we found it!! Jinya finally didn't fail me. We ordered spicy tonkatsu and spicy miso ramen. The broth was flavorful, thick and well seasoned. The noddles were cooked perfectly and their pork chashu were tender and not too much fat like you get in other ramen joints. Gyoza was just meh and the gyoza skin was not crispy.
