Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Cool little spot in Houston. I ordered the Snooze classic with the Chorizo sausage and a side of pineapple upside down pancake. It was delicious! I also ordered the spicy Bloody Mary, which was tasty as well. Wait is long, but definitely worth it. If you check in, they take your phone number and will text you wen your table is ready. We ended up driving down the street to some vintage shops and killing some time before they texted. Win win for us.
