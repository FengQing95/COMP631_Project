JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Best ramen I've had by far!  Even on a busy Saturday evening, the service was wonderful and the quality of food never suffers.  Both times I've been there, I've had an attentive and efficient server and the ramen has been out of this world.  Parking is on the street but I've never had a problem finding parking, furthest I've parked on a busy night was two blocks away.
