JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Lillie - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry you had a bad experience with our server Cindy. Are you able to expound in further detail on how "customer service is not personable"? Cindy has been with us for quite some time and has never received such a negative review. Additional details (feel free to send me a PM) would serve her and all of our waitstaff greatly as we are always seeking constructive feedback to correct bad habits and fix errors. That said, our front of house do often find themselves in a high-stress environment when the restaurant is full and there is a long wait time for seating. Please know that I am not in the business of making excuses, but in the restaurant industry we are all prone to an "off night." It is my job and my managers' jobs to find the root causes of these "off nights" and make corrections.
