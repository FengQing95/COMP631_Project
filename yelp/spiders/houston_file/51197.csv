Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze has a large menu of breakfast dishes and the service was awesome. My waiter was friendly and took care of me throughout the meal. While there were many appetizing dishes on the menu, I went with the pancake flight because I'm all about that variety. The pancake flight allows you to pick any three pancakes off of the menu. Better yet, you can also include French toast even though French toast isn't a type of pancake. Breaking the rules, I love it!
