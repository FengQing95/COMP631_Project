Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Thank god they have a dedicated parking lot though the street parking on the other side of Westheimer isn't so bad if they are busy (which they usually are). Since my work is typically remote in on my own time finding new surroundings to work in are pretty important to me. Eat and work at the same time. Some would call that a dream situation.
