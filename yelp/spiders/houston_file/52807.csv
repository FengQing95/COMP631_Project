Kata Robata////What a great experience. We started with the Kobe skewers and the grilled squid. The Kobe was so tender, with a wonderful rich taste and the squid was delicate with a hint of the grill. A very nice match up. For the next round we had the Caribbean roll with 6 piece sushi chefs choice. The roll was as wonderful as everyone was has said, but the Chef took it over the top with the sushi. Those 6 little pieces of heaven made the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. I could not believe the flavor in each piece of sushi.
