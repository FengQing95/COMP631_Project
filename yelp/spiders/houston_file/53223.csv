Kata Robata////Food: miso soup was average, it had no mushrooms :( smoke duck salad was good, dressing good, but duck was not tender enough to my standards. Scallops dish was good. the soft shell crab had to much batter for my liking. a lil too heavy. i could pull pieces of batter off the soft shell thats how thick it was. carribean roll was good, but had too much sauce so it made the roll soggy. the most flavorful dish i had was the uni-crab spoons, but it was very little. 3 bites. for dessert, we had the banana tempura. it was average. the pieces were too small and soggy because of Â too much chocolate syrup. mochi icre cream was good, i like the strawberry and banana, but not the greean tea.
