Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Went there on a Friday around 11:30 AM and there was a 45-min wait, so we put our names down and came back when they called us since we didn't want to wait awkwardly in that standing area they have near the bar. Got seated at a booth near a screaming baby. The service was nice. The food was incredible. We had the pancake flight (which my husband thought was amazing) the eggs benedict duo (ham III and chilaquiles), and the pot pie. Everything was delicious. Also got two cocktails. One was supposed to have fresh basil in it and did not come with any at all. Both were unmemorable, unbubbly (even though they were both bubblies), and disappointing. We won't order cocktails here anymore but will definitely come back for the breakfast!
