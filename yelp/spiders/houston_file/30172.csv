The Pit Room////The gang of five wanted to find some great 'Q and boy does this place fit that description!  The brisket was tender and flavorful, the beef sausage was on point, pork ribs had us looking for more, the frito pie didn't survive the encounter wit' us, a couple tacos bit the dust, the pinto beans ended up on a few plates, cole slaw equaled everything else's 5 star rating.  A few beers and a glass of wine topped off this meat fest.  We'll be back.
