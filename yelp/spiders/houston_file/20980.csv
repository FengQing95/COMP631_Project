Uchi////Probably the best sushi in town.  I love this place.  While I am a fan of Uptown Sushi, Roka Akor and others this place is by far the best.  It is far superior to MF sushi and a true experience.  I highly recommend that you have your waiter bring specific delights to your table based on the things you like while staying away from what you don't.  We go on a regular basis and each time the food amazes.  The o'otoro Nigri and any other tuna, snapper or yellow tail nigiri is amazing.  The Brussels sprouts cannot be beaten and their mushrooms over rice are just a few items that I adore.  Their rolls are perfection, one that has a miso glaze as a dipping side is my favorite.  Do not go here and ask for soy or spicy mayo, all food is dressed and done so to perfection.  Such an amazing experience.
