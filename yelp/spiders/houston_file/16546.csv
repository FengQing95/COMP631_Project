JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Cannot say the same about our waiter, he was absolutely horrible, we saw him three times, initially to bring water, get our drink order and finally to take our order. He was never ever seen again! We had to stop random waiters to get help for certain things and to get our check at the end.
