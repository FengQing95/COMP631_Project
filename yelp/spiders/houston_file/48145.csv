Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Top brunch spot of my life. the chilquiles eggs Benedict if my favorite brunch dish of all time. I've had Snooze in 4 locations now - San Diego, Denver, austin, and Houston and gotten the SAME thing every single time and they've maintained the same high level of consistency at every location. I was so scared when Snooze decided to expand to Texas that it wouldn't live up to the hype but it's delivered and then some. Now back to the food, the eggs Benedict is constructed perfectly - the perfect poached egg, tender and flavorful Barbacoa, and awesome hollandaise sauce lathered all over it. I just have to throw some Cholula hot sauce on it and I'm ready to savor every bite. The pancakes are amazing as well, I appreciate the seasonal flavors and the option for the indecisive orderers (like me) to get the Pancake Trio which lets you try 3 different awesome sounding flavors. The blueberry cream cheese one is my personal favorite but you really can't go wrong with any of them, the pancakes themselves are super fluffy and well made.
