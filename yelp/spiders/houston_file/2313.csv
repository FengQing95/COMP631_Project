JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It's a very large portion of food and the price is so cheap. It's definitely a little challenging finishing it all. They are very accommodating with making exceptions like switching out the noodle type, the spice level, adding or leaving out some ingredients which is very much appreciated.
