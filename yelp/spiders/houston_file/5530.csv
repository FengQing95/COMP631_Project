JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Nam - Thank you for your review. We do offer a few lighter broths, such as our Old School Ramen or our Slurp Up Cilantro ramen. But as far as our staple ramen goes, we specialize in a rich, hearty tonkotsu broth, while our chicken broth is also fairly stout. We'll never be all things to all people, but we do have an array of offerings for (almost) every palate. Thanks for your feedback.
