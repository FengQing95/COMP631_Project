Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I wanted to love this place, I really did. But, I am not a sheep and not going with the masses. The food is absolutely 5 stars - no doubt! The manager, Leah did rectify the problems we had and was EXTREMELY acomodating (love her), But here is my review, take it or leave it.
