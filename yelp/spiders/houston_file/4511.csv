JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Angel - Thanks for the 5-star review! I'm also glad to know our extended-wait times during peak hours didn't dissuade your decision to try us out. That said, we greatly appreciate your kind words, and your even greater assessment of our ramen as "the best place you've been to around Texas" ! That means a great deal to us, so on behalf of our entire staff, thank you again and we hope to serve you again in the near future.
