Uchi////This place is everything I heard it would be. By far the best sushi I've had! Everything we had was amazingly good...From the sake (and the history lesson we got on "masu" boxes) to the dessert. The brussel sprouts were crunchy on the outside and tender in the middle, tossed in a yummy savory sauce. We also had the "zero sen" yellowfin...OMG...melt in your mouth delicious. For you vegetarians I also tried the "chefs vegetarian" roll...nice spicy kick. Also had the "biendo" tempura shrimp roll which was also very good. Fried milk for dessert, perfect ending to a great meal. Will definitely be back!!
