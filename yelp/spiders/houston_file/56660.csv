Kata Robata////Service was on point. Our server was Steven, he came back to our table often to ask how we were doing. The food came by pretty fast, and was cleared away equally as swift as soon as we emptied it (and we ate like we hadn't eaten in a week). I really appreciated how he also gave me a complimentary cake, which was delicious.
