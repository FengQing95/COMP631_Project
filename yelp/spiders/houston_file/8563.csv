JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Before getting into Jinya, there's a parking lot around the corner and it's free. It wasn't even that packed either. Already, I was starting to like this place. The atmosphere is pretty loud, especially in the evenings. I usually go around 9-11pm. It's also quite dark and cell phone reception isn't great.
