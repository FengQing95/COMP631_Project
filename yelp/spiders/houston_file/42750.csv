Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////There's not much to say about the flat white coffee because it was perfection. The presentation was, oh gosh, beautiful. Not to mention, the cheesecake and the coffee went in harmony with each other! The bitterness of the coffee counteracted with the slight sweetness of the cheesecake, so neither flavors stayed on my tongue.
