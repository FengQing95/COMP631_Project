JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Now on to the actual ramen. I got the cha cha cha with nori ($1extra). The broth is warm soothing and flavorful with the noodles are toothsome and delicious. I love soup like this. It is definitely comfort food in Japanese soup form. Like I don't know how else to describe it other than a warm hug you didn't know you needed. The pork in the dish had a layer of fat on it that usually turns me off like know other. But it seems that japan has found a way to make fat just immediately melt in your mouth. I asked them to make it has hot as they could and I couldn't feel the burn (Bernie 2016).
