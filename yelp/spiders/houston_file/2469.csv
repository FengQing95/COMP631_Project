JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////If you are a fan of great food and ramen, JINYA is a win-win! When the hostess escorts you into the dining area, she shouts a greeting to the diners and they return in kind. Very nice touch. But the ramen... nice & brothy, loads of veggies, bursting with delicious flavor! We had the shrimp appetizer (OMG!!!) and the pork dumplings. Both were amazingly good but I love shrimp and boy did they get it right! I'll definitely be back!
