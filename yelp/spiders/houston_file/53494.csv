Kata Robata////In an upscale Japanese restaurant like Kata Robata, excellent sushi is to be expected. But fish and chips? Indeed, this eastern take on the traditional British favorite is what called to me like a Siren song. It's on the expensive side at $22, perhaps because they're using flounder instead of the normal cod, but it's worth the price. The flounder has shuffled off its mortal coil, its skin fried into a tureen, in which its flaky white meat is served in bite-size fried pieces. The fish was fantastic, and with a cold Sapporo instead of a Boddington's, maybe a dash of ponzu instead of vinegar, this occidental dish translated perfectly into oriental flavors. The "chips" weren't all that exciting, though its tough for a simple fried potato to stand up to all those other flavors, except when used as a dipping instrument for those sauces.
