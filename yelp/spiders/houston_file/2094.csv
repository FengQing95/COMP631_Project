JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I visited here a few months ago with my boyfriend and we had a good time. We did the community seating, as the separate seating was going to come with a long wait. Our waitress was very friendly and nice. They do shout out something every time someone new comes in, and at first I didn't know what they were doing, but after a while, I figured it out. The ramen was awesome, and the atmosphere was nice and cozy. I will definitely be coming back!
