Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is my second time coming here and each time it has been extremely busy --- for good reason.  It's delicious!  They have a huge array of different pastries that are staring at you from behind glass counters.  We got a pistachio raspberry tart, chocolate croissant, cinnamon roll type thing, and a couple of macaroons and split them all.  My personal favorite was the pistachio tart.  Never had anything like that and it literally melted in my mouth.  Great ambience and delicious pastries.  Coffee drinks and lemonade looked good, however did not get the opportunity to try them.  Can't wait to try their brunch items.  Cons:  parking and a little on the pricier side.
