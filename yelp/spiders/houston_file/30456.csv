The Pit Room////Honestly I was unimpressed with this place. I got the 2 meat plate and added a 1/4 pound of pulled pork in the side. My 2 meats for the entree were ribs and sliced brisket. They even put a feed burnt ends on the plate and those even lacked flavor. The pulled pork was moist and somewhat good. What was good though was the okra, I'm NOT and okra fan at all but I enjoyed it the most. What was good though was the okra, I'm NOT and okra fan at all but I enjoyed it the most.
