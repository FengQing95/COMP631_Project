Kata Robata////Food:  Kata Robata is part of the Soma, Azuma, and Izakaya Wa Japanese restaurant family; (price wise in that order too!) Each has its slight differences, and Kata Robata is more Japanese-Euro fusion.  They have the usual sushi fare here, but not standard sushi rolls;  if you plan to eat just sushi and rolls go to Azuma their other location for typical  sushi and rolls.    The food and presentation here are fusion, haute cuisine.  There are many interesting dishes that you want to try everything!  They are artfully plated in teeny tiny portions.  One literally inhales the food here, appreciates the food art presentation, and easily spends $100 per person and still feels hungry! If you  are extra hungry, whet your appetite with a bowl of oxtail ramen first, so that you can slowly savor the other teeny tiny food creations later.  Thus, I can only come when I am willing to wait to get a table, feeling posh and want to eat creative, top-notch food.  They do have happy hour, but there is always a long wait, and I am never able to make it early enough.
