JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Cody - Thank you very much for your review. I'm very pleased to know you're a regular customer, and that you have good, fast service at the bar. In our defense, I will say that I have seen a great many couples who dine at our restaurant, as they can be mostly identified by their holding each others' hands across the table as their ramen bowls are brought by their servers. ;-)
