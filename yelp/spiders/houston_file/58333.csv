Baby Barnaby's////I give the food 5 stars but the service from the two young waitresses we had one time was UNACCEPTABLE!!! I frequent here MORE than often, sometimes twice in a week. I always bring a friend because I love the food. A few months ago the waitress was beyond rude to me and my friend and to make matters worse when we asked for the manager the other young lady who is a waitress as well and has also served me in the past, she came over acting as the manager and had a very rude attitude. We didn't want to pull the racist card but I NEVER experienced that here and I was very shocked! I went on strike from here for a couple of months and I returned recently with my boyfriend. We had a guy server, one who I had in the past as well and he was GREAT! The food of course was amazing as usual but most importantly , we got treated with respect and felt like our (well my boyfriend cause he always pays) money mattered! ;) I recommend the green eggs, the pancakes and the freshly squeezed OJ!
