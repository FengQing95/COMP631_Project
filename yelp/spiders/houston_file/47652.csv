Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Once we were seated, our waiter attended to us instantly. I got a caprese eggs benedict with my best friend (she got a different type of eggs benedict in the same platter, which is great for people who want different things but not huge portions of each thing), and split the pancake flight with her (3 pancakes on one platter). We got the baklava, choc chip, and peach cobbler pancakes. All were phenomenal, but I gravitated toward the baklava because I enjoyed the combo of pistachios and whipped cream on my pancake. My best friend's mom asked the waiter to surprise her with a dish and specifically requested not to get meat. What did she get? Meat. Our waiter was pretty out of it and wasn't super focused on our order. I could tell he was super distracted; maybe he was tired? I don't know, but it does suck to get something you didn't want. But my friend's mom was a good sport and didn't request for a change.
