Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Desserts and bakery items I feel can be hit or miss. Sometimes I really enjoy them and other times I think meh....someplace else has better. Brunch is kind of the same too, though I do appreciate that they even have it at all because the location is pretty convenient in Montrose.
