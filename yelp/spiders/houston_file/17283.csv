Uchi////This place is truly outstanding!  We have been here countless times (including the two Austin locations) and the overall experience is always top notch.  First, the food...simply incredible!  This is  not your ordinary sushi restaurant, every drop and garnish on each plate has a reason to be there and completes each and every dish perfectly. Standouts include but are not limited to....the jar jar duck (a perfect well thought out jar of deliciousness that smokes when you open the jar), uchiviche, walu walu, nasu (best eggplant you will have), king trumpet mushrooms (there is a fancy Japanese name, but I can never remember it), and gytoro (one bite of melt in your mouth beef).  Also, try any of the specials that your well-educated server recommends.  This brings me to the service which is always impeccable.  Jeremy and Katelyn (who introduced herself as our sidekick for the day-so true) are especially outstanding. My best advice is to make a reservation (or get there early and snag a seat at the bar) and go during happy hour and enjoy the sake social specials while you can and sprinkle with some of the specials and off the happy hour offerings.  Yes, Uchi can be expensive, but if it is totally worth it and going during happy hour makes it much less harsh on your wallet.  Thank you Uchi for the consistently outstanding experience you provide each time we come!
