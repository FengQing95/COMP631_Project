JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been coming here regularly for almost 2 years now, and absolutely love their food. The ramen is amazing, the rice bowls are awesome and the desserts are great too, however, if you're coming on a Friday or Saturday evening, be prepared to wait for around 35 minutes as it gets very busy. I would also try to avoid drinking the water, as it tastes like it came from a fishbowl, but I won't demote a star, because that's just how good the food is
