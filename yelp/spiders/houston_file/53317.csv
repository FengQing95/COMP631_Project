Kata Robata////Atmosphere: casual decor but upscale vibe.  Always a crowded mix of foodies, River Oak old money, West U yuppies, business and first dates, etc., but do come if you are padded or feel like you can spurge.  It's quite pricey indeed. Good place to impress your date, but not quiet enough for business or serious discussion,  because the tables are seated very close that you can hear next table's conversation.
