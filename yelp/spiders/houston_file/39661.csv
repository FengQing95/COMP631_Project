Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came here for a quick meet up with a vendor business lunch. We had an amazing service from the moment we walked in, everyone was very attentive from the beginning to end. Get the Brussels spots that was my favorite thing ever omygooood to die for! Their special ketchup is so GOOD for the fries! Yummm!
