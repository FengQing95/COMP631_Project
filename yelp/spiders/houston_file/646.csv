JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Fumi - Thanks for your review. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay with us. Please know you can always send back your ramen for whatever reason. Our motto is "If it's not great, REMAKE." That said, you can always request your server that your ramen be made "Hot Temperature." We have conducted tests of our ramen and have found that the approximate temperature of our broth once ladled from the stockpot is approximately 200 degrees Fahrenheit.
