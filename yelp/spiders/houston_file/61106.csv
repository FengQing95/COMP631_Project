Baby Barnaby's////La Chica ordered from left field with the chicken fried steak.  Didn't see that coming.  Totally not in her wheelhouse.  The friend who dragged us down to the restaurant ordered Huevos Rancheros with egg whites.  Well, actually, he didn't order because the waiter already knew what he was having.  Love places like that.
