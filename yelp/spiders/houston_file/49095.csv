Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The waitress was nice. We had to send our food back twice, then determined the entire meal needed to be redone. Ordered the Cuban sandwich, egg was suppose to be sunny side up instead I got uncooked raw egg white and yolk. The French toast was wet and not cooked through. Waited an hour to be seated then another 1.5 hours for our food to actually be Cooked and correct. As a visitor to Houston going to Snooze based on reviews I will not be back.
