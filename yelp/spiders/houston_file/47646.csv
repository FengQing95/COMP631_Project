Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Love this place! I have been here probably 10 times and the they only screwed up my food once. The Benedict's are always great! Make sure go knowing that you will probably wait for an hour to an hour and a half. You can put your name on the list and they will text you so oh can leave and run an errand before. They do not answer the phone or take reservations.
