Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I been meaning to try Snooze since I missed my chance at the San Diego location . This restaurant lives up to its reputation, the wait is indicative of that. I got the pancake flight and the sweet potato pancakes with the candied pecans are favorite. The value for money is certainly there, great food with plenty to enjoy on each plate. Definitely a place to make a staple for breakfast or brunch.
