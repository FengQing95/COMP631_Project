JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm sorry to hear your experience at Jinya Ramen Bar did not meet your expectations.  Yes, our seating style isn't set up for big groups mainly because we only have 2000 sq. ft of space for the dining area.  That's why corporate headquarters put in 2 large communal tables just in case big parties come in.  The Cha Cha Cha you ordered is by far our thickest and richest broth.  It leans toward the traditional ramen you get in Japan.  That's is also our most expensive ramen.  I would suggest you get something a little lighter next time you visit.  Try the Tonkotsu White or maybe the Tonkotsu Assari.  Both have more veggies and a much lighter broth.  As with most guests that try Jinya for the first time, it will take a couple tries to find the ramen that best suit your palate.  However, should you ever feel you are not satisfied with what you ordered, please feel free to send it back and we will be glad to make you something else to your liking.
