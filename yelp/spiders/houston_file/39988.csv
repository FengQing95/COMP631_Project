Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I was in town for a few days and after looking at couple bars I decided to try this place. The host was a little rude but our server was fantastic. I think his name is Sam, he gave us a tour of the whisky room which is fenomenal specially for a business meeting. Totally recommend this place!
