Uchi////FOOD: 2.5 stars. The hamachi sashimi was excellent as was the cooked escolar dish. But beyond that, everything was pretty so-so...and in some cases extremely oversalted. I love brussels sprouts and had high expectations for theirs given the reviews. But after two bites, the excessively salty, somewhat sickishly sweet sauce was a real turn off. Japanese food is known for its finesse and subtlety and very flavorful as a result. Uchi may not be fully declared as Japanese food, but they need to work on subtlety with some dishes. The worst Â food experience of the evening came near the end of our meal when we ordered a $24 daily special that was advertised as uni with king crab and shaved truffle. When the dish was served, it looked like a risotto (no mention of rice in the menu description). There was no discernible uni in the dish and only flecks of snow crab. The waiter told us the uni was blended into the rice. The dish was again...salty...and unenjoyable. When asked how our food was, I expressed my disappointment with the final dish (for $24 it was really sad)...and the waitress comp'd a dessert, which were both good (fried milk and peanut butter freddo). But like other dishes, after about 5 bites, both my husband and I tired of the sweetness. Apparently, they sometimes have yuzu sorbet, and I would love to see how they prepare that...as I love yuzu.
