Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The decor inside is really cool, but you almost can't appreciate it with how it's always packed with so many bodies.  The interior configuration of the place was a little stressful for me because it felt like things were always getting in the way of other things.  There is only one way to enter/exit and how you have to barge through all the people in line to exit.  Luckily for us, we showed up for brunch at 9:30, before the crowds hit.
