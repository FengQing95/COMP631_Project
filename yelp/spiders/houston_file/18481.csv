Uchi////This is my favorite restaurant in all of Houston.  Get a reservation or get there before they open and wait in line and you'll get in.  It's amazing.  Everything is fantastic.  Service is great, a bit of a team effort.  They have more than just raw fish.  If you appreciate good upscale food, you will love it here.
