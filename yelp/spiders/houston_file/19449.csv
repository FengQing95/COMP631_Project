Uchi////The best Sushi I have had. I don't like raw sushi, but this is the first place that I really enjoyed my raw sushi. It didn't taste fishy at all. The service is superior, but the wait is definitely long without reservation. I love the Unagi and deserts. It's a must have every time I go there, especially fried milk. My favorite sushi place so far. :-).
