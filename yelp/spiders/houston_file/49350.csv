Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Four stars just based on the creative thinking behind the drinks. Order the Pineapple juice Mimosa. Bring your appetite. But definitely bring a friend so they can order "that other dish." You know, that one you can't decide if you should get. THAT'S what friends are for. So make them order the French toast. Mostly because you have to try it but you if you're like me you don't want all of those pesky calories. Order the Chilaquiles Benedict. Your welcome.
