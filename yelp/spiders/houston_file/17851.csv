Uchi////Try the Uchiviche, Machi cure, Avocado sushi, Nasu and the cauliflower tempura or anything on the menu and be amazed. The deserts, which I usually never order at other restaurants, are incredible so save room. I recently ate at Jiro's in Tokyo and it was really great, but I would rather have a meal at Uchi, that's what I think about this restaurant. The Austin location, the original is also totally amazing! I have been in Asia traveling for the last two months and can't wait to eat and see the folks at Uchi tonight.
