Baby Barnaby's////Amazing green eggs and ham.  The wait was kind of atrocious but worth it.  The restaurant was adorable, I felt like I was in a hut.  This is not healthy food by my standards but highly satisfying after a late night of drinking.  Go on the early side of brunch if you do and bring a newspaper or a book.  They provide coffee/water while you wait.
