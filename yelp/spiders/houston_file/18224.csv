Uchi////Since I was a small child, I have always hated Brussels sprouts... until I came here. Seriously they are AMAZING. On top of that, an entire bowl only cost $6! I haven't seen vegetables cooked better since my trip to Vietnam. There fish here is great too. I highly recommend the Â hot fish that comes in a bowl (sorry for the vagueness, I just let the waiter pick the dishes). Everything I had was good, so I definitely recommend trying this place out.
