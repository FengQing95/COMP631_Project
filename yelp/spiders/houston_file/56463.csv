Kata Robata////Uni Chawanmushi - It tasted particular, to say the least. I liked the fluffiness of the egg custard. It did have some overpowering fishy smell to it but it's understandable cause they made it with real japanese uni, another reason they spiked up the price of $9 to $12 or so. But I didn't like the fact that they didn't tell us of the price change until after we got our checks and I asked about it.
