Uchi////We ordered just about everything on the happy hour menu as well as some select nigiri pieces. As each dish came out my girlfriend and I took turns shining our phone light on the dish so we can take a glamour shot for the food. The manager noticed our efforts and thanked us with a gift card for helping showcase their delicious items.
