The Pit Room////First things first... while that beef rib could be easily pulled off the bone and was super tender, I have to say that I did enjoy the brisket more so than the beef rib. But you can't take away from the bad ass points you get when you're walking back to find somewhere to sit and everyone in line looks over and points at the giant beef rib on your tray. Swagger points unlocked. Not to take anything away from the beef rib but brisket is definitely more of my preference and we still ended up finishing both meats!
