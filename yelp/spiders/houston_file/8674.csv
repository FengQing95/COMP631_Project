JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My husband and I decided to check out this place since we've been craving for some authentic Ramen noodles. Well, midtown parking sucks. We drove around several times to find a spot, and ended up parked in the High fashion parking lot across the street hoping they don't cause us any trouble.
