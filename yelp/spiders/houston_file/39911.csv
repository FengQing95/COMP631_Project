Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Boss Cat has been on my radar for quite some time now.The overall theme is a whiskey lounge including a beautifully decorated whiskey room. The fruity pebble french toast is what caught my attention. The ambience is amazing! Its very clean and cozy and the lighting was perfect for photos.  I ordered the fruity pebble french toast of course and I also ordered the the chicken fried steak. The french toast was delicious and I especially liked the interesting taste of the chicken fried steak. I can't really describe it however it was light  and crispy, topped with a really rich dark gravy. My friend didn't like it but I almost finished the whole thing and it was huge! I will  definitely be returning!
