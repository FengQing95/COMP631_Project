Kata Robata////For starter, we ordered a papaya and pork belly salad. It was so good and light. We also ordered fresh oysters which was good. The dish was only two pieces though so I was quite sad after my slurp. Our other dishes include sushi roll and chef's assorted sashimi. The sashimi selection was amazing and each sashimi was thick enough in cut.
