Uchi////I loved everything I ordered. Everything! We ordered a ton. I tried the Foie Gras, which I've never eaten before and it was delicious. If you're a fan -- get it! The Sea Urchin was amazing. Creamy & delectable. I haven't ever been a fan of uni & have had some pretty bad experiences with it living in Florida, so they gave us two free pieces of uni to try out. It was surprisingly good! The eggplant sushi blew my mind! How can eggplant taste so savory and delicious?! The Wagyu Beef on the hot stone is a must. It melts in your mouth. And the fried milk. JUST. DO. IT!
