Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////During a weekend trip to meet friends for their first trIp to our great state, we searched restaurants in the area looking foot great food and atmosphere. Bosscat exceeded our expectations. The waiter Jeremy was excellent! Â He was quick, friendly, helpful and full of positive energy. The food was interesting, beautiful and delicious. The restaurant ambience was eclectic and felt classy not like a franchised bar and grill.
