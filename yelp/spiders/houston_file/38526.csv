Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We went with a work group and Terry was our waiter and he was awesome!!  The food and drinks were great. Wide variety of options on the menu, enough to keep our people with vegetarian and keto diets happy. Everything we got was delicious.  We got the bosscat fries, portobello mushroom fries, chicken cheese dip, fried oysters, chicken flatbread, mac & cheese, avocado toast, brussels sprouts, and baby broccoli. The fried oysters and Brussels sprouts were favorites of our group.
