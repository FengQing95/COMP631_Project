JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Food: Daughter in law and I had the sprouting up ramen, she had it on my recommendation from my first visit. My granddaughter had the child's meal. We all shared the gyoza. The Sprouting Up Ramen was awful, it tasted like semi-flavored water, there was zero of the flavor and richness that I experienced the first visit. The kids meal on the other hand was amazing chicken ramen (the only reason they get Â stars), it had the same richness and flavor I experienced my first visit. We all shared the gyoza which were also amazing again.
