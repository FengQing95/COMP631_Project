The Pit Room////If you love your smoky fatty bbq this is your place. The beef rib pulls apart so easily and just melts in your mouth! Brisket just crumbles when you try to pick it up cause it's so soft and wow even the sausage was great and so full of spice and flavor. I have to say though my favorite was the beef rib. You'll leave the place still tasting all the grease in your mouth and that's how you know this bbq knows what's up.
