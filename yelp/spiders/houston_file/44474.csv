Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been here so many times and it is honestly one of my favorite cafes. Not only is the interior super cute, but the food is amazing as well! I have a huge sweet tooth so I've tried a bunch of their pastries and they always taste so yummy! Parking can be difficult when it is busy but patience is key haha
