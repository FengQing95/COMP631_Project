Uchi////Food: Declicious, creative, fun, elegant, and weird (in a good Williamsburg, NY kind of way).  We went with the Omakase the first time and told the waiter our preferences in food.  Though I tend to be adventurous, my party was not.  Even with the restrictions (no pork, one was vegetarian, another hates fish), our Omakase dishes were absolutely amazing!  The next few times we went we ordered al la carte and had a fabulous time being surprised by flavors infused into their dishes.  Presentation was also amazing and creative.
