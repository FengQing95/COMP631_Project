The Pit Room////Let's start with the good: BEEF. RIBS. One rib is mostly likely one pound, and one pound costs $22. BUT. This fatty, fall off the bone, giant chunk of meat, was quite tasty if not a bit under-seasoned. Nothing some sauce can't fix, but I was hoping I could enjoy the flavor of the meat itself a but more. Great smoky flavor, best thing I had on the menu.
