Local Foods////Exceptionally good qality food. I had a Banh Mi sandwich (Vietnamese - style pork). Ironically, I'm generally not a fan of the Vietnamese-style pork sandwich, but I took a chance here. The pork was actually tender and marinated in a good sauce. The fresh veggies on it were good - including the pickled onions. Even the french baguette was fresh and and soft - not hard and dry they so often are. The person I was with got the truffled egg salad sandwich (egg salad being another thing I don't like), and hers was really, really good. I will totally go back here when I'm in rice village.
