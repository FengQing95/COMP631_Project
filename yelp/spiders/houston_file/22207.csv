Uchi////We tried making reservations ahead of time, but the only times available were really late at night and the hostess said that they reserve most of the dinner hours for walk ins so we decided to do that.  From the moment we stepped foot on Uchi grounds, I was immediately impressed.  The restaurant is located on the corner of the intersection and upon walking in, there was a very hip vibe to it.  We waited out on the patio until our table was ready and we were offered free sushi samples and ordered some delicious wine.  When our table was ready, someone came out to personally walk us to our table.
