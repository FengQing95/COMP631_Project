Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the Breakfast Pot Pie while my friend got the Bravacado toast. The food came slightly slow, but the restaurant was getting busy so it was understandable. The hash browns which accompanied my pot pie were the favorite part of my meal, as they were very crispy and golden. The pot pie itself was good, and the puff pastry portion was very flaky. On the other hand, my friends Bravacado Toast had very hard bread. She did not enjoy the accompanying salad either. She said that the toast was good, but she may have enjoyed another item such as the French Toast more. I've tried the French Toast from here before, and it was delicious for those seeking a sweeter option.
