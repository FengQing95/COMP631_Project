Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Note that it is $3-5 per item, but they are pretty big.  Everything we got was delicious, but I wasn't as "blown away" as I thought I would have been knowing the chef's background, but I am going to go over and over again, to make sure I taste everything.  I'll update this entry in the future.
