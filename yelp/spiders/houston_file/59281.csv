Baby Barnaby's////My favorite meal here is the breakfast green eggs and chicken sausage. The flavor of the eggs is unbelievable and fairly healthy. I don't care for the side of potatoes. Also you should try their orange juice. It's fresh and quite interesting to watch being squeezed. Prices are very reasonable. I love that they have kept the Montrose feel.
