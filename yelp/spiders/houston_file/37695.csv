Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Shoutout to James, our server! Came here for Sunday brunch--bottomless mimosas (duh). Service was excellent--I can't remember a time our glasses were empty (maybe one time). We got the avocado salad and the chicken fried steak. Both portions were huge. The salad was fresh with a good amount of toppings (tomatoes, avocado, and blue cheese). I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese, but I was okay with it. It wasn't too overpowering; a nice complement. Chicken fried steak was super crispy with a brown gravy (they called it gumbo gravy). I'm a white gravy girl, but I'll definitely make an exception with this one. The gravy was seasoned with creole spices and really made it special from all the other chic. I was very happy with both the entries and the mimosas. Will recommend and come again!
