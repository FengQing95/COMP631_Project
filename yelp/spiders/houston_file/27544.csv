The Pit Room////This place is worth the long lines if you don't mind standing around, but we try and pop in during off peak food consuming times. The ribs are to die for. Pulled pork is crazy delicious and their Mac and cheese is the best in Texas. They have a pickle bar. That alone is a reason to go.
