The Pit Room////As for sides I got the Mac n cheese and green beans. I thought the Mac n cheese was good but I wish it was hotter. I felt like it was served just warm-ish. The smoky green beans were great. I thought that was great alternative to potato salad or coleslaw if you're not looking for a lot of mayo.
