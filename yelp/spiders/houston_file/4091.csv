JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////On more than one occasion, we have seated an incomplete party of two people that would eventually hold the table for more than an hour before ordering their meal, even after telling the host the other person was parking the car and would arrive shortly. On these occasions, we have received complaints from other parties of two that had arrived but could not be seated.
