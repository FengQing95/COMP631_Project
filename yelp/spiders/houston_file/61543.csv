Baby Barnaby's////This breakfast place is quaint and yummy. They offer good choices for standard breakfast fare. I got the breakfast plate (2 eggs, with choice of fried potatos or grits, bacon or sausage, and biscuit or bread). I ordered this with scrambled eggs, the fried potatos, bacon, and biscuits. The potatos were nicely crispy and the biscuit were flaky. I recommend adding jam to this. Overall a good breakfast. I also recommend trying the fresh-pressed orange juice. It's refreshing and delicious.
