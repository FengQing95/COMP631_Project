Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////If you need to get away from the stress of uptown and galleria traffic, grab a seat at the bar at Bosscat for lunch. Friendly staff (Kaleb is great) and terrific food. Rotating local taps. Great atmosphere. Steak cut fries with house made ketchup alone makes the visit worth it.
