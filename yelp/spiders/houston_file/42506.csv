Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////After reading/hearing about this highly-anticipated bakery, my hubby decided to take me to Common Bond during its opening weekend. The bakery itself is housed in a pretty large building on the corner of Westheimer and Dunlavy with its own private lot with enough parking spaces for the many customers who also ventured over on a Sunday morning. We arrived at 9:15am to be surprised by the customer line weaving within the store, out the door, and around the building towards Westheimer! It took us nearly an hour to get to the front of line, and by then we had plenty of time to scope out the premise and all the delectable goodies they had to offer. The bakery itself has a gorgeous layout - tall windows, lots of natural lighting and space, urban rustic decor, beautiful servers and attendants decked out in white uniforms and fedoras, and a wonderful display of all their pastries and breads. Even though the line was long, there oddly enough wasn't any wait time to find a seat, since there are plenty of indoor and outdoor tables and counters to enjoy your food at.
