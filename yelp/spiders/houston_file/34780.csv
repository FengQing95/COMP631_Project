Local Foods////I love love love this place!! As every other review states here. It's probably my all time favorite sandwich shop. You'd definitely have to have somewhat of a diverse palate to really appreciate everything here (I used to be really picky and found it really hard to get anything I really liked, but when I started trying more things, everything I got I liked.) I normally am a person to just stick to one order per restaurant, but every time I come here, I like to get something different because everything is seriously just that good. The crunchy chicken and salmon bagel are among my favorites overall, but seriously, nothing has ever disappointed here. Really glad that they have more than one super close location, because the parking can be a little difficult for both areas.
