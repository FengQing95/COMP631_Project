Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Visiting from out of state, and found that this cafe made me feel right at home. From the friendly staff to the comforting sweets and a more than perfect latte. Adam was such a delight to talk to, and gave great recommendations of other places to visit while in town. Loved it!!!
