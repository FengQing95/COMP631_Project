Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Typical american breakfast place. It is very nice and the service very good but there is HUGE problem. The waiting list. Dear lord, 1.5h waiting on a sunny hot saturday is a horrible time to wake up. The waiting is crazy and they should find a better way to organize their tables. Other than that, it is a good place.
