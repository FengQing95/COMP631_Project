Kata Robata////This place is simply awesome! It's very spacious and usually crowded so definitely get a reservation especially if you are going there for dinner and during the weekends. Unless you don't eat meat, you have to try their kobe beef skewers (it is unbelievably good). Great sushi and entrees/appetizers and good portion as well. Must go place and highly recommend!
