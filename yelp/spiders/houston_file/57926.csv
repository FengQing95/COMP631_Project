Kata Robata////Phenomenal experience. Having lived in Japan and having had exceptional sushi, I can say I was pleasantly surprised by the freshness and quality of their food. I'm more a nigiri Â fan, but we ordered a roll first and it when it came out and tasted it, we ordered another one. Fantastic, delicious, please go and try them out. I'd recommend making a reservation as we got extremely lucky getting there right before they got busy and the wait time can easily reach 45min to an hour on the weekend.
