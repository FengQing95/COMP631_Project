Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The brunch -- seriously good and at a really good value! The presentation is stellar and they have nothing above $20 on their menu. when you get the food, it looks like you would pay twice as much as any restaurant. They really bring value to the meals that they create. I also enjoy the fact that their menu changes each month. It's really worth it going there over and over each month just to see what kind of creation they'll have.
