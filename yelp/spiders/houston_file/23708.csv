Uchi////As mentioned before, the fried milk dessert is my favorite. It's innovation and a great mix of textures and flavors. I get it every time. The fried milk part has a crunchy outer layer with a gooey, sweet inside. That's paired with cold smooth ice cream and various forms of chocolate. One of the best desserts out there.
