Uchi////I am about 4 months late for this review and was skeptical of writing it because I don't even remember what I ate.  Then again it was Omakase which probably made it harder for me to remember.  Please take this review with a grain of salt.  These 4 stars are reflective of how i remember my taste buds were feeling.  Which i felt was 4 stars because i don't remember coming out the place thinking WOW i must come again.  Honestly I believe this place has been hyped and turned into a I have to say this place is "fantastic" or I am not in the in "cool" crowd.  But don't get me wrong it is definitely above average delicious.  We had a private room for 10 people and service was on point as it should be.  Waiter knew all the dishes like the back of his hand and was very accommodating.  All in all it's definitely an outstanding restaurant but it's not "to die for".  Sorry Houston still has ways to go in that regards.
