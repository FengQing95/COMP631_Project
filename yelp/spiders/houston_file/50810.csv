Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place has really good brunch! We got the harvest Benedict and the OMG French toast. Both were really delicious. The harvest Benedict had really perfectly cooked eggs with delicious runny yolk, also a hint of lemon or lime which went really well the quinoa and bits of veggies. Such good flavor, and a bit mushy (which I liked).
