JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Nikki - Thanks for the great review! Since we opened our first JINYA nearly two years ago, we have heard customers mention Naruto and his penchant for ramen, so we're glad this exposure to Japanese culture and cuisine brought you to our doorstep. I'm also glad to hear that Hamzeh was able to assist you with your selections, and that your little one enjoyed the Kid's Meal option. Thank you again for your patronage, and we look forward to serving you again in the near future!
