Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////i am clean, polite and middle class.  i was even wearing a new shirt.  so what's the deal?  my brother pointed out afterwards that we were the oldest people in the place.  (i'm 61, my brother is 55 or so.)    i don't know what the snooze policy about oldsters is, but i can testify that they seemed quite anxious to seat anyone else before us.
