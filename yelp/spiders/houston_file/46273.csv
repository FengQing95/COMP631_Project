Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is such a cute bakery/cafe! My cousin and I decided to try here for lunch. Parking is limited in the back of the cafe so you may have to park in the neighborhood where it is a parking zone. I didn't get the baked goods this time, but I tried their lunch menu. Â Luckily, it wasn't too packed and was able to find an indoor table after ordering our food. I got the Beef Bourguignon while my cousin got the Hot and Crunchy Salmon, and we also the Latte coffee.
