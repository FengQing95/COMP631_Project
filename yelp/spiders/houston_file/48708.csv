Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We ordered the pineapple pancakes, French toast (super yum) and the bella bella benny (the perfect savory). The French toast was hands down one of the best we've tried. Tasted like luscious coconut cream pie. The pineapple pancake was yummy but not in comparison to the French toast! Bacon was SO good and perfectly cooked. We'll be back!!!
