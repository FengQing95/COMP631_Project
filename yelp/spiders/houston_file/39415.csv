Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////There's a lot of options, obviously a ton of whiskey, but the names aren't very telling.  Lucky for us, we had a waiter that knew all the drinks and was able to recommend the right one based on what you're looking for (i.e. fruity, dry, type of alcohol, etc).  I had the Bosscat, and it was really good - generous pour of alcohol, but it didn't taste like rubbing alcohol.
