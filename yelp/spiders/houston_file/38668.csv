Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Updating my review because of their whiskey/bourbon prices. Bosscat touts itself as a whiskey/bourbon bar, and they do have a great selection. However, their prices are crazy. It is $35 for a glass of Weller 12. That is more than a 750 ml bottle costs at retail, and you know they are paying retail for their bottles as a restaurant. It's also $10-15 more a glass than you would pay at any other bar. Other glasses are $5-10 above what you would pay at other places. I know restaurants can set their prices at whatever they want, but I really don't appreciate Bosscat price gouging their customers. If you want people to actually be able to afford and try good bourbon, do better. I still like the food and the cocktails aren't that overpriced, but I will never order a straight glass of alcohol here.
