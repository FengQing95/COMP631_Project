Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My review is based only on two items, the oatmeal cream pie and the Chocolate chips cookies. Oatmeal cream pie, this is what dreams are made of. It's not like the stuff you buy at the store. It's a perfectly soft oatmeal cookie with a cream cheese filling. I could eat the cookies all day every day then they add the cream, mind blown. The chocolate chip cookie- when first saw the price my thought was no way I'm paying that. I was promised it was awesome so I bought one thinking I'll never buy another. This is the best chocolate cookie I have ever eaten. It's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. It has whole walnuts and the best chocolate chunks that melt in you mouth. No other cookies will be the same after trying these. I live in Katy Tx and look for reasons to go here for the cookies. It's the best in Texas and most likely in the country. I've heard the rest of the food is awesome also.
