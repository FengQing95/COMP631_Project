Baby Barnaby's////Food is obviously great but get ready for an attitude if Scott answers the phone. I did not see pancakes on the menu when I called and instead of just giving me the options he told me to look at the menu online and then call him back with an attitude. I was wrong the pancakes were on the menu but I guess it was too much to ask for him to tell me the THREE options they had. I always report great service and rarely report bad attitudes but I'm sick of people thinking they can just talk to people however and not have any repercussions. I know this review won't do much because the rest of the place and other servers are awesome, but something had to be said for the unprofessionalism by one individual. I know the service in person and food Â is great just don't call the food order in when Scott answers.
