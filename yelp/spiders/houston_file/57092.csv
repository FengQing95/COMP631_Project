Kata Robata////Who goes to sushi restaurant and order tonkotsu? This idiot after 2 friends recommended it on 2 separate occasions. And one happy idiot I was after finishing the bowl for late lunch on a Friday afternoon. The broth and the noodle and the ajitama were all great! The broth has a strong ginger flavor, so may be stay away if you're not a fan. The pork was a tad bit on the dry side. Still a solid bowl. My friend tried the miso ramen and, perhaps I was just preferring a more flavorful bowl that afternoon, I actually liked her bowl better.
