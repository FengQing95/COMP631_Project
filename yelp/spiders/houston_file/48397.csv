Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My big issue with Snooze either in Houston or in Denver is that it's very heavy on carbs.  Even for dishes that you order that shouldn't be heavy on carbs (e.g. eggs benedict variations), the dish comes with very little eggs benedict and a ton of hash browns.  Their pancakes, instead of feeling light and airy, feel heavy, plain, and uninspired.  I might give Snooze 3 stars if I wasn't as carb/health-conscious, but since I am, it gets 2 stars because there are much better brunch options in this area of town, at a similar price point.
