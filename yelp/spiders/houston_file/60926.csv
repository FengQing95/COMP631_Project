Baby Barnaby's////A friend picked this place for brunch one Saturday. I had never been. We got there at 1pm, an hour before they close, but still received great service. The coffee was good and the food was better. We both got the green eggs which I had read about here on yelp and I was not disappointed. The plate of food was so huge, my friend and I could have easily shared. Everything tasted fantastic. I can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu I highly recommend this place.
