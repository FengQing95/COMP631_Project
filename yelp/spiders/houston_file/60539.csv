Baby Barnaby's////This was one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time. My boyfriend and I split the green eggs (a MUST) and the waffle. The green eggs were deliciously creamy and flavorful. They came with crispy potatoes and a sausage. I ate my entire portion of sausage before I realized there wasn't any left! The waffle was covered in fresh fruit and powdered sugar. It was very fluffy and combined with the fruit and maple syrup, it felt like a dessert rather than breakfast.
