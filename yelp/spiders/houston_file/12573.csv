JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Cute and trendy little place that can get pretty loud since it's pretty much always busy. If you are the mood for an appetizer, I recommend the Spicy Tempura Shrimp: YUM! No, they are not spicy spicy, but they are slathered in a yummy sauce and served over a bed of field greens (like a mini salad = ) Â  I personally wasn't a fan of the lettuce wraps because there wasn't enough meat and super small lettuce wraps so I would pass on those.
