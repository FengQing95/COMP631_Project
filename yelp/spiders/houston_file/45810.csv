Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I ordered the biscuits and gravy. The biscuit was dense not light and fluffy like I would expect from a bakery. The gravy tasted sour or vinegary. Very disappointed.  The general manager Jordan is not much of help either.  Offered to give me a gift card.  Why would I want a gift card to a place that can't make a biscuits and gravy.
