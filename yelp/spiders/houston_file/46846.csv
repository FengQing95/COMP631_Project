Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Had the eggs Benedict duo with one classic and one Bella, Bella(prosciutto, Taleggio cheese, and perfectly poached eggs on toasted ciabatta, topped with cream cheese hollandaise, balsamic glaze and arugula). Oh my, was it good.  The flavors were excellent.  I munched through both of them.  The only huge drawback is the wait. We got there before the lunch crowd so only had a 15 min wait.  It was also a little loud.
