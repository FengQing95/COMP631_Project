Uchi////The food here is nothing but amazing.  You can't go wrong with any menu item.  Personal favorites are Aji, Hotate, Foie Nigiri, Madai, and the Sake Toro sashimi is truly melt in your mouth like butter delicious!  The semi freddo  is like no other, or else just have a few pieces of the Foie Nigiri to leave the experience in bliss.  Enjoy!  I finally have a favorite restaurant in Houston.
