Kata Robata////Whoever was the hostess on Feb 13th needs to be re-trained or fired. Called in on that day to make omakase reservations and was supposedly put down tonight for one. I made it extremely clear that I wanted it to be an omakase reservation and she made it clear that it was an omakase reservation as well. Got called today to confirm our reservation, only to find out it was never an omakase reservation. Too bad I guess. My party was anticipating this dinner for almost two weeks. Needless to say, I won't be trying to make a reservation again because I don't know how deep this idiocy runs in the establishment, :(
