Uchi////I haven't been to the restaurant in person yet but ordered takeout as a birthday celebration. Â I had always had this bias that Uchi was just another overrated sushi place where you're paying more for "brand" and ambience than the food. I stand corrected. The food was absolutely amazing. The fish was so soft, the right warmth level, and flavorful. The wasabi they placed on the rice (nigiri) was subtle but added a lot of flavor to the nigiri. The (I'm assuming) yuzu paste they added to the top of the scallop nigiri was so flavorful and really brought out the sweetness of the scallop.
