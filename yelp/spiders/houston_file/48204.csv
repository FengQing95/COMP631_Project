Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Disappointed again ! I dropped by Snooze this afternoon trying catch a quick sandwich. They were putting away chairs when I walked up, so I asked "are you still open"; reply, "I don't know what time is it?". So I walked in, no one at the desk, just incredibly loud music and bunch a people running around. So again, I asked "are you still open"; again reply, "I don't know what time is it?" So I looked a my watch and said 2:25, reply "ok yes". So I ordered a Rueben sandwich to go and asked for side salad instead of potatoes. Last order of the day, simple, but they could not get it right.  Managment needs to decide if they are OPEN then be open! This is the third time, twice while opening and now once with closing that staff was more concerned about something else than the customer.  Maybe if they turned down the music they could here the customer's order and each other.  Plenty of other places to go less frustrating
