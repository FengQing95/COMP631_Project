Baby Barnaby's////The food: Really good. The scrambled eggs were some of the best I had in a long time. The had good tea and coffee. The biscuits were warm and soft and made it easy to spread the butter or fruit preserve options available. The grits were smooth. The only downside was my brother's steak had too much gristle. Â Plenty of vegetarian-friendly options as well.
