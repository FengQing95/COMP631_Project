Kata Robata////I've tried both Spicy Soy and Tonkatsu Ramen here. The ramen just doesn't truly compare to the ones in Japan, so I can't judge it against that. What I liked about the ramen was that there was good flavor in both soups and that it came with an soft boiled egg. I didn't care for the seaweed, pickled ginger and beansprouts that came with it, so I had to pick that out. Would I eat these two ramen here again?? Maybe just the Tonkatsu one... I liked the flavor more in that one.
