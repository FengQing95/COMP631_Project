Uchi////I traveled to many places around the US, Uchi easily took number 1 sushi restaurant on my list.  First it blew my mind that I heard such good things about this restaurant in TEXAS.  C'mon, HOUSTON, TX, that alone questions a lot of things.  However, I was in the area for the F1 race, hoping to see Sebastion Vettel....let me say that again, hopeful wishing.  We sat at the sushi bar, where me and my friend can converse with the sushi chef.
