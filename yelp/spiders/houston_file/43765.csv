Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Right when you step inside, it's hard to remember that you're in Houston. The interior is very cute and chic and the staff all wear a uniform with white fedoras, different from the usual Montrose coffee shop. This is more of a cafe than a coffee shop so avoid it if you're looking for a quiet place to read the morning paper.
