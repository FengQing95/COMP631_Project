Kata Robata////-"Kakuni" Pork Belly with 60 degree egg:  I could eat this dish every day and we ended our meal on the highest note yet!  Its a must try when you come here, holy smokes!  Soooo delicious!  When they bring it the plating is awesome and you cannot wait to break that egg so it runs over the sauteed greens and pork belly.  It come with a spoon so you spoon everything into that delicious perfect bite!
