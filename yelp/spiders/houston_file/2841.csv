JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////You do get a large whole egg at Jinya, but the egg has been way overcooked for me every time I've been here, with near-solidified yolks and hard, rubbery whites. I actually thought it was a hard-boiled egg at first, very disappointing. At Tiger Den, the egg is a smaller half, but it's cooked perfectly with a fantastic runny yolk and soft white.
