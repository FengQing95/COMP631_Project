Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////What really surprised me came afterwards. You see I had expected the cookie to be good. I figured someone who can do sweets that well can't possibly do savory equally well. You see how quickly I judge? I was wrong. Oh so wrong because that BBQ beef bulgogi sandwich was fantastic. It was savory and drizzled with an aioli sauce. It was also served with tiny Persian pickles. My God do they know what they're doing here. I'll be back. You can't count on it.
