Uchi////So, we all got there about 15 minutes early. Only, to be seated an HOUR and a HALF after our reservation. WTF. I hate waiting, especially that long. It was a Wednesday night and call me lame but I try to eat before midnight during the week. By the time we got our food it was like 10 something, I wasn't even hungry anymore. So, I got one roll and soup. The Shag and Miso Soup...good choice. Everyone else really enjoyed their food as well.
