Baby Barnaby's////Got there around 10 on a Sunday morning and there was a wait list for indoor seating (which, from the looks of it was pretty cramped), but, since the weather was so nice, we found a spot on the patio which was first come, first serve. Â Our server was great (his name on our receipt was "the man", which is telling of the chill/quasi-hippie atmosphere of Barnaby's)
