Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Adorable corner and very small spot in the Montrose. Small! You can find additional parking down Dunlavy should you need. This area has boomed so traffic is only getting worse so most likely will only come back once in a blue moon. Houston restaurant week was okay tasting. Had better as we close 2021's event. The service is excellent though. Very kind staff. Thank you. Cheers!
