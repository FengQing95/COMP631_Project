Kata Robata////The ambiance is dressed in warm Asian hues of orange, soft yellow, red, and beige. It's a very low lit restaurant except for the sushi bar, but the lighting adds to the warm and intimate feel of the restaurant. Service with the hostess staff is a bit hit or miss, but I found the sushi chef's and waiters to be very consistent with their attentiveness and professionalism with me on both visits.
