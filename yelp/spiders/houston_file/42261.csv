Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place confused me when I walked in, which initially put me off, but the pastries speak for themselves. They are amazing. They're beautiful, they're inventive and they're absolutely delicious. If you love pastry you have to go here. The variety of pastries change. One time they had a pistachio/raspberry tart, another time they had a passion fruit pastry or a lemon tart or a chocolate tart and they were all good. The almond croissant was delicious and I am not usually a fan of croissants. The hot chocolate was just OK. Oatmeal cream cookie, yum!
