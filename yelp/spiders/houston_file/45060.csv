Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Even though the line was long, it moved pretty quickly. We ordered the Chicken Torta, an almond croissant, and Arnold Palmer, and a vanilla latte. The food came quickly and the staff was super helpful and made sure we got everything we needed. THE SANDWICH WAS AMAZING. Like absolutely one of the best (if not THE best) sandwiches I have EVER had. You must try this. Also, I hate bread, so I never get pastries or anything because I just don't like the taste, but the almond croissant was so delicious - I've never had anything that amazing and fragrant before. Just phenomenal...and the almond cream inside was perfect. The portions are great for sharing also.
