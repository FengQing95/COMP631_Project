Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great food, poor service. Came here for brunch on a Monday at around 11 AM. Wait was around 35 minutes. Good thing they had coffee for those waiting but the hostesses were rude. Weren't happy that I asked for an update on my wait time and when I received a text that my table was ready, it took an extra 5-7 mins on top of my 35 minute wait to have us seated. I noticed a lot of tables would be open with no one being seated for at least 5 minutes. Seems like slow turnover. Noticed few people leaving because of the long wait.
