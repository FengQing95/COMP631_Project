Local Foods////I got the crunchy chicken sandwich on a Pretzel roll. (Ahhh! That's amazing, fresh pretzel roll?!). It was so good. Not quite as I imagined it would look, it's more a chicken salad than a slab. That was fine. Made it easier to eat. I got the quinoa side and chips. Fresh made, on site. Both were good. But the chips were abundant, good for sharing.
