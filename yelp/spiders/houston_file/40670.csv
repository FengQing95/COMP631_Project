Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The hamburger we ordered had no seasoning on the hamburger patty it was just cooked plain. The potatoes either from the hamburger nor the appetizer had no flavor, it was potatoes cut and baked with no seasoning at all, the pork chop with polenta was good, the pork didn't have a lot of flavor either and it was dry but the polenta was delicious.
