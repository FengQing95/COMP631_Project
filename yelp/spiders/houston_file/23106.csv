Uchi////This is a delicious sushi restaurant! They have a wonderful cocktail menu and sake too. Sadly no plum wine but that's no issue. Was a little frustrated we waited for 40 minutes to be sat even though we had a reservation. Though we sat on the patio the service their took a while to get to us about 5 minutes for an drink or small bite to be ordered.
