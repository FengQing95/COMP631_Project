The Pit Room////Only giving 3 stars bc the employees were very nice and friendly with the exception of the cashier. The cashier seemed to be upset bc I chose a 10% tip. I only chose that option bc I was ashamed the option even came up. Why leave a tip for counter service. Literally order food at the counter and slide down like Luby's to pay and go to your table. The guy that walks around bussing tables need to be tipped more than those working behind the counter. Anyhoo, the food was alright. Not worth the $80 paid. We had 3 three meat dinners, 4 drinks, 1 beef sausage and large mac & cheese. The sausage had a soft texture, the brisket was dry. Nothing had seasoning (seemed like). The mac and cheese was creamy and pleasing to the eye, but no seasoning. The potato salad was bland. The pork ribs were ok, no seasoning, the star of it all was the pickled cucumbers. The tea had a toothpaste/minty after taste. I had the sweet tea and I added 3 splendas and STILL wasn't sweet. It all just went to waste.
