JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////While I generally want to leave light reviews highlighting positive qualities. I was disgusted by the restroom situation, it seems that it is okay to leave a puddle of urine and to my shock ACTUAL fecal matter smeared over the mirror! It is said that a restaurant's food safety can be judged by its restrooms and I would make this risk again.
