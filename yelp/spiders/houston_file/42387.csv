Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond... what more can I say or what higher praise can I rightfully give to this wonderful cafe. I have been coming here for over 4 years and as of my most recent visit, I have still yet to have had any negative experience. Their service is fantastic, all of the employees are extremely friendly and always ready with a delicious suggestion and a beaming smile. I have tried approximately 60-70 percent of the various menu items and while I certainly have developed a few favorites, I can and will honestly say that everything that I have tried is amazing, not only in taste but also in each dish's respective presentation. To sum up this review, I wholeheartedly recommend Common Bond and would definitely suggest that anyone in the greater Houston area who has not yet been here to swing by the next time they are in the midtown/Montrose area. I will be back soon for my next visit without a doubt. Five plus stars!
