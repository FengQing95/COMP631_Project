Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'm sad I don't live in Houston anymore to experience this fully and really try the menu seeing as I discovered this on my way out. I didn't try much beyond those, most of what I wanted was sold out behind the glass anyway so I got a hot chocolate. It was quite cramped in there from the door, line to order & to those seats up front.
