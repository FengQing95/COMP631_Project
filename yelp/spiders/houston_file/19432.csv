Uchi////Amazing vegetarian selection. Even my family members who usually dislike any kind of Asian food enjoyed Uchi. Try the vegetarian sampler meal- absolutely fantastic. Make sure not to miss dessert, the fried milk is delicious. Appreciated the complementary valet, and the staff were super accommodating during our wait as well as during dinner. Overall had a wonderful time and will be coming back again.
