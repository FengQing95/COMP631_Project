Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The bakery looks visually appealing, but the last time I visited, there were unfortunately a couple of flies flying around behind the sneeze guards. Hopefully this was just a one off, as i understand that it's difficult for bakeries to deal with those issue; and thus it wouldn't deter me from visiting again in the future.
