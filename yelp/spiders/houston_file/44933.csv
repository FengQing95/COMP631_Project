Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love this place! Every single baked good I've had here has totally fulfilled all my fat kid dreams! A serious favorite of mine is the nutella croissant. If you love nutella, you must eat this decadent croissant stuffed full of globs of nutella. The chocolate croissants are also delicious with one of their expertly crafted lattes. The espresso is absolutely delicious here and the drip coffee is amazing. I've also had the quiche lorraine and salad which is great, usually I save half for lunch the next day. My friend adores the beef and grits and I see many people ordering this. I have yet to try the macarons or specialty cakes, but they're also on my list.
