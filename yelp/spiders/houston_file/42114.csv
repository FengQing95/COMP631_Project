Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I would only come here for the pastries...the hazelnut brioche was yummm, probably my favorite.  Their croissants are huge! We came for lunch so we did order the hawaiian royale and the shrimp and grits.  They were both OK.  I would rather eat the shrimp and grits at Backstreet Cafe.  We also got the pain perdu (spelling?), it's like French toast.  That was pretty good too.  The line was out the door so it was pretty intimidating at first but the line went by pretty fast.  It's packed inside, barely any seats for the amount of people coming in.  Definitely not a place for strollers or car seats.  They do have outdoor seating, but I'd pass on that since it's Houston.  Maybe I'd venture the outdoor seating in the winter...  ;)
