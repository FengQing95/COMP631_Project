JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The place was very crowded around 7pm on a Saturday (what do you expect). We had to wait around 40-45 minutes for a table. When you enter, there is a bar right in front of you and the hostess stand is on the left along with walkway on the left side that enters the dining room. The dining room is set up as small tables on the side with a 2 long bench tables in the middle. It appears that larger parties sit in the middle next to other customers.
