Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have been here a handful of times. I really enjoy this bakery. There are two items in particular that I am crazy for and that is the oatmeal cream cookie and the bread plate. The bread plate is lots of artisan bread slices with butter and jam and goes really good with a cappuccino or latte. The cappuccino barista usually adds a heart design in the foam. The oatmeal cream cookie is a rarity to find homemade. It's wonderful.
