Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond isn't bad but definitely not outstanding food and not worth the money spent.  You have a decent wait in line, limited space, dining is cramped and you can't eat without someone bumping you.  We came for lunch and ordered the burger, quiche, salad, and fried chicken burger with a coffee.  The burger was dry and light on flavor, the fried chicken burger was oily and not very crunchy, fries tasted old/stale, and the quiche with salad was okay.  Our coffees were extremely sweet so we didn't even drink them.  We didn't mention it to the staff because a part of our order was wrong and all they could say was oops and sorry.  This isn't service in any way.  Needless to say, we won't be returning here.
