JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Lance - Thank you very much for your review. I'm glad we were able to take care of this particular situation in a manner that met your satisfaction. We don't always hit the mark in terms of food and/or service (not for lack of effort), so it's always nice to get such excellent feedback from our customers. But above all, I am happy you enjoyed our ramen, and we most definitely look forward to serving you again soon.
