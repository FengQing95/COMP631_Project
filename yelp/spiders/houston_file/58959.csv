Baby Barnaby's////Breakfast/Brunch is by far my favorite meal anytime of the day but it's especially good on a late Saturday or Sunday morning. If I am looking for a non-partying brunch I love coming here. My only complaint here is that it's teeny tiny but it makes up in great friendly service and hot fresh food.
