Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food. The totchos are amazing and the right kick for starters I'd definitely order that again. For my entree I'm a country girl so I ordered the chicken fried steak with two over easy eggs. The steak is massive and two could eat from it if small Portions are your thing. I love how the steak is all meat and not just breaded it was great. My only compliant is the gumbo gravy (no meat just a gravy) it was a bit salty for me and I don't like brown gravy I wish I could have had some good ol white country gravy I would have been in heaven! I will definitely order the steak again but perhaps stop off and buy some white gravy from say diary queen or whataburger Â before I go. Mouth watering I tell you. Few of the other people orders had the fruity pebble French toast he ate all of it but did say it was very sweet. The meatloaf dish had some asking for more of meatloaf they reported was not much of that at all and they left disappointed because the meatloaf was good but very limited in that dish. Few had the burgers and they reported was nice and tender no complaints. Fries appeared to be over cooked but based on all the reviews on the fries from other yelpers seems that's just how they cook their fries. I didn't try any dessert and not sure what's even offered. We toured the Whiskey room which is great for picture back drops. I love the atmosphere and will definitely be back. There is complimentary valet parking as well as street and self parking.
