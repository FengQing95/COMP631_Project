JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I really enjoyed that everything is customizable. I wouldn't say I'm necessarily a picky eater but I hate when there's more than one ingredient I don't want because then I feel like I'm being an ass/picky by asking the waiter to 86 those items. But you can pretty much mix and match which I loved. I went with the classic chicken and got some chicken dumplings on the side. Holy hell those dumplings were incredible, truly. And the ramen portion was the perfect size and very tasty. I highly recommend getting a couple dumplings to dip in your ramen! I'll be back!
