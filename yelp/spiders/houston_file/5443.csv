JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Menu has a good number of items on their menu- not too much, but a good number of choices to choose from. They have appetizers, ramen, and rice dishes, as well as specials and cocktails. I've had the Tonkotsu Assari with extra garlic and egg, and it was so savory, garlicky, and delicious. The pork was tender and had a thick layer of fat, and the noodles had a good bite and smooth texture. Fried Brussels sprouts and truffle fries are also very good, although on one occasion  the sprouts were under seasoned. What I love about Jinya is that they have veggie ramen  for my vegetarian friends. My coworker ordered it and she loved it. if you want the broth spicy, all you have to do is ask. Service is consistent and always friendly.
