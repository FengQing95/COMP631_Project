Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////A great go-to work happy hour or date night location. Self parking or valet. Best part of the experience was the manager, Jose. The decor, music and food was spot on for a good evening. We were waited on by Jose and he was the cherry-on-top. It's a gem when you find people who love what they do. His attitude is so infectious. He is so kind, considerate and engaging which made the visit even better! I hope owners recognize his talent. By the way, the pulled pork hush puppies are delicious!
