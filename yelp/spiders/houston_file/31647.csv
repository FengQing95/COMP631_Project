Local Foods////Wow, call me crazy, but I really wanted to hate the egg salad. Mostly because I didn't wanna conform to what everyone else was saying. Also, because I've never ever liked egg salad. However, this egg salad is amaze-balls. It is so light, fluffy and simple in the fact that it isn't overdone with relish, capers, onions, etc. It is fresh, simple, eggy goodness. All this served with some shredded cheese, greens, tomatoes (all local) served on an INCREDIBLE pretzel bun. I seriously dream about this bun sometimes! It is completely divine! So crusty, soft, airy and simply incredible. I'll have to venture out and try the different varieties of sandwiches, but as of now, I'd marry this egg salad if I could!
