JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went here on a Thursday evening with a couple of friends.  While the food was pretty good, the service was very rushed.  The drinks always stayed full and the food came quickly, but we felt like we were being rushed to get out of there (and there was no one waiting for a table, so we weren't holding up anyone).  We were there only an hour.
