Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Let me preface this by saying I love(d) Snooze! Every time I'm in Houston I brave the parking and come grub. Today I ordered the pancake flight...one pancake and my side of bacon came out before the rest of the food, cold. I politely sent it back and my pancake flight came and new bacon came, with the same cold pancake and no syrup. By the time syrup came the other two pancakes were cold. My waitress was nice and comped the side of bacon but the experience was a downer. So to sum it up, still good food but the service and inattention by the kitchen has my eye wandering.
