Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Yes, yes! Wonderful coffee shop and bakery. I love the location and outdoor seating. They've put a Texan spin on French classics ... The croissants are MASSIVE for example. Common bond is cool and laid back and busy and delicious all at the same time. The coffee is fantastic, the service is prompt and the options for treats are plenty. Head over here for breakfast and then a Montrose stroll.
