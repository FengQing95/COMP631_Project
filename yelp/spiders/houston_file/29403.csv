The Pit Room////We were able to snipe down a table and enjoyed our meal. Everyone was able fill their plate with a good amount of each kind of meat, and everyone seemed very happy with the meal. I think that the consensus was that the meat was cooked very well and not too red but still very tender meat. One could argue that some of the red meats were a bit fatty, but I think that is part of what makes barbecue great. The food is definitely a hit, you'll love whatever you get (even the turkey breast was tender and delicious!)
