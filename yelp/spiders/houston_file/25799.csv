The Pit Room////We went for lunch and both got pulled pork sandwiches and Mac and cheese on the side. The sandwiches were very generous and you could add toppings at a little bar, though they didn't have tomatoes, my favorite with bbq. They could have been a bit less greasy, though that keep the pork moist and there were no pieces of fat in the meat. The place was crowded and clearly popular, so we may be back.
