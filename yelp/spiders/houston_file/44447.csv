Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Ham & egg torta: Such a good concept, but this flopped for me. This is a huge sandwich, the standout being this awesome poached egg that bursts and oozes out a warm egg yolk when you bite into it. However, the sandwich itself was just way too salty (I think it was mostly the ham). I found myself constantly reaching for my water and a lot of the flavor of the sandwich just overpowered by saltiness.
