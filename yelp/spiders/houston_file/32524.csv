Local Foods////I love the garden sammie as a salad.  There's great flavors (from the hummus and the guac gives it a bit of moisture) and I feel like it's a real meal sometime unlike a salad.  The crunchy chicken and chicken posole are also really good.  I am not a big fan of the sides, i think most are underwhelming a pricey for the little tiny cup.
