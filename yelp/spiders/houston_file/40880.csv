Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great ambiance, the general decor and vibe was great overall. Went on a Saturday and it was a little busy, though we had reservations and were sat pretty quick though. The brunch menu is great and alot of the other items I saw looked good. Overall the service was good but sometimes it took a bit to get someone's attention, other than that staff was friendly.
