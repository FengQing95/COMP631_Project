JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is a great Ramen restaurant. Their bun appetizer is soo good! Mediocre seaweed salad. I ordered the tonkotsu black bowl spicy with thick noodles. It was beyond spicy. My throat was on fire! Other than that really nice atmosphere, geared towards the young people of midtown.
