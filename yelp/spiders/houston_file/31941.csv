Local Foods////We noticed the sandwiches were huge so my friend and I shared the Gulf Shrimp & Blue Crab Sandwich which had huge chunks of crab and shrimp as well as some yummy pickled onions and green goddess dressing. It was really really good! For sides we god the homemade chips and quinoa salad. This chips were fresh and seasoned with Old Bay and the quinoa was pretty tasty as well. My other friend got the same sandwich but on a salad instead of in ciabatta bread. It's pretty cool because you can take any of their sandwiches and turn them into salads!
