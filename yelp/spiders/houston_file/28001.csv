The Pit Room////Before today I gave this place a strong five stars. I would go here once a week. On 5/27 I experienced hair in my food. Later when I asked for a to go box I found another hair in the box. Due to the cleanliness I won't be coming back. Their food has great flavor and I was a huge fan but after today I will find bbq elsewhere.
