JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Rocio - Thanks for the great review. I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen. Please know that the Spicy Sauce on the table is not the same as the Spicy Sauce we use predominantly to add heat to our ramen bowls. That sauce contains upwards of 15 separate ingredients and takes a great deal of time and energy to produce large quantities for the chefs to use. Charging 50 cents for this spicy sauce is akin to being charged extra for sour cream at a Mexican restaurant.
