Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////3.5 stars-- came in for lunch because it was new and had pretty good ratings. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, and explained that Bosscat is actually from LA and this is a new Houston location. We ordered the shrimp & grits and short rib. Portions are pretty small, especially because I generally think of "heavy, filling" meals when it comes to shrimp & grits and short rib.
