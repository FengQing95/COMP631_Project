Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////- Pancake flight (trio of peach cobbler, blueberry danish, and the pancake of the day): Pancake of the day was Berry Bacon, which was a candied bacon batter with fresh strawberries and chocolate syrup. Surprisingly good! I'm usually not a big fan of candied bacon but I think it was done really well. Would definitely order them again. The peach cobbler pancakes were also quite good. Not too sweet and felt perfect for summer. The blueberry cobbler was a bit too sweet for me, and I felt like the blueberry overwhelmed the rest of the pancake. Overall I felt the pancake flight was the highlight of the meal.
