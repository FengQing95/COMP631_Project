Uchi////Also our server was super friendly and helpful, I didn't catch his name but on the ticket it says Steven. He was very knowledgeable, and he was giving us suggestion on food. I didn't know this, but we should have figure out what we wanted to eat from the beginning. He mention that the next time we come, we should mention all the dishes and the server should know which plate to come out first to the last dish. Each dish suppose to built upon each other to give you a different taste bud explosion. Our server even came around before putting the order in for the foie gras nigiri, if we wanted anything else because foie gras is so strong, it should be the last dish before the dessert.
