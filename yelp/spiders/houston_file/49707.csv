Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place was really weird. The bar seating had awkward stick outs in places that made the end seat unbearable. And what annoyed my absolutely the most: they were playing trash rap music with no complaints while eating breakfast. Okay sure if you like the new "rap" then you probably wouldn't have minded. But as 90's kid, this rap is pure trash. But that's not what's bad, enter sandman from the iconic band Metallica started to play. Finally some tunes worth listening to. The manager changed it. Just really hurt the ole heart. Rap is okay. But not metal. So minus a star.
