Kata Robata////The quality of ingredients and care in the execution is what sets Kata Robata apart from the rest. This was the Sashimi Bento box lunch special with sashimi slices, agadashi tofu, seaweed salad and California roll. I opted out of the chicken serving and asked for more agadashi tofu-- which is well executed and delicate with each bite. Who knew clean eating can be so yummy.
