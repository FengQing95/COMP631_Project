Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Restaurant deff lives up to it's reviews. The wait is worth it, time goes by pretty fast. The food alone is very delicious and the price is reasonable for the amount of food that is given. I myself got the Chiliquiles Benedict & my bestfriend got the Cornbeef Hash & the pancake of the day (white chocolate). Wouldn't recommend the lattes, unless you're into a strong coffee after taste!
