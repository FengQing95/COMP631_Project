The Pit Room////We drove by, on a Saturday afternoon, just before going to see Kane Brown at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, and the place seemed quite busy. We had to park a couple of blocks away and when we walked up, we saw that there a outdoor bar connected to the restaurant, called The Patio. It looks like most of the crowd was hanging out there.
