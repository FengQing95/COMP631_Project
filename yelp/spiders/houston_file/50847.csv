Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We are very indecisive brunchers, which is why Snooze's duo and combo options are so appealing. We went sweet and savory with the Benny duo (two styles of eggs benedict - Benny Goodman lox and cream cheese and Green eggs benedict), and the Pancake Flight (3 pancakes: sweet potato, blueberry Danish, and key lime). We also both got the Snooze Hot chocolate and a chai.
