Kata Robata////I've ordered off the menu only a few times, and thoroughly enjoyed those meals. However, I recently stopped looking at the menu and instead been asking for the chef's or waiter recommendations. I am so glad I started doing this. The staff always recommend items that I would never choose myself, but are amazing and "blow me away" delicious.
