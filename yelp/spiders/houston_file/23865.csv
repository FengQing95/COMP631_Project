Uchi////Despite the expensive price tag, we felt satisfyingly full at the end of dinner. We also got the fried milk dessert, which is on my top 10 list of desserts every. It had an amazing and interesting texture and the mousse cake accompanied with it, complimented the fried milk perfectly. It was a perfect end to a great night! 5/5. Would definitely recommend.
