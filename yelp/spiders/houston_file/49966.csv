Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My issue came when the food actually arrived. I looked at my Sandwich I Am and noticed there was no cheese on it. I tried to ask my server to take care of it, and she explained that the cheese was actually inside the eggs. As I made my way through the sandwich, I confirmed that there was no cheese anywhere to be found. After waiting so long to eat, I didn't want my food to disappear from my sight so I made do. Maybe the chefs are still working out the kinks with their consistency.
