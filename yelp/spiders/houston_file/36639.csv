Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Thank you for the compliment on the decor. We put a lot of hard work and time into our little restaurant. We also focused just as much time and effort into our training and our food. Our executive chef even moved 1500 miles to be here. He's very dedicated to make sure we use the highest quality ingredients.
