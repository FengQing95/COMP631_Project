JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Our group ordered a bunch of dish. I was able to pick at a little of everyone's. My significant other and I got the Tonkotsu Spicy, Tonkotsu black, Lychee Moscow Mule, Jinya bun, and crispy chicken. Their appetizers came out astonishingly fast. The Jinya bun was so good. Right about of fat for the pork belly. The pickled cucumber complemented every bite with a crisp crunch and the mayo added just the right about of creamy to the pork belly. My sister got the impossible Jinya bun and suprisingly, texture wise, you can tell it was vegan meat but the taste, i wouldve assumed it was pork. The crispy chicken was cooked perfectly, not dry but still had a good juicy taste. Their tonkotsu ramen was delicious. I LOVED the thick noodles. Honestly cannot go wrong with it. It was the right texture of chewy and absorbed so much of the broth that it was flavorful. The pork belly inside the ramen was mouth watering. The skin was barbequed perfectly that it had that bitter bbq taste and the fat melts with the meat so well. Only bummer about my ramen was that they did not include a soft boiled egg in my ramen. That's usually my favorite part but my significant other and my sister said their egg was pretty flavorful and delicious. I also got to tried my sister's takoyaki balls which were pretty delicious as well. Not too doughy, had the right amount of mayo and octopus that everything just combined so well in my mouth. I loved my moscow mule. It literally tastes like those lychee jelly cups you get at the asian market but with a carbonated kick.
