Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Cons: staff is not trained for high volume seating. Watched multiple tables stay empty for 30 min. They were quoting 1.5-2 hour waits, with a proper rotation it should have been closer to .5-1 hour. The wait was so frustrating that we almost left...but the drinks were flowing sooooooo we stayed.
