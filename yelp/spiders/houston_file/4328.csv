JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Okay. I am a HUGE ramen snob. Especially because I am a DIE HARD Tiger Den fan, and will drive there during the coldest winter months and hottest summer months waiting for a seat to filly my belly. BUT. things have changed a bit since Jinya is much closer to me, easier to get to, and open for lunch (where Tiger Den is strictly dinner). I got the Tonkotsu spicy (medium spice) and it was phenomenal.
