Kata Robata////Came here for happy hour and ordered the pork belly buns, longhorn roll, and salmon & soft shell crab roll. Was pleasantly surprised by the variety of stuffing in the buns--I originally thought it was just going to be a bit of meat in a roll, but it came with some veggies and garnishes. Longhorn roll was super delish, being topped with avocado and all. Also enjoyed the salmon & soft shell roll. Overall, excellent value for the dinner, and I will be back soon! Ambiance was lovely and service was on point.
