Baby Barnaby's////I also added a plate full of french toast, yes I was hungry!  The french toast had a strong cinnamon taste, which I love.  I also had the fresh squeezed orange juice.  The cups they use here are tiny.  But I was told by Jaire's review it is free refills.  For 2.50 a glass of OJ I better get some refills!!!
