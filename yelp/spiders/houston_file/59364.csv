Baby Barnaby's////After a Saturday night of any partying that has alcohol involved, Baby Barnaby's breakfast/brunch is one of the best ways to end the weekend. Cozy casual breakfast joint. Eggs & waffles & fruit cups OH MY! Yes, the parking sucks, the "wait" can suck sometimes, as well.. but once I finally sit at my cramped table whether it's inside or outside, im at peace :) The prices for this awesome breakfast joint are def inexpensive.
