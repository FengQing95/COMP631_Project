JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As I mentioned before, I've only eaten here for lunch and the wait has never taken so long to the point where I feel myself getting impatient or worse - hangry!! (Which of course my boyfriend can appreciate very much.) Customer service has always been great as well. The servers are knowledgable about the dishes and can recommend items based on your preferences. I mean, you could just read the menu but I like asking about the most popular dishes since most ramen places have somewhat of a speciality.
