Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Their pastries will make you a better person. Chocolate or almond croissant. Magnifique. Grab a baguette on your way out. You simply cannot get baked goods this good this side of the Atlantic. /// Their brewed coffee is quite atrocious. Why are you drinking that anyway? You've made it this far. You can't go half-euro: order an espresso. /// No wi-fi, so bring a friend or a book and leave the TPS reports at the office.
