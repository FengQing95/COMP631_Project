Local Foods////My favorite sides are the kale, cabbage slaw, and potato salad. I still need to try the quinoa and lentils, they look pretty good. (EDIT 6/23/14: Quinoa is average and apparently the lentils taste like kimchi.) Not a fan of the beets because they're noodle-like and dry. I prefer them to be cubed usually.
