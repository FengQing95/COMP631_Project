Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Definitely would recommend for a date or for a group! When I was there for brunch on Sunday, they had a DJ playing in the front which was super fun! I was with a group of 6 and I had made the reservation the day before. It would've been hard to get a table for 6 people if I hadn't made a reservation but there was always a couple of free places at the bar.
