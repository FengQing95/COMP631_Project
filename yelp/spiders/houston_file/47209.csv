Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great place for brunch, the food is good but the service is terrible, our eggs weren't even cooked to order. We didn't understand how service could be so terrible if this was a Wednesday morning. We spoke to the manager and he offered to give us something free but we didn't want anything from them, just so they could improve there staff because the atmosphere is great and the food is also.
