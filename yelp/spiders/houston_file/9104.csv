JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Came here for lunch on a weekday, and fortunately the wait was reasonable (less than 10 min). The ambience is nice; I especially like the center area with the black stones and the mirrors alongside one wall, which created a spacious feel. I ordered the Jinya Tonkotsu Black which came with crispy onions and half an egg. It was yum! The soup was a bit salty, but I still liked the ramen overall.
