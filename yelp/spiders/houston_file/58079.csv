Kata Robata////Well worth the 45 minute wait on a thursday night. Y'all, their water? So fresh haha, the water was one of my favorite things but anyway. A friend and I came here around 8:30pm. We ordered the crab and lobster ramen. Impeccable. There are minimal words to describe the experience my taste buds went through, but everything was compatible with my palette. I would also like to add that the broth was extremely savory and the garnish on top complimented the lobster/crab so well. 10/10 would recommend for those especially if you're into ramen. Best $26 i've spent on a bowl of noodles by far. I will be back.
