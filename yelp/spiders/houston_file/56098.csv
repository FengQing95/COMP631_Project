Kata Robata////Anyways, I am hoping to update this review to a 5 star in the near future.  I'm a huge sushi fanatic, and this place has got to be my favorite sushi place in Houston.   It's definitely on the pricier side, so it's not a normal place for me to visit, but I look forward to my next month-iversary dinner. :)
