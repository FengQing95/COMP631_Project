Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Ever since Common Bond started serving food, I've always felt they were all so heavy of a choice for breakfast and lunch (very heavy greasy meat and bread dishes). You're a french bakery! How about some lighter, simple daytime fare (simple french omelets with herbs?) thats not going to put me to sleep? Biscuits and gravy, fried chicken and biscuits? If I wanted that, I would've gone to House of Pies.
