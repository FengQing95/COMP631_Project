Baby Barnaby's////This place, dear lord ..I've only been here once and I've been dreaming of it ever since. I rarely eat breakfast but for this place, I might just have to start. I got the delicious green eggs I heard so much about and seriously, it was like heaven in my mouth. Also, if you're vegetarian, you can ask to get veggie sausage instead of the regular ones. That was a hugee plus for me! It even tasted like the real thing that I wonder if I was lied to ..hm. Anyways! I tried to finish as much as I could but there was just soo much and my friend and I sat there for at least 20 minutes afterwards, just rubbing our aching bellies, unable to even move. The owner was also really friendly, talking to all the customers and even came by to our table to talk to us and laugh about how silly we looked being incapacitated. Overall, a must go to place for breakfast! I will definitely be back soon! :)
