JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////He went with the Tokyo Tonkotsu ramen, while I ordered the JINYA Tonkotsu Black. We were tempted to go with one of the chicken broths, but for his first time eating ramen, it felt like it needed to be pork broth. We ended up sampling each others and both like mine more, but he was quite happy with his. I hope this is the start of him becoming a ramen fanatic, but you never forget your first!
