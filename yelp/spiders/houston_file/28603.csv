The Pit Room////Did I love this barbecue? No. But I loved the vibe of the place and staff was friendly. The food was decent; I suppose it's hard to impress me when St. Louis has some killer barbecue. But Pit Room was still good and filling. I had just a few ribs and they were decent. You gotta commit! Be salty or be sweet and sassy or be spicy! The barbecue was ok, but it didn't blow me away. I would say that it's worth the visit, but no need to come back. I know I'm in the minority here!! But it's still a fun vibe.
