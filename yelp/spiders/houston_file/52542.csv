Kata Robata////I don't understand how 3 girls combined can't figure out how to seat people. The most recent time I went, my friend of I (super simple, party of 2) walked in around 6:30 and asked how long the wait was, then literally stood like idiots for 15 minutes while the 3 girls fluttering around the screen said "Hold on" and ignored us. Mind you the restaurant wasn't even packed; there was an entire empty section (that could easily have fit a party of 10) and 2 booths empty. People who came after us ended up getting seated before us (they did not have a reservation) because it was such a disorganized clusterfuck. A nice couple who came after us told us they had called to try to make a reservation, but were told to just come in. Then they were told there was a 20 minute wait when they arrived. The hostess wasn't even apologetic at all and the couple ended up leaving in disgust. I had to approach them twice more and then they finally sat us.
