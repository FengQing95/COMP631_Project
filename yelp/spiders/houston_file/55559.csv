Kata Robata////Now on to the food, the fish is very fresh and normally I would do some salmon, salmon belly, yellow tail spicy chop scallop, sweet shrimp and if I'm feeling spoil I will do some toro or Otoro nigiri. Prices range from $3-$5 a piece, but so worth it because the cut of the fish is very generous unlike some places that charge the same for half the size.
