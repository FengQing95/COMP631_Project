The Pit Room////I wanted some good Texas/ Louisiana style sausage and theirs was okay. It was infused with other stuff like cheddar/ Jalapeno  and I just wanted traditional. I tried both varieties of sausage on the menu. However, the ribs, potato salad and okra was very good. The service was good and seating was plentiful because they had seating next door too.
