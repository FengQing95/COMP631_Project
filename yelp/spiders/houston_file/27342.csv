The Pit Room////OMG!!!  This is the best BBQ I have ever had!!!  It was lunch time and it was very quick to get through the line.  Lovely outdoor seating.  The food was outstanding.  Chard green beans were the special side for the day.  Should be an everyday side!!!  This is a place you must eat at while visiting and if you live near by, you're one lucky person!!!
