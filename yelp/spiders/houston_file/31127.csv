Local Foods////Had a fabulous dinner at the new Kirby location on Saturday night - local, free-range chicken with VEGAN mashed potatoes and grilled squash. Since I have a dairy allergy, I was thrilled about the vegan option for the mashed potatoes, so thank you! My dinner also came with a complimentary appetizer of sliced tomatoes with basil, salt, pepper, balsamic and oil. So delish! I just wish y'all would come to Clear Lake!
