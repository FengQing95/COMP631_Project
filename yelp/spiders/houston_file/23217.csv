Uchi////We did the Omakase - chef's tasting with 10 courses for three people. Everything was beyond amazing. Our chef Patrick did an excellent job taking care of us and he also talked to us a lot and made our whole dining experience even more fun. The wagyu beef on hot rock was better than the Kobe beef I had in Japan. I was looking forward to the foie gras the most and it did not disappoint at all! Every dish was so special. It was nothing like any other sushi I've ever had. A little bit of lemon zest, a slice of mandarin orange, or a sprinkle of cinnamon on top all made a difference to every dish. I just wanted to close my eyes to savor the taste of everything in my mouth every time I took a bite. We also ordered two bottles of wine because we had so many dishes and our dinner was three hours long but I did not want it to end. We got so many free dishes from the chef because we were celebrating my dad's birthday and also two $25 gift cards. Chef Patrick really is the best! I'm definitely coming back soon to use the gift cards. For people that said you can not get full from Uchi; you really can't expect to come and not want to spend money and get full. If you just want to get a meal to not be hungry then you might as well go to McDonald's. You pay for the experience and the quality of the food. And I think it was very worth it, all three of us left very satisfied and very very full. If you ever want to splurge on a dinner, Uchi is definitely the place you need to go!
