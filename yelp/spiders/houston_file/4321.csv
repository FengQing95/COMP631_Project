JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Camille - Thank you for your review and for bringing this matter to my attention. Your comments indicate our servers leveled some form of discrimination against you due to your physical disability. That is unacceptable, and I am quite frankly surprised to read this as we have NEVER in the nearly five years we have been open received such a claim. Can you give me any specific information about which staff members have "[stared] at [you] in [your] wheelchair" and "ask whomever I'm with but no me" for your order.
