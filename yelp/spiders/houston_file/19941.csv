Uchi////If this is your first visit, I would suggest asking for the original vegetarian brussel sprouts [brussel sprouts, fish caramel, lemon, and chili], we didn't see them on the menu, but when we asked afterwards if they would be back our server said that you can request them. So do yourself a favor and ask for them, they are D E L I S H! For dessert try the peanut butter semifreddo apple-miso sorbet. It is owner and chef Tyson Cole's version of PB&J according to their cookbook which has been beautifully done.
