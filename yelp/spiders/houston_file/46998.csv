Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////A really cute & cool place for lunch or brunch.  The food was good & flavorful.  There were tons of people that were working, but the service was still slow. Guess it's kind of expected since the place just opened so we'll see if they work out the kinks & get better over time.  The parking lot is tiny so expect to look for street parking.
