Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is my favorite place in the city for pastries. EVERYTHING is delicious and I know because I've had EVERYTHING!! Common Bond is a cozy and friendly spot with great food and a terrific vibe. The only beverage I've had is the lemonade and it's darn good too.
