JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Mi A. - Thank you very much for your great review. I'm glad you decided to give ramen a try! For many folks, Japanese ramen is considered "soul food." And we have lots of anecdotal evidence that folks, who were feeling a little sick, have felt better after a bowl of our ramen.
