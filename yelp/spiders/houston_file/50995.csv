Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My hubby ordered the Benny Duo, so you'll have to check his page for the review on his breakfast. Just a little note, he didn't leave much on his plate. I ordered the shrimp and grits. The homestyle cheesy grits were loaded with sautéed shrimp, andouille sausage, peppers, leeks and topped with a sunny side up egg. The dish was good. However, I wasn't feeling that egg sitting on top of my entrée. I politely removed it.
