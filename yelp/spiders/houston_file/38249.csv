Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Service was pretty good except for when they failed to boxup essentially an entire meal. They only put half of the entree in there and also left out the entirety of the green beans and fried onions. Payed 28 dollars for the meal and they boxed up 4 bites of braised beef. It's a pretty egregious mistake. It especially hurt because it was the only food that didn't have a problem.
