Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Here for happy hour I got a jack and coke for five dollars! They had other options on the happy hour menu including food so I would definitely recommend this place to someone looking for cheap drinks and good food from 3 to 6 Monday through Friday. This place also has a cool aesthetic so you can definitely get some photos and videos if you're interested in that kind of thing
