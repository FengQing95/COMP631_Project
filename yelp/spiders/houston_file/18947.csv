Uchi////** AREA & AMBIANCE: My beau and I were invited to Uchi's "Friends & Family" soft opening since we're good friends with hostess Amanda & sushi chef Huy. Being on the bustling intersection of Westheimer and Grant St., you'll kill yourself looking for street parking, so here's a tip: if you turn onto Grant St., there's a couple of open lots that are reserved by Uchi. The one directly behind the restaurant is valet only, but the lot across the street from that one is first-come-first-serve. Have at it, folks. Now, for the interior. In a word? Chill. Mellow. Homey. Completely ties in with Uchi's philosophy of "inviting friends into our home for dinner." (no, I'm not making that up - ask them!) With its small space, low ceiling, dim and sexy lights, and comfortable atmosphere, you really feel like reclining 'n unwinding after a hard day of whatever you've been doing! Uchi offers an alcohol bar, sushi bar, and several tables (I read they might even be communal?).
