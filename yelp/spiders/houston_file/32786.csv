Local Foods////I could seriously eat here every day. The menu variety is great. Everything is tasty and filling. My favorites are the banh mi sandwich and the 7-layer bar. I'm not really a coconut fan but that thing is SO good. Seating is sometimes a challenge, but you can order to go. Service is very friendly too.
