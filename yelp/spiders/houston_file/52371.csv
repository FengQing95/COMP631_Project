Kata Robata////Wow 400 reviews?? I guess I don't even really need to say anything but I've been coming here for a few years. Everything on the menu is awesome. High quality fresh fish. Lobster mac is a must and so are the kobe skewers. Bartenders really know their stuff!!! I couldn't be more impressed with this place. See yall again soon!
