JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is easily my favorite ramen place around. There are a lot of different options and add-ins, and I think my favorite things about this place are the Â facts that the soup can get pretty spicy (I have a pretty high tolerance) and that they have the option for thick noodles! The menu is expansive and has other non-ramen options as well that I really enjoy and get instead of or alongside my ramen. The ramen also isn't too sweet, which I feel is a big reason why I don't like other ramen restaurants as much. My favorite ramen dishes are the tonkatsu spicy (get it extra hot with thick noodles and fresh garlic) and the new sukiyaki ramen. I also love the pork chashu and Tokyo chicken curry. Also, I am not vegetarian myself, but Jinya offers both a vegetarian and a vegan ramen, as well as several chicken-broth based ramens, which makes it a great place to go with groups of varying dietary preferences.
