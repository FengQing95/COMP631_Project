Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Victoria and Will serviced my husband and i. Happened to be the best service I've ever had. The attentiveness and personal nature went above and beyond. It was my husbands 29th birthday. 300 whiskeys but 1 on 1 service was amazing. We randomly choose this place but so happy we did. Victoria helped us choose based on our individual experiences. We had a few flights of whiskey which was fun. Will chose a around the world based on my price. Wow we will be back. These folks have the attention to provide an experience...awesome at its simplest. Would recommend 1000%. Oh even the shrimp and grits are amazing. It isn't New Orleans with the tomatoes but. We all agreed it was done well. A must !!!!
