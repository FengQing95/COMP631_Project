Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love the sweet cherries that were buried inside. It was so yummy and sweet. If only there were more. The verrine was very heavy and flavorful. I could taste the rich chocolate in every bite. If you're a real chocolate lover then this is definitely for you, but unfortunately I'm not much of a chocolate fan; so I almost died from the chocolate overload.
