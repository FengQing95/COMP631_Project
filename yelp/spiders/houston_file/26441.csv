The Pit Room////Awesome. Great menu. Nice people. Reasonable prices. Excellent. Flaws? Too clean? Sides were top drawer. Mac n cheese great flavor. The elote is a fully dressed out street corn. Awesome. The main attraction pork ribs, excellent. No need for their tasty BBQ sauce. The table service, which technically doesn't exist, provided for prompt clearing of your plates when you finish. Don't miss the deserts as I did, I didn't know they had any until I was leaving. Funky comfortable interior. Could it be too clean?
