Uchi////I really would love to get detailed and give you a total breakdown on how awesome this place is, but there is NO CHANCE of that happening.  My dining partner and I did the Omakase meal which means that it was all Chefs choice!  Prior to coming to dine, I asked my friends what to get and they gave me a list of a billion things I was bound to forget, so who better than the chef to make those decisions for me!  Everything was spectacular.  Fresh, tasty and interesting!  The waiters were very attentive and I cannot wait to go back.
