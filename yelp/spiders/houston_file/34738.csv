Local Foods////So I read about the Crunchy Chicken sandwich online, it has made some lists.  I finally had the chance to go.  So after the gym I met up here.  I got the Crunchy Chicken and it was delicious, and much bigger than expected.  I wolfed it down with a kale salad and coucous.  But wait!  There's More!!  I was lucky enough to have first-class company during my visit here.  Not only did she have the looks, but she was down to split meals and she had the Truffled Egg Salad.  Oh Lawd, I thought the Crunchy Chicken was off the chain, but the Truffled Egg was the star of the show.  I didn't get into their brews.  They have locals!!!
