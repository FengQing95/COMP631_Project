Local Foods////This time around I had the salt and pepper roast beef sammich. The roast beef itself was good and I liked the addition of kale and curried cauliflower, though it was hard to detect over the overpowering flavor of horseradish. The house-made chips were on point as usual, but the market gai-lan was very unusual. I love Chinese broccoli as much as the next aZn, but something about the combination of that + black eyed peas, squash, zucchini, tomato seemed pell mell and not necessarily complimentary. Honestly, I probably wouldn't order that side again.
