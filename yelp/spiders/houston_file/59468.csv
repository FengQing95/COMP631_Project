Baby Barnaby's////A nice spot to get breakfast or brunch. It's location and inside give a more honey feel as opposed to being located in a busy shopping center. For what was on the menu, most plates looked appealing as being either healthy, hearty or filling. The Bob's healthy breakfast plate can facilitate in the maxim: breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper. Another plus is the freshly squeezed orange juice. Additional options to the menu could be more pleasing and enhance the experience.
