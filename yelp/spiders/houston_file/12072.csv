JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I typically get the Tonkotsu spicy with a poached egg and bamboo shoots, and it never lets me down. I wish the bamboo they used was more tender, but I love to add it nonetheless. The noodle texture is really great, just thick enough with some flexibility to it. Besides noodles, the thing that makes or breaks ramen is the broth, and I think they do a good job with it here.
