The Pit Room////It's dangerous living across the street from this!!! Their BBQ is amazing, but their Mac and cheese is TO DIE FOR! So simple and creamy... perfection! Everything on their menu is pretty killer. I usually split a 3 meat dinner plate with my boyfriend because it comes with 2 sides as well and we ask for an extra slice of bread- It's pretty filling for the both of us. It also doesn't hurt that you can grab the tray of food to-go to sit at The Patio bar next door to enjoy a good drink with it!
