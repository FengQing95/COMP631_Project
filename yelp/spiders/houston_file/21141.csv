Uchi////Been to Uchi at least 4 times maybe more. Love it! Last time we overheard the couple next to us while sitting at the sushi bar, that the dish the couple ordered the fish was frozen so they sent it back . Personally we have never experienced anything bad but for the price and the type of restaurant something like that should never, ever Â happened. So we will be careful and not order cook food or maybe try some other popular sushi restaurant next
