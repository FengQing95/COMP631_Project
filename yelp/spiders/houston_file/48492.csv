Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Finally got the chance to try this brunch restaurant in Montrose. We went around noon-1:00, so there was no wait or a crazy crowd. Parking was available on the street and a lot in front. Our waitress was very sweet and friendly and took our order. Despite coming close to closing time with no wait our food took a very long time to come out. On top of our food coming out extremely slow and being hungry the meals did not come out all at once. My boyfriend and I are in the restaurant industry so we are highly understandable when it comes to factors like this, however we had a party of 6, only 2-3 plates came out, and the following other dishes followed minutes after. Although wanting to dig into my pancakes, my main entree hadn't arrived yet and I had to wait longer for every one else's meals to come out as courtesy despite being pregnant. Nonetheless all the food followed out. We weren't fairly impressed with Snooze. My cousin's fianc√© ordered the steak and eggs and he expected more pieces or larger portion of steak. They definitely have their meals at a decent portion size where it is profitable, however seeing that my family had something to say about the sizes and comments about their meals made my decision to dine here not fairly an impressible one. They all said that they would not come back. Although our waitress was very nice, she didn't really check on our table often and all our water glasses stayed empty, for me this is a big issue. I hope that just since it is closer to closing time that they keep up the service quality from both the workers and food here up. Nonetheless my visit here was not a memorable one, I definitely do not see what the hype is about. One last comment, they have big hashbrowns that come presented as a side on most of the entrees. I did not touch mines much. I feel that they focus a bit more on the presentation of the circle shape and not the quality of the food, it should be more crispier, and focused on cooking it thoroughly, instead of a heap of soft potatoes on your plate.
