Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place had been my go-to for years now. I'm never disappointed with anything I eat here. The chocolate chip walnut cookie is the best I've ever had, the coffee and espresso is always spot-on, and the service is always great. The staff is SUPER friendly, and love talking to the customers and getting to know them. All the friends and family I've brought here love it just as much as I do. 5 stars isn't enough to give to Common Bond, and it'll be a place I visit often for many years to come.
