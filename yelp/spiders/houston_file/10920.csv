JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered tonkatsu black and the soup was pretty bland, noodles a bit soggy and the pork lacked flavor. What was nice about their ramen was that they did take their spice levels seriously! So if you like spicy ramen this is a must try. I'm not saying the food was awful but it could use a bit more flavor and seemed relatively new so they have room to improve and grow. Â
