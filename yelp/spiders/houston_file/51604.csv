Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My picks are the pancakes and the Benedicts.  The pancake of the day wasn't as good as the pineapple Pancake but it's not bad just not as impressive.  Definitely ask for the syrup to go w the pancakes.  They might give you a tiny one but I like to drown mine so definitely ask for two if you are a syrup lover.
