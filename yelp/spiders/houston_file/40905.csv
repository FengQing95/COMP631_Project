Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Okay, so when I tasted my shrimp & grits; my first reaction was like why is this tomato sauce so acidic & salty? And then when I took a few more bites I started to get a heartburn. At the same time the grits were thick and I'm not a fan of that, I like mine to be a bit creamy. In addition, my shrimps were small & for a $24 dish I expected the shrimp to be bigger. My server came to check on us and she can see the dissatisfaction on my face, so she asked me if I wanted something else. I told her no because I'm not one of those hard to please customers, she responded by saying "I want to make your experience worth coming back" that right there is the reason why I am giving this place a 5 star, so y'all thank her for that.
