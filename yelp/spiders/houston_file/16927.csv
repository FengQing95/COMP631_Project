JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////After about 10 minutes the drinks came over. Not sure why it took so long but they were busy and didn't look like they were really distancing which was a little bit of a concern but OK. 15 more minutes go by and we have no faith Ramen. My grandson's food came over pretty quickly and he was happy except for his Ramen. The server came by about 10 minutes later, we have been here for 25 minutes now, and explained that he wasn't sure where the Ramen was and would go check. 10 minutes later he came by surprise that we still have not received it he would go check. You see a pattern here. After being seated for 45 minutes we did indeed get our Ramen. It was delicious, but the crazy wait time made us decide not to go here again if ever in Houston. Maybe it was a bad night but it did look like staff was running around like they're crazy
