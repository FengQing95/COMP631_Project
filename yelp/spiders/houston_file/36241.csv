Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////In for brunch as recommended by Culture Map. Not my first time to a DJ'ed brunch but perhaps I'm now too old, or the music was too loud, or some combination of the two. At any rate, I found it difficult to speak to the person next to me. That said, the music was good--nice mix. The restaurant was drafty on a cold day, and the service was a bit slow. The rest is good--very cool interior design, lots of TVs in view from most every table, unique (very private) restrooms, terrific menu (hard to pick just one). They also have a tremendous libation game.
