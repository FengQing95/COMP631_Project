JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I guess I'm just not on the ramen bandwagon. I ordered the Jinya No3 "Cha Cha Cha" for garlic lovers. It just didn't wow me. It's not bad, but I think I just prefer pho, bun bo hue, or banh canh over ramen noodles. There are obviously a lot of people who love this place, but it just doesn't hit the spot for me. However, my boyfriend chose the No1 Tonkatsu black and there was nothing left in his bowl, and he finished my barely eaten bowl as well.
