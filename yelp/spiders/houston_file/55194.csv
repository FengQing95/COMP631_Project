Kata Robata////Just absolutely perfect. Took my husband here for his 30th bday and everything we ordered just melts on your toungue. It was pure gluttony. The stand outs were the 72 hour slow cooked kobe beef skewer, the foie gras over scallop,  and lobster mac and cheese. Excellent food and service to match!  Can't go wrong here.
