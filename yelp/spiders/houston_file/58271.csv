Kata Robata////3. Miso Marinated Black Cod (3/5; grilled miso-marinated Alaskan black cod): You typically cannot go wrong with the Miso black cod, but this one was slightly disappointing. The fish did not seem as fresh as other similar dishes I've tried, and it did not have that melt-in-my-mouth sensation. In addition, it seemed like there was teriyaki sauce at the centerpiece of plate, under the black cod.
