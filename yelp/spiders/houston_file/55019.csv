Kata Robata////Big, big rating. I know. I mean, who gives 5 stars?  So today isn't my first time eating at Kata and it's not even my fifth time. It's more like my 10th time. And whether we come for lunch or for dinner on a busy night one thing is for sure..... it's consistently good. Really good. In fact, Kata is the reason I rate other sushi places less than average.  But one things is for sure ... the food is always on point and the service has never let us down. It's consistently good. The staff is attentive, timely and friendly. You should expect to to wait on busy evening if you haven't made a reservation so plan ahead.
