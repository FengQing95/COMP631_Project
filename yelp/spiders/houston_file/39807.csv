Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We had an absolutely fantastic meal for brunch at Bosscat over the weekend.  The atmosphere was very trendy, vibe felt good, music was on.  We arrived just after 11 on Sunday, and quickly got a seat.  By the time we left, the place was packed, and a reservation would likely be nice, although it does appear to have a fair amount of seating.
