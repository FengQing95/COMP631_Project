Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is exceptional. They have some really great chocolate chip cookies and macaroons. All the food here looks really beautiful. The staff is really helpful and gives thoughtful-ish suggestions if you are feeling overwhelmed with the display. It's a little weird that the food is exposed because you can see every little fly that decides to land on the pastries. I came on a Saturday afternoon and it was kinda hard to find parking. Other than that, this place is a solid option if you don't mind spending $3-5 on a pastry. It was really clean and despite how it looked, quite organized.
