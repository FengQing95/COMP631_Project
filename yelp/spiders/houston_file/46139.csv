Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Went here for brunch and would definitely go back! We ordered the lox tartine and chef's scramble and ate every bite. Only downside was our coffee orders were wrong but they were super busy on a Sunday morning. They keep the tables distanced and it seemed pretty clean.
