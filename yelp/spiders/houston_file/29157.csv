The Pit Room////Wow this place was Incredible! We were stopping in Houston for just one night and we decided we wanted to try some barbecue. When in Rome! Glad we landed on this place. As soon as you step in the door, it smells like heaven. Even though they were super busy (on a Thursday night) the host seated us very quickly when they found we were from out of town. Our waiter was very helpful and suggested his favorites since we aren't from the area. I got the brisket (which is award winning) and cleaned the plate. It was the best thing i've eaten.We all left with our stomachs full.
