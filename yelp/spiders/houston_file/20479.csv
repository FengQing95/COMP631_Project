Uchi////I was quite unimpressed with the Uchiviche. It's low in citrus and high in spice. The Walu walu, which is a 3x2 sq in of fish, is difficult to eat with chopsticks and the (soy?) sauce ruins it. The shag is good but the outer fried bit overpowers the sushi taste. Also, just fyi, its heavy in lactose. =l The service is pretty good other than their tendency to not make sense when talking to you. Each of those dishes were $6 during HH. Also, we got an uchi salad on the house. The dressing dip is really good.
