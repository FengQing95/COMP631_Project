JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jeffery, Thanks for the 5-star review! This has got to be one of our favorite reviews to date. I doubt the surgeon general would sign off on the curative powers of a bowl of ramen, though I would say there's enough anecdotal evidence out there that a hot bowl of soup can do the body some good. I'm additionally pleased that our servers attended you and your party well, and that you are understanding of the somewhat poorly worded contest being held by JINYA corporate. Thanks again, and we look forward to serving you in the future.
