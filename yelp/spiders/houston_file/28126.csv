The Pit Room////One of my top 5 best BBQ spots in Houston. They also sell bbq for dinner! It's a big plus because most BBQ places only serve lunch as it's first come first serve until we run out kinda deal. Their brisket is great but can sometimes be inconsistent. I've been one or two times where the meat is ultra dry or ultra fatty. But 6/7 times it hits the spot. YOU HAVE to try the sauteed okra!!! If they don't have okra, the beans are almost as good too. Jalapeno sausage is good but also can be dry at times. But overall I have The Pit Room in my monthly rotation of joints I like to visit regularly.
