Uchi////7. Brie Ringo: This one fell a little short on flavor and execution. The brie was a bit too large, the apple chutney and julienned apple were too few, and the sweet potato chips weren't crispy. However, I've had this dish multiple times and it was fantastic, so this time was just an exception.
