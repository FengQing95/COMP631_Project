Baby Barnaby's////I'm not really sure why this place gets such high reviews. This is actually my second time eating here, obviously the first time was not memorable either as when I looked on yelp for a place to eat the name didn't ring a bell. The food is passable, potatoes are very good and crispy but nothing really stands out here. The corned beef was on the dry / burnt side and the huevos rancheros were nothing special. The crowd is all lower 20s, so maybe that explains the high ratings.
