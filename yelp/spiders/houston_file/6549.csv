JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is my favorite ramen bar in Houston (only the downtown location, others have been lackluster). The spicy chicken ramen has just the right amount of spice and he flavors are magical. Most of the extra add on options are all delicious and the fried chicken piece appetizer is divine.
