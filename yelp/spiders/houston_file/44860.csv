Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////For mornings, I also like to get the soft scramble and share with a friends, sometimes with a full baguette purchased on the side so I can really enjoy all that scramble deliciousness. for a hipster place, this place is pretty packed. sometimes to a point that I feel you can't really sit there long. Maybe just for a meet-up with a friend, but studying or excessive time spent here is hard. It's pretty bustling at all times.
