Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love places like this for brunch. A short brunch menu visiting of less than 10 items ranging from seafood and real brunch food to even a handful of vegetarian options (for my gf). Everything else is showcased right before your eyes with just the right amount of options without overwhelming you. I ordered the seafood remoulade salad and my gf ordered the fried green tomatoes (with a poached egg).
