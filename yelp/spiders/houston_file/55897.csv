Kata Robata////My parents ordered the beef skewers, which I had to eat one. These are melt in your mouth beef. Seriously, one of my favorite things here in this restaurant. They also ordered the spicy soy ramen which was full of flavor and the noodles were cooked perfectly. They also ordered a ton of other stuff which I didn't really try because of the omakase, but everything looked delicious...
