JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The menu is simple and easy to understand as some of the popular ramen of theirs will have a picture along with detailed description on what's actually in it. Then there's also the "upgrade" option by paying additional money for an appetizer, a salad, or a small size curry rice. Again, I have already mentioned that this place is the most consistent and that's a big step up from all other competitions here in Houston. I'm not saying their noodle or the broth is the best but it's good enough. I have tried quite a few of their popular choice and it's not bad, but not the best I've had. So this is definitely a good place to take your friends to for first time trying ramen.
