Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////It was me and my friends first time trying Bosscat's and we all truly enjoyed it. The atmosphere was young , modern & enjoyable. Terry and Jose gave us excellent service. I order the potbelly tacos and they were delicious. We also had bottomless mimosas and left tipsy and satisfied. I will definitely be back again :).
