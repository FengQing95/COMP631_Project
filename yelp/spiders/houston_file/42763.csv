Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First of all, the pastry is out of this world!  However, I also ordered an egg sandwich, which they used a poach egg rather than a cooked egg.  I told them at the counter that I don't eat poach eggs and they told me that it would be done thoroughly.  When they brought it to the table, it was not what I asked for.  When I said something, their response was, "This is how we cook it and we don't make changes.".  I told them to take it back.  The manager came out and gave our meal to us for free as well as giving us something else to try.  She truly tried to recover from the server interaction.  I asked her why she won't make changes and she told me that there kitchen is too small and they pre-cook the eggs.
