Baby Barnaby's////After waiting about 40 minutes, we were seated. There is already a pitcher of water on the table when you arrive, no need to wait for a beverage or refills if you prefer water. Our orders were taken very swiftly. The menu seems pretty small, but there appears to be an option for anything you coukd crave. I ordered the Breakfast Tacos while my boyfriend got the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs.
