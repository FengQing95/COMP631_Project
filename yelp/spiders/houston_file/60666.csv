Baby Barnaby's////When coming here, know that you have to write your name on a list hanging on the post outside, and wait-times can be very long depending on the size of your group (not an issue, just plan for it).  And parking is never fun, so I suggest riding together with your party or taking an uber or something.  Its a fun, dog friendly environment with indoor and outdoor seating.
