JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been wanting to try this and when I finally had the chance, it didn't disappoint! I have my days where I crave ramen and this place really fills that cravings. I always get tonkotsu, it's my go-to order! For sides, I usually have Â edamame, crispy chicken and takoyaki. The combination might be weird to others but the flavor does it for me. I love coming here! The atmosphere is really nice and very aesthetic! The food will make you full because it is serve in large portions, to me at least.
