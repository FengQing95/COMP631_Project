Local Foods////I can't remember everything we had but a few things to note. The sandwiches, while very delicious, are a bit messy to eat. Needed lots of napkins for sure. I had the duck confit and hubby had the crunchy chicken. I think I preferred the crunchy chicken. The sides were okay, very healthy. Hubs got a soup, again he got the better pick haha. Kind of wish I tried the truffled egg salad but who knows, maybe next time we're in Houston! :)
