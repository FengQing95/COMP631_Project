Uchi////I absolutely love uchi and it's somewhat of a hidden gem for me. The food and service is amazing but if you do get seated at the bar just be cautious of the time it may take to prepare your food. It tends to take a little longer which isn't so much of a problem for me but for others it might. Â A tip all add is to make reservations as soon as possible do to the limited amount of seating here. Valet is free down the street and not far of a walk. Do also be mindful of panhandling outside the building.
