Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Come here for the croissants...I say this because every order I've gotten from the lunch menu has been a disappointment. It's like they try too hard and end up mushing a whole bunch of unnecessary ingredients together. Believe me Common Bond, adding a few slices of pickles on the side is not going to save your entr√©e. First, focus on baking enough croissants to last longer than rush hour because you're frustrating the people who have to work on a schedule for a living.
