Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I went to Bosscat for the first time . I went by myself to grab something to eat and drink at the bar . I had such a good time mainly because of Carissa was such a great bartender and talked with me and made me feel so Welcome. What a great place to hang out. I will come back many times.
