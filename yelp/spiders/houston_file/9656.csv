JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First time trying out JINYA. We ordered the caramelized cauliflower and takoyaki, which I highly recommend. I was excited to try their ramen (JINYA tonkotsu black) but was a bit disappointed. I haven't come across any ramen bars in Houston that beat Wabi House (my favorite) in Dallas. I also found a hair in my ramen close to being done with my ramen. BUMMER. Service was exceptional and atmosphere is chill.
