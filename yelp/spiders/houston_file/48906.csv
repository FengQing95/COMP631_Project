Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Put down our name for a party of two and was quoted a wait time of 20 minutes that came and went; later the hostess asks why we haven't been seated yet.....???? and turns out their automated system seems to have skipped us or something. i also noticed this happened to several other people before us as well. hopefully they get that fixed soon, because we definitely waited at least 45 minutes for our table (which happened to be the worst seat in the establishment, right behind the kitchen doors in a corner shoved behind the waiter's station). I understand the restaurant was busy, but it took us another 15 minutes to get some water. After waiting in a crowded front part of the restaurant after all the cups are gone from the complimentary coffee bar, we were definitely thirsty.
