Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is just mid in my opinion. Everything is really over priced (I guess expected from a location close to downtown). Macarons are $3 each but they're so tiny, you can get better quality macs at an actual macaron shop and they cost less too! Coffee is okay here, nothing life changing. I got a Panini for $12. It was good and a decent size. Overall I wouldn't really come again unless i'm in the area and wanted something quick to eat like the pastries!
