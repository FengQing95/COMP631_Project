Local Foods////Ordering is at the counter, and you can see the variety of salads in the display case at the front. The menu is straight-forward, but flexible. If you order a sandwich, you have the option of choosing two of 7 sides or a cup of soup. You can also make a sandwich a salad, which I've never done, since the bread is so good. The sides are fantastic, and you have the option of choosing 3 for $11.
