Uchi////Oh, Uchi. Just delicious and a great experience. I've only heard great things but had to try it for myself. I walked in expecting a whole boat load of sushi and walked out full of so many delicious japanese dishes (and a little sushi too). Our waiter was excited about the food which is such a great asset to a restaurant like this.
