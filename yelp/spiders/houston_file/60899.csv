Baby Barnaby's////I went here on a whim a few weeks ago and I was pleasantly surprised! They allow dogs on the patio, which I loved and they were really accommodating of our bigger dog. The wait seemed long at first but it moved pretty quickly. The waiter was friendly and helpful. Not only did our food come out quickly, but the portions were huge and it was delicious! This is a solid spot for a good brunch. It's more of a casual brunch for sure, nothing too fancy or over the top.
