The Pit Room////This place is a must try, this is my 2nd BBQ joint trying since moving to Houston and yes they are in first place. The brisket was soooooooooo tender that is melted like butter in my mouth. The sides of beans and potato salad was also delish and complemented by DE tastiest BBQ SAUCE.
