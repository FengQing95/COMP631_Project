Local Foods////Became adventurous today and tried the falafel sandwich and thought the flavors and hint of spice was tasty. The boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich and i got to try some and that was delicious too. He had chips and cabbage slaw as his sides while I stuck to my kale and quinoa sides. The chips were strong and a tad greasy tasting but it went well with the pulled pork. The cabbage slaw was a surprise. I was expecting it to taste similar to coleslaw but it was more flavorful and yummy.
