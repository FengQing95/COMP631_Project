Kata Robata////I'd heard good things about this place and was eager to tear into the menu.  I ordered the Tempura Shrimp Bento, and was pleasantly surprised by the amount of food.  The shrimp was sweet and crunchy with a side of chicken teriyaki.  A good value @ $12 for the amount and quality of  food.
