JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Saturday night dinner date with a friend. This was my first time coming to this spot and the ambience was pretty cool. The service was quick and the food was yummy. I'm not an expert on ramen but I thought it was on point. Oh and the bamboo extras that we got for our ramen omg I could of just ate only that all night it was so good. I loved the flavors.
