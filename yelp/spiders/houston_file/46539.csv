Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The cafe is cute and we'd eaten there before - sandwiches, patisserie, etc are all excellent. But it's the cake that Kim and the artists made that really blew me away. I had a pretty simple description: please make a delicious, veggie garden themed cake for my dad's birthday. Wow did they deliver. The cake is delicious and the decor absolutely spectacular from every angle. So very happy. Thanks!
