Kata Robata////My son chose this restaurant to celebrate his birthday.  When I made the reservations I mentioned that we were celebrating.  The chef sent over a delicious appetizer, which was very nice.  Every dish was delicious!   From the minute we walked in their doors until we said good night it was an amazing dining experience.   Thank you for making his 23rd birthday celebration wonderful!
