Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Regarding your cocktails that evening, I apologize if we failed to impress you. Our goal is to always make well balanced cocktails with a story behind each one. Our bar director and bar team spend a tremendous amount of time creating and crafting a drink list that has something for everyone. We also want to make sure we don't short pour our guests. It's our company policy to pour a full 2oz of liquor in every drink we make. Whereas most establishments only pour a standard 1.5oz. My point is we always want to make sure we keep your needs and wants top of mind when making decisions.
