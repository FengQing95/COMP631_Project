Uchi////My two friends and I ordered a variety of dishes, some from the Happy Hour menu and some from the regular menu (HIGHLY recommend coming from 5-6:30 to take advantage of those cheap Happy Hour prices!) Of the dishes we ordered, there were in my opinion really only two standouts: the hot rock and the fried milk. The fried milk was the clear winner of the night - get it without a doubt if you come here! I'd never had hot rock before so I was intrigued by the concept, but my friends said they've had better elsewhere. I also liked the machi cure, and it's certainly worth its $6 happy hour price, but I don't think I would go so far as to praise it as one of Houston's best dishes.
