Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We waited ~35 mins on a Sunday morning around 9a. It was definitely worth that wait, but I don't know that I would wait 2+ hours as I saw in some of the reviews. Our food was delicious though! Just a traditional breakfast for me, my husband had a corned beef hash, and we shared some pancakes. Everything was quite good, although the pancakes were a little sweet for my taste. Next time I'd just get basic ones over the bourbon ones. Our server was AWESOME!! Super friendly and on top of her game!
