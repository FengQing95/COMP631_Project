Local Foods////First, I must mention I do not usually do any chicken/tuna/egg salads anywhere because I dislike condiments (mayo, mustard, ketchup) and LOATHE celery.  I took a chance though on the truffled egg salad because I love truffle, I love eggs, and I definitely love pretzel rolls!  Yelpers did not do me wrong.  It was mouthful after mouthful of heaven.  On the side, I got the cucumber-hominy-jicama-cilantro and the beets with wheatberries.  My mom got the crispy chicken sandwich with kale (amazing!) and the cabbage slaw.
