Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////As you walk in, two cops ask for your ID instead of bouncers which was a first for me...kinda weird. In general, I'm not a fan of cops who hang out at bars/restaurants. It kinda makes me feel like if I were a teenager and I was hanging out with my buddies and my mom was standing in the corner staring at us the entire time. That may just be me though! The bar itself is pretty spectacular with a chic interior and a central bar along with some seating towards the back and edges.
