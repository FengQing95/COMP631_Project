Local Foods////6. Sides/Soups - These are all kind of an after thought for me, the main star of this place is the sandwiches. I prefer the soups to the sides, I guess I am just not healthy enough to get down with all the kale, quinoa, barley etc. If that's your kind of thing, then you will love the sides.
