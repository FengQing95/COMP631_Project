The Pit Room////I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of BBQ they have here.  A bit overpriced in my opinion for a dinner plate of 2 meats (Around $17-$18?).  Asked for extra fatty brisket, and they knew what they were doing when they flipped the hunk of meat to cut me some heartypieces of the point/deckle for me.  Their sides were mediocre, same as you would find anywhere.
