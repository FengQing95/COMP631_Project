Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Our server was Bree. I was pretty unhappy with her level of service. My husband has a pretty severe lactose intolerance and one of our friends has a life threatening allergy to uncooked vegetables, uncooked garnishes, and nut products. While ordering, my husband wanted to try the bosscat burger chef's style, but she gave push back when he asked no cheese due to a food allergy stating she'll have to ask the chef if it's ok. What? Then my friend wants to order the pulled pork sandwich, no coleslaw (so she doesn't die at the table), and same story -- I'll have to ask the chef if he'll accommodate. This put me off so bad and ruined the vibe heavily for me. They did end up accommodating it thankfully, but the process really bothered me, like we had to permission.
