Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went to Bosscat last night with my boyfriend. Had a reservation for 8:45. We arrived around 15 minutes early so there was a wait....no big deal but we should have taken that as a sign. We were finally seated 10 to 15 minutes after our reservation time. Our waitress was Marissa. She was lack luster to say the least. More concerned with her large table than making sure we had what we needed. We got water with no straws and had to ask twice before receiving them, although she brought them out immediately for her other tables (I watched). After the food arrived she only came back once to check on us which was when we were almost done eat the unseasoned food. We had to ask the person filling our water for the tab. I guess she told Marissa who eventually brought it without asking how our dinner was. She just dropped the ticket and walked away. Usually a great tipper, well over 20% standard but on this occasion she definitely was getting the same tip as the service she provided. I highly doubt I will ever be back!
