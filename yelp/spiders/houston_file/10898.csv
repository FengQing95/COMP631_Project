JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So-so ramen not worth the lines or the hype. So one night I decided to meet my wife and 2yo son after work here for dinner. They got here first. Even though it was not crowded at all, the uppity hostess refused to seat them until I arrived, even though my son was crying and upset from hunger; I show up a few minutes later to a screaming toddler. We could have been seated immediately once I arrived, but screw that. We went next door at Piola where they've always treated us right and will ever return. Shame because the kids meal is a good deal, but it I'll go to Tatsu-Ya nearby every day of the week and twice on Sundays for much better ramen and much friendlier staff. Or heck I'll go next door to Piola for pizza.
