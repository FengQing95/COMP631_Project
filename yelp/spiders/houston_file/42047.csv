Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Visited here for the first time on Friday afternoon. When you walk in, it's bright and fresh feeling. We didn't encounter any lines. The parking was a bit tough and we parked on the street. However, a couple who shared the common table with us were extremely put off by a manager they saw in the parking lot asking for cars to be towed because "they were outside the white line." They vowed never to return again because the manager never bothered to come in to ask whose vehicle it was and give them an opportunity to move it before being towed away.
