JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jasmine - Thank you very much for the stars. We greatly appreciate it. Also, we will have a word with our hired security staff. I'm not sure why you were made to feel any way besides comfortable in our house. For future reference, never hesitate to inform an employee if there is any issue with any aspect of our business. We appreciate your understanding, and we look forward to serving you again soon!
