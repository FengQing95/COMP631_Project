Baby Barnaby's////Attempted to use a delivery service to pick up a to-go order at this location.  The kitchen prepared the food because they accept to-go orders, but refused to give it to the delivery driver.  The restaurant told me that I could come in myself to pick it up.  I tried to get to the bottom of this seemingly ridiculous policy and the manager, Scott, was unable to articulate any viable reason for this policy.
