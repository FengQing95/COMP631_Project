The Pit Room////Outstanding BBQ!  I had the Brisket and Pork Ribs. The meat was moist and tender with great flavor and excellent bark on the Brisket. Potato salad was also great as were the beans. Line was 6 deep and went very quickly.  Only negative is that the seating is not very comfortable but I'll trade that for outstanding BBQ any day. Price is a few dollars higher for a 2 meat plate compared to other BBQ restaurants but well worth it for the quality and taste. I will definitely be back!
