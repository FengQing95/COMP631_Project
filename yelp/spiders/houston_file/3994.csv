JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi EJ A.- Thank you very much for the 5-star review. We greatly appreciate it. And thank you for understanding our extended wait times during peak hours. We will be opening more locations in the coming year, so hopefully this will mitigate some of the crowds at Midtown. We'll see! Thanks again.
