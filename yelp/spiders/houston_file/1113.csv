JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm sorry to hear of your experience at Jinya tonight.  Your server violated company policy by not writing down and repeating your order back to you.  It's the first thing we teach when we train our servers.  I will not tolerate this and want to know which server served you tonight.  Since opening on March 16th, we haven't had complaints about servers not writing down their orders.  It's simply unacceptable.  It's too easy to make mistakes when orders aren't written down.  Would you mind looking at your receipt and letting me know the server's name?  I need to have a serious one-on-one talk with this person.  If she is unwilling to change or correct this behavior, then she will not be working for Jinya Ramen Bar.  Once again, my apologies and will get to the bottom of this.
