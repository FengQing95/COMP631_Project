Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was thrilled when I got a chance to try a new breakfast place. While Snooze isn't on my rotation of must-eats, I really liked my meal and coffee, and our waitress was funny, friendly and on her game. The only let-down for me were the hash browns; they were presented in fancy looking rounds but they didn't have much flavor and they could have stood to be thinner and cooked until they were actual, y'know, hash BROWNS. But I would definitely go back and I would recommend their flight of eggs benedicts.
