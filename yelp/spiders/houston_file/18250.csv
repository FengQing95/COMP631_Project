Uchi////Sure, it's pricey - but where else does each bite feel like a flavor extravaganza and I get to channel my inner Top Chef Judge. Totally agree with the suggestion to avoid the sushi rolls, I didn't find them as spectacular as the other small plate items. The service was stellar! Why bother with parking, if you're coming here you're gonna be spending some money on food anyways so just valet it people - save yourself the stress.
