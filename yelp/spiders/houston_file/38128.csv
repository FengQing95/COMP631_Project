Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Terry was an excellent server! The atmosphere was excellent, great chill vibes for summer nights. There's a large variety of whiskeys to choose from. I ordered the 12 hour braised beef ribs with scalloped potatoes. Thick, rich sauce covering the ribs. Overall, i would definitely come back to this location.
