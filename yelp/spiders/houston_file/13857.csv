JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First time eating in at the place. I called in just to make sure if there wasn't a big line since I know it's popular spot. The phone was answered quickly and in such a nice manner. Costumer service was amazing! I ordered the Spicy Chicken Ramen and it was was AMAZING! Highly recommend to get the chocolate mochi ice cream to hit all the right spots.
