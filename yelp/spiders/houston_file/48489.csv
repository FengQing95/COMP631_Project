Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!!!!! I got Juan's breakfast tacos... holy crap. So GOOD. Everything was fresh, tasted excellent and looked just as great. Super cute and trendy spot. Everyone was super kind and helpful and efficient. If you are between this spot and somewhere closer or with better pictures or something.... trust me, go to Snooze. It's amazing. So many interesting choices and you can add or take away ingredients. Our waiter was super cool too. My husband (pictured slaying bacon) and I are in town for the day and took our time choosing a place to eat breakfast and we went with our gut.... we were right. Thanks Snooze!
