Baby Barnaby's////The menu is short and to the point.  No frills here and also no shortage of flavor.  Whatever your breakfast indulgence (or health consciousness) may be, they have an option for you.  The coffee is tasty (Fontana) and the fresh squeezed oj is, well fresh sqeezed.  The oj machine is pretty awesome.
