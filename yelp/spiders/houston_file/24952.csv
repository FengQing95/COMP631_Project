Uchi////Happy hour was a glorious way to take the training wheels off without sinking our wallet boat. The unfiltered sake spilled over the side of my cedar box and on to the two desserts we were rewarded with. Hidden blueberries peeking through a soft peep hole of moist sponge, starring at a naked lime sorbet crumbled in nutty treasures. Milky dark chocolate sheets chatter and fall from the sky, splattering slowly onto my pallet like a silk pillowcase sliding across a bed.
