JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food was the biggest disappointment ever! When I think of a good bowl of ramen consists of there things: good tasty flavorful broth, perfectly cooked noodles and a perfectly cooked egg. However the ramen I got had a very weak broth, because of the Brussels sprouts it really ruined the both taste. The noodles were okay, but the EGG. Omg the egg was the worst thing ever. It tasted like someone just hard boiled an egg and then slapped some soy sauce on it. I can make a wayyy better egg than that. I expected a standardized ramen egg to have good seasoning and the inside yolk to be perfectly cook - kinda soft but NOT HARD BOILED which is what I got!!
