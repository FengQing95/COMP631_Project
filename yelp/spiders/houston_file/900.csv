JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your kind review of JINYA. I'm glad you enjoyed the Tonkotsu Black. However, I have spoken to the servers about mishandling the ramen bowls as you have described. I fear this was an instance of rushing service to meet quantity over quality. Please know we are working hard to fix these missteps. Also, please never hesitate to bring these matters to our floor managers' attention. I promise they will make it right for you immediately.
