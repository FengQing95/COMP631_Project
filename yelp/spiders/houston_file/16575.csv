JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the spicy tonkotsu ramen and loved every bite of it. The portion is decently big and they hit the perfect spice level. It doesn't come with an egg so I always ask for one on top. They also have some extra sauces available at your table - adding the chili oil to your ramen gives it a great kick! My friends and I also shared the gyoza appetizer. I personally thought it was just ok - not bad at all, but nothing special.
