Baby Barnaby's////Everything I've ever eaten at Baby Barnaby's is fantastic.  The portions are plenty big enough to share, the ingredients are fresh, and the service is friendly.  Although the patio is small and it's right next to noisy traffic, it's still a great place to sit on a sunny day.  Make sure to get there before the crowd, though, because they're always a wait.
