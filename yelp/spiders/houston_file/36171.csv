Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Good food and cool decor but won't come back again because of how loud it was. We could not hear the person next to or in front of us because of the loud club music they blasted throughout the restaurant. That may be for some people but it wasn't for us; we actually wanted to talk to each other!
