JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First time in this location...I usually go to the Holzwarth location in Spring. I must say, this location is extremely busy! Lots of young crowd...young adults in their early 20's. If you don't like younger crowds and noises, don't come here. Â Food was great. I got the sprouted ramen, which a recommendation on the menu...wished I could've ordered more mushrooms..oh well, nonetheless, it was excellent!
