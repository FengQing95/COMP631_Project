JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We waited for half an hour on a rainy Monday night, yes, Monday! To be honest, even I was hungry at the time I still think it was underwhelmed. I had the premium (mix of chicken and pork broth) and my mom had the Tonkotsu (pork broth only) because I know the ramen pork broth is usually salty. We were happy at first, though, the broth tastes pretty good the first few spoons but then it gets saltier and saltier until I feel like my tongue got numb and can't keep on then I only try to finish the noodle, my mom had to pour in a bit of water into her bowl to make it less salty haha So I would recommend the full chicken or veggie broth to anyone who doesn't need a sodium boost after a bowl of ramen.
