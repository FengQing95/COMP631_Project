Local Foods////My wife ordered the Gulf crab and shrimp sandwich, while I had the Truffle egg salad sandwich. Both sandwiches, IMO, were rather bland. They definitely could have used a bit of seasoning - if nothing else salt and pepper. Her sandwich would have been much better served hot than cold. Mine could have used some chives or shallots. Both sandwiches also came with uninspired sides. My wife got the Quinoa and I got the Tuscan Kale. We both took a bite of the sides and pushed them away. Fancy names don't always translate to flavor.
