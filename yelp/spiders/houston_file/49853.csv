Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is probably my favorite breakfast place in the World! Before I ever came here, I hated pancakes. Blueberry, Strawberry or any type of pancake was yuck. So then I came here, they didn't have waffles so I got a pancake. I was just getting prepared to have the worst pancake ever. I ordered a Blueberry Pancake AND IT WAS AMAZING! My mouth was bursting with flavor and ate it in about a minute. Their sausage was also amazing and so was their bacon.
