JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm really glad there's a convenient ramen place in this area. It's not the best ramen I've had, but it's a solid choice, and I'll continue to come here. I especially love that it's open until 2am on Saturdays because we can always use some more late night "snack" options at night.
