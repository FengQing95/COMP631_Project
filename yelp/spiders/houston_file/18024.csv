Uchi////We love this place, it's one of our go-tos for great, imaginative, and fresh sushi and kitchen menu items. If you can, sit at the sushi bar at least once (it helps to arrive before they open AND have reservations) and do NOT be afraid to interact with your sushi chef, it is highly encouraged by all the staff, and he or she will be your best guide to what's fun and fresh on the menu that night. Dishes change often, so it's worth going back again and again, and while the experience is first class, the price is incredibly reasonable, especially if you arrive for happy hour. It's true that most nights you need to wait on a short line if you want to get in when they open, but it's always worth it!
