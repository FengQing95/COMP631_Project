JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston//// We eat alot of ramen all over the United States and this ranks pretty low on our list. Also we found the yelling back and forth from host to cooks to be a bit cheesy . I know they are trying to make the atmosphere fun but it gets old about 30 minutes into it. Â  And no, we are not old people. I think this place is busy because it's a hot spot for young 20 something year old groups when they go out and it feeds off of the success of restaurants next to it.
