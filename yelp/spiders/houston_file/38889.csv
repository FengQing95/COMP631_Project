Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My Anticipation to visit this famous brunch spot was high this Sunday afternoon. As my guy and I walked in, we were told the wait was about 15-20 mins. We ordered mimosa and orange for our first beverage choice, as well as the "Totchos" which were AMAZING I could've done without the egg on top, but this app was a delight!
