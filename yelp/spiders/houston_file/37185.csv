Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This is my first time eating here and my experience overall was good. I was STOKED that they serve "real" dr.pepper. We had the meatloaf squares which were amazing!! I ordered the Cajun brick chicken. The flavors were out of this world.. the only complaint I have is the rice was so greasy. Like dropping off my fork. They wait staff here are all very friendly and they even offered to give me something else to eat. The sweet girl that was taking care of us even got us RED BELVET CHURROS on her. I will definitely be coming back to try the other things on the menu.
