Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have been to Common Bond several times. It's in my neighborhood, and I really want to like it, but ... Today, it was very busy (Sat lunchtime), and I had to wait quite a while, but I stuck it out since people have said it is beter than it used to be. I got the Chef's Scramble and coffee, $25 for breakfast. The eggs were a bit overcooked. I thought they gave me a brownie which turned out to be a very over-browned hash brown square, and my usual favorite, the biscuits were over crisp and falling apart. I could not spread jam on them because they just crumbled when I tried. Everything tasted good, but was just so so for the price. I do love their croissants and fresh loaves of bread, especially the sprouted sourdough. Finally, though, they have a few more options for vegetarians, and that's a good change from their previous attitude of "no substitutions."
