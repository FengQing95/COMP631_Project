JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Discover this spot 2 days ago when I was craving chicken ramen! Ramen tasted amazing, started with caramelized cauliflower and octopus balls, and both had ramens! Service was quick and knowledgeable. Place got busy quickly (which I am glad that this place doing good during pandemic). Will definitely come back.
