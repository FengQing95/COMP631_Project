Kata Robata////Update: this place got even better wow. I went there for New Years dinner and it was absolutely amazing. We went all out for this dinner and it did not disappoint. My favorite new dish there (but to be frank, you can only really handle eating one of this because it's so rich) is the salmon+quail egg+truffle sashimi piece. Amaaazing. Also the lobster Mac and cheese is worth it - prepare to share because it is very heavy.
