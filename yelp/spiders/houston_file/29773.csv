The Pit Room////Their BBQ is TO DIE for!! The brisket is the best.  It's moist and fatty just the way I like it!  I don't care too much for their sides but brisket is a must when I'm in the area. Jalapeño cheese sausage and ribs are good also but like I said,  brisket! Brisket! Brisket!!  The lines could get long at times but moves fast so don't let that steer you away.  Give them a try if you haven't already!  Can't wait till I make a trip back to Houston for more!
