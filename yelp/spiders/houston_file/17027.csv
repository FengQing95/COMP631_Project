JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////that aside, jinya's ramen is pretty good! when i first had it, i thought it was way too salty, but i think maybe i just had a bad bowl. or maybe they were too new. i've since been back to jinya and my ramen was not at all over-salted, which was a super pleasant surprise!
