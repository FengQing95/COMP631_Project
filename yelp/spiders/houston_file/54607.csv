Kata Robata////I'm just going to review the things I ate (since my fiance has a Yelp account and will review the things he ate anyways). The pork gyoza was okay... the dough was really good and the pork was just okay, and they were smaller than I thought they would be based on the pictures from other people. The yellowtail robata was pretty good, though I thought it would benefit from a little salt. I suppose that's what they soy sauce/ginger is for.
