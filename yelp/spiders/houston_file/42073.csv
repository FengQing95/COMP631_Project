Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Yes, if you go there in the morning there will be a line and parking is a pain, but it is worth it. Plus, the line moves quickly. The service, atmosphere, and decor are all great. It's a great place to hang out, but it's the food and coffee that really makes this place special. The options are slim, but that's because what they do offer is so well crafted. I am so lucky that I live down the road from Common Bond because there is nothing common about it. Everything is exceptional.
