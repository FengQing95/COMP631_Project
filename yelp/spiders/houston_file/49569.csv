Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////To be very dramatic...THIS IS THE GREATEST BREAKFAST SPOT IVE EVER BEEN TO. French toast? Exceptional. Pancakes? To die for. Hash browns? A little weird tasting, but you get past it. I had the pancake flight and added a plain French toast(carbs are my friend) and was pleasantly surprised at how perfect everything was. Go here, but expect a wait and terrible parking. Fortunately there's several locations in Houston !
