Uchi////I wish I could give them 10 stars. This was by far the best and most inventive food I have ever tasted. My boyfriend took me two months ago and I have not stopped raving since. It was hard for me to eat again afterwards because all other food is crap in comparison. If you want to change your life and your idea of food, eat here. My favorite dish was the Butter Fish and the Jarjar Duck and for desert the the ash lime sorbet. The staff were all so well trained and accommodating. Cannot say this enough but this was the best dining experience I have ever had and if you haven't eaten here, you haven't lived. For the rest of my life I will be comparing all meals to Uchi. "It was good, but it was no Uchi."
