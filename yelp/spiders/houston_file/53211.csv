Kata Robata////We also got a few cocktails. They were good but too a little too long getting to us. We waited about 30 minutes. They also didn't get our food out at the same time and we waited another 30 minutes for the check. After we paid our bill the manager stopped by to see how our experience was and we told him what happened. He offered to buy us another round of drinks which we declined. I got the feeling that it was a mostly a fluke, so ill go back and give it another shot.
