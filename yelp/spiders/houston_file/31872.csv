Local Foods////I have only really found one side that I liked which was the green olive salad.  I have tried the slaw with edamame - the first time I had it, there was an overpowering sesame oil flavor.  I tried it again, and that was not the case.  The white bean salad is dense and in my opinion, needs salt.  Even the chips were too greasy.... They are house made, but that doesn't mean that they are good.
