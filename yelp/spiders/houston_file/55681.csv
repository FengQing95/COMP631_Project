Kata Robata////While we were waiting to order drinks at the bar Dale, one of the bartenders, greeted us and brought us menus. Before we were able to order a table opened up and we sat down. Dale immediately came to clear the table and take our drink order. He was great! He checked on us a couple times before we ordered to make sure we didn't have any questions. We were stuck on what type of sake to order and suggested one that was exactly what we were looking for.
