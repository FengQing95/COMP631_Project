Local Foods////The decor was the second thing I noticed. (After I ran to the restroom from drinking too much iced coffee for the sake of finals-- by the way, if you go to the restroom look at the trash can because that cool 4 leaf clover design is pretty bomb. Nice trashcan, Local Foods.) It's a clash of lots of different decor but it just somehow works. Very clean and very interesting. The most interesting, in my opinion, is the choice to but the dishes and bowls on a hanging slab of wood. It's kind of cool, honestly.
