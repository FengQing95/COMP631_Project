Uchi////This place used to be good. Sad to see that they have become the epitome of haughtiness. We went there for my birthday. Waited for 2 hours and when we were finally seated our server did not care to explain the menu or offer water to our toddler. She was very rude. There are so many places like Uchi that is not child friendly and it is not okay! Sure the food may be great but the poor service we received was unwarranted. There are so many great options out there and I'd much rather take my money where it would be appreciated.
