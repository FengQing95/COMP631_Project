Kata Robata////This was my second time at Kata Robata, and both times I came for their happy hour. They have pretty decent pricing for happy hour, but still expect to pay around 20$ because the portions tend to be smaller and you'll keep wanting to order more! As for service, Our server was very attentive, however, a bit on the hover attentive rather than friendly attentive side.
