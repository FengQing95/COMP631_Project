Local Foods////I got the truffled egg salad. I simply love egg salad and I do love truffle oil although there should be a disclaimer here. You die-hard localtarians are going to have a heart attack and not because of the cholesterol in the egg you're eating (Truffle oil is a synthetic concoction made in a laboratory). There I said it. And I don't care cuz this sandwich is delicious. The marriage of pretzel flavored bread, truffle oil, and egg salad is an awesome combination. Good job chef!
