Uchi////sadly this place has gone down in quality and quantity, i wish i would have taken a photo of my sushi... it was as small as a bottle cap.. i mean Â tiny its very expensive for what it is.... we spend a whole lot of money on eating out and i wont say we will come back.... we used to go to uchi at least 2 times to 3 times a week that they sent us a gift at the end of the year.....but no more, the sushi size is ridiculously small....not worth the price if you want good sushi go to teppay japanese! its much better quality and tastes amazing!
