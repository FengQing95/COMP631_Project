Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went in Saturday and was quickly seated! We were greeted by JOSE who was our amazing server! He took real good care of us and answered any questions we had! We all got drinks to start but as we waited they had already brought us out some water! All drink we got were good. Some very strong but overall great! We asked for some shots which I didn't know if they knew how to make and they sure did! Came out perfectly! It was our first time there and we will definitely be going back and will ask for Jose!
