Kata Robata////My first time dining at an expensive Japanese restaurant. Kata did not fall short at all. Everything was amazing and delicious. My husband and I wanted to order everything on their menu. For sure we had to get the lobster Mac and Cheese, Miso Bone Marrow and their Kobe Beef Skewers. Everything came out delicious but we weren't that impressed with their bone marrow. The Kobe Beef melts in your mouth and their Mac and Cheese was just heavenly. And of course being us we ordered three different kinds of dessert. I fell in love with their banana Creme Brûlée.
