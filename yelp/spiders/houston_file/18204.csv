Uchi////Place is awesome...I've missed sushi in London and this is very good stuff and not bad pricing...The dishes are mostly pretty good..there are a few misses but that's to be expected when you try new things...every time I've been I've had a knowledgable waiter who's been able to help me select entries based on my palate preferences...not to mention the sake selection is spot on...
