The Pit Room////Solid BBQ inside the loop! When I'm craving a good beef rib, I go straight here now vs. making the long journey to Killen's and waiting in that crazy long line. This rib definitely rivals it! I'll occasionally get the sausage and maybe some sides but nothing compares to the beef rib in my opinion. I love that they have fresh condiments like the pickled goods, onions and more. Plus different sauces if you want to experiment with flavors.
