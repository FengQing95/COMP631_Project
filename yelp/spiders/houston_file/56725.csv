Kata Robata////This used to be my favorite spot for some Japanese fusion and good spicy soy ramen. The food is still very good but the only complaint is there's not much veggie choices anymore. Yes I know you don't go to a Japanese restaurant looking for great vegetarian food but since this is a fusion I'd hope to have more of a complete meal. There used to be veggie truffle oil with tofu that was very good. Pls bring it back!
