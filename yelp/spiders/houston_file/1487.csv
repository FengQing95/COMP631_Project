JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My group and I were placed on a 45min wait. It's a small area and very crowded on a Saturday night so we decided to wait at the bar next door. When our time came 3 of us were ready to be seated while the others paid their bill next door. We were told we could not be seated until our whole party was together. Without hesitation they seated another group. Not even 60 seconds later our group was waiting for seating and the TWO girls at the front completely ignored us. Right in front of us they talk d to one another about how they couldn't seat us until we were all present(which we all were at that point) one of us spoke out to inform them yet again that we were ready. One of them walked away without a word. Finally when she came back she ,very annoyed , sat us down. Server time was also terrible. We had to stop a random worker to ask if we could order. Overall, they were rude, uncooperative with our order requests and the fries are pitiful DONT ORDER
