JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As my boyfriend was going to place an order for takeout today during happy hour, we come to find out that there is no such thing as happy hour anymore. It's only on appetizers???? Apparently, this "change" was a month ago, so just an FYI to all the local loyal customers that love happy hour. Wish they could have done something at least regarding the news but nothing... really disappointing
