Kata Robata////Definitely one of the most unique food experiences I've ever had with such a high quality level! The food was absolutely unbeatable and had such a level of originality. Each bite was a delectable burst of flavor and umami! The inside decor also provided a great complementary atmosphere to the food that I was enjoying. While on the slightly pricier side, I think the whole experience was worth it for sure.
