Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat is our favorite place.  We were here recently for my husband's birthday dinner with friends, and it was the perfect choice.  Our server, Henry, went above and beyond to make it a memorable experience.   Their signature drink, The Bosscat, looks just as good as it tastes.   The floor to ceiling whiskey selection is something to see.   The food, drinks and service all exceeded our expectations.   Can't wait to go back!
