Local Foods////I've been here a few times and never had anything bad.  I first got their crunchy chicken sandwich which was to die for!  I also had quinoa for the first time there, and I'm hooked!  They told me you can get any sandwich as a salad if you want. I haven't done that yet,  but I bet they are delicious too!
