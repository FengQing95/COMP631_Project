Baby Barnaby's////Crowded little place, but the line out in the cold was not bad with the heaters and coffee for those waiting.  I had Oatmeal with veggie sausage on the side, and was pleasantly surprised that it was real oatmeal, not pre packaged instant like most places.  They also have the coolest machine to make their fresh squeezed Orange Juice!
