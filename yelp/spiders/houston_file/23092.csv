Uchi////This was a great experience. I'm still not sure how comes I have never been to this gem before. I met up with a friend to check it out on a Monday evening. There was a short line outside of people waiting for them to open at 5pm. My first thought was are they that good and a lady in line said yes. As we approached the counter we let them the name for our reservation and the host was taking us to the table. At the entry way there is a girl with fresh sushi samples to offer you one on the way in. It was yummy and I didn't catch a photo because it didn't last long enough.
