Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I'm actually surprised I like this place considering it's location. I hate galleria area bc parking is ridiculous but they have complimentary valet. We had reservations for 4 ...otherwise 40 min wait. Inside it's very roomy and nice but extremely loud, reminds me of being at the club. Outside is nice but nice it's summertime in htown it's not safe to sit in the heat. Lol! Ac is necessary for survival. So I had the michelada, fries, & fruity pebbles french toast. It took awhile for the food to come out, and it doesn't come out at the same time. My friend ordered the avocado toast and 2 of us ordered fries for appetizers. The avocado toast came out first. The fries came with our meals. I guess they assumed it was part of our meal? Anyway, the waiter was nice and attentive. There were people promoting drinks & handing out free drinks. (It wasn't good. ) We also ordered the breakfast shot. The liquor tasted like syrup, then you follow up with OJ and a piece of bacon. $12/shot. Pretty good! & bathrooms were nice--Individual rooms for each person with a really bathroom attendant present in the hall. Prices were affordable. Drinks and food were really good. The only bad thing was the music, although really good jams, was soooo loud you have to yell to be heard. Otherwise awesome place!!
