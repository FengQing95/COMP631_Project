Kata Robata////I love this place and agree with so many others that they serve some of the freshest finest sushi and Sashimi you can find in Houston. Lunch is an amazing value (I had the miso soup, 5 Sashimi and 2 roles for $16 today) but my advice is to arrive when the doors open at 11:30. I've seen people outside as early as 11:15 waiting to get in! Excellent food, excellent staff.
