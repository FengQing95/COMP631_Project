JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello JP G. - Thank you for your review. JINYA's restaurant concept is geared towards a trendy, loud atmosphere. In fact, for each of our franchise locations, we are contractually obligated to play our house music -- provided by a Â Corporate-mandated music service called GrayV -- at specific decibel levels. Failure to do so violates our franchise agreements, and could effectively put us in default.
