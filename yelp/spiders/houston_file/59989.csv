Baby Barnaby's////This is honestly my go to breakfast spot. Whether it be this barnabys or the other locations, the food and service is impeccable nonetheless. I love the green eggs platter. Any dish you get there comes in lovely hefty portions, so you definitely get your money's worth. The service is amazing because the people there always seem so genuine to help give you the best experience. You gotta try their freshly squeezed orange juice too. It's so refreshing. Other than the size of this establishment being a bit on the tiny side, I admire it's quirky dainty-ness to it. Out of all the times I've been, I haven't had any bad experiences. A must try!
