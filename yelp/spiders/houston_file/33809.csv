Local Foods////One of the best sandwiches in Houston!!!!! Everything here is local and extremely fresh, their gulf shrimp and crunchy chicken sandwiches were mind blowing along with their sides, I especially liked their kale salad...very neat interior and there is free parking, this shall be one of my go to places when I'm looking for a fresh, tasty and light meal
