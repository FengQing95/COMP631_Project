Uchi////We got the foie candy bar ($6) for dessert, which was accurately described to be a better, and much more complex, Snickers ice cream bar. Personally, I found the Austin location to just slightly edge out the Houston location in overall experience, and I will be updating my review of the original to 5 stars to reflect a more accurate relative rating. Uchi Houston is very similar to its older brother in Austin, and while they would never be mistaken for twins, they both still have that same charm that makes them special in the first place. 4 stars.
