The Pit Room////I was wildly surprised by this place. I'd heard it was fantastic but I'm not a huge BBQ person, so I thought ehh. The Pit Room was SO GOOD. Potentially the best BBQ I've ever had (still coming from someone who is not a BBQ buff). I didn't think I liked brisket, oh I like brisket now. The meats were juicy, and the sides were delicious. The portions are ginormous - please be warned. I got the Three Meat plate because I wanted to try 3 different meats, but I don't think I would have been able to finish the Two Meat plate. I took home over half of it.
