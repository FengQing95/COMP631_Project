JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ramen was okay, not as flavorful as I'd hoped. I chose one of the pork dishes. The pork was flavorful, but broth and other ingredients were quite bland. The desserts, however, were quite pleasing. My daughter and I tried both, as there were only two options. Would I try this restaurant again, yes.
