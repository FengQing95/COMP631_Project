Kata Robata////Honestly not sure why it is so hard to get a reservation at this place, I have been there twice and have found the sushi to be good, but nothing mind blowing. Liked the fresh catch ceviche and the king/uni spoon but The value, ambiance and service is mediocre at best. Not super impressed sadly, especially when I had to fight for a a 5PM reservation for 2 I was hoping for "wow".
