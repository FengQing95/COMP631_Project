Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The croissants were delicate. And they were delicious. Who knew that layers of sweet carbs and sugar could taste like such an accomplishment? I can't think of many foods that make me feel victorious when I take a bite. The chocolate croissant had little nuggets of chocolate waiting to be discovered. The almond croissant was dusted in a powdered sugar that I won't forget anytime soon.
