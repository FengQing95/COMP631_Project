JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Give this place 4 stars , not because the food wasnt good but because our sitting was a little off. The place itself is very organiced, entrance is bright and open while the actual eating place is a little more crammed and with dim lights which will not help if you want to take a picture , it gives you the orange look . Anyways first time going , menu has a lot of combinations to choose from , you can literally make your own bowl of noodles. I chose a spicy one , but bc there noodles you need to eat close to the bowl, some spicy broth jumped to my eye. I had trouble eating it because i dont know how to use chopsticks but overall the food was very yummy. The only complain is that the table were we were sitting was so close to the 2 other next to us. I could literally extand my arm and be in both tables. I saw that they did had booths , and that probably would of been better but because we were in the middle of two 4 party table it was a little uncomfortable.
