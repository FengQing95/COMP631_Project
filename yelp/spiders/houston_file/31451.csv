Local Foods////Love LOVE this restaurant and this location. Their menu selection perfectly caters to someone like me-loves soups, salads and sandwiches, but craves the occasional burger. I can't get enough of their Garden Sammie -they put some sort of spiced cauliflower in it and it is AWESOME. Don't even get me started on their sides; delicious and perfectly portioned-and healthy too! I only gave 4 stars due to it's size-it is a tad small, and the line is normally out the door due to it's cafe style set up. However, the food is totally worth it!
