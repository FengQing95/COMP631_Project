Baby Barnaby's////I love pancakes and I generally order one on the side at breakfast that we split. I ordered one and was shocked at the size of the pancake that came and was a little more shocked at the full breakfast entree price. Not that I think they should discount something ordered as a side but maybe say they don't do one alacarte pancake and let you know that you'd be purchasing a $6 side.
