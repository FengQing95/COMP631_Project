Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////A group of us went here for brunch because we heard good things. First off, let me just say that the food is good and had a large variety to choose from. There's something for everybody. The atmosphere is quite friendly because everyone is either at the bar or standing and chatting as they are waiting for a table. Don't be deterred by the outrageous wait time they give you when you check-in on the weekend. We were told for a party of four that it would be one hour and thirty minutes. I turned a stopwatch on and we were alerted that our table was ready after 21 minutes.
