Kata Robata////After my last experience here, I must have experienced a completely different restaurant than everyone else.  Service was mediocre at best, and much closer to poor than anything.  After being seated, we were not greeted for over ten minutes by anyone.  Plenty of servers walking around us and looking at us, but not one coming by to say anything nor to even state that our server was a bit busy but would be coming soon.  At nearly fifteen minutes, our server arrives, asks us what we wanted to start with, and leaves for the next ten minutes without bringing us anything.  No water, no apologies for the lateness, nothing.  He really didn't give any effort, but that's just because he didn't care.
