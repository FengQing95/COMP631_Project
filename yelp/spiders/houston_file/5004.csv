JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My husband and I eat here at least twice a month if not more.  I was completely bummed to find out they are changing the sauce on the creamy vegan ramen which is my favorite.  It truly is the only reason why I come here.  Unfortunately, I won't be back after tonight. . Not sure why they would change something that didn't need changing.
