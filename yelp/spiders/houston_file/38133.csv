Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I liked this place a lot. It's actually a whiskey bar and I believe the waiter Chocolate' said over 300 different whiskeys around the world! They have other liquors as well and a good choice of texas brews. They have a good menu and good happy hr. I loved the atmosphere the best. Nice outdoor couch/patio seating. Also a bar/counter like area inside where u face the patio to enjoy the weather and dog park across the street. Very nice and highly recommend.
