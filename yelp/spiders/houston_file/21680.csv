Uchi////The Ahi tuna was very fresh so definitely worth it. I have to say that the service was particularly good and I guess this is part of what you pay the $$$$ for, but the food was also EXCELLENT! I went to bed and slept through the night peacefully shortly after dinner and I cannot help but think that this exquisite meal had something to do with it.
