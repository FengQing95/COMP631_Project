Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////A-OK experience. To be honest, the food here is just Okay. The pancake was a 7/10 (tasted like ihop). They could have used more buttermilk in the pancake. The eggs were... eggs. And the (pork belly) bacon was a 5/10. The texture and taste were a bit off and inconsistent with each piece. I also tried the chocolate chip pancake that my homie had and it was just okay. The pancake itself had no flavor, and was easily overpowered by the chocolate chips. I could even tell the exact type of chocolate chips they used (Semi Sweet Nestle chocolate chips) because i use the same to make waffles at home. The best thing about this place was the customer service and the use of real maple. Unfortunately, I have been cursed with eating the Apex of pancakes (check my pics for Emmas Country Kitchen in Toronto or Red wagon in vancouver and compare to this). The only breakfast spot in the US that makes pancakes on the level of Canada is a spot in Vegas called "Eat." and to be honest, that may just be the only place I eat at here in the US. So Yeah, take from this what you may.
