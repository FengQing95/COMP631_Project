Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Tried this place for the first time the other day after hearing so much about it! I'm not sure if this place is always super busy but we waited about 45 minutes to be seated. Really cute place that offers a variety of different breakfast items until 2:30 pm. I'm a huge brunch person and I'm glad this place offers that, not just on weekends (huge plus). I tried the pineapple upside down pancakes,bacon, hash browns, and of course what's brunch without mimosas!? The food was good and the mimosa was pretty strong I got pineapple & oj (waiters recommendation) and it was pretty good. The food is fairly price and decently proportioned.
