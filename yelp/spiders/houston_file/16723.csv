JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ordered ramen to go and it did not disappoint! It had a great authentic taste to it. I'm from Southern California and I've never had ramen that has a similar taste to this. Even though I did not eat in, the atmosphere had a great vibe to it. Perfect for a date night in downtown!
