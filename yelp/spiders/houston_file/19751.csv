Uchi////This was my 3rd visit to Uchi's and it just keeps getting better.  My friends and I have tried almost everything on the menu and there is nothing that has not impressed us.  The service. it really stands out as one of the best in Houston.  Uchi's is a gem and I would recommend you give them a try.  Even if you do not like sushi,  you will like it here because it is so fresh and clean.  Once you have had really good sushi, I think you will fall in love like I have.  If you're an old pro and love sushi already, you will think twice about what real good sushi should be.  My friends and I love it and now we can't go back to those so so sushi places again.
