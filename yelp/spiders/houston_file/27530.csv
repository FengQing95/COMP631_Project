The Pit Room////Really good quality BBQ. I ordered to go and service was fantastic, I got my food within 2 minutes despite a line which sprawled out of the door. The brisket was our favorite, try it out! Although it is a bit expensive, I will say I enjoyed it thoroughly, The Pit Room is a great place to get food from (especially perfect for get togethers).
