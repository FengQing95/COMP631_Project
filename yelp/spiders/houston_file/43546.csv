Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is totally worth the hype! When you walk in you can look at all the pastries and place your order before you get down to the cashier, they also have savory items on the menu. I got the iced mocha coffee and chocolate croissant and they were both delicious! Iced mochas can be a hit or miss at a lot of places but this one was perfect! Not too sweet or too bitter. My friend is a regular here and she highly recommends the french onion soup! The only downside about this place is parking is almost always full!! They have extra parking down the street but usually you can get lucky and find a spot as someone is leaving!
