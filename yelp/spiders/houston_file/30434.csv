The Pit Room////Continuing my mission for sampling BBQ in Texas, there were 2 places in Houston that I had to try. One was The Pit Room. This place did not disappoint. There was the expected line outside the door and surprisingly everyone had face masks and was social distancing. It was very orderly and limited entry in the establishment. The ordering process is cafeteria style, the first station is the meat guy who cuts to order your selection, the next is the sides guy who dished up your side dishes, then the drinks person and the condiments, plasticware, napkin station, then you pay. Very efficient. These guys do a good job with the process.
