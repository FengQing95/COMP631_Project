Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I really wanted to love this place. It looks great, I can walk to it, and the whisky list my husband loves. But in the 4 times we have gone here the food is not great for the price and the entire menu is hit and miss, the cocktails are ok but pricy for what you get, the happy hour time is ridiculous (I know that is common in Houston but who thought happy hour was from 3-6 I would love to know where that guy works), it is LOUD the building just keeps the noise in and you can't hear yourself think if there is a event going on (they seem to have a lot), I thought the staff was awesome till we watched the bartenders bickering in front of everyone. The food and drinks do come out at a good pace, most of the staff seem happy and are helpful, and the place is very clean. It just is not worth the trip for us even though it is only 2 blocks, we tried a few times to give this place a chance and it just never does it for us.
