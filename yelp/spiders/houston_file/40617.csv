Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////And can we talk about how loud the music is?! I'm all for music at a restaurant, what is not okay is music so loud you can't hear yourself speak. Music so loud, you feel like you're at Vegas club. I literally couldn't wait to get out of the restaurant! A 2nd visit to Bosscat is highly unlikely.0
