The Pit Room////Excellent Barbeque!  I had the brisket, beef ribs, beef sausage, and a side of charro beans.  My wife had a pork taco, brisket taco, and a side of mac'n'cheese.  Everything was very good.  The staff and environment were also very nice.  I think this is one of the best places for barbecue in Houston for sure.
