Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////On to the main course of Fruity pebbles French toast and the Donut Burger. Initially I thought the French toast would be too sweet but the fresh berries and bacon bits elevated this to another level and balanced out the flavors. If you wanna go big get a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream to top of off! This one is definitely a masterpiece and staple at Bosscat Lounge. The Donut burger was interesting, something new to me and worth a try. I could appreciate the double patty topped with an over easy egg that ties it together. The chocolate is subtle and adds the sweet to a savory sandwich.
