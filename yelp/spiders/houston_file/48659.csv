Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze snooze snooze but DO NOT sleep on this place, I repeat DO NOT sleep on this place! First of all the food is AFUCKINGMAZING as well as the service! No matter how early or late you arrive you will have to wait so be prepared but don't be turned off by the line or the wait because it's more than worth it! This is my 3rd Snooze experience and let me say it gets better and better! Today I had the Spuds Deluxe which is my absolute FAV!! I kindly added chicken sausage, pico de gallo, caramelized onions, avocado and Pablano peppers with eggs over medium and a side of ranchero sauce and it was to die for!!! If you haven't been yet GOOOOO, you'll thank yourself as soon as the food hits your table!!
