Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Cozy happy lil. Coffeeshop. Parking is scarce. But worth the trip! Their chocolate chip cookies are THE BEST cookies I have ever had! Not too sweet and the texture is just perfect. Also, they have the best birthday flavor macaroons. Everything I had there was really good. Service is great and the place is clean. I tried almost all their sweets and baked goodies - i like them all!
