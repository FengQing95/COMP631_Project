Baby Barnaby's////This place has one of the best breakfast around Houston. I'm not much of breakfast kind of person, but I love it here. The lines are long but that's the sign of greatness. As you come in, you have to write your name on the clipboard to be on the wait list. As you wait, they have self-served coffee. The place is small but comfortable.
