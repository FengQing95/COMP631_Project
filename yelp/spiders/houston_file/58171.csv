Kata Robata////I had no expectations when I came across Kata Robota on Yelp. My boyfriend and I decided to splurge because we thought to ourselves, how often would we be in Houston? Little did we know that this place would leave a deep footprint in our bellies. What makes it even better is that this place also flies in their fish from Japan multiple times throughout the week!!
