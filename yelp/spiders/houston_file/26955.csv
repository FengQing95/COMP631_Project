The Pit Room////The pit room has great tacos! The BBQ is awesome too. Service is average, but quick. I can see why, they don't have much time to talk because they are ALWAYS packed. I usually call ahead and it's really hit or miss. Their sauces are INCREDIBLE but they're not consistent with providing them. Their prices are a little steep as well. They're tacos are great, but for the 1-1.5oz of meat, it's not worth the price.
