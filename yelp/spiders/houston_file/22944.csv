Uchi////Went here last night for Happy Hour and had an amazing time. Between two people we spend under $50 and were quite full. Their happy hour drink menu is also well put together and reasonably priced. We didn't have a reservation and waited about 30 minutes for a seat (but the happy hour drink menu was put to use). Uchi tends to keep a portion of their dining area for walk-ins but the rest is for reserved. If you don't have a reservation, I would strongly suggest lining up at least 10-15 minutes before the restaurant opens at 5 pm to ensure you don't have a longer wait.
