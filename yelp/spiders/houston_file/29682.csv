The Pit Room////I think this is a meal that is as American as you can get. Taking pride in Texas barbecue, the pit room holds reputation that is unmatched by any other barbecue joints. They meat literally melts in your mouth like butter. Seasoned perfectly to harmonize with the meat flavor and the Mac and cheese combined with soda is the formula for a happy and satisfied belly.
