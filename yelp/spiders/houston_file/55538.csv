Kata Robata////This past Friday night my husband wanted a casual dinner of sushi so rather than going to usual old Japanese stand-by, Blue Fish, I suggested Kata Robata. When we arrived, we were seated in a booth located directly under a POS machine which meant that the waitstaff were constantly using the machine to input orders, talking and looking down at us. Why someone would place a POS machine in the center of a nice restaurant immediately next to diners is a mystery.
