Uchi////I ordered sakana mushi (sea bass in amazing soupbroth. Used to dunk our sushi in),  sasami yaki ( chicken cooked perfectly), Hana tataki (tasteful cauliflower), and 3 shag  rolls (they were that good dipped in the booth above). Would definitely return, My husband and I both preferred the cooked options rather than the raw.
