Kata Robata////4.5/5 for the ChawanMushi. The other CM was their award winning uni version, but I enjoy duck more than uni so that's what I went with. This was definitely better than the ramen, but unfortunately a few bites and it was gone. Great egg custard and soy/mirin/dashi broth. Can't go wrong with mushrooms, duck, and foie gras in one bite.
