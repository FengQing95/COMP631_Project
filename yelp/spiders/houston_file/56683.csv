Kata Robata////The Spicy Soy Ramen and the 72 Hour Slow Cooked Texas Kobe Beef Skewer (let's shorten the name to 72HSCTKB) here are amazing! For first timers, I highly recommend getting both dishes if you don't mind paying $16 for four bite size pieces of beef. (Order the 72HSCTKB as an appetizer and not a meal!).
