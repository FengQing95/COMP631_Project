Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Staff, to include token bearded guy in apron (quite irked by my dumb pastry questions, but hey, I tip!), served up some gorgeous $5 pastry. Anyway, I'm a pretty bubbly person, and most of the staff that I interacted with were so great and genuinely friendly to me, from bussers to baristas.
