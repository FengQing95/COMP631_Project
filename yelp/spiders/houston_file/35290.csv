Local Foods////Local Foods is always a good option. This cafeteria-style spot offers a revolving menu, in addition to their standard list of salads, sandwiches, and sides. There's also a fun (and local) craft beer list. As of this review, I've been to this location countless times and have always ordered the crunchy chicken sandwich served on a pretzel bun. Just great. Everything is remarkably fresh and the service is super friendly.
