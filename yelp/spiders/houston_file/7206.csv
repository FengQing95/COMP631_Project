JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Came into Houston on a rainy night so I was craving some soups! My friends and I came here for dinner and were seated very quickly. I ordered a spicy tonkotsu ramen, which was everything I needed and more. I wish the bowls were bigger because this was sooo good. The pork in my ramen just MELTED in my mouth. I even drank all the ramen to clean up my bowl because I could not get over how tasty this was. The only disappointment I had was not having boiled eggs in my ramen - like what!? Why are not all ramen created equally and given boiled eggs?! That's the best part and I shouldn't have to pay extra for it just because my broth is tonkotsu???? lol my friend tried the chef special which was a karage chicken ramen - he said it was good and liked it. My other friend also ordered the Jinya bun and she said the pork was delightful as well! Overall, the service was great and the food was great and I would totally come back again!!
