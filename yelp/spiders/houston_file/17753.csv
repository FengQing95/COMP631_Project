Uchi////We started off with a ryushoo mixed cocktail and hirame usuzukuri (thinkly sliced flounder that's to die for) as an appetizer. I really wasn't sure if I should order it, but our bartender recommended it so I hesitantly took his advice. It was amazing. Still my fiance's favorite meal of the evening; probably my 2nd favorite. Our main order consisted of yokai berry (salmon with asian pear - 5 stars), hot rock wagyu beef, bacon tataki (pork belly that's extremely soft with cripsy onions and an awesome fish carmel sauce. The mixture of sweet, tangy, soft, and cripsy just sends your taste buds for a spin; in the good way.), and the machi cure (My favorite!!!). I wasn't going to order it since I've never liked yellowtail, but the bartender recommended it and my fiance' hinted (not so subtlely) that she wanted to try it so I went ahead and ordered it. Turned out to be my favorite, by the slimmest of margins, of the evening. The Machi Curi is yuka (Think potatoe chips, but with a different root that has a more complex and savory flavor), along with sliced pears and great sauce and some sweet raisins that combine to make the most delicious mixture of flavours I've ever tried.
