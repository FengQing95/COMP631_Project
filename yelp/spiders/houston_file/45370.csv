Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////You know I never liked any of the stuff from here. The desserts aren't good, the coffee sucks (go next door to agora for real coffee), the food isn't that good, and I held my tongue all this time but to tow a car after hours when your sign is covered by a tree so people can't see is just giving the public the finger. I mean you're closed and ur lot is completely open and ur sign is covered by a tree! That's just nasty. The least you can do is let people park after hours when ur closed. The car wasn't even mine, it was my friend's and she actually liked this place and only said nice things about it. Let me tell you that I will never go back and neither will she and I will personally advertise for people not to support this place. Literally the only cool thing about commonbond is the building its in... The rest is just rotten.
