Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Y'all, I don't even like French toast, but my little sampling at The Morning After made me think again. So back to Snooze I went and had a full portion. OMG is the perfect name for it because that's exactly what you'll say when you take your first bite. Wake up early so you don't have to wait and get yourself some French toast and a side of bacon cooked soft.
