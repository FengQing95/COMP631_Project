The Pit Room////First time visitor. In fairness, the place was 30 minutes from closing so they ran out of almost everything. I ordered a (2) meat plate. Brisket was very good and the gentleman gave me a generous portion because they were closing. The pulled pork wasn't my favorite because it looked like it was sitting all day in a pan. The beans were "ok" too. Again, eating at 8:30pm isn't the best time to frequent a restaurant that serves BBQ. I liked the service and ambience and I'd definitely come back.
