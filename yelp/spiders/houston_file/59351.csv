Baby Barnaby's////Stopped in here to fortify myself this morning and it was an all around pleasant experience. I really can't stand the phrase "the warm fuzzies", but it applies here. Â This is one of the few joints in my 'hood where it truly feels neighborly, the wait staff are super friendly, and the green eggs and those fried potatoes are still shut yo' mouth good.
