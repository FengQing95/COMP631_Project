Kata Robata////Jacob provides excellent service for me at the sushi bar.  Nice restaurant setting, more high-end than the average sushi spots.  Good variety of fish from kohada, aji, to kinmedai.  Bluefin toro, chu toro and akami.  Fresh Santa Barbara uni was a leaping portion for sushi, foie gras on my applications, I think I had most of them.  Would of like the Foie a bit more seasoned, the Foie sushi was a bit too cooked.  Everything was fast even though quite busy.
