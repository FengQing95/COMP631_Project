Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Recently went here with my girlfriend for brunch. She had the fruity pebbles French toast, which was actually very good. I had the donut burger, which I think could be improved - it needs to be a glazed donut and not a chocolate sprinkles donut. The glazed would provide a more cohesive flavor and provide more sweetness, I think. As is, though, it was just serviceable. We shared an order of the tatchos, which were fine, but nothing you couldn't just make at home. I think I'd give the food three stars, but the service earned the fourth star. From the hostess stand to the table and back out the door, the employees were polite and on top of it. If we asked for something (sour cream, syrup, etc.) there was no unnecessary and fake wait time associated, it was out within a minute. Would probably return and try some other menu items!
