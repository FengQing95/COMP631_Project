The Pit Room////Such a hyped out place with lines out the door. Came for a weekend lunch. Line was out the door but moved relatively fast since it is scoop and go concept. The dinner meal options seemed interesting so I could sample different types of meats. I chose the 3 meats option that comes with 2 sides. Unfortunately, beef ribs are not an option for the dinner set so I chose: brisket, pork ribs, and beef sausage Czech style. For the two sides: elote and Mac n cheese. Decided to order an extra pulled pork taco because it didn't seem like that much food. I got a Dr. Pepper classically bottled for my drink. Once seated, there's a side cart of pickled cucumbers, pickled onions, onions, peppers, jalape√±os, and taco salsa. There's also a wide condiment selection of hot mustard, coffee bbq, hot sauce, etc.
