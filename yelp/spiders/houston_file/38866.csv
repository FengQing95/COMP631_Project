Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Our Server Breanne was great, friendly, bubbly, always checking up on us to make sure we're doing good. We were informed about their popular whiskey infused cocktails, the drinks were a bit pricy for me ($14), but I had to try one, so I ordered the Bosslady. It had a nice strong taste with a complex blackberry aftertaste, it was SO good! We ordered a few starters the porkbelly poutine and tomato bisque , and for our entree the short ribs.
