JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I came to JINYA for the first time not too long ago and the spicy chicken ramen was delicious! I did go on a Saturday night and it was very busy. My party of 4 waited 45-50 minutes to be seated but everything came out super fast once we ordered. Will definitely be coming back!
