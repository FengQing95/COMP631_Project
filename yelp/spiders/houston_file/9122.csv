JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My daughter took me to this restaurant for dinner not too long ago. It was my first time eating there. Although it was a little loud, the atmosphere was nice and the crowd wasn't too bad. The food was very tasty and the portion was enough to feed an army. I would recommend this restaurant for sure! Also, thanks to Mark who attended my daughter and I very kindly. Thanks Mark!
