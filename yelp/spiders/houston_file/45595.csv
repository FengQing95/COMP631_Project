Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Seating was a little challenging since we were a party of five and it was very busy. After some deliberation, we ended up outside with a couple of tables pushed together. Initially, we were in a very awkward spot (right near the exit gate for the restaurant), but after a few minutes, a group finished up and we managed to snag a spot under an umbrella. The staff were very helpful in helping us push together tables, so we were grateful for that.
