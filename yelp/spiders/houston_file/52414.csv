Kata Robata////What a wonderful place! There was about a 35 minute wait, although we were quoted about 45 minutes to an hour, and it was well worth it. My boyfriend and I made our way to the bar where we were welcomed by someone who was coming around to give samples of sushi to the guests who were waiting. When we were seated, we were greeted by our server, Cory, who was outstanding. He had the best recommendations, and was so attentive. I can't recall the names of all the plates we got, but all I can say was that his recommendations really made dinner this evening an experience. It's been a while since I have had such a good meal with such excellent service, and the sushi was delicious, of course. We will be visiting again!
