Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Was looking up different bakeries in the area, and this place popped up. I won it's OK get some special treats for my birthday so I stopped by on Sunday afternoon. I had the pistachio croissant (2.5/5), almond croissant (3.5/5) morning bun (4/5), fruit tart (2/) and the vegan gingerbread cookie (1/5). They have so many options to choose from. Employee was super helpful in helping me make decisions. They also informed me that an hour before closing, all of their bakery items are 50% off. The bakery was super cute and the staff were very helpful.
