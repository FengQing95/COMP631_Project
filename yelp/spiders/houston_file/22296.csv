Uchi////Not a big sushi fan and was skeptical about coming here. Went with a big group and we just ate what our host for the party ordered. Let me tell you, I didn't expect I would like many dishes. Was I wrong, I enjoyed every dish that came out. Everything was fresh and flavorful. This experience made me liking sushi more and left me wanting to come back again sooner than later
