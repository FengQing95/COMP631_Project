Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Was recommended to try this place from a few friends and glad I gave it a shot! As pictured I ordered the donut burger followed by the amazing breakfast shot that just goes perfect together! I was told this donut burger sells out pretty quick so I showed up 5min after they opened on a Saturday morning. I sat at the bar with the morning bar staff, who I became friends with quickly. Beautiful environment and awesome friendly staff! I have tried to grab a bite here a few times before this attempt but the kitchen stops serving at early times, to me... I'll definitely back to try other dishes soon!
