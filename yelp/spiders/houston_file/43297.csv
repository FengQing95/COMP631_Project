Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The chicken & biscuits were on point but you literally can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Don't leave without a pastry... try the Kouign-Aman or just a chocolate chip cookie. Got a chance to speak with Justin and Chef Matt who both wanted to know my thoughts on the chicken & biscuits as it was a new item (good af!). They were super knowledgeable and friendly
