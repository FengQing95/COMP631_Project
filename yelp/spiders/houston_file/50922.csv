Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Now onto the service and food: Both were impressive and impeccable. We were a party of 5 and each ordered multiple things and got everything just as ordered in a timely manner. There were scrumptuous pancakes, corned beef hash that was packed with a huge amount of meat, pot pies, particularly excellent eggs, sweet potato pancakes and a whole lot of silence at our table - we were too busy stuffing ourselves with a satisfying meal to speak! Absolutely loved the sweet potato pancakes and the amazing eggs (I didn't know you could make eggs that delicious!).
