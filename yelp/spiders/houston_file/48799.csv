Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////It was bacon day when we went so we ordered a bunch of bacon stuff. The bacon wasn't overwhelming at all though even though everything had it. I got a peach bellini which was cold and sweet and didn't taste too much like alcohol which I was glad for at 7:30am. Food: we got the pancake flight with a french toast, the bacon pancake of the day, and a peach crumble pancake. All three of us had a different favorite which basically means that each pancake was delicious. Then we shared a benny duo which is basically two ways of eggs benedict that you get to choose. Then we had a third dish that I don't remember, but I think it was probably good, too. Each dish was probably about $10-13. The portions are pretty small compared to places like ihop and denny's, but they're really good for sharing and tasting.
