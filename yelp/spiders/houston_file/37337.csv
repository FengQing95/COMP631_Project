Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The menu was designed to be well seasoned and flavorful. So I apologize if we didn't meet your expectation. Being that I'm Vietnamese, I also like the contrast between different textures. That's why I'm a fan of our Pork Belly Poutine too. The Mac & Cheese is supposed to be flavorful as well. Chef Peter and I both have 2 year old daughters that visit us here a lot. The Mac & Cheese is their favorite item. I'm so disappointed that it wasn't to your liking.
