Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////As for atmosphere, while slightly pretentious for a Montrose crowd, it's cute as shit in there. Â Clean, awesome design and decor. The staff all wear little white aprons and fedoras. They were all very nice. It feels like your not in Houston, or even Texas. It's beautiful in there. It is a scene though.
