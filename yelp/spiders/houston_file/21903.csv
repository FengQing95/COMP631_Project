Uchi////- complimentary hors d'oeuvre while waiting for a table (we were offered pumpkin tempura and sliced apple with some toppings) - no reservation minimum wait time is 30mins. You get to hang out near the bar or outside where you can comfortably sit and have a drink and can order appetizers like edamame. What's great about Uchi, they provide tasty treat for you to munch on while waiting for your table.
