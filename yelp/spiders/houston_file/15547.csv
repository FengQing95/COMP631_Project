JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Seriously! First time I can here I didn't get the hype. Then I heard about this vegan ramen. Other places I have tried have been an awful waste of money but the search was still on and the Instagram photo looked so good sooooo...... Wow! It's better than regular ramen! I'm hooked! I would literally move closer just to walk here for it!
