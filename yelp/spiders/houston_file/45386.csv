Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Once you go through the double doors, you're in a snaked line. Once you get to the front you better know what you want because as soon as you have someone with a pad and paper in their hands, you better start talking. There's a bar area and seating all around the perimeter of the wall. There are a few tables and a communal long table. There are also seats outside if the weather is pleasant.
