Uchi////This most recent meal was perfect. I waited an hour and 15 to get a table because I didn't have a reservation, and it wasn't a problem at all. While you wait, they have a patio outside where you can sit and have drinks and excellent edamame that they toss on a grill. The whole meal was incredible. I had friends from in town with me and they were equally impressed with our Uchi experience. We all agreed that the Hama Chili was the best tasting thing we've had the whole night. The out-of-towners kept talking about how it was the best thing of their whole trip. We also all came to the consensus that the Brie Ringo was the best surprise of the night. I would get married just so I could serve that at my wedding. Not only was the food great, but the service was equally exceptional. Everything was perfect. Every time I visit Uchi, whether it's in Austin or Houston, it is always sensational. There are not enough nice things to say about this place.
