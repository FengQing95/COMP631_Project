The Pit Room////Got the feast for my dads birthday, and we loved it! There are so many different types of meat, but our favorite was the beef rib. It was so tender and fatty, and full of taste. Also loved the pulled pork and the sausages. Some of the cuts have a black pepper crusting, which makes it slightly spicy. Even though it was a lot of food, we heated up leftovers in the microwave oven and it was just as delicious!
