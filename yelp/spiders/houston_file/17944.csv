Uchi////The experience I had here was immaculate.  The service was fast and helpful but not doting and overly attentive.  Our waiter walked us through everything we ate, down to the ingredients of the sauces.  He framed our food as well as guided us as first-timers to Uchi.  The portion sizes are quite small but the food is really high quality and a lot of thought has been put into how it is constructed/designed.  Most of their foods have a sweet, spicy, or bitter element with many contrasting textures.  We went for the 5-6:30 social hour, which means everything was half off.  My Fiance and I left stuffed, with a bill of only $45.  Apparently that is really low for this place, so I highly suggest the social hour if you haven't been here before.  If you have bigger pockets you could probably end up spending closer to $100 per head.
