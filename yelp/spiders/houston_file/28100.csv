The Pit Room////The portions are very large and the bbq sauce is good. I didn't think the sides where too great I had the elote, potato salad, mac n cheese, and beans. The best of all the sides was the mac n cheese. The brisket and ribs are delicious and juicy and would be the only reason I keep coming back bc the sides didn't win me over.
