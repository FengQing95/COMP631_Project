Kata Robata////Went here for happy hour during the week and, while the food was good, i wasnt as impressed as i thought i would be. There were only four rolls on the happy hour menu, Â and were pricier than your average sushi happy hour. I'd prefer to go somewhere with more options on the menu next time.
