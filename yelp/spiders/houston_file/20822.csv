Uchi////After every one of my "foodie" friends had berated me for not trying Uchi during a whole year of their existence here in the H, I was getting pretty sick and tired of explaining how my wallet's not made of platinum and blood diamonds. A friend lured us over to Uchi after our happy hour at the bar next door. An expected 45 minute wait flew by as we enjoyed cocktails at the busy, crowded bar. Note that they have a cocktail patio outside where you can wait as well.
