Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It's hard for me to be truly impressed by bread, especially in its bare, plain form. The baguettes here, though, are genuinely splendid. The crust is perfectly tough, not too stiff or too thick, and the inside is simply delightful, with an amazing doughy taste and a cloudy, fluffy texture. The plain croissant is an impressive feat visually speaking, but they are just a tad overbunt and too flaky and dry for my taste; they are more a sight than a meal, as far as I'm concerned. The almond croissant is altogether a different matter, and it may well be the best croissant I have had anywhere in the world, bar none. The subtlety of the almond-cream filling renders it much smoother and more substantial than its regular brethren, while retaining most of its good qualities. The fruit croissant is probably something I'd love after eating a pound of brisket, as it is too sweet an affair to catch my pancreas off-guard with; the dough itself is majestic, however. The Kouign-amann was a bit tough as those things go; the dough is pretty great, but the thick sugar coating does make for a challenging bite; good, but I prefer the one Chicago's Alliance Bakery makes. I also very much like their cortado, which goes perfectly well with the holy almond croissant.
