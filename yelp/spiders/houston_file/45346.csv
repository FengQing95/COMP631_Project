Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Dislike: their tight parking, I've had to park 2 streets down. The one time I got to park in the parking lot, I had trouble getting out because 3 cars were waiting for my spot! I guess my advice is don't go at their busiest times, weekends and lunch times are surely packed, or go early! But this is a sign that Common Bond is great!
