Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Extremely adorable place! They don't have sugar free coffee syrups, or soy milk (they have house made almond milk), and only sugar in the raw or Splenda choices to sweeten your drink (that was out and available).  I wasn't impressed with the taste of the coffee or my raisin scone, both tasted burnt.  I might return and try the lunch because that looked good, and I really want to like this place.
