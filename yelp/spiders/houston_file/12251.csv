JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place has set the bar pretty high for Ramen. Thick rich broth, noodles with a slight crunch, (which can be adjusted on the order to less crunchy) and they load the bowl up unlike a lot of other ramen places who give you the bare minimum to get by. When I order ramen this is what I expect to get. Yeah this place gets crowded. It's busy and noisy, esp at night. But there is good reason. If there is a Houston top 10 ramen list going around I would except to see this place in the top 5.
