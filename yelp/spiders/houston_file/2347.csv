JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I don't know if it's just me but it felt like I was gulping oil with every bite I took. My meat was very fatty and though I ate it and didn't complain to the waitress, I feel the need to share my experience with this fish oil vitamin, they call soup. My husband and I will be sharing half the toilet seat today. I hope we have enough scented candles for todays madness.
