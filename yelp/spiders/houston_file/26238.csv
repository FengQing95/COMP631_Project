The Pit Room////Came here on a Saturday lunch. It was busy but not packed. There was booths and tables available. We ordered and shared three meats that came with 2 sides: briskets, pork ribs, pulled pork, baked beans, and elote. There were several draft beers but we opted for canned Real Ale. They had a variety of self-serviced pickled sides available: pickles, carrots, onions, jalape√±os...etc. Ribs were delicious. They had thick, charred crust that was not overpowered with pepper. The ratio of fat and lean meat was good. The brisket on the other hand was on the leaner side (The guy behind the counter did not offer us the option of fatty vs. lean). I would not recommend the pull pork. It's dry. Period. The reason why I came it 4 stars was because of their coffee bourbon bbq sauce. It's towards the sweet end but not in-you-face that makes you nauseated when combined with lots of grease. I'd drink it by itself if not were for my boyfriend. I probably had more sauce than I had of the main entree. As for the sides, elote was not that memorable but companion who was indifferent of beans in general, liked it. I would come back again. Btw, it is better than Goode Company.
