Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Online/phone check in and reservations ameliorate the LONG waits to eat here. You put in your name and they call you which is cool. Drinks were good. Different mimosas all around but they were all good. Food was amazing. French toast was the best I have tried and the breakfast sandwiches looked amazing. The key lime pancakes were too sweet for my liking but that's just my preference. Food took forever to come out (40 minute ticket times). Otherwise, it was a splendid experience and would come back again.
