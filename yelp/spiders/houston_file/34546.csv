Local Foods////Aside from the fantastic food, their customer service also stood out to me. My brother has cerebral palsy and as a result suffers with his speech, so my family and I order his meals for him at restaurants. We were ordering the grilled cheese sandwich and were having trouble figuring out whether he wanted the provolone or cheddar cheese. The guy behind the counter was SO nice and cut a slice of each cheese to show my brother, so that he could point to the type of cheese he wanted. This was SO unexpected and sweet. A restaurant that is so kind to people with disabilities and willing to go out of their way to give them a good dining experience is indispensable and to be cherished in my eyes.
