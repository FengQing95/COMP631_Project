Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Delicious cute desserts taken to the next level. They are extremely rich and decadent so I would just buy one to split with someone or else you will probably end up taking it home. Parking lot is tiny but they say there is an extra lot if you just go down the road a little further past the main lot.
