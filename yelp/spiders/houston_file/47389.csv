Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////LOVE LOVE LOVE. I fell for Snooze the second I walked in. The wait was soooo worth it. The staff is so fun and focused to give every customer an unforgettable experience. The OMG French toast literally made me tear up because of how delicious it was. My family was almost fighting over each other's plates. It was THAT good.
