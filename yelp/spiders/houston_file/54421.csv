Kata Robata////OMG! Went here for date night and it exceeded expectations. First, try to get Kristy as your server. She is adorable and every single item she recommended, we loved. Loved! Oddly enough, she didn't recommend the mac & cheese, which I was sure we would order. But we didn't. And I'm okay with that.
