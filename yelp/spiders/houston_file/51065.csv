Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the pot pie and the pancakes. The pancakes were good but the pot pie was lacking flavor the puff pastry was put together well but the turkey gravy had about 6 pieces of turkey and no flavor. This was my second visit but henceforth ill stick to omelettes and pancakes.
