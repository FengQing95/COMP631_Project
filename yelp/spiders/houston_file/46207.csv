Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////As for dessert, we tried three different kinds since it was our first time here - the cheesecake, the flourless passionfruit strawberry cake, and a caramel chocolate eclair. The only one I thought was good was the cheesecake, as this was light, fluffy, and flaked apart like snow. The only thing, however, is that it needed some fresh blueberries paired with the "maraschino" blueberries or something crumbly to offset the entire smooth texture. As for the other two desserts, both seemed like they were sitting out. The chocolate eclair mousse was dense and had that slight gel like texture around the outside, and the strawberry passionfruit dessert fell flat and dry. In fact, the layers separated right when we cut through it.
