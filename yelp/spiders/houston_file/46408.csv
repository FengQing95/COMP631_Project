Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Disappointed.  My almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and baguette were all stale.  They were all very soft like cotton textured on the exterior. It seems like the baked goods were just defrosted from the fridge. I have given common bond many opportunities to improve but it just seems to get worse and worse in quality. There is no longer the local feel from a local bakery.
