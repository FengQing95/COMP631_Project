Kata Robata////The "mixology" drink menu at the rear of the menu is pretty big and a lot of things look good. The nadir of my evening was poring over the menu for a good while, as previous drinks wore off, and I finally settled on the bloody mary. But the waiter informed they were missing ingredients. Rats! Good thing I had selected a second choice: the Hokkaido Sunset. Which is basically something you could find at Anvil, although it was missing the flaming turbinado cube on top. All in all still tasty, just at $11, I was expecting someone's pants to be impressed off. I am still wearing pants. Let's talk about the food.
