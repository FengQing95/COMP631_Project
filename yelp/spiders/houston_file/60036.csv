Baby Barnaby's////Anywho, I had the oh so tasty green eggs. Freaking yummers! I hadn't read reviews on what to get & it was a choice between the green eggs or the salmon and I was not disappointed! The green eggs are made with spinach, artichoke and cheese. The sides consisted of chicken apple sausage (double yum) and breakfast potatoes.
