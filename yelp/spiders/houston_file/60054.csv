Baby Barnaby's////I've learned my lesson that if I'm dying to go, I got to get my butt up early in the morning to beat the crowd. It's torture having to put your name on the list and wait and wait...while watching people get their delicious, wonderfully smelling food. It feels like we should almost keep this place a secret so not too many more people come. It's tough enough to go in a small group (recommended 4 or less people per group to get seated in a reasonable amount of time) because everyone wants to go!
