JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Linda - Thank you very much for the 5-star review! We greatly appreciate it. And thank you for adding your tip. There's absolutely nothing appealing about parking in Midtown, but at least we have a free parking garage connected to our establishment. There aren't many Midtown spots that can make the same claim!
