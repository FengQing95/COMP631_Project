Kata Robata////My boyfriend and I came here early on a Friday night (around 630ish) and we were surprised that it wasn't too busy. The decor was very simple yet stylish and not at all stuffy. We were given a menu by our friendly waiter, who by the way was happy to explain the menu to us. They also had a special seasonal chef menu with a few items. We decided on the Lobster Mac n Cheese, since Yelper insisted this dish was too die for and boy were you Yelpers not lying! We also ordered the Caribbean roll, Scallop Carpaccio, and Lemon Cake on a waffle cone with citrus salad. Both the scallop carpaccio and lemon cake were on the limited season menu, and our waiter insisted we get these since once the menu changes these items will be gone forever. The Caribbean roll was a pretty standard roll, nothing too special but tasted good. But that scallop carpaccio, lemon cake, and lobster mac n cheese was a definite O.M.G orgasmic experience! The scallop carpaccio was thinly sliced with a great vinaigrette dressing and was melt in your mouth delicious! The Lobster Mac n Cheese cost a pretty penny, but was pretty huge for tapas standard. It was so buttery and cheesy. My boyfriend practically licked the plate clean!
