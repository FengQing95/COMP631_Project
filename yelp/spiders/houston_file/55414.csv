Kata Robata////This place is sooooo delish. Everything I had tasted great. The foie gras nigiri was my favorite. It was so creamy with the right amount of sweetness. Also, the black sesame creme brule was something I've never tasted before. I definitely love the creative combination. Thumbs up! No complaints here except that the place was sort of noisy, but I guess it's because this place is doing well for itself. The place was super packed for a week-day night. Will definitely return for some more goodness! =)
