Baby Barnaby's////When the food arrived, it was plated very well. My entire dish was warm and very fresh. The tacos were stuffed with cheese, egg, and chorizo. The potatoes were warm and perfectly crispy yet flavorful. The black beans were some of the best I ever had. Overall, an amazing breakfast that I would wait 40 minites for over and over again. My boyfriend's dished looked equally delicious and he enjoyed it. I was stuffed after finishing, it was a perfect amount of food. The bill was less than 20 dollars, which is excellent considering the quality. I WILL be visiting again soon.
