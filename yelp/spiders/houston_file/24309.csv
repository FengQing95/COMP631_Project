Uchi////Came here on a whim and so glad that I did. It was super busy on a Thursday night, so it some time for me to grab a place at the bar, but the service was exceptional and I was offered the wine list while I waited. I gave my taste preferences to the bartender and he made some amazing recommendations. I love how a lot of the dishes are recommended that you eat them with your fingers! I had a chocolate and caramel ice cream dessert afterwards which really sealed the deal. I will definitely be back!
