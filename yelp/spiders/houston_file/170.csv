JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The service was slow and they got my order wrong. I explained to the server how it was wrong and she kept arguing with me. Finally a manager came over and asked if I wanted anything else. The server was not very friendly. Two of the dishes I tried didn't match their description on the menu.
