Kata Robata////I can't say enough good things about this place.  I have been twice and if the place was closer I would probably have been there 4 days of the week.  The food is amazing.  We had the Miso Gyoza,"Kakuni" Pork Belly, Foie Gras + Unagi, Kobe beef Carpaccio and sea urchin.  Had a couple pieces of sushi (very fresh and awesome portion of fish to rice).  That was the first trip.  The second we had almost the same thing but tried a noodle bowl from their lunch menu and it was yummy too.
