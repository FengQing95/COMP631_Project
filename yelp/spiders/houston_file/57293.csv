Kata Robata////Food here is good. We've gotten a mixture of the nigiri and sashimi. Reason why it is 4 stars and not 5 is because the rice isn't sticky rice. It kind of falls apart and hard to pick up with chopsticks. I'd recommend getting the foi gras here. It's amazing. Â  My boyfriend also really likes the chutoro
