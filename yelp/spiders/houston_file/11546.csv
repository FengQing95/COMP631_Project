JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My favorite spot to get ramen! My top two favorites are the Spicy Chicken and Cha Cha Cha but instead of pork I get chicken, I also like to add some spice to this dish. The Jinya Bun is also something interesting to try it has so much flavor. If you don't like mayo you've been warned. Jinya also has good drinks.
