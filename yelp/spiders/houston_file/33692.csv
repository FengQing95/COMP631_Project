Local Foods////This place is awesome! I had the egg sandwich with a side of quinoa and kale; everything was spectacular! The waiter explained all of the ingredients that I had concerns about-very helpful! On top of that, the wait time was less than 10 minutes during a busy lunch hour. I'll definitely see more of this place and I'd absolutely recommend. All natural foods from your local suppliers.
