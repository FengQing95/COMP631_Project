Kata Robata////Staff is rude! Used to love coming here, the food was awesome and so was the atmosphere.  Lately they think they are better than everyone else, and not in a good way. Tried to order a classic roll (had tried some of there specialty rolls and just wanted a smaller bite to eat before ending the meal).  The roll was a Philadelphia Roll in which they do not serve, instead of offering me something else as a substitute and simply saying they do not serve this roll, the employee yelled at me and told me to go somewhere else if that's the type of food I wanted.  Sadly, I will take his advice and won't be back again.
