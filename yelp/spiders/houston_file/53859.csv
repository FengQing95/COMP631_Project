Kata Robata////Monday nights might be an off night for Kata Robata as the night was hit and miss.  No specials on Monday night.  Service was good, but not great.  Our primary server was pleasant and informed, but secondary servers who brought dishes lacked polish, difficult to hear their rushed explanations of dishes.
