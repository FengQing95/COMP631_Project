Local Foods////I ordered the Crunchy Chicken Sandwich and it was pretty darn good. I really liked the pretzel bun, usually im not a fan of it since most places dont make it right but the one at Local foods is definitely the best iv ever tried!! For the sides i chose the homemade chips & the local fruit. Personally, i love fruit and the tangerine i got for my side was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G !!! I honestly was so surprised and it was the best tangerine iv ever eaten. My best friend and I ended up buying 4 tangerines Togo since they are to die for.
