JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It's a tie. Jinya and Samurai.  Appetizers were just oK, but their pork bun was amazing!! Hubby loved it.  I ordered the chef special ramen - filled with garlic flavors with loads of pork and noodles.  It was very tasty but I couldn't finish it.  We also got the traditional ramen and it was good too.  Samurai has better quality and tasty noodles while jinya has better broth.  Jinya's ambiance and service is hands down better, though.  We will be back.
