Baby Barnaby's////Tucked away in the Houston "Gayborhood", this Barnaby's location is quaint, friendly, and offers delicious food. When we first entered, we weren't sure what to do since there is no host stand or podium. You walk to the center of the patio and look for a clipboard to add your name to the waitlist to and just relax untl called. In the waiting area, there was coffee and water for you to self-serve, nice touch. We were called in less than 10 minutes and got our table outside on the patio, with our puppy Chip. The server brought over a small container for water for Chip and took our order. I had the Migas with fresh jalapenos and it was delicious. It had a slight different flavor from what I'm used to for migas, but I ate nearly all of it, even the delicious potatoes that came on the side. I asked for a side of salsa which might have already come with it, but just in case, request some when you go. The salsa was kinda smoky and really flavorful. We also had the fresh fruit and ordered the breakfast plate with chicken sausage. Chicken sausage there was delicious. The only negative thing I noticed was the congestion around the bathroom area, but wasn't a major deal. The food & service were well worth it, we will be returning.
