Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////They have a little coffee bar area which is very cute and you can watch the baristas make their morning concoctions in their little hipster way. AND THIS PLACE HAS A ZUMEX ORANGE JUICER! If you don't know what this is, it's basically the coolest and best juicer known to man. Very European (I've only ever seen it in euro) and very expensive, but it dispenses juice quickly and freshly and you get a glass of happiness! I love it and wish I could get one. /endsoliloquy/
