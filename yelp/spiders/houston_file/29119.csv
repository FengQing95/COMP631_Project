The Pit Room////I really like their meats. Both the chicken and brisket were quality and tasted great. The sides were ok except for the beans and I really don't care for their sauce. Finally, I think their prices are high. Definitely 'In The Loop' pricing. I am split on how to give an overall score. I really want to give a 2 but I won't because their meats are too good. Also, if you want to pay the prices here then that's your choice. Usually when I give a 3 that means I would come back. In this case, I don't think I will.
