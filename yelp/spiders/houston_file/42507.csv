Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Service was very friendly, though not the most efficient. At the counter, things slowed down terribly when the attendants wrote down your order on a ticket, kindly answered any questions you may have about the plethora of baked goods, and then finally filled your bag/box with the goodies you had ordered. (They'll take your entree and drink order upfront, too!). Once paying for your goodies, you receive a number and your baked goods to find a seat in the dining area. The waiters were very nice and made sure you had everything you need, although ours had a few mixups with our drink order (hopefully it's just an opening weekend thing...). For drinks, I highly recommend the caramel latte (best we've had in Houston) and the orange juice (very small serving, but freshly squeezed).
