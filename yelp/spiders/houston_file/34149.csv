Local Foods////My food was really good. I got the crispy chicken sandwich ($10) which is the same crispy chicken from benjy's, thinly sliced, and piled high with some condiments on a delicious bun. I would absolutely get this sandwich again, it was yum! Each sandwich comes with two sides. The homemade potato chips were perfect and plentiful. The potato salad was just ok and could have used some salt, but I didn't see any salt around, so I just ate it bland and all. My husband had the tuna sandwich and it was good but nothing wow. Overall, my friends all enjoyed their food.
