JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The Tonkotsu Assari was satisfying, not too salty or oily but full of flavor. The spicy version less so -- for some reason the broth was quite thick and pasty. Toppings were classic (wood ear, green onion, bean sprouts, 1 piece of pork belly, and half an egg) and I enjoyed them all. Overall, things were delicious but not amazing or unique yet and quite pricey. Looking forward to how the taste and recipes change over time.
