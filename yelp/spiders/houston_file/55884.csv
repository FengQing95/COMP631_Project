Kata Robata////We went here before a show. It is a clean and contemporary Japanese 5 star culinary experience for a reasonable price. The dishes are light, which allows you to experience many favorable dishes. We began with the octopus crudo in citrus. The octopus was not chewy and melted in your mouth. We then tried Japanese Amberjack sashimi with Foi gras- hands down the best sashimi we have had EVER. We then ordered the sashimi plate for two that had an array of fish- it was delicious. We need with the famous lobster Mac. Save this for last- as it is super filling. It was the best way to end our meal. Smooth and creamy and oh so tasty. Cannot wait to go back!
