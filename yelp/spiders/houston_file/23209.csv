Uchi////Japanese fusion with a taste of traditional at its best. Uchi has fresh selections straight from Tsukiji market in Japan. We arrived at around 6pm and there was a line, but I didn't have to wait for a long time because we were a party of 2. We ordered quite a number of dishes. The best dishes include wagyu on hot stone, hama chili, foie gras sushi, and fried milk dessert. The foie gras sushi was the BOMB! I had to order another portion cause it was that good. I think the walu-walu isn't good, it tastes just like normal fish nothing special. Overall, it was a great restaurant with great service. Can't wait to go back.
