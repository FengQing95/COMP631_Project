The Pit Room////This is my favorite BBQ place in the area! I have never had a bad experience here. It is well worth the price. Everything is made fresh and I love that you can see all of the food up close and personal while you're ordering. The staff is friendly and always willing to give recommendations. My go to order is brisket, Mac & cheese, and elote! You definitely need to try the Mac & cheese and the elote, it's amazing!!!!! Also their sauce is PERFECT!
