Uchi////I've put off writing this review for about four months now, mainly because I wasn't sure what I wanted to say about my experience. Don't get me wrong, everything was good. I love the ambiance, right down to the dim lights, but I am not sure I really appreciated their strategy or the value for my overall meal. This is not the place to come on an empty stomach, even if you are willing to shovel out whatever the costs for the price of 7+ items on the menu for maybe two people.
