Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The croissants are amazing, albeit pricey. They're still huge and an awesome treat and I will gladly pay for them any day. My favorite is the almond, but the plain and chocolate are also fantastic - you can really taste the quality of the ingredients in the chocolate one. The keugelhopf is an acquired taste and not my favorite thing on the menu, but it's worth checking out, especially if you have less of a sweet tooth. The chocolate chip cookies are fantastic (I think I prefer them to Tiny Boxwood's) and again, pricey, but huge and made with good chocolate.
