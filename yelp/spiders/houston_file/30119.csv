The Pit Room////I just had the feast for 5 for a dinner party I'm having tonight in less than an hour. It's enough food for about 2-3 people. The markets salad is so sad looking with all iceberg lettuce, brown avocado and enough dressing and toppings for one person. I'm too embarrassed to serve any of this and ordering from a neighborhood restaurant this second to make up for what was delivered to me. Was hoping this would be my go to dinner parties but will never make this mistake again.
