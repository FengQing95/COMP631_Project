Baby Barnaby's////When we arrived we waited for a table. While we were waiting another customer came in and was seated after us.   Our order was finally taken. My friend ordered corn beef hash and I ordered green eggs.  It wasn't a big deal that it took awhile for our food to arrive until I noticed the two men that came in after us were already eating.  When our food finally arrived the corn beef hash was actually their interpretation of hash. I didn't eat the green eggs because it was not good. Overall our dining experience wasn't that great. But on a positive note the fresh orange juice was really delicious.
