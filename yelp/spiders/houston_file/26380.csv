The Pit Room////I had gotten the three meal dinner with brisket, beef sausage and venison sausage. We wanted to try different meats, but since we came towards closing they ran out of most of their meats. Everything was super moist and tender. The mac and cheese was probably my favorite thing as it was SO SO cheesy. Pretty good bbq. There's plenty of seating, both indoors and outdoors!
