The Pit Room////Every list of great barbecue that I see that doesn't have Pit Room at the top is strange to me. Brisket, beef rib, sausages are standouts, but there isn't a weak link in the menu. My normal gripe with bbq places is that there isn't a good way to enjoy a reasonable portion of food, so you can only go when you're super hungry. That is not true here, because they have great taco options. It's not just the meat that is great in the tacos, even the tortillas are clearly made in house and fresh. In fact, all the sides are carefully crafted, curated. You can tell someone put an awful lot of thought into every last detail of the menu in this place.
