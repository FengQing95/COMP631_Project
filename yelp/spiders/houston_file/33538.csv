Local Foods////I wolfed down the kale salad as well. I would just order a tub of this on days when I'm feeling "healthy." The only disappointment was the white bean salad. It was not only too salty but was missing something, I'm not sure what. I'll forgive the salad as I'll be trying everything else on the menu instead.
