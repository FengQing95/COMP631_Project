Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////A little over hyped but the food is good (best things so far are the pork bennie and the peach cobbler pancake). Mimosas etc were nothing special. If it weren't for the option to leave your number and get a text when your table is ready I'm not sure I would ever have waited long enough to try it...
