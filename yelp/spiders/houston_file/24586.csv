Uchi////One of my favorite restaurants in Houston! Reservations are pretty much required unless you don't mind waiting. We have had pretty good luck with going a littler earlier and ordering a drink and waiting for two seats at the bar to open up. You can eat at the bar from the full menu. You can't order the full menu when outside on the patio.
