JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My friends and I ordered the chicken wings, edamame, gyoza, cha cha cha, white tonkotsu, and white tonkotsu spicy, and chicken ramen. They allow you to choose how spicy you want it. There is also a spicy sauce that lets you do it yourself. I think the gyoza is home-made, but it tastes like any typical gyoza. The best ramen broth out of the four is white tonkotsu. Btw, you can also choose whether you want thin or thick ramen noodles which does make a huge difference. The pork is soooo good!!!! Pork belly is my favorite and the flavor is just right.
