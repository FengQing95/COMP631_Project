Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have been waiting to eat here since they opened and finally got my chance today. Everything was amazing. The chocolate croissant was flaky, butter, and delicious. The only gripe I have is that it was too busy! We had to stand around for a little while after ordering before we could get a table.
