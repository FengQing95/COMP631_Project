Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My desire for savory pastries still goes strong, but I feel it'd be unfair not to bump the rating up to five well-earned stars after my lunch here today. I had a spectacularly tasty shrimp remoulade today with capers, avocado, and mixed greens that may well be the best shrimp salad I've had anywhere. I also had the fruit croissant again, mainly on account of the fact that it looks a bit different now (from afar, it looks like french toast on steroids), and it absolutely blew me away. Far better than the last one I'd had, with a much more delicate (but still very tasty) cherry jam and an even denser, smoother dough that nearly brought this grown man to tears. I'd like to shake someone's hand. Congratulations are in order.
