Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Cornbread Madeleines were probably my favorite because of the sweet cream berry butter. Meatloaf cubes were crispy but bland. Poutine legit had like 3 cheese curds in it and not enough gravy and fruits were totally burnt. Shrimp and grits were just okay. Chicken was dry. The sauce on the short rib was think and pretty sweet, maybe too sweet. The drunken pasta sounded good but didn't really live up to our expectations.
