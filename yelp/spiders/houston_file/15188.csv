JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Delicious ramen! This was my first time here, and I was not disappointed. I ordered the Spicy Chicken Ramen. I chose the spicy spice level. I can handle a lot of spice, and the spicy was not very spicy. I recommend ordering another round of noodles when you finish because they don't give you very many to begin with. The service is great. The atmosphere is nice, but this place is very dimly lit. It would be nice if they brightened it up a bit.
