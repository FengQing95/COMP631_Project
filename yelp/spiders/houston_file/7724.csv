JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For appetizers we usually get Spicy Creamy Shrimp Tempura. We've tried the Crispy Shrimp balls but they're not as good. A personal favorite is the Jinya Bun. The pork is tender and contrasts nicely with fresh veggies and the super light bun, but it's a little pricey for just one piece. The extensive drink menu is nice too, with a wide offering of sake and Kirin on tap!
