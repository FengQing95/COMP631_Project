Local Foods////Lots of seating. Come before 11:20 and you'll have the whole restaurant almost to yourself. Come after 11:45 and it gets pretty rustling.  Went at night on a Monday, and it was quiet and great for my small group of people to relax and enjoy our meals.  Cashiers are always pleasant, and the food comes out fairly quickly. The decor makes you want to rethink your living situation (I want an exact replica but in house living form).
