The Pit Room////Got lucky and went on a Saturday 6pm with no line! Fast cafeteria line set up, and the staff is very welcoming and accommodating if it's your first time. Got the brisket sandwich and my husband the barbacoa tacos, with sides of mac n cheese and charred okra. Everything was divine, down to the pickled veggies. The bussers were also very efficient and nice. The indoor seating seems minimal- but there is plentiful seating outdoors.
