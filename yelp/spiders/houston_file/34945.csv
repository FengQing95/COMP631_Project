Local Foods////I am a fan of pretzel bread so I selected the Crunchy Chicken sandwich (minus the dairy and added mustard) for my sides I selected the beets and housemade chips.  The sandwich was full of textures and flavor and the chicken was moist and tender.  The chips were crunchy with just the right amount of seasoning.  It is nice to see beets as a side... they were tangy and the mint adds just the right punch.
