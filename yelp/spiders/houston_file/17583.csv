Uchi////Upon waiting for our check, we watch our server, who is a white female, speak Japanese to the sushi chef, Son, who is Vietnamese.  He hands her a receipt.  I ask Son if she just spoke in Japanese and he said yes.  They all have to learn some Japanese and speak it behind the sushi bar...interesting.  I also noticed all of the servers are white, well minus a couple.  That's also unconventional in a sushi restaurant, but, the sushi chefs are all asian.  Something of no importance, it's just different.
