Local Foods////Most everything we got was blah. The duck confit sandwich - the most expensive sandwich on the menu at $15 - was super blah. They ran out of the normal bread so we substituted with pretzel bread.. which turned out to be the best part of the sandwich. The duck confit itself was pretty bland along with everything else in between the two slices of bread. The quinoa was very dry and bland as well. The mint-ade was kinda syrupy like one of those cheap juice drinks you can get at Fiesta. It was saved by adding a bit of carbonated water.
