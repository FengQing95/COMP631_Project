JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston//// I ordered a vegetarian bowl but the waitress said we couldn't swap out any of the vegetables - we had to pay $1.00 just to add corn instead of mushrooms. I found that a little ridiculous but paid the extra anyway. The vegetarian came with thin noodles and I didn't risk asking if I could swap out for the dreaded "no substitutions" line again. The noodles were just okay. The vegetables and broth were good and well seasoned. Their garlic crusher was lost somehow so they could only give me a pinch of garlic to put in my soup.
