JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Overall, ambiance of this little spot is nice. 2 bars, handful of booths and tables and 2 long community tables. Be prepared to possibly sit with strangers! Food was great, this will likely be my go to spot for Ramen in Houston. Just need to work on managing that wait list.
