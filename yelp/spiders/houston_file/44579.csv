Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It is so rare for common bond to disappoint, which is why it's so shocking when you get a pastry to go and then when you pull it out it's totally burnt!!!!! So upsetting.. this isn't unheard of though. I got one a few weeks ago that was a little burnt, but this one takes the cake. How could you?! That's an expensive little piece of ashy sugar... :/
