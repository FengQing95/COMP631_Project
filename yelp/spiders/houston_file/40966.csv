Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came here for brunch around 10:20 without a reservation. There were very few tables taken and we were asked about a reservation which we did not have. They said they could still seat us as long as we knew we had to leave in an hour and a half (not sure why it would take that long to eat brunch but we agreed).
