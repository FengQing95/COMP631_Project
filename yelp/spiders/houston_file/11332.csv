JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It was my first time here and eating ramen in general. I got the combination 1 with pork, extra hot. My friends had raved about this place for a minute and they honestly weren't exaggerating. The food was amazing!!! The only issue I had with this place was the wait time. We weren't even on the list until our whole party had arrived.
