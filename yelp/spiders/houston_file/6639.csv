JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your feedback. I would like to know a bit more about your experience if possible. You said your ramen broth lacked flavor besides salt. May I ask which ramen you ordered? The broth is the most important aspect of our ramen and we use a Refractometer to check for thickness and consistency each and every time we prepare it. If the broth clarity doesn't meet a certain grade, we don't serve it. Furthermore, you said your friend felt sick after eating at JINYA. Please know we take these types of claims very seriously, and of the few similar claims we have faced since opening this location nine months ago, we discovered that some customers' digestive systems are not accustomed to the thick and heavy nature of traditional Japanese ramen broths, especially the pork broths. Although you have already declared your intentions, I would like to invite you to come back and try something possibly better suited to your liking. And should you return, please ask for me or any of my managers (Keith, Sara or Wynne) who will take care of you.
