Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Really disappointed with this place. It was so hot and humid inside and we had small bugs flying around us the entire time we were seated. I got the benny duo and my husband got the burrito. Both items were alright but I wouldn't wait almost 2 hours for them (1 hour wait to be seated and the other for food).. There are much better options in Houston without a wait that long. Service was good for us and they do try to make your wait more bearable by providing free coffee. I most likely wont be back.
