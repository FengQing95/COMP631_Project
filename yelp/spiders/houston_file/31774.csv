Local Foods////Between the Smoked Salmon on a poppyseed bagel, the Crunchy Chicken on a pretzel bun, and the Truffled Egg Salad sandwich...I had a pretty difficult time deciding which one was my favorite. All of the flavors of the sandwiches were simply divine. Even the sides were pretty good- though I'll say that my clear favorite was the cabbage slaw. I didn't care too much for the ratatouille.
