The Pit Room////The brisket was out of this world! The meat was so tender and juicy. The sausage link was really good too. As for the sides, I had the potato salad and baked beans. Both the sides were very simple yet so delicious. I don't know what special seasonings they use, but they definitely work very well. I would definitely come back again!
