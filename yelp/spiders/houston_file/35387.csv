Local Foods////It's counter service style so you order your food, they give you a number and you find a seat. I ordered the crunchy chicken sandwich with potato chips and kale and my husband ordered the BLT with the chicken hominy soup. Everything was great! My only qualms were I wish the crunchy chicken had more of the "crunch" (its nuts basically on the bun but not very much of it) and the potato chips needed salt.
