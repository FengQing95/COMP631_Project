Baby Barnaby's////Friend and I came for brunch on Sunday (more like lunch to be honest) and was slightly daunted by the long line. Sign your name up on the notepad near the entrance and find a place to wait. We ended up having to stand for about thirty minutes, but after we got seated there were no issue. There are several 2-fer seats on the outside covered patio (where my friend and I ultimately had our meal), so I can't speak for the internal decor.
