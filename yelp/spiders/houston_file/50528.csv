Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was pretty good. I had the chili verde benny and the pancake sampler. The day that I came the had a special pancake that had strawberries and mascarpone. Â It was my absolute fave. It knocked the OMG and the pineapple upside down out of the park. It was a daily special but I think they should make it a regular menu item. I also asked for Tabasco cause and they said that they didn't carry it anymore bc it doesn't meet their standards.
