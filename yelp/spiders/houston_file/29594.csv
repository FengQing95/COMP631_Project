The Pit Room////Meat. Meat. And more meat. We both ordered the two meat plates that came with two sides. I got the ribs and the brisket. Bestie for the brisket and another meat. The brisket has this crispy crust but was so tender and delicious on the inside. The ribs was ridiculous. I'm usually not a fan of spare ribs; I prefer baby back but this ribs was just delicious. Seasoned well and Cooked beautifully.
