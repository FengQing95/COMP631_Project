Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was first introduced to Snooze on a Wednesday morning at about 9am. Those of you who have been here know that this is not a great introduction, as there was a line out the door. I scoffed at the poor, silly fools who would wait for any period of time on a weekday, holiday or not, for eggs and bacon. That day I chose not to partake.
