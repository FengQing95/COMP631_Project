Kata Robata////I would unhesitatingly recommend this restaurant, the personal service I received, including several conversations with the Chef de Cuisine, menu customization (I told them I really enjoyed uni and they gave me two courses that had it present), and exactingly high standards of food made this restaurant a really stellar meal and absolutely worth it.
