JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place has absolutely fantastic. I haven't been for a couple years and this was my first experience back. The staff was great, the restaurant itself had a cool vibe, and the food was excellent. I got the crispy chicken appetizer and the spicy chicken ramen. Definitely recommend this spot. I'd say it's definitely worth a 30 minute drive imo. Just be aware it gets really really packed on weekends. So plan for that. All in all great ramen spot with a lot of options including some vegan and impossible meat ones.
