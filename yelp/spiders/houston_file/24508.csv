Uchi////My first time here was for my 20th birthday. I reserved the large community table for a party of 10 and the management was very helpful in securing the large group. At least 3 in the group were vegetarian and Uchi has a very extensive vegetarian menu so they were all extremely satisfied. They also gave a couple complimentary items for the special occasion.
