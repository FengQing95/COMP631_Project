JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is really busy on weekends, so I recommend calling in to make a reservation beforehand. My date and I waited for half an hour to dine in here. The place was surprising small, but I like the atmosphere. The hostess is super friendly and professional. However, we got a really bad server. Everytime we asked him something, he replied with a quick ok and left. Our water was never refill. After we finished our meal, he slammed the check on our table without saying a word and continued on his way. He didn't ask us if we enjoy the meal, or if we need a box for the obvious leftover that we had on our table, or maybe even ask us if we need anything else like desserts. The food, on the other hand was really good. The tonkotsu black ramen was absolute perfection. The broth was tasty, ramen noodles was perfectly prepared, and the egg was to die for. I finished the whole bowl. The takoyaki was flavorful, but I just wish they add in a little more octopus. Overall, it was an ok experience.
