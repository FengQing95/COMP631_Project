Kata Robata////Overall a great restaurant. Convenient parking, great service, excellent food. It definitely gets busy at night, so I'd recommend getting a reservation. If i had one complaint, it would be that we were unawaringly charged for requesting extra crostini to go along with the bone marrow. Â Looking forward to our next visit!
