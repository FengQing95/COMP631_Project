Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I guess we share that "Common Bond" when we have to brave the long line before we can even catch a glimpse of their monstrous pastries or get our hands on a menu. I guess it's my fault that I've only been here during Sunday brunch, which is pretty ridiculous almost anywhere you go in the Montrose/Westheimer area. We don't even try to park in their small lot, but immediately go to the adjacent streets.
