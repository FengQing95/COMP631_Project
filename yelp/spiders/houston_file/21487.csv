Uchi////Uchi is worth saving money for perhaps a special date or business dinner. If you're hoping to be impressed, they will certainly do exactly that. Simply stated, Uchi elevates sushi, sashimi/nigiri beyond what you would expect. If you're budget minded, you might want to try another sushi bar but if you are seeking a true fine dining experience, Uchi is a never miss gem in the heart of Montrose/Westheimer. The menu selections are not cheap by comparison to most other similar places, however it is the high-quality cuisine and fine attention to detail you would expect in relation to cost. Yet, it is this exquisite experience of savory flavors (including familiar favorites and unique signature creations) that gracefully combine to make Uchi an easy winner.
