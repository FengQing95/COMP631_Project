Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Chorizo + potato benedict - This was not what I was expecting. The description was, "Milk biscuit, slow cooked egg, fried chicken hollandaise". The dish came in a skillet with potatoes, mixed with chorizo & onions, a fried bun, and a poached egg on top. Â The 'milk biscuit' is more of friend bread. I was thinking the flakey biscuits you would typically get. I guess I should have asked for clarification. Nothing special.
