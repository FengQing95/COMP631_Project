JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have only been to about 3 or 4 ramen places. This being the fifth if I am not mistaken so I am not a ramen pro. Only writing the review because this place stuck out and not in a bad way. This place had the best ramen i had ever tasted. Even their french fries were good. I don't think I can make a bad comment on the food here. Anyway on to the food.
