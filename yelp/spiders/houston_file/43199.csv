Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If I may diverge a moment, from croissants back to relationships...the most fruitful seem to be symbiotic, consisting of constant tug and pull, tug and pull, with one entity never dominating the other. A bit of sweet pastry juxtaposed against bitter espresso with a view of Dunlavy Blvd under Houston's unrelenting sun. The drip of sweat down my black v-neck, how I lament that those I love are not here. How bittersweet. How perfect Common Bond exemplifies life. Be it lump blue crab over avocado toast, or their croque-madame, its velvety farm egg yolk spilling over gruyere...Oh, how I spill over for Common Bond.
