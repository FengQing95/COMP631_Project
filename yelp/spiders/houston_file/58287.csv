Baby Barnaby's////This is a great little restaurant.  I had their famous green eggs (2 eggs scrambled with spinach, artichoke, onions, cheese - maybe more) and I understand why they're famous for them - yummy! Apple chicken sausage was good - bit of a kick to it. They serve their own brand of organic coffee which is very good (even offer you a "to go" cup when leaving!).  I'm here (Houston) on business and sought this place out for a good breakfast based on other Yelp reviews.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is beause no one seems to be in any hurry to take your order, process the payment, etc.  The staff seem to share all the tables (one seated me, another brought me coffee, another took my order, and yet another gave me the bill).  If you're at all in a hurry, eat somewhere else.  I wasn't in a hurry but was a bit perplexed by how long everything took.  In short, food and atmosphere are top notch - service is laid back, a bit too far back for some tastes.
