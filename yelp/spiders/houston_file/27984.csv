The Pit Room////Visiting Houston for a week and friends here are asking if I want to go try some Asian food since I am Asian, but come on!!! I come from Vancouver where we have awesome Asian food scene. The very food I am excited about Texas is its BBQ, Tex-Mex and steak! I tried to a few BBQ places in Houston including Brookstreet, but they were quite disappointing. They were nothing special.
