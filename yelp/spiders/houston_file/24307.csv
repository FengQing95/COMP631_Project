Uchi////We also got two of the rolls but I can't remember what they were called but one was with salmon and the other one with yellowtail. All I remember is that they were absolutely yummy. We also got the eggplant dish that is on the sake social and I really enjoyed it. The social short rib was also very tasty - although I have a bias for meat.
