Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I visited Common Bond for brunch this weekend and Do not regret it. Great environment. Good food. Good service. I had the French toast which was good, a tad bit on the dry side but it was still a pretty good dish. I also had the Nutella latte and it was delicious! I was even craving it the next day. I look forward to returning soon!
