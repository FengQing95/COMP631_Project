Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My first time eating here and the food was off the charts delicious. Everything in the case looks so tasty and fresh. I had the chicken torta sandwich and it was incredible.  The pulled chicken was seasoned very well and the bread was perfect. It's one of the best sandwiches I have ever had truly. Great flavor and just the right amount of spices. My only wish is that their menu was bigger.  Would be nice if they offered more selections.  Otherwise, it was perfect.
