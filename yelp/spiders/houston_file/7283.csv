JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the spicy chicken ramen... it was good but it smelled and tasted a-lot like chicken and I think it's was a small plate for the price but overall nice experience and would like to go there again and try something else. Also got the tempura Brussels sprouts and those where good!
