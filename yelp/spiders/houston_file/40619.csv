Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Good food, great atmosphere and very inviting staff. Portions were smaller than I would have expected for the price, but times are tough so I understand. Lastly, the bacon used in the Bloody Mary drinks and with the "breakfast in bed" shot sits out freely on the counter just waiting for Covid to jump on it . Yuck.
