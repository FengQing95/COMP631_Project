Local Foods////Everything we ordered was very good, and a few things were just exceptional.  I had the truffled egg salad sandwich on pretzel bread.  OH. MY.  So good!  The egg salad itself was good, but the dance of flavors in the whole sandwich was just divine.  The pretzel bread was a major part of that.  I would have bought several loaves if it had been for sale!  I'm not sure what else was on it (they list greens, but there were more flavors - perhaps including some parm?), as I didn't want to take the time to take it apart.  But it was a divine combination.
