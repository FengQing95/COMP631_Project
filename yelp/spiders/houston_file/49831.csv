Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My husband and I absolutely loved this place and can't wait for a reason to go back (we live kinda far). I got the tacos, which were to die for and the blueberry danish pancakes. My husband got the chocolate peanut butter pancake, avocado Benny with hash brown, and the chai tea and he was in love.
