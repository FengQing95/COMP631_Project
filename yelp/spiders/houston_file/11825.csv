JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great ramen, but it's often so busy that the wait can be waaay too long. I used to get the Spicy Chicken bowl and add a seasoned egg, bok choy and fresh garlic. The last time I went, I had the Cha Cha Cha and it was EVERYTHING! The broth was perfect and filled with flavor!
