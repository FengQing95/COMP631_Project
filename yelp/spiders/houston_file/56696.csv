Kata Robata////Of all the different sushi restaurants in Houston, Kata Robata is definitely up there. The ingredients are fresh and service was great! My only complaint was the status of the restrooms (it definitely needed attention as the ground was wet in the stalls and the sinks leaked & dripped water all over my feet) as well as the noise level (I could barely hear myself talk).
