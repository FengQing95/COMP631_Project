Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////When my friend and I came, we weren't really in the mood for anything sweet but weren't hungry enough for a full meal. We ended up ordering the daily selection of bread. It only cost $4, which was a great deal, and we got so much bread that we had to take half of it home with us. The baguette and cranberry bread were good, and the olive bread was delicious. We also loved the different butters and jam it came with.
