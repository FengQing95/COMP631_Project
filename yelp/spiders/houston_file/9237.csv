JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have come here for both lunch and dinner and both times have enjoyed my meal. While the wait time for dinner may be a bit longer depending on your arrival time and the day of the week, my experience with the wait time at lunch was relatively fast. This ramen restaurant is surprisingly much larger than others I have been to and would be fun with a group of friends as well.
