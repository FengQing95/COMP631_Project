JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Normally I looooove the spicy vegan ramen but I ordered take out tonight and it came with hardly any broth and seemed super watered down. Like hardly any soy milk in it/almost translucent and 0 flavor. They do have a super yummy quinoa salad and tofu salad though, that I think was added recently. Those are wonderful, but after a 10 hour shift I was reaaaally bummed about the ramen
