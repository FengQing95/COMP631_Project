Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The almond croissant was also so good! Almond croissants are my go-to pastry but only if they have almond paste inside. This one has almond paste. The croissant was crispy on the outside but fluffy and soft inside. The almond paste was sweetened just enough and it wasn't cloyingly sweet like the pistachio one.
