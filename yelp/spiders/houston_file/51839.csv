Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We came of a Wednesday morning so there was no line at all. There are so many options for breakfast but we got the snooze classic (made vegan), Benny duo and the pot pie. The eggs are perfectly runny. The snooze classic had potato hash, sour dough bread and jam, soyrizo and tofu scramble. The tofu scramble was seasoned very well and was flavorful. The soyrizo was quite good but I found that there was too much of it. I wish the bread was toasted a little more. Breakfast at snooze is an amazing value for the cost. I definitely recommend it!
