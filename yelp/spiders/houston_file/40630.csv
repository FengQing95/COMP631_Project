Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Brought my friend from out of town here for brunch on a Saturday and it was a great decision. I love the vibe here. Sat at the bar and ordered mimosas. They didn't take very long to kick in so that was great. The food is delicious and the service is amazing. I look forward to coming back.
