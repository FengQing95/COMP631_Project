JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the spicy tonkatsu. It was flavorful, creamy but a bit too spicy for a balanced taste. I recommend getting the regular tonkatsu and adding spices that is available at your table. I love it that they give you additional sauces at your table for you to personalize your ramen.
