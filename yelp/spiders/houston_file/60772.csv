Baby Barnaby's////Food aside, the service was pretty meh. I expected a lot more from all the raving and hype around this establishment. After skipping the long wait, we had to flag down a waitress to order our food (after 15-20 minutes of sitting around). And then, my orange juice literally took 50 minutes to come out. EVEN THOUGH the couple who arrived 45 minutes after us got their drinks first. It was pretty busy, and they only had one waitress to cover the entire outdoor seating. I understand the struggle, but still, 50 minutes for a drink is ridiculous; I was finished with my meal by the time it came out, and I had asked to cancel it, but she misheard and brought it out anyways. Also, the returned check came back with a wrong receipt. By this point, we were pretty frustrated with the service, so we paid and left ASAP, only realizing afterwards that they had never given us back our credit cards. Overall, nice place and food. But they definitely need to step up their service.
