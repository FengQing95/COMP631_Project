Uchi////So is it perfect? No. I have two concerns. The cooked items are very favorable. Almost too strong. They can do a much better job by toning down the flavor of their cooked dishes. Second is the lighting of the restaurant. The light is a killer of their great presentation. Of course some seats have a better lighting. Ask for a place with a spot light. As you can see, I used flash to get the food color out. It is too dark and this is not a great idea for Japanese food.
