JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Delicious! Went on a Thursday night and waited about 10 minutes before being seated. It was definitely the place to be, it was packed when we got there and when we left. Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. I had the chicken ramen and my friend had the vegetarian ramen. Both were delicious and very filling. Would definitely go back again!
