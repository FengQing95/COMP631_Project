Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Pulled pork hushpuppies (2.5/5): I appreciated the creativity with this dish. Instead of your standard hushpuppies, these are hushpuppies on steroids that are stuffed with pulled pork. These oversized bad boys were pretty dry which took away from the dish. They do give you a dipping sauce, which helps, but it was not enough to overcome the barren desert.
