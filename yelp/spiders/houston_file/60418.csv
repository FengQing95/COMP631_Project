Baby Barnaby's////This is a true gem! I am in town visiting from upstate NY and we stumbled on this place for breakfast one morning, and I am so glad I did! Outstanding service, the manager/owner working his butt of right along with his staff was a nice thing to see. Every employee was engaging and kind and truly a step above most places I have been. Do yourself a favor and come here! Might have a slight wait to sit but trust me it's worth it. And try those honey biscuits!!!! Bravo on an amazing place!
