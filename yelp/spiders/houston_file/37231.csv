Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I will say that for me, personally, the noise level was a little too loud for me; I also have mildly impaired hearing and I was sitting right across from my friend but I was basically having to yell at him to talk. Granted, it was also very jam packed that night, along with at least one or two big parties going on.
