Local Foods////As far as the service and dining environment, A+++!! Especially the service... Everyone's so nice. One time I was here, the cashier generously gave me a free chocolate strawberry for no apparent reason. The dining area is spacious and modern too. Sometimes I just come here to eat by myself and read a book when I want a me-date because the atmosphere is so agreeable.
