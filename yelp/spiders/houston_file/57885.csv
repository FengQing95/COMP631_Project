Kata Robata////I've heard amazing things about Kata Robata so I went in with high expectations. First off, I love a dark ambiance especially for dinner which is what Kata has. Our waiter was also very attentive and checked on us often. Food wise, I wouldn't say that it lived up to the hype per say but I would definitely come back. The sushi was great quality and the vibes were nice. I highly recommend the first roll in the picture, with white fish and Serrano. Not sure of the name!
