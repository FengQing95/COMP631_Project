JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Although parking and waiting in line for service are probably the pain in the ***. We parked in the garage behind Jinya, the high fashion something garage, as I remembered. I'm not pretty sure Jinya is included in this parking lot, because I did not see its sign in the front of the garage. In case somebody asked you which restaurant you came here for, just say you dine at Raku (like i did), then you're safe and sound. I know they do valet parking for Jinya in this same parking lot, but not sure if we're allowed to park ourselves here. If you plan to come here in big group (10+), you definitely have to wait for at least 30 minutes. If you come as 2, 3, or 4, you'll get to your turn pretty quick, on the bright side.
