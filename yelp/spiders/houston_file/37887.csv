Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I absolutely love the ambience in Bosscat. I've always have had excellent service when I go and the Cajun chicken is super good. Even when they made a mistake they were quick about correcting it while the manager apologized. They truly cared and that goes a long way in this business. If you go for brunch get the fruity pebble French toast! Â I'll definitely go back.
