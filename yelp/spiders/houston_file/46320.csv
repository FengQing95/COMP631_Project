Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Yes, Common Bond continues to offer the best Kouigan Aman I've ever had. I felt I owed it to you all to return for a triple-check and quality confirmation Â This buttery, chewy pastry with layers of flavor rocks my world every time. I always find myself trying to scheme up ways to take a dozen home, freeze them, somehow not gain weight and celebrate their magic over and over again. Alas, I'll savor these few visits we have every year.
