Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I got the blood orange cream puff. The puff itself is much denser and heavier than the regular pate choux dough and it took some knife handiwork to split the top without making a mess of the cream. The citrus custard was good- bright and light without being overly sweet. The whipped cream, however, smelled too milky to the point it smelled cheesy, which kept me from finishing the dessert. The chocolate croissant has a nice flavor, buttery and flaky. But finding the chocolate is like mining for gold. A mini nugget here and there. C'mon man. It's a chocolate croissant, not croissant with essence of chocolate. Their macarons are airy and light and crisp nicely upon biting. The cream is smooth and stayed moist. They also had a nice scent too, but the flavors were too sugary for my taste.
