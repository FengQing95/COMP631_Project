JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya has been by far the best ramen noodle restaurant I have gone to. I have tried several other places such as tiger den and ninja, but this one definitely blows the rest out of the water! The noodles are cooked to perfection and the broth is very milky and flavorful. I have tried several of them but the spicy chicken ramen and fried chicken karaage are definitely my favorite. The extra toppings are a plus, but it can get pretty pricey sometimes. Overall, the restaurant has a great atmosphere with great food. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
