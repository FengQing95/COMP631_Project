Kata Robata////I'd never had robata anywhere before and this experience was 10/10; I had the chance to try so many new and interesting dishes! I'd heard so much about this restaurant and it definitely lived up to the hype. It's a lovely atmosphere for a date night (even though it can get a little noisy!). Â
