Baby Barnaby's////Set in the Montrose neighborhood, this tiny cafe is great for a lazy morning watching people as you wait for your table. It can get very crowded so you might not want to go when you are absolutely starving. The potatoes are what I remember the most for some reason, but everything was excellent.
