Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We came here on a Saturday afternoon to have some coffee and some of the nice treats I read about pn yelp. I really like the interior and the coffee and the cappuccino were pretty good. But unfortunatly the only sweet stuff they were offering was a cookie, two different cakes and somw macarons. The counter was nearly empty. I am not sure if we just came too late, but at 3.30 pm they should still have some more pastries.
