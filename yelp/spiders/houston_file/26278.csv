The Pit Room////I really want to like this spot because the neighborhood is saturated with a lot of mediocre cue. My first visit left me disappointed so I waited a few months to return. The food has improved but still, for me, everything missed the mark. The brisket and turkey both tasted over-smoked and lacked a tenderness and moistness. The macaroni was too salty to eat. The barbecue sauce had a very off-putting tomato paste aroma and flavor that overpowered everything. The chili was rather bland. I'd like to try the beef ribs, but I'm not ready to invest the $22 based on what I have tried. The restaurant is beautifully-designed, and the complimentary offerings of pickled vegetables are a great touch. They have an awesome selection of beverages and the staff was so friendly that at one point I had everyone in line talking to me at once. I'm hoping they continue to grow and improve.
