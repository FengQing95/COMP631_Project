Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The line was extremely long so if u r in a hurry you might not want to wait. But all the bakery was just amazing! And the environment is so nice! We were heading to another place after so we didn't sit in and eat but next time we will definitely try out brunch there.
