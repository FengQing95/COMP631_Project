Local Foods////Came here on a Saturday during peak lunch time and surprisingly it wasn't packed like during the week. This place is definitely worth coming to in off times. The food is fresh, and delicious. And for a sandwich and 2 sides (especially a great sandwich) ~10-12 bucks really isn't that bad.
