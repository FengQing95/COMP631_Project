Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food/Drink: Snooze has many breakfast cocktails to choose from, including many types of Bloody Mary's and mimosa flavors. The White Peach Bellini was refreshing and not too sweet. My friend got the Bangkok, which she said was a little salty compared to average bloodys. I got the Ham Benedict III and substituted the hash brown for a side of the OMG French Toast (w/o coconut shavings). The eggs Benedict was very flavorful! The french toast was to die for and the caramel sauce had just the perfect hint of burnt undertones to it. The portion sizes were filling and not overwhelming like other breakfast spots.
