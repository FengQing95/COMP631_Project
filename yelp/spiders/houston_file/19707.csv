Uchi////The fried milk. You'll have to call it Mr. Dairy, first name Muthafukinlegend. Oh sweet perfection. This was the best possible way to end a meal. Toasted milk pastries topped with iced milk gelato, with a block of chocolate milk mousse, and a couple flakes of fried cacao oil, and sprinkled with crunchy corn flour. Combine in any way your imagination fancies. This is one dessert you should never pass up.
