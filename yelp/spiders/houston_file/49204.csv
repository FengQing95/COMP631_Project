Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Visited on a Sunday around 9am. The wait was about 45 minutes - not too bad and there is a texting system so we were able to wait in our cars. Parking is not so great . There is a small lot in front of the establishment, but there was a decent amount of street parking at this time. Upon entry, I noticed the inside was extremely small and folks were waiting in line near the tables which is a little awkward if your table is near the front. Our server was amazingly sweet! A few minutes after we ordered our food we were gifted with a complimentary pancake! I don't really care for foods that are super sweet, but this pancake was delicious ! Will definitely visit again around the same time. Later on the line outside grew much longer !
