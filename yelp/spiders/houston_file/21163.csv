Uchi////- service! Ok so... Isn't service supposed to suck when food is this high on the scale? It seems not. NO pretentiousness and in fact, the most chill and happy staff I have ever seen (makes sense... EVERYONE dining is happy. You look around and EVERYONE is simply shocked and ecstatic). Sushi chefs are happy, having fun, VERY skilled, and simply perfect. Both times the server was FAR better then most places I have been... Ever.
