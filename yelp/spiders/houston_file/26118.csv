The Pit Room////The service was top notch. Friendly and welcoming. They asked us if we needed more bread (two small kids in tow) and extra plates. They also offered to help us to the table with our trays which was much appreciated. The gentleman manning the dining area to bus tables and such was really nice and helpful. He pointed out where we could find the water and stopped by our table more than once to check and see if we needed anything.
