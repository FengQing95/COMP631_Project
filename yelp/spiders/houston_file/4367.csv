JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Torn between 3-4 on this. Ultimately decided on 4. I can't deny that the food is delicious--generally speaking. The ramen's actually somewhat passable (which says A LOT for Houston), but overhyped for the quality if you know your ramen. Solid broths. Their noodle game is a bit weak, but I can only speak for the "thin" noodles. The thin noodles just don't hold onto the broth or other collect the other ingredients well. I keep forgetting to order them thick and see if those are better.
