The Pit Room////I was in the Houston, TX area this past holiday weekend for business and of course with any new travel to a new location I look for the greatest places to eat of course via IG lol. I'm happy I went here and saw what all the hype was about. Very long lines, but it was worth the wait as the line moved fast. Food was good! And service was excellent. Highly recommend ‚Äç
