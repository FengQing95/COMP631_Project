Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I definitely recommend this place for brunch for a group of friends. There were some kids there during Sunday's brunch but families appeared to be Â placed more towards the back of the restaurant so they weren't so close to the DJ. Although good Sunday Funday music was definitely consistently playing throughout the space. There was also music playing in their awesome, gender neutral, private restrooms. However, their services was a little slow on taking our orders but owner, Leslie came to our table to help us out. Our server was a little slow on refilling our champagne glasses, so I was surprised they didn't bring a carafe for the table since we ordered bottomless mimosas. However, later co-owner, John, came by with a carafe.
