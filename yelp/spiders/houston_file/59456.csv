Baby Barnaby's////This place is cool. Not somewhere that I have to go back to. Orders a breakfast that came with scrambled eggs and cheese bacon grits and a biscuit. Also ordered the pecan pancake. The cheese literally looked like it came out the bag and was dropped on the eggs on the way out the kitchen. No melting. No nothing. I was completely turned off so can't say how the egslgs were. The grits were bad. Tried to add seasoning and butter but they were just horrible. Now the bacon was awesome. And that pecan pancake was awesome. It had apples baked into it. If I ever decided to go back just would get bacon and the pancake. The service was a bit shabby. The place is small and it's weird. Not really a spot I need to go to again.
