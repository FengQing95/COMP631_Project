Uchi////This is probably my favorite restaurant in Houston.. not just because of the food (which deserves 5 stars alone), but also because of how helpful, friendly, and informative the waiters are.  With an eclectic menu like theirs, it can often be difficult to decide what dishes to get, and some ingredients aren't common.  The waiters were so great about explaining everything, recommending dishes based on your personal taste, etc.
