Uchi////You will be spending some money here and rightfully so. The Japanese style dishes are very artistically creative and here they offer so much more in the heart of Westheimer Uptown. You should make a reservation or else you're risking a long wait. I recommend visiting this place for a starter beer or 2 and trying out of dishes as an appetizer and then finishing off dinner at a place with more hearty choices.
