JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Today I decided to finally try JINYA for lunch and I was not disappointed! I ordered the JINYA Tonkotsu Black ramen that had an excellent broth and depth of flavor. The meat was tender and juicy, and complemented the broth very well, as did the other toppings. I thought it was a bit odd that the egg was not cut in half, as I normally see in other ramen places, but it was delicious and perfectly cooked. I also loved the texture of the noodles - they definitely weren't soggy but weren't too crunchy - it was the perfect in-between state.
