JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Kiet - Thank you for your review. Please know that you can always inform your server at the time of your meal that if you dislike our food for any reason, our chefs will remake your dish or offer something different that might better suit your palate. In this case, we can always prepare your ramen with "Less Salt." This particular parameter, similar to spice level, is highly subjective and every customer reacts differently. Regardless, we appreciate your visit and your taking the time to review us.
