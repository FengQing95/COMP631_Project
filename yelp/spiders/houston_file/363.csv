JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Really good ramen this side of Japan (better even than some of the places touted as great in NYC).  Noodles are the right texture and the broth is rich. I would recommend trying the traditional bowl if you've never had ramen before and then working your way to the more exotic ones from there.  Of note, there is a ginormous communal table in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by individual tables around the sides so it can get a little noisy at peak meal times - maybe not the best place for an intimate date, but great for a group.
