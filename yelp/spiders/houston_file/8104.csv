JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Before I visited Jinya, I kept hearing comparisons between Jinya and Tiger Den. Not having been impressed at all by the blandness of my Tiger Den experience, I was pretty skeptical about Jinya... The fianc√© has been raving about Jinya though, so I finally went and am now hooked! Definitely my go-to place for ramen cravings from now on. The only thing missing on their menu is the brothless creamy ramen that Ninja Ramen carries, but their super extensive menu options more than make up for it.
