Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Everyone seemed to like what they had--the chorizo+potato Benedict, Sunday scramble, and short rib chilaquiles were served in personal-sized skillets that appeared tiny compared to a usual plate but were fairly rich and filling. The chicken fried steak was huge and neither of the two big guys who ordered it could finish it! The simple burger was also huge and delicious; it didn't come with fries as a default. I had the avocado chop salad with chicken and it was surprisingly delicious for how (relatively) healthy it was!
