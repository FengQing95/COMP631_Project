The Pit Room////I ordered the three meat platter that comes with two sides. I tried the brisket, chicken, and beef sausage along with the coleslaw and beans. Since we were there at slow time of day, the chef himself was out of the kitchen and instead making friendly small talk and offering his advice on what to order. This was a nice touch which I appreciated especially compared to some of the older BBQ establishments in Houston which make me feel a bit like cattle.
