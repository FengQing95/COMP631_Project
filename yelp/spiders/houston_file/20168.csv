Uchi////I thought I was going to drop a buttload of cash on this place, and don't get me wrong, you can definitely spend spend spend here, but the happy hour here is actually a really good deal.  Some of the items can be lacking in size on the HH menu (like the walu walu) which is expected.  However, it was still really good.  The rolls on the HH menu were also a good deal, and 3 dollar sake?!?!  Where else can you find that?  Service was very nice and it was a great experience overall.
