JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love love Ramen! I went here about a week ago, yes the wait sucks, but worth it. However, sometimes the broth isn't consistent, if you go to the JINYA in Spring, there broth is so flavor some . I would recommend trying all their ramen lol, but mostly the spicy chicken Â and sprouting up ramen. I hope they open more locations, it would be convenient!
