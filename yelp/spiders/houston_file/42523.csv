Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////And yet, I'm still giving four stars, because the chocolate croissant here is really spectacular (and everything else looks fantastic).  It tastes of nothing but delicious, fresh, fragrant butter; the layers are crisp and manifold; the chocolate a little bitter and dark.  If I had to complain about it, I'd say it's a little  too rich and a little too big - I like my croissants more bready than this and a little smaller - but that's a niggle.  This is the best breakfast pastry in Houston.  Game over.  It might be the best croissant I've eaten in America. Just to be clear, I've eaten a lot of croissants.
