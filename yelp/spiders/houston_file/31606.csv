Local Foods////I would have given this place 5 stars based on their smoked salmon bagel alone but I am basing this review on my overall experience. Food=5 stars for freshness and creativity. My coworker and I split the crunchy chicken on pretzel bun, smoked salmon bagel, sides: Cous cous, kale, potato salad, and watermelon. We didn't care for the sides but the cosy cous was the best aside from the watermelon. The smoked salmon was the best of the 2 sandwiches.We didn't like the crunchy chicken- it was soggy and we thought it was a crispy chicken breast but instead it was more similar to the texture of canned chicken breast... Atmosphere=4 I went at lunch time around 1:30p there wasn't any place to sit so we took it to go. It's bright and airy in there. Service=1 the lady was not welcoming. It was our first time and she didn't smile nor give recommendations. In fact, she seemed annoyed as we were trying to decide on whether we were going to eat there or take out. Plus, 2 customers who ordered slightly after us got their food to go before ours... Therefore- I would really give this place an overall 3.5 if there were half stars. Food good/ service not impressed!
