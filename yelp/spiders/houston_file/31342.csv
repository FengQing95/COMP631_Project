Local Foods////Local Foods exceeded my expectations. So delicious and loved the atmosphere. I had the gulf shrimp and blue crab sandwich made into a salad along with sides of kale and quinoa--very fresh and yummy. My friend had the crunchy chicken with sides of turnips and barley. He loved the chicken sandwich on the pretzel bun and of the sides we shared our favorites were the barley which had brussel sprouts and the quinoa. The portions are unexpectedly but pleasingly large and easily sharable. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The only thing I'd request is the nutritional information which the guy behind the counter mentioned that that was on their to-do list for the future. Will be back soon!
