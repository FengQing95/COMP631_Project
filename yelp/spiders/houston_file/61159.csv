Baby Barnaby's////Amazing brunch. My friend got the wings and waffle which is not on their menu but on the chalkboard menu inside for whatever reason. Also check the chalkboard for pancake flavors. I got the lemon ricotta pancake which was everything you want in pancake plus kind of the flavor of a lemon square. It was amazing. Back to wings and waffle. The wings were some of the best I've ever had. They are spicy and don't need sauce. Chicken is cooked to perfection. Only complaint is that I kinda wanted to get a savory dish with a side of sweet (like the migas with a tiny pancake on the side) and it's not really an option. You can however do a sweet dish with a side of savory which is what I ended up doing since I got the bacon with my pancake. I was able to park in the lot for the restaurant but otherwise you can find street parking. The wait for 2 of us on a Sunday at 11:30 was about 15 minutes.
