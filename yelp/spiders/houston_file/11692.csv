JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jessica - Thanks for your review. I agree parking is a huge issue for the entire neighborhood of Midtown, probably more so than in most other congested parts of Houston. I wish our city planners could have used more forward thinking in terms of zoning and urban layout. Alas, this is the hand that we have been dealt, and I would ultimately say that our parking situation is not great, but it's also not completely abysmal.
