JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We tried the octopus balls appetizer. It was good! The white sauce underneath and the brown sauce drizzled on top made it better- without it, the balls would have been pretty plain. They were well cooked, perfectly fried, and a good texture. The brown sauce had a sweet tinge to it. The whole thing went perfect with gyoza sauce.
