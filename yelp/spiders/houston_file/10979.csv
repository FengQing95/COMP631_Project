JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ate here for the first time with my boyfriend last night and the ramen did not disappoint! I got the tonkotsu black while he got tonkotsu white, both with thin ramen noodles (you can easily exchange it for thick noodles if you'd like). The black didn't have much of an initial kick unlike the white but the aftertaste was absolutely delicious for both. The meat melts in your mouth, and much to my surprise, there was some spiciness to it too. The eggs are also perfect. It was definitely a fulfilling meal!
