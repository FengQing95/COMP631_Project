Uchi////Spectacular! From the ambiance, to the service, to the food. Nothing but simple perfection. When I go to a fine dining restaurant, I expect an experience, not just a meal. I'll tell you, this was an experience. If you haven't been, please, treat yourself! With that said, bring your pocket book because this is not a cheap or moderate place to enjoy.
