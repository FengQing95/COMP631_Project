The Pit Room////The song that comes to mind is, "Flintstones, meet the Flintstones" Be prepared to struggle with parking and find seating but I think it's worth it if you like meat. The prehistoric looked beef ribs are divine. Often times bbq places that are great at their meat often fail on the sides. This places does both well. Â They stick to the basics. I'll come back... as long as someone else is driving.
