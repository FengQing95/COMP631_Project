Kata Robata////Ambient lighting and great place for a fun night with your girls or a fun and romantic evening with that special someone. Love, love, love the food:) Very packed on Thursday evenings. It's probably best to make a reservation, although I have done that last time and they accidentally placed me for the wrong time. The staff and sushi chefs are always very sweet and professional. It was my boyfriends birthday so I had reserved a certain table for dinner but they marked us for the wrong time and it wasn't available when we had came in. But they were very sweet to sit us at another. We ended up asking to sit off near the booth area, which I recommend or at the sushi bar if you want to fully hear and enjoy your conversation along with your dinner. The waiters and waitresses are always very sweet and observant. Dinner was great as usual and they even offered a birthday dessert on the house. So sweet! :) always love their service, scenery and great food. Definitely recommend a visit if you're looking for a romantic and fun environment with great asian and beautifully prepared Â dishes. Will be coming again!
