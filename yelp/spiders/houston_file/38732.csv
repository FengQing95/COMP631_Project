Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I met some clients here for lunch and glad that I picked this place. The food was great the service was too. I ordered Brussels sprouts And fries for the table and omg! I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup and it dint disappoint! I can't wait to come back and try their cocktails.
