JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'll keep it short! All the hype is true this place is amazing. My boyfriend and I are vegetarian and he got the veggie one and I got the creamy spicy vegan with a poached egg extra spicy. His was eh it was ok but the vegan ramen is literally the best vegetarian ramen in houston. I've been to a ton of ramen bars in houston and most places have vegetarian ramens as an afterthought and they're either bland or just a weird mix of ingredients. It was flavorful the noodles were chewy the broth was amazing the ingredients were amazing I just overall loved it! We also had the tempura artichokes which were so delicious. We came on a Sunday night and got quoted a 30 min wait but got seated in about 15 and were in and out in less than 45 minutes. The only thing stopping me from only eating here is it gets a bit pricey, our two ramens and appetizer brought the total to around 40
