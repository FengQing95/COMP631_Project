Local Foods////I came here after tennis so I was famished and just ready to devour anything that came my way. I ordered the crunchy chicken sandwich and chicken posole soup. I'm already salivating as I writing this review.. it was ah-mazing. Both were generous portions but the real winner was the soup, it was just yummy goodness. It was broth based and just a lot of everything in the soup (poblano, hominy, and cilantro) I'm basically a sucker for anything that has cilantro, it's so refreshing.
