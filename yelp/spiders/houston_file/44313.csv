Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My sister is the type of person to disregard any hype for a restaurant/bakery/etc, but she brought home Common Bond croissants for my family and could not stop raving about them. I figured I would check out the caf√© and get a fresh croissant with a friend who was leaving town.
