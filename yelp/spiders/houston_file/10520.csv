JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I tried the crispy chicken and shrimp toast. Crispy chicken was quite good (4/5) and shrimp toast was OK (3/5). For ramen I took tonkatsu with fried onion extra topping...liked the flavor and all but probably needed to increase the spice level little more next time. Did not like the thin noodles it came with - maybe next time I would substitute with thick noodles. Ramen is a 3/5.
