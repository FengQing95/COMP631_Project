JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We always go during the lunch hour and even though it is packed they somehow seat us in no less than 5 min.  The Ramen is the best I've had in Houston.  Fresh ingredients, with so many choices of ingredients.  We are always satisfied and at a very reasonable cost.  I'll keep coming back as long as the quality of the broth stays rich and the ingredients stay fresh!
