Baby Barnaby's////I went to the restroom and crossed paths with her and she took the opportunity to say obnoxiously loud to a server, "it's so cold out there!" (she's a method actor, I assume, so the arm warming and unwarranted shivering was once again performed). Worth noting: Â I waited tables for years and I understand the feeling when you're 20 minutes from close and a party of seven walks in (groan). But you don't get to treat that table like they're the bane of your existence.
