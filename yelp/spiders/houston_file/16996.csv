JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Service was exceptional. We went on a Sunday around 6pm. It was packed short 5min wait and we were able to sit down. My friend ordered the JINYA bun she said it was very good. I ordered the caramelized cauliflower not very sure which part was carmalized but i ended up adding some seasoning from the table on them and it was super good! I also ordered the Vegan bowl. Initially when they brought it out the flavor was bland... i added some hot sauce from the table and it turned out fantastic! i would definitely go back just to get that bowl again and again! Also they give u ALOT of food so be prepared for to-go. overall very worth it. Price was cheap as well
