JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Yummy~~~ Jinya has the best ramen i've ever had (even better than Soma Sushi) Comparing to Tiger Den (in Bellaire), the different distance is really really extremely far. There are three different types of broth: pork, chicken, and mixed (pork and chicken) Also two kinds of noodle: thick and thin. They also has no soup ramen as well (Tan Tan Men) and Vegetable Soup Ramen (for vegetarian) Basically, this restaurant comes from New York (or California, i don't remember well the awards and newpapers they hang on the wall) where people usually value the standard of food with other places, therefore their ramens are really delicious! Highly recommend Tonkotsu Spicy (extra spicy costs $0.50) and Tokyo Yatal Ramen
