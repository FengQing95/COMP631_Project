Local Foods////When we got there, there weren't many customers (who eats sandwiches for dinner on a Friday night at 5pm?  We do, I guess).  The guy who helped us at the deli counter was really kind.  He let us sample some of the local beers & made some great menu recommendations.  I ended up with the egg salad sandwich w/truffle oil on a pretzel bun (OH.MY.GOD.).  I don't even really like egg salad, but this sandwich was one the most amazing things I've even in months.  The truffle oil was subtle but added layers of interest to the flavor profile.  The kale & raisins peaked my interest - though I don't usually go for kale I was again surprised at how much I loved them.  So many surprises all around - I was in 5pm dinner heaven.
