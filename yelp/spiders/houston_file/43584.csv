Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This bakery lives up to its hype. Although 3 hot chocolates cost almost $20 (with required gratuity), the drink had a great deep chocolate flavor, without the drink burning your tongue. To top it off, our cashier gave us 5 desserts on the house: 3 macaroons (vanilla and tiramisu) and 2 chocolate chip walnut cookies. Friendly staff, so don't forget to thank them for their services.
