Kata Robata////I usually come in and sit at the sushi bar with my husband and the sushi bar staff has always taken care of us.  One night I decided to come in with my girls and try the happy hour menu for the first time, and I was not disappointed. We came in around 5:30 and the restaurant was already getting really busy.  Our waitress Mindy (we loved her!) was very patient, kind, helpful, and respectful. My girls and I were the definition of the worst table.  I asked her to box about 10 different items for me.  My girls asked for bowls of rice and miso soup all at different times throughout the meal.  Not once did she ever give me an attitude or anything less than a smile.  The restaurant was very busy but all of the other waiters were willing to help me including the bussers and hostesses.  I recommended this restaurant to my friend and her husband.  They agreed that not only is the food amazing but the environment is very inviting and friendly.  From the hostesses to the bussers, everyone is extremely warm and that is more of a reason why I love coming here.
