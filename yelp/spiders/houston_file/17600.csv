Uchi//// I know for sure that the ambience that people brag about is not that great and not really for romantic seating unless your are just both in love and who cares about the rest.   If you have eaten a lot in a nice Restaurant or eat out.  You can probably brag about this place or not. I would say OK. I believe others when they said "Overrated".
