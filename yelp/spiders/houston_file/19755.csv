Uchi////Just a general warning against their valet service.  If your car is not worth over $50k, they will park it in the mud lot.  My husband's front bumper was caked with mud.  After washing it, he discovered they had scratched and dented his bumper.  They had dented the rear of my car and cracked the rear light.  You can try to park your car yourself on the street, but good luck finding a spot.  Or you can go to Kata Robata.  The food is just as good, and they have ample parking without classism.
