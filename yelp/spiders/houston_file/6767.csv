JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the Spicy Chicken Ramen with thick noodles (instead of the thin which it comes with) and a seasoned egg. The egg is the my favorite part of the ramen. I ordered the medium spice level and it was perfect. I loved my meal overall and the ambiance of the restaurant is very nice.
