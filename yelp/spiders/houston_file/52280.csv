Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Good place for brunch!  We were meeting some friends here and because I've been burned by not checking the Yelp waitlist before, I had the right mind to check it this time and scheduled our wait in line for the time that we were planning to make it there.  Parked, got the text that our table was ready, and walked in immediately to our table - couldn't have gone smoother than that honestly.  The wait was getting up to an hour by the time we got there.
