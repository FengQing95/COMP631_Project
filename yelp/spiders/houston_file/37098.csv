Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////What a cool new spot to hit the Houston competitive unique grub scene! This place has tasty burgers, its classy and overall just has an amazing atmosphere! I heard all their burgers are amazing! I tried the Kentucky hot "brown". It's an open faced roasted turkey burger without the buns! Â DELICIOUS!!!! Very cool and caring staff as well as being very knowledgeable on their items. I'll definitely be back soon!
