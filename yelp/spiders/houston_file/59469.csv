Baby Barnaby's////This place never let's me down! The bread fast here is delicious no matter what I order. My favorite is the migas which have a nice spicy kick to get your day started. I know the line can be long on the weekends but is well worth the wait. If you can sneak in here during a week day even better. Don't forget to ask for some fresh squeezed orange juice to wash it all down.
