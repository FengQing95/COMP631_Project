Uchi////The hotate momo is one of their recent specials. Scallops, saffron, peach and pearl onion. Sounds great, right? Not when the dish has clearly been sitting idle for a while and the scallops are cold, rubbery and overcooked. This was the most disappointing thing we ordered, and I've grown pretty accustomed to being disappointed by Houston restaurants.
