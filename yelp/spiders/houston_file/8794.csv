JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////HI Rachel - Thank you very much for the awesome review. We also appreciate your patience with our extended-wait times during peak hours. I also appreciate your constructive criticism: We are constantly working hard to keep the flow of our restaurant as casual and relaxed as possible. As you might imagine, when there are dozens of people waiting for tables, tensions tend to rise and we find ourselves trying to move as quickly as possible but without rushing people along. It's no easy task, but like I said, we are constantly working to achieve a perfect balance.
