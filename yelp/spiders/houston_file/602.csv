JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Came on a Saturday afternoon at around 3pm and the place was still packed! Thankfully we didn't have to wait too long as the hostess and servers all seemed to be working hard to seat people. The Tonkotsu Black was perfect as always, the garlic oil they add really brings out the best of the broth. Â Service was great as always, welcome change from the last takeout order I had.
