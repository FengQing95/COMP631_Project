Local Foods////While Local Foods didn't "blow my mind" like other reviewers raved, its still pretty awesome. The atmosphere is quite trendy(including the mass amount of hipsters and their beards), the food was delicious, and the portions definitely weren't lacking. I would try it out if you haven't. Also, I'd try not to go during peak hours because the line was out the door when i went @12:30.
