Kata Robata////This review is mainly focused on my top picks here since I am a pretty picky eater. Even today, I'm surprised I would ever go to a place like Kata but my sister convinced me since she's way less picky and loves sushi. She also enjoys the entrees here but she definitely appreciates this place more than I do.
