JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love this place! The ramen is great and flavorful with huge portions and the restaurant is so trendy and cool. I really loved the vibe and the people there. The only reason i'm giving 4 stars is because the security/ police officer there was weird af. I don't know if he was told to watch us or what but he literally stared at us and only us the entire time we were there.... in a full restaurant. We were well dressed so I'm confused. Anyway, def great spot to bring someone if you want to be cool and different.
