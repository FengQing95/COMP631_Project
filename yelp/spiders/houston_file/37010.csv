Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My bf and I are from NY and wanted to go to a really cool brunch spot. This came recommended from a friend who has been to Houston a few times . It's such a cool , modern but yet looks expensive vibe. I can't really describe it well enough. The whiskey room is super dope , the vintage decor adds such a cool charm. Our server Geoffrey was super fun and informative. I would be here all the time if I lived in Houston. Overall really cool place to have a brunch with a group of friends . You feel like you are dining fancy. Only one downside is that I had the eggs and hash browns and they lacked some flavor. My bf had the veggie omelet and loved it . Drinks are original as well , I suggest you have some when you go.
