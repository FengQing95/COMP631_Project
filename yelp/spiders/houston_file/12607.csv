JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Lastly, I would never presume to change your opinions about our ramen; we're never going to be all things to all people. But we try our best to provide a quality product at a competitive price to our customers. And we work very hard to do that, serving several hundred customers each day. We will always make mistakes, and when we do, we try our best to make things right.
