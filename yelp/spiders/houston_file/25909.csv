The Pit Room////We were in search for a good barbecue place and Yelp's high rating convinced to come to the Pit Stop. Parking lot was full - a positive sign. We were not disappointed. Fat chunky brisket and finger-licking pork ribs were the stars of the evening. The pulled pork was dry and contained too many burnt nibs. The staff was friendly and the patrons gave us suggestions. Next time, we will try the barbecue tacos!
