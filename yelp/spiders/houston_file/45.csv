Local Foods////I really like the concept but I am very conflicted about the execution. The most popular dish is the truffled egg sandwich, and it is alright, but reading about truffled oil it is just olive oil with some chemical added mimic the complexity of truffles in a simplified single-flavor way. Apparently it is controversial among chefs, some like it, others think it is tacky and cliche. I tend toward the latter opinion. Why do we suddenly want all our fries and eggs and whatever to taste generically like truffles, if it is just a new artificial flavoring like grape or cherry? When will the truffle Icee flavor come out or the truffle flavored Nyquil? Maybe that is exaggeration, but as I understand it the truffle oil definitely doesnt come from a truffle and if it is natural it is probably cultured from some strain of microbe. So, I felt kind of weird eating it, knowing it was pretty good, but also did not taste quite right and part of the flavor was out of place. Also, I ordered the Kale expecting it cooked, like spinach, but it was a cold side. A lot of the sides were cold salads with vinegar, which I am not a fan of. I also split the country chicken sandwich with my guest, so we could try both, and it was good if not especially memorable, as was the soup. I wasn't able to try any of the seafood sandwiches because my guest did not want to split those. So, maybe the food was not my style, but it had quality ingredients and came out well enough, so that it was pretty good without being my style. I really liked the bright open decor and the service was good. They just need to work on the menu and maybe offer an un-truffled version of the sandwich and depend less on having vinegar is every side.
