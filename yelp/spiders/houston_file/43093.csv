Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been to this cafe for coffee, lunch and brunch. The quality of their food is really fresh. I've tried their heirloom tomato and burrata sandwich, which was really good. I also tried their biscuits and gravy, which was decent. Their chocolate chip walnuts cookies are absolutely delicious. Overall it's worth checking this spot out .
