Local Foods////Cat food, ouch! We're sorry to hear about your subpar experience with us, and do appreciate the feedback. The harvest salad changes seasonally depending on what's fresh at the time, maybe our upcoming spring version will be more to your liking, but we hope you have you back again before then!
