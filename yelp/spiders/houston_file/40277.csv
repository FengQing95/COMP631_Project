Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This is my second timing eating here. I have enjoyed everything I have eaten here. Food has been great both times. The service has been good. The only negative I have it the volume of the music, it is ridiculous. You can't hear your serve much less carry on a conversation with anyone at your table without yelling. Â I love music but can't understand what the management is going for, night club or restaurant with the music.
