Uchi////Uchi is a Japanese-inspired restaurant. When eating sushi, one orders in small doses (to make sure the ingredients are freshly eaten, to cleanse the pallet between bites, to give the chef time). Each dose has a bunch of flavors, proportioned by the chef already (wasabi, fish, rice, etc.), and all one need do is make sure to eat them all as intended (typically: all the flavors at once).
