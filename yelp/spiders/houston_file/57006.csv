Kata Robata////Honestly, this place never disappoints and I've tried most of their items from their lunch menu to their dinner menu. My favorite items to get from their lunch menu are the Bento Salmon Teriyaki and the Texas Kobe Beef Yakiniku Don -- the soft and tender kobe beef over rice with the sweet garlic sauce is to die for.
