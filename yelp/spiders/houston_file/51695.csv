Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Let me start by saying this is my first ever review. I am a new resident to TX, I have dined at other Snooze locations and loved it, sometimes a lengthy wait, but never the less over all experience pretty good. A family member and I go today to the Montrose location and had the worst experience. I arrived at 9:20 am and was told the wait was about 25 minutes, I informed the hostess that I had to be to IAH by 12 she explained that we Â would be serviced and out in enough time. After waiting 30 minutes we were seated , the server whose name was Peter comes over he takes our drink order and brings us water, my niece who was visiting asked for an orange juice 20 minutes later still no orange juice. We were ready to order once he comes back to get the food order I ask him a couple of questions.
