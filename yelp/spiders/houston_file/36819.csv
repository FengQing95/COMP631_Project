Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Cool vibe! The waiter was super nice and accommodating! The food was good. I had the chef's cut which was a filet pretty tender. Not the best filet I have had but decent and the sauce was good. There fries are really tasty with the chow chow Ketchup! They have a really big bar and pretty good beer and wine selections! The only thing was a little out of place were all the TV's playing sports! If you want to watch a game and have a beer good place to go but not really a perfect setting for dinner! They have a whiskey room that you can reserve to eat in as well as a private room with its own bar in the back! It's really cool! They will block off the room with large hanging drapes and open a glass garage door that steps out onto your own private patio area! The place is similar to Whiskey cakes! We spent a week down in Houston at the Houstonian and went to several restaurants! This was fun but out of all the places we went the most expensive up against Oporto Fooding House & wine which we Iove as well as one fifth Mediterranean Chris Shepard Restaurants which was surprising! Fun place though especially with a group!
