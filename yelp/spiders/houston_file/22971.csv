Uchi////Not often that I give such a well know (in Austin) named restaurant such a bad review, but tonight was absolutely horrendous. Not sure I'd hold more accountable the restaurant or the waitress, but it sucked. "Uchi" is very proud of their legendary name from Austin, and are always packed in Houston, so we were excited about getting a 7:30 table here. Unfortunately it took us 45 minutes to get 4 plates, and one trip to our table from our waitress. Â
