Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food was so good! I had the fruity pebbles french toast and it was out of this world! I also love their home fries Â plus the ambience is A1! It'll help to make a reservation before showing up on a Sunday in you're a bigger party (4+) and wouldn't like to seat at the bar.
