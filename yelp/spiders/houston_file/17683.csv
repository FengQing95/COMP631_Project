Uchi////The food orgy began. I think we had just a little of everything, both hot and cold. We started with Brussels sprouts - outside of dessert, this was the one request we made of the server. For me, these were unexpected at a sushi restaurant, but a completely delicious way to start the meal. From there it was a whirlwind of food, probably 11 or 12 dishes, a couple of cold items and then a hot item, then back to cold. I believe our hot items were duck, pork belly, tuna and wagyu beef - all cooked perfectly. The one item I didn't "get" was the salad, which came near the end of our meal - I didn't love the dressing or the timing. The salad was but a blip on an otherwise perfect meal.
