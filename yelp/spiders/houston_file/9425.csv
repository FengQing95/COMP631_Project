JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Unfriendly and poor first impression of the restaurant. Walked in on a rainy day. There were two to three wait staff waited along the walls and watched the customers coming in get drenched. The least they could have done was open the door when they see customers running for cover inside their restaurant.
