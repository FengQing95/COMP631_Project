JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////In regards to the 50-cent charge for reheating your soup: First and foremost, if a customer has any issue with their food, we will do everything in our power to make it right. However, we don't charge customers to reheat their food. That, quite simply, defies logic. Perhaps you requested that your ramen be made "spicy" or "hot"? If so, that is where the 50-cent charge would have been applied as the chili paste we use comprises more than 15 different ingredients and requires a significant amount of labor to prepare. Ordering this extra chili paste is comparable to ordering sour cream at a Tex-Mex restaurant -- it's rarely free, but instead carries a nominal fee.
