The Pit Room////The place:  Parking would seem difficult i this area however there's quite a bit of pedestrian traffic that makes this place a packed restaurant. I believe the bar next door is owned by the same owner and so any overflow of patrons can eat at the bar.  The seating is quite cozy and has a picnic table feel.
