Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I didn't have the chance to try their breakfast and lunch that was served. However, I did get a great sample of their baked goods!! You MUST get their cookies. I had both the chocolate chip walnut and the chocolate chip butter cookies. Each filled with enough chocolate and nuts to keep you coming. The editions weren't overpowering and allowed you to continue to taste the cookie dough itself. They were soft, yet still had their crispy bottom to give them texture. It was everything I had ever wanted in a cookie. Aside from that, I ordered the aesthetically pleasing pistachio croissant, chocolate croissant, almond croissant, and kugelhopf. I was pleased with each and every one.
