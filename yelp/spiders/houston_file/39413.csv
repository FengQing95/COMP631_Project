Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Anyway, I shared the salmon, the healthiest entree choice I saw, and a kale salad.  The salad was not worth writing about, but the salmon was flavorful and flaky (make sure you get it medium rare or else it may be dry).  If you're having a cheat day or don't need to count your calories, though, get the shrimp & grits.  My friend got it, and I got to try it, and it was DE-LISH!
