Uchi////I'm never disappointed when I go to Uchi. I love how for the sake social hour they open it up to the entire restaurant, not just the bar area. That means no awkward stares to claim the next available bar seat. The social hour is short so I'd recommend showing up at 5 and there should be minimal wait for a seat.
