JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen:  Ive had the tonkotsu black at other locations but dont remember how it compared.  The broth was good, however my bowl didnt come with enough broth, maybe it was sitting too long and it evaporated?  Noodles were decent, I would probably like to opt for the thicker noodle to see,  The plus is that you can pay for more broth/noodle as well as other toppings.  The egg was decent in consistency, but lacked in overall flavor.  The condiments were decent, and you can add more with more $$.
