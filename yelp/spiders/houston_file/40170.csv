Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Henry was our waiter and he would be the only reason I would give the restaurant 5 stars. So the girls and I arrived at noon for a table, there was an hour wait, which was fine. We were sat near the restrooms , which are really clean. Henry came, gave us detailed information about the menu and we ordered our food. Firstly, $30 for a mimosa is highly priced. I would've been okay with $25 but that extra $5 came across steep. When our food arrived we expected bigger portions of food. Although the food was small it was delicious. Lastly when our bill came we were notified we couldn't split items on the bill , we could just split the bill. This became inconvenient due to the fact I had the most expensive amount of food compared to others at the table.
