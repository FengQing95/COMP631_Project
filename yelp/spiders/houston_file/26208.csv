The Pit Room////Throw some of this excellent bar-be-que in my bowl with a side of their mac-n-cheese and I'm in dog heaven.   We get it and go next door for beer and whiskey.   And pretty girls who come over and pet me and love me and gives me buckets of cold water to drink.  During the few months of really nice weather that we have in H-town, my master loves to sit on the patio and feast on brisket and beer.   I wait patiently for a few leftovers.
