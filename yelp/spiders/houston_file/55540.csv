Kata Robata////Kata Robata's dinner menu was 4 pages long and filled with inventive offerings such as Lobster Miso Mac+Cheese, Sea Urchins with "King Crab Spoons", Foie Gras with Daikon, etc... Other than the Edamame and Miso Soup, I figured they were all entrees but wanted to be sure so I asked the waiter. To my surprise, he said that all the dishes (except for the 4-5 entrees listed on the bottom of the last page) were appetizer size and advised that getting three each would be the equivalent of a meal. With these dishes between $10 - 19, it quickly became clear that our casual supper was going to be very expensive. Wine was equally pricey. A glass of Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc was $12, which was a huge mark-up given that a bottle is currently available at Costco for $12.99.
