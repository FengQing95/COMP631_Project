Local Foods////Seriously though, y'all should come out and try this place if you haven't already. It's a perfect lunch spot with plenty tables for both small and large groups. Heck, it's a perfect dinner spot as well. In such a prime location that's still somewhat quiet as it's at the edge of Rice Village, I know I'll be coming back here many more times in the future.
