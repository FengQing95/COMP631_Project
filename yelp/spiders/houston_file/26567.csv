The Pit Room////Along with some Tex-Mex/BBq mash ups, like tacos, elote, queso, etc.  Overall, from price, ease of ordering, and most important, quality of everything was spot on.  They have a great Yelp rating for a reason, but even so still seem to be a bit under the radar compared to some other BBQ spots.  Anyway, easily one of the better places in town.
