Kata Robata////We went here for lunch with a group from work and it was really great. I got the nigiri sampler with about a dozen different fish cuts. Nothing too fancy because I just wanted to check out the fish quality because I was wanting to bring my boyfriend back here for a dinner date. Let me tell you this place did not disappoint! I think their salmon may very well have been the best I've ever tasted. We will be coming back here and eating Omakase style at the bar for sure!
