Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We decided to eat here based on other yelp reviews during our visit to Houston. The lines here are really long on the weekends. We decided to get there "early" on a Saturday around 8am to beat the morning rush but at that time there was already a 45 minute wait. The wait is definitely worth it. My husband got the Ham Benedict III and he said it was delicious. I got the pancake flight which includes 3 pancakes on your choice. I decided to try the pineapple upside, blueberry danish, and the sunburst cakes and omg they were hands down the best pancakes I have tried. The portion sizes were pretty big which was another plus. You will definitely leave here satisfied, full, and ready for another food coma induced nap.
