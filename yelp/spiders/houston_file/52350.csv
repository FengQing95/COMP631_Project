Kata Robata////Came here based on Yelp Reviews, so I have to pay it forward.  Very fresh sushi, and on this Friday night the sushi came out with dizzying speed.  Good presentation, crowd seemed youngish and not too casual nor overdressed.  I would absolutely come here again.  In my opinion a very good mix of authentic sushi (a la Nippon) and trendy spot (like Ra).  Might be my new goto sushi spot.
