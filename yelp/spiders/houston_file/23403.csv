Uchi////Amazing dinner especially for group dates! With a variety of interesting dishes combining textures, cooking techniques, and proteins. The charred shishito peppers make a great starter, following fried acorn squash, bacon and egg, and finished with mushroom and rice bowl. They also make tasting menus based on the tables preferences (be careful with this because they sometimes over serve portions past the point of being stuffed and pick more expensive dishes).
