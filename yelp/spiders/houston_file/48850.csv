Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze easily climbed its way to the top of my favorite breakfast places in Houston, after just one visit.  I'd heard a lot of great reviews before I went, so I had pretty high expectations.  What I wasn't expecting was the ridiculous wait my husband and I had at 10:30 on a Friday!  I figured Friday would have significantly fewer crowds but nope, it turns out it's still packed.  I'd highly recommend coming earlier (around 9am) or just be prepared to wait around for a lil.
