Kata Robata////Now, for what we ordered. (1) Miso Gyoza, (2) Pork belly and 60° egg, (3) the Rising Sun roll, and (4) The Caribbean roll w/o mango.  Now just let me say everything was so delicious and fresh. The mouth watered with every single bite. You cannot go wrong with dinner at this place. Our bill was about $65 bucks, so its not cheap. But I will definitely be back whenever I am in Houston.
