Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was pleasantly surprised by the quinoa, which soaked up the flavor of the broth quite well. The carrots and egg were also cooked perfectly (tender and over easy with a nice soft yolk, respectively). The prosciutto just didn't work-- way too salty. My parents were both happy with their dishes.
