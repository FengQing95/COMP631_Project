Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Abso-freaking-lutely. Whenever I have a friend in town, this is the place I'll take them. However, this really isn't somewhere you can do your work at. They only have wifi starting at 2pm (which makes sense, since they have so many customers and they don't want you to take up a table if you're just sitting there), and even when they do have wifi, it is super shotty. I tried to bring my laptop one time and plan a trip with a friend, but it did not go well. But overall, this is still an awesome bakery/cafe!
