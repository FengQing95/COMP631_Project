JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had JINYA Tonkotsu Black for lunch and Tonkotsu Spicy for dinner. Both are excellent but I prefer the thick noodles to the skinny noodles. The spicy wasn't too spicy and I added extra spice but I guess my spice levels are more Sichuan China limits. Great flavor, non-the-less. The egg is one of my favorite parts of the ramen meal. Highly recommend getting an extra egg and extra pork.
