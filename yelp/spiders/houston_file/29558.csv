The Pit Room////This place is so popular and I can definitely see why! I should have came by earlier in the day because the ribs were gone by the time I made it to dinner. Would be nice if they had a sign that said which meat was leftover because I can only imagine the sadness after waiting in the long line and getting to the front to find out most of the meats are gone.
