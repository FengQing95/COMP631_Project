Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Overall, it's on my list of brunch/breakfast places for sure. However, it's usually such a hassle, I don't know if it's necessarily worth it. It's a solid option though with friends. I could never bring my parents here, it's just too chaotic, especially for a breakfast place.
