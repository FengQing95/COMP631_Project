The Pit Room////I can't say enough good things about this place.  the food is outstanding, the vibe is laid back and cool and the beer is cold and cheap! I have never tasted better brisket and the ribs are always tender and juicy.  We just moved to Houston about 3 months ago and have gone to The Pit Room every Sunday since we arrived.  And I see no reason to stop this weekly tradition.  Our son and grandkids meet us there and it's really a fun time of family bonding for us.
