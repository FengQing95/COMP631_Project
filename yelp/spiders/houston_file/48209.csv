Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I literally go here 4x a month. So far the best breakfast place in Houston in my opinion. Never thought breakfast food could get any better. But at Snooze it is! I recommend the shrimp and grits. Also the flight pancake is to die for . Let's not forget about the mimosas. Super good as well. They close early so you might want to start your day off here.
