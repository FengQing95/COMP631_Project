Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I personally recommend the Kouign-Amann, the croissants (any kind), those glorious cookies, and the loaves of bread (any kind).  Much praise also for the chocolate caramel tart and the vanilla cheesecake.  I haven't tried the sandwiches, and the coffee is good but not the best in town.
