Local Foods////I've always thought that fresh ingredients are the key to a delicious dish--and Local Foods really takes this mantra to heart.  All of the sandwiches and sides are thoughtfully crafted using locally-sourced produce, meats, and breads.  This combination of care and quality makes for some superb dishes.  I don't think you can go wrong with any of them!  That being said, some of my favorites are the Truffled Egg Salad Sandwich (definitely NOT your typical egg salad) and the Smoked Salmon Sandwich--the onion jam and awesome salmon are the key to this sandwich.  For the sides, go with the Tuscan Kale.  So good!  And they definitely don't skimp on the golden raisins or pine nuts.  The portions are also good-sized so you feel like you're getting your money's worth.
