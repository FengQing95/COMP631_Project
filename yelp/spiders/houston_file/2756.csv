JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My husband and I love going to this place! The food is awesome and the Â ambiance is inviting with good music and a warm vibe. Try the jinya bun and spicy chicken ramen (if you're a meat-eater) and finish it off with the annin tofu dessert. For the vegans out there, try the vegetable ramen!
