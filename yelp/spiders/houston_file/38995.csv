Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Looking for a place for brunch with bottomless mimosas or bottomless Bloody Mary?! This place is it!! I like the fact that they indeed take reservations for brunch! Beats going to places and having to wait! This place is located in the fancy area of the Galleria, pretty close to Steak 48 and the Highland Village Shopping area. There are parking spots if you're lucky but for the most part, they reserve the spots outside for valet for Bosscats and Eloise Nichols. Â The doors are open and you can tell that this place is busy and loud before even walking in. There is a DJ and it's a pretty lively place for brunch. I mean, at $32 for bottomless drinks (mimosas or Bloody Mary) with a brunch entree, that's a pretty great start to a Sunday funday! The restaurant is darker and decorated nicely - with the barn wood and the steel seats and dark leather booths. My only complaint is that it may be a little too loud for conversation cause you definitely have to scream to be heard by the person sitting across from you.
