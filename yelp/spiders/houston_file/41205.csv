Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I tried this place recently one morning with the family. From the bakery, we ordered a fruit tart, fruit croissant, and two of the almond croissant. The croissants were very flakey and delicious. The fruit tart was very refreshing. Though some options are pricey for the amount you're getting. From the lunch menu, we order the sandwiches Chicken Torta, South Houston Roast Pork, and Egg Salad 2 Ways. Everyone was happy with their options and the amount (two sandwiches weren't even finished) they were giving for the price.
