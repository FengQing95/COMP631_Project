JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////A group of friends and i came on a friday night, it was quite pack. After 30mins of waiting we finally got seated. The decoration is beautiful, but the tables was not pratical. Most of the tables are design to sit no more than two people. I ordered the cha cha cha ramen, the broth was too overwhelming and there wasnt much meat or veggies in it. For a $14 ramen, i expected more. The chicken nuggets are tender but too oily. The only thing i liked is the tako yagi, it was delicious.
