Uchi////Food-wise, ingredients are good and interesting, and the balance between tastes are great. I liked my rolls although there's only 5 pieces and they were tiny! I was very disappointed at the two pieces of sake toro sushi - they are about 60%-70% the size of what I got at Miyagi and taste was very very average.
