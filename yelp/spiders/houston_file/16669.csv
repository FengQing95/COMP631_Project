JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food is great, but parking is hard to find and it's always crowded. The servers are usually overwhelmed and have forgotten to give me half of my order 2 separate occasions. The lines are usually long and you have to wait forever to get seated, order, get your food, get your check, etc. Basically, every step of service. I would rather order in if I really wanted their food, but it's really heavy and not something I crave a lot anymore.
