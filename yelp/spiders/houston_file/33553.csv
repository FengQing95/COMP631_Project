Local Foods////I love Local Foods and the location in the Village is my 2nd most favorite spot. Parking is almost always a challenge but it's worth the healthy, yummy, and affordable food Local Foods serves up. I'm particularly a fan of the Crunchy Chicken sandwich, the kale, and the Chicken pozole soup. The portions are generous and unless you're starving, you will surely have leftovers. 10/10! I look forward to my next visit.
