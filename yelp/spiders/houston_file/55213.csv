Kata Robata////I was at Kata.I had some meeting. My client was waiting at a counter bar. I had to meet a bartender,Vincent from Seattle. I checked the menu. I found $14 Asahi beer! I asked Vincent " What's that?" He showed me a big Asahi beer. I was sorry for telling him Â that it would be too big! I didn't want to end up sleeping around Kirby on Saturday afternoon.
