JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I gave this a second chance because my boyfriend hadn't try this place before. We went on valentines and was seated within 20-30mins. Service was passable this time because our server was nowhere to be found when we needed something. We decided on the special which was the Tokyo ramen with a salad, fried chicken and fried dumpling. The dumpling wasn't that great, a little oily for me. However the fried chickens were surprisingly delicious compare to anything else we had. It was cut into large pieces and fried. It has a juice inside and goes well with the sauce. The salad had a weird dressing that doesn't go too well. Our ramen was decent, nothing spiral about it, the egg was like any other egg you can get at ramen shops. The noodle was too soft and fat for my preference but my friends states that she like it here better.
