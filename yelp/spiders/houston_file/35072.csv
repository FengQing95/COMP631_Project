Local Foods////Tried this place with a co-worker for lunch!! When you walk in the atmosphere is welcoming. It's a cute little spot for lunch breaks. They have plenty of seating and the customer service is exceptional. The menus are at the door for viewing, you choose what you want and approach the register to order. I ordered the "Turkey Confit" but on pretzel bun and it was sooooooo good!! I will be coming back!!
