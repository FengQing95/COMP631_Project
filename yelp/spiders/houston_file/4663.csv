JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Abbey - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry you found our ramen "not up to par." While we might disagree with you regarding what makes a bowl of ramen -- we happen to believe the broth is the integral component -- we might have been able to offer you a different option or perhaps given you a different batch of chashu with your bowl. Regardless, we are grateful you gave us a chance and even more grateful that you might consider visiting us again. We appreciate your patronage and your taking the time to give us feedback.
