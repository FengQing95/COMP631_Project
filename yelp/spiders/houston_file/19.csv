Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////In a nutshell, their breakfast is phenomenal, but not worth the wait (1.5+ hours) or the hassle with parking. My wife and I tried to go on a Saturday, there was essentially no parking (think their parking lot holds maybe 6 cars...) and the wait was going to be nearly 2 hours. We left and came back on a Wednesday morning. There was no wait this time. My wife ordered the breakfast pot pie and I ordered the snooze spuds deluxe. I also ordered the morning margarita. The pot pie looked better than it tasted, but was good nonetheless. The snooze spuds deluxe, as far as eggs and potatoes go, was some of the best I've had. The morning margarita was a little strange for my taste. I supposed I'm used to El Tiempo's margaritas.The place originated in Colorado, and deff. has that kind of cool/chill/different vibe. It fits well in the Montrose area. I would try it again when the newness of it wears down and the wait becomes tolerable.
