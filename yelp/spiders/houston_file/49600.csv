Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I became a big Snooze fan in Denver when they first started. I'd waited for an hour at the Union Station location for the pancake flight. Now that Snooze is also in Austin and Houston, I carry on this tradition to have a brunch once in a while on weekends. My favorites has always been pancake flight( blueberry danish is the best), smoked salmon Benedict, and egg omelette. The beloved OMG French toast was a bit too sweet for me but still in love with it.
