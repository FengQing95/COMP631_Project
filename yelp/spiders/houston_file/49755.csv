Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Our server comes and we place our order. Everything on the menu does not come with the typical eggs, bacon, hash brown deal it is separate. I feel like no one said that in the Yelp reviews so just adding that in. Everything was fairly priced though. I ordered the French Toast Neat with hash browns and bacon and my boyfriend ordered the Breakfast Tacos with chorizo and hash browns (Our server did try to add on a few things to our meals like an additional pancake etc.). While we were waiting I realized I had a friend that worked there Stephon who gave us a pancake to try (Apple Pie) and it was soooooo delicious so I was excited for our meal. The wait for our food was pretty long but worth it. The food was excellent and we loved the salsa's they brought out for his tacos (we ended up buying them after we left at the Whole Foods). All in all everything was amazing food was great and we will come again!! Thank you to the manager and Stephon for making our first visit amazing!!!
