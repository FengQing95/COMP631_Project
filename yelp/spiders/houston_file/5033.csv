JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Visit this restaurant at night, I was totally impress when I came inside the atmosphere very nice, warm and interesting look. The services are awesome. I love their ramen alot, I tried Karaage Chicken Ramen, Tokyo Curry Rice, and Takoyaki. They're all taste fantastic. I will definitely come back :)
