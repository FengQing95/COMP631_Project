Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've been to the place twice now. Definitely my go to brunch place! No one has been able to beat their Pinneapple Upside Down Pancake. I love pineapple, so when I heard about this pancake, I knew I had to go try it and I wasn't disappointed. So when some friends came to town I immediate suggested this place for brunch again. Everyone was happy with the choice.
