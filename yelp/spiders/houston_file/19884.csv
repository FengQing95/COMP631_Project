Uchi////I had one of the most memorable dining experiences ever. From the ambiance, taste & service, everything was top notch. While we had to wait a little to be say, there was a nice waiting area where you could order drinks and appetizers with surprise rolls by the chef. I'm visiting from out of town and would come back again, if I was ever in Houston.
