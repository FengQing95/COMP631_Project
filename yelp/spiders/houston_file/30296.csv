The Pit Room////Being a little late around 730 they ran out of beef ribs and pork ribs. Two of the things I really wanted to try, so I settled for the other picks brisket, Czech sausage and turkey. The turkey was one of the best things I've tried. The brisket not bad and neither the sausage. The Mac and cheese was nice since the pasta was still solid. They made their own chicharron so that was definitely a treat as well. I think what made it better was the coffee sauce. Overall it was a good experience. Hopefully next time when I come back I can try their beef ribs.
