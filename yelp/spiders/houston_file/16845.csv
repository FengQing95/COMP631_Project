JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Overall I feel like this ramen bar is a bit overhyped. I would've expected their famous ramen to be the best on the menu, but I ended up enjoying the rice bowl far more. The prices were also on the higher side for a ramen bar. Pretty much most entrees on the money were well over $10. I might consider coming back for the rice bowl, but not the ramen.
