Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It's the place to be, I've tried all the breads now and they are all so amazing.  The sweet treats are heaven.  The only bad things is having to wait for the food and also having to wait for  a space to eat.  Take it to go and you will be happier with your experience.
