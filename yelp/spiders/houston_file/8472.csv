JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jenny - Thank you very much for the kind words. We are beyond pleased to know you consider us your favorite ramen spot in Houston. If we could go back in time, we probably would have opted for a larger space, but given the premium for real estate in Midtown, that might have been cost prohibitive. In the meantime, we will be opening a third JINYA location in Katy in a few months. Hopefully that will alleviate some of the crowds at Midtown. Regardless, we appreciate your patience and understanding and look forward to serving you again soon.
