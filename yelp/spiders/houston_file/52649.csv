Kata Robata////Miso Crusted Bone Marrow: This item was recommended to us by a friend, and I must say...it did not disappoint. I've tried bone marrow before, but wasn't keen on the texture. This, however, was amazing. The portions were huge! It was prepared with this panko style crust that could be spread upon some crostinis and there was dijon mustard seeds and pickled onions on the side. Just wonderful. I could see several other diners ordering it as well. I was definitely happy with this dish.
