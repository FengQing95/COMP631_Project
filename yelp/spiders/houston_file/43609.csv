Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////About the customer service. I visited in the dreaded 'lull' of the day (after lunch, before dinner/closing at 7p) so everyone seemed a little lax. Operations still seem pretty new. One thing I don't like is the menu...or lack thereof. You walk in, and have to figure out how things work. You look, ask questions, etc. which seems to take a long time...hence the line. Theres small chalkboard above the check-out...so I guess you have to wait until right before paying to choose what you want, or whats left to order.
