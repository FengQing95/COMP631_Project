JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////ps - It was great there was no wait or line upon arrival... I asked to be seated so I cld order Apps and a frosty Bev while my other half was parking the car. But wait... Even though 50% of the party was present (that's me) and I'd like to order  ..I can't.. But if I said I'm a party of 1... I would've been sat since there were available seating options .   Don't get me wrong, plenty of circumstances to not seat a party until all are present, but this SHOULD NOT be a policy for every party that walks thru the door.
