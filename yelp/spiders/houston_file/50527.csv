Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So this was my first visit to snooze. I've been hearing a lot of buzz about snooze. So first impression of this place wasn't great. The parking lot had under 20 spaces so it forces u to park on the street or park at a near by business and risk being towed. Ive heard people parking at jack and the box, Walgreens, or Krogers. Towing signs are all over so just be careful if u want to risk it. Then once u come inside, you put your name on the list and they will text u once it's your turn. Â Although while I was waiting, the hostess let a few people cut the line...... I mean everyone is there waiting so we all were like what the fuck....?
