Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I finally made it to Snooze and it did not disappoint. Going on a weekday was a great way to avoid a long wait time (or any wait time at all). I didn't have a reservation but was promptly seated on the patio per my request. Since it was my first time, I asked for a few recommendations and ordered the Mmm Mmm Mimosa and the Benny Duo where you can select two different Benedicts to try. I ordered the Bella Bella Benny and the Lox-n-Latke. The lox Benedict was amazing! I'm still dreaming about it. The combination of salmon, pickled onions and capers was something I would never imagine but it was delicious. I wish I had ordered two. Unfortunately I was given the Smashed Avocado Benny by mistake and it took a while to get my correct order out. The Bella Benny didn't live up to my expectations but that's ok. I'd go back for the lox anytime.
