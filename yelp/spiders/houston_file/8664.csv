JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love brussel sprouts and have tried them at various places to see how they season. But making it into a tempura was different. The batter was good but the actual brussel sprout didn't have any taste to it. I had to result to dipping it into gyoza sauce which is already on the table because it tastes bland.
