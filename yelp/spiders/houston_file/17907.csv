Uchi////This place will live up to the hype. Trust me. Two weeks after my 2nd visit and I am still thinking about the Brussels sprouts. I'm sure it's a simple science of fish oil and some frying, but they are seriously the most addictive plate on the menu (we ordered 2). The waiters are really friendly and good at suggesting items. I don't even remember all of the dishes that we had but every single one was amazing. This place made me love sashimi, and I never thought I'd say that.
