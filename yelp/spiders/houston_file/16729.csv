JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The pick-up logistics were not the smoothest. It was difficult to stay Â COVID-distanced in the small reception area, and there wasn't really a line, making it difficult to navigate. I just wanted to leave that comment in case someone was looking for an easy, COVID-distanced pick-up... this isn't the place.
