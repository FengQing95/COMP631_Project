Local Foods////So good, you have to get the Crunchy Chicken sandwich on a pretzel bun, it's to die for.  Great lunch place, mostly filled with people from the surrounding offices on a weekday.  Online ordering is available, otherwise order at the counter and they bring the food to the table once it's ready.  Tons of seating, kept very clean.
