JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Alina - Thanks for the 5-star review! I'm very pleased to know you enjoyed your dining experience with us. You're pretty spot-on in your description of our Spicy Chicken Ramen ("spicy" level). JINYA franchises are popping up all over the U.S., so chances are fairly good there might be opening near to where you live in the future! But please come back to visit us if you're ever in Houston again.
