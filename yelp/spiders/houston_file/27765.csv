The Pit Room////Pretty good BBQ. The brisket was nice and fatty (how can fat taste bad), and the rib was fall off the phone tender with a nice smokey flavor. The sausages that we got were good. The jalape√±o and cheese had a good kick to it and the venison sausage was different and salty. The sides were ok, but not my favorite ( the potato salad and Cole slaw). The BBQ sauce was a little tangy and spicy and smokey, pretty good, but I think I prefer the sauce from other BBQ places.
