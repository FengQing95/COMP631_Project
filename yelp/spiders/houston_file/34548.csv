Local Foods////Local foods remains one of my default go-to restaurant in Houston! I love how they use local fresh ingredients for food that leaves you feeling full but not heavy. It is conveniently located in rice village. Though the parking lot is big, it fills up fast during peak hours. Luckily there is ample street parking all around the restaurant.
