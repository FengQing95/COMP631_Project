Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Parking can be tricky. There is a decently sized lot attached to the restaurant, but there is so much foot traffic that you'll likely have to park along nearby neighborhood streets. Upon walking in, there's usually a long line, but it moves quickly as the employees have the system down to a T. You'll likely want some time to decide what pastries to select anyway.
