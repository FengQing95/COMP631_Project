The Pit Room////Got here at 2:00pm on a Saturday. The line was all the way outside and we only waited 15 minutes in line! Wow! The food is DELICIOUS, the Hispanic lady that cleans after people is super sweet and the guys are so polite and quick. Food is amazing and reasonably priced. I'm from Austin and Salt Lick is the place to go but when I'm in Houston, THE PIT ROOM is the place I will be stopping by.
