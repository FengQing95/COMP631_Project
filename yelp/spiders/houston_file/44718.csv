Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is amazing. As soon as you enter you get completely immersed in "multifactorial sensation experience". The odor of pastries go through your nose, get to the brain and stays there, waiting for the pastries images coming from the eyes. Once you see them, the images match together and they stay there too, waiting for signals from the mouth. At this point you start to have a feeling that something amazing is going to happen. After you order, the pastry arrive on the table (I love the Kouign Amman), you bite it and here there is the moment in which all 3 sensations get together, travel into the brain and deeply fix the experience in the long-term memory.
