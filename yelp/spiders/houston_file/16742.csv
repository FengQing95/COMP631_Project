JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It's always a great experience at JINYA. My to go is the sprouting up ramen, and I added some spice this time, it was tasty! The crispy chicken was delicious and tender!!! My husband loved his spicy tonkotsu ramen, I think he literally finished in less than 10 min. The bun was not too bad, but by then I was too full to fit
