Kata Robata////We started out with some drinks, and they were excellent. I was happy to note that they were in the high-falutin mixologist style pioneered by Anvil (and demonstrated at a number of other Houston restaurants). I had some Manhattan-y type of drink. Both were more than acceptable, though like any other drinks of this type, expensive. I think they ran about $10 apiece.
