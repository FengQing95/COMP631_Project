Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////LOVE LOVE LOVE! We luckily got a parking space in the small parking lot at the front and had to wait for about 30 minutes to get a table. They sat us outside and my friend was uncomfortable sitting where there was no shade so the waitress and hostess accommodated our decision to change tables! Our waiter was extremely attentive and so nice (shout out to our waiter Erin (sp?) The mimosas were delicious and the food is amazing along with the great staff. Will definitely be back!
