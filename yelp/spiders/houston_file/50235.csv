Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was visiting Austin from Los Angeles, this place looked like a go to for the funky, hipster type Austin locals. It didn't disappoint! I was offered liquor at 8 or 9am in the morning! This is not something I normally do and didn't that day either, but it was an interesting concept, if my day hadn't been so busy, I might have ordered a spicy Bloody Mary with my breakfast.... the coffee was in point, the food was original, diverse, and creative. I truly enjoyed the experience all the way through. There was a bit of a wait, which was a little unexpected because It was on a Wednesday. But, it wasn't that long and it was definitely worth it. I highly recommend Snooze if you are in the area.
