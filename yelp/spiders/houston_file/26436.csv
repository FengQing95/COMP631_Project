The Pit Room////Moist brisket and pork ribs were good, but not amazing. Frito pie was very salty, mac n cheese runny, charro beans were not good. Guys preparing your food are not very friendly either. Limited seating because they don't clean up after other guests leave, but thankfully we were able to find one open table at The Patio. To top it all off, they overcharged me and added a lb of brisket on my tab when we never ordered it nor received it. Watch out!! You will probably have better BBQ at your friend's house. Don't waste your time.
