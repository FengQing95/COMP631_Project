Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I got a flat white, and it was solid (+1 point for barista who brings you the cup instead, if you're clumsy like me you can probably relate with the nerve-wracking trek from the bar to your table..). Also tried 4 of their macarons, in order of my favorite to least favorite: Blue cheese + honey, lemon + lavender, salted caramel, and red velvet.
