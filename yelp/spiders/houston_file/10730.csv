JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The dining area is kind of cramped. It is kind of awkward depending on where you sit because you can seriously end up right next to a group of random people. I mean, it doesn't matter when you're all too busy digging in but I can see it being really awkward and/or disturbing if you get the wrong seat partner. It's not much of a problem with normal human beans so it's okay. I do like to have my personal space though.
