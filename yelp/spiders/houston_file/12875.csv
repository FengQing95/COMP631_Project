JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////What an amazing meal! This place was busy when we came to eat here on a Tuesday night. Our waitress Kaylin was efficient and very helpful- throughout the entire meal she checked on us often, answered many questions and was always smiling and friendly. My husband and I started with the fried Brussels sprouts (so delicious!!), a salad (yum) and the gyoza (the best I've ever eaten!). Then he got the cha cha cha ramen (and loved it- he ate the whole bowl!). I got the traditional white ramen and added book choy (absolutely delicious!). I didn't finish my ramen but thought it was so good I got extra broth to add into my to-go to be sure it would be just as wonderful the next day. Neither of us had anything bad to say about the food or the service and would highly recommend Jinya!
