The Pit Room////The 2 stars is from disappointment in the downturn in quality and my experience today. I stopped by and got some loose cut / moist brisket to go. Â When I got it back to my office to eat it, it was mainly the tough inedible charred ends of brisket. There might've been 2 decent slices in the half pound. The rest were tiny chunks of meat. I used to rave about this place and fell everyone about it - but it's not the same. Didn't post about last visit, but had to return the sausage as well. There's a lot of BBQ competition in this town, so I hope they'll take note of the review.
