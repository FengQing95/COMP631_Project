Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Very rude and entitled servers. Wouldn't let us order any breakfast at 10:30am, stating they had just stopped serving breakfast. Wouldn't make an exception and the guy was very rude about it. Then we tried to order lunch and said no. They said we couldn't order ANY food between 10:30 and 11:00. Will not be back.
