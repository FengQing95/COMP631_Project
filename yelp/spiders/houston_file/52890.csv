Kata Robata////P.S. Â They seem to have problems with their credit card payment system. I was told my AMEX card was declined and had to pay with another card. I called AMEX and was told that my card was never swiped. Could be just due to kinks in a new setup, but the waiter should have called AMEX to get a verbal authorization. That's what good service would be: not just walking back to the table and loudly announcing that my card was declined.
