Uchi////My manfriend and I have been talking about going to Uchi for a long time now and our anniversary seemed to be the best excuse to finally splurge on a great meal.  It was hands down one of the best meals I've had in Houston in a long, long time.  We didn't have a reservation on a Wednesday night, but no problem, there was room at the sushi bar.  Perfect.  We went in with open minds and wanted to try things we normally don't try so we told the sushi chef to just make whatever he wanted.  He sent out plate after plate after plate of delicious goodness and it was hard to tell him we had to stop.  Just a few of the amazing offerings we had: hama chili, pork jowl, zero sen, and so much more.  The staff was attentive and very friendly...overall an amazing experience.  This place definitely deserves all the hype and then some.  We will be back for sure.
