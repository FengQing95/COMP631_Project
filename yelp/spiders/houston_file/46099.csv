Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////For the most part their dessert and food is good. Their almond croissants are the best, hands down that I tried any where else before. Their food is good too with a variety of different things daily. The problem I have is when I want anything extra, like jalapeño or guacamole or something. They are not very helpful. They are like, "oh no he didn't ask for anything extra."  And after paying for the extras which they price it at their crazy price. It's like they give it to you in the smallest little cup. I'm like you got to be kidding. I just paid a couple of dollars for this small little thing. Cmon I know it's supposed to be trendy here, but give us what we pay for and stop being such a twat about it.
