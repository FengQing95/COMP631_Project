Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Eating here is wonderful, food is always good and service is always great! But my review is for the to go orders. They really messed it up and it wasn't even busy. I ordered (2) of OMG French toast which are amazing, only received one, asked for extra coconut instead got none. Ordered an egg white omelette which was not egg whites. Messed up in the toppings for the pancakes. The only thing that was right my 2 orders of bacon. Won't be ordering to go anymore. Very disappointed
