JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Tim - Thanks for your review. On most weekdays, customers arrive as much as 30 minutes before we open to beat the lunch rush. At JINYA-Midtown we have 89 seats, including the seats at the front bar, so there is a limit on the number of customers we can accommodate at any one time.
