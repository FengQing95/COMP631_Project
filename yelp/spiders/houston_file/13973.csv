JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First off, I LOVE coming here, let's start there. I typically sit at a table but have been enjoying the bar service, so tonight I came in with my buddy and sat at the bar. He was there before me so he already had his drink. By the time  I arrived both bartenders just stared at me and continued talking to (who I assumed was the manager) at the host stand. After they were done chatting they came to me and took my drink order. I asked for a water and didn't get one. I asked again and STILL didn't get one. Finally, after asking for a third time I ended up  getting water. Our food came out perfect but after that, the bartender would make eye contact with us but would not assist us. I asked for another round, but she didn't seem to listen so she did not get us another round of drinks, she just walked away. I asked if she heard that we needed another round and so she finally got us our drinks, without saying anything else. It was very obvious that she was trying to leave, but as someone who loves coming here, our experience was quite disappointing. Would not recommend sitting at the bar if this is the kind of service that is going to be provided. Anyways our food was amazing but our service was such a let down.
