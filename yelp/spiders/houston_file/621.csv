JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was hesitant to come back after that second visit, but I was in the mood for ramen. I was just hoping it was an off night and I gave it another shot. Both my friend and I ordered the chachacha ramen and it was very good. Not my favorite ramen here but still very good. No complaints this visit
