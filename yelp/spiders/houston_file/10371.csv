JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Best ramen in Houston so far! The wait was about 30 minutes at 8pm on a Saturday night, but the turnaround time was pretty quick. There's a large community table in the middle of the restaurant and small booths seating about 1-2 people lining he side of the restaurant. There's a bar in the front of the restaurant which you can also be seated at to eat and drink.
