Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////After ordering everything went downhill. The email we received with our confirmation said the order would be ready in 15 minutes and to wait in our car until we received a message. We showed up at the pickup time and waited for about 15 minutes in the car, before I decided to head in because I assumed they forget to notify us. I went inside and asked about pickup and they directed me to the bar area. I kept asking waiters and waitresses for help but got got no assistance or info from anyone. After about 15-20 minutes I finally heard my name and got my order, and never received any sort of notification about my order so the email confirmation we got was completely wrong about timing (ending up waiting like an hour) and what to do while waiting.
