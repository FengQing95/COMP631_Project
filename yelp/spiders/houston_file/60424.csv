Baby Barnaby's////I should preface this by saying the food was good.  Thats not my major beef with this place, its the fact there was no where to change a baby.   Not to mention the place was beyond crowded inside ( this was expected).   We were sat at a table for 4 but really it sat more like 3, as the air conditioner was partially sitting  / resting on the table.  Also, they were storing produce stacked near the bathroom, i believe it was oranges. For the fresh squeezed orange juice. I had such high expectations and then they fell short ASAP.  Like I said the food was good, but the lack of changing facilities , produce near the bathrooms was a complete turn off.
