Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've stopped in a few time to pick up bakery items. There is ONE long slow line for people who want to order the full meal deal as well as those who want to grab and go. It would be so simple to just add a bakery/take out line. The way the order is handled once you get to be waiting on makes no sense either. I order one baguette, then I have to wait to get to where the pastries are down the line to complete my order. The order taker gives me a number. I get to the pastries and wait again, while they enter my order. Then I wait while they take care of several people behind me in line before they box up the remainder of my order. I can't believe that it is still so inefficient even after being acquired by Carraba's.
