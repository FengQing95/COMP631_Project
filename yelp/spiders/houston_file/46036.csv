Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My husband and I came here to place an order for my baby shower, and we were very pleased with how everything turned out! We opted for a selection of their small cakes as well as a few dozen macarons. They let us sample a bunch of different flavors so that we could make an informed decision. I was also eyeing some of their breads, especially their croissants, but opted to save those for another day.
