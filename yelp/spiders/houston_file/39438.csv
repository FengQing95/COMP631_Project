Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////3.5 out of 5. The first time I went it was for brunch. I had the pancakes and bacon. Pretty good, but nothing to rave about. With all of the reviews I thought the place would be spectacular. Went another time for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. Much better. Got the brick chicken with dirty rice and green beans. The rice was a little too spicy and the green beans were lukewarm. Chicken seasoned just right. Will probably go one more time but not having higher expectations.
