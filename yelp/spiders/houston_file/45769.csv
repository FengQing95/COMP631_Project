Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////For my loved ones that visit me in Houston, I bring them here! I love the life-loving vibe that this establishment offers. Everything I have tried here is lovely. My favorite thing to get off of the menu is their ham and cheese sandwich, which comes on a croissant (*buttery flaky crust*). My favorite dessert to get here is their oh, so popular kouign-amann (pronounced queen uhmon). I have also tried the plain croissant, chocolate croissant, chocolate chip walnut cookie, and macarons. They are ALL wonderful, and I would definitely recommend or reorder all of them.
