Uchi////This is a unique high end sushi joint. I understood why majority of the reviewers gave such high marks to this place. From decor of the place to the presentation of the food, it definitely exceeded my expectation. The only complaint I had was the long wait.  It took almost more than two hours to get seated.  It really was ridiculous and I was starving to the point that I almost passed out.
