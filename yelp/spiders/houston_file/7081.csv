JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food was good, should've order to my taste instead of the popular pork ramen. Came in about a month or 2, drove 40 mins just for the ramen. I use to work as waiter and my expectations of great service was not met. Took 2 of my friends and sat at our table and not single server greeted us or even ask for our beverages. Sat maybe about 20-25 mins and the couple who came in waayy after us had a server and got order and food before us.
