Kata Robata////WHERE DO I START?!? I've been going to kata robata occasionally for over 5 years and what I love about them is their CONSISTENCY in their food and service! You honestly do get what you pay for. The portions r pretty big for a high end sushi restaurant. ESP the nigiri cuts! I also love their big n diverse thier menu is! ALL of their specialty nigiri r great! Must try the crab spoons, Waygu Sandos, lobster sandos, o toro nigiri, scolloo n foie gras nigiri, lobster Mac n cheese, fried soft shell crabs , miso ramen n so much more I can't think of right now! ALL of their desserts r delicious! Honestly I've never had a bad dish at Kata. And you must ask for THAI as your server!!! I don't even bother to remember what to order each time Bc Thai always know what to order. I always come with a group of girls and we can be quite a handful but Thai is always so accommodating and patience with us!
