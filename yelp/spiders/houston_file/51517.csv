Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////OMG. The brunch food here is really amazing. I got the Pancake Flight, and my friend got the Benny Duo (Chile Verde and Bella Bella), and both were great! Pancake Flight allows you to get a sampler of 3 different pancakes or 2 pancakes & 1 french toast, which is perfect for trying different flavors if you're indecisive. I got the Pineapple Upside Down, the cinnamon bun flavored one, and OMG! french toast, and all were very delicious. The french toast in particular really reminded me of the Auntie Anne's cinnamon sugar nuggets! My friend loved the Chile Verde, and especially how his barbacoa mixed with the yolk and Hollandaise sauce, but thought the Bella Bella was average and wouldn't get it again. They also have this green chili sauce that added a great kick to the eggs benedict. One complaint is the wait...we came on a weekday and we still had to wait ~25 minutes to get seated and an even longer time for the food to come. However, the quality of the food here is on point. Definitely will be back!
