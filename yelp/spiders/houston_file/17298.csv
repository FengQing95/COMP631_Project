Uchi////Yes, the sushi is a little more innovative than anywhere else in Houston. BUT, the last time I was there, the price for two people, with sake, to become 3/4 full (we went elsewhere for dessert) was $482. Four Hundred and Eighty Two Dollars! This is insane. Go off-menu at one of Houston's old-line sushi places, and the chef, who will be an older man from Japan, steeped in tradition if you're at the right place, will be glad to make you something special.
