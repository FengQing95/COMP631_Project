Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////So, Ill start with the food was amazing ! I had the Hot Chicken Dip with Homemade chips. Perfect portions! However, as I have read previously, the service was not of quality. My issue was about service. Our waitress never checked on us the entire 1.5hrs we were there eating. She took our order and never returned. She did, however walk past us 3 times as we waved basically in here face for attention. While she laughed with friends within an earshot of her tables. We were helped by a wonderful server Jose, and he should receive all the praise. Thank you. The tension was thick and we could tell something was going on. It did take away from the experience of a place we had heard such great recs about the food. Nevertheless, I would def. Uber Eats from here though.
