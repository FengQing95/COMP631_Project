Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Again, this is our first time coming here from out of state. The atmosphere in Bosscat is very romantic and relaxing even though there were plenty of people inside eating! It's a great place to eat for date night or dinner with friends. My boyfriend and I sat very close to the kitchen at a high top table and were given complimentary extra chips by the chef to go with our chicken dip appetizer (very good). My boyfriend ordered the steak and I got the catfish. My catfish was AMAZING, the risotto was creamy, fish was crispy and everything went well with the sweet/spicy sauce that came on top. I would give this place 5 stars without a thought if my boyfriends steak came out well the FIRST time. He had to send it back initially because it was verryyy overcooked and tough even though he ordered it medium well. They quickly remade his food, which was moist and flavorful the second time around. My only complaint was the waitress we had made it seem like it was his fault his steak was overcooked. She never apologized for his food being chewy and dried out which we did not appreciate! Otherwise, the food and service was great. I would still return here or recommend to a friend!
