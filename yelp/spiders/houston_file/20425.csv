Uchi////Best part of experience was our server Ryan! Very knowledgable about menu, and he definitely has a good palate because his recommendations did not steer us wrong! Thanks Ryan for a wonderful dinner and wonderful service!!! He also gave some good tips such as they have HAppy Hour everyday from 5-6:30p!!!! What!!! And a lot of Â our faves are half off!!! Will definitely be a regular here! Oh and complimentary vallet a plus but make sure to tip the guys just in case that wasn't clear :)
