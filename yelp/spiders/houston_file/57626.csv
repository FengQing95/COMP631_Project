Kata Robata////6. Foie gras and duck with cold soba: I definitely have a type and it's foie gras and duck. I couldn't really tell where the foie was among the noodles but it may be because my friend was eating all of it - I kept picking up pieces of mushroom in disappointment. The soba noodles were slightly on the salty side but were fine when eating with the duck.
