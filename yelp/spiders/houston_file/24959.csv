Uchi////I just love, love, love Uchi and is my go to for special occasions.  Among many things-I always get the brussel sprouts in the caramel fish sauce, and the eggplant...but the sushi chefs will never steer you wrong. Such a creative bunch and you feel like vip the moment you walk in, till you leave. Such a great and special place with personalized service-if you go once, they remember everything.  Such a unique spot in today's world.
