Uchi////Wow. The food here was decent, but we had awful service. We ordered three dishes and a glass of saki. Our waiter insisted we try a bottle of his favorite saki, and only after we get the bill did we realize we had just spent nearly $200 on saki alone. I asked the waiter about the bill and he very rudely told us, "If we were on a budget we should have made that clear prior to our meal." I have no problem spending money and a great dinner and good drinks. A member of our party told him, he was being very rude and he sent the manager over. She told us that they always back up their waiters against customers. I'm under the mentality that the customer is always right, especially when we were calm and courteous. We were not asking for anything free, I just wanted an explanation of our bill. I cannot believe I waited a week for a reservation here. l won't be back, but not because of the food Â or the bill, but because of the lousy service.
