Baby Barnaby's////I ordered the Chicken Mill Valley with a side of the caesar salad instead of the apple and fries that it's supposed to come with and oh my goodness, I can literally eat that Caesar every single day of my life. The chicken was good. It consisted of a chicken breast with a layer of their in house spinach dip and on top of that a slice of melted cheese. In addition to that we got the house red, which I believe was the cab. Excellent dinner service by our wonderful server. At the end of the meal we got a chance to further donate to Dining Out for Life by one of the people who volunteers for it.
