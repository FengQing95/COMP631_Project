Uchi////I've noticed that they reduce the portion (and imo, the quality) of the food they offer at social hour, which is much more affordable than their regular fare but still pricey. Overall, I'm not sure what I paid the premium for tonight, as the food was small and lackluster. The ambiance isn't fancy either; just a crowded, somewhat loud, and laid-back restaurant with tables somewhat close together. As for the service, it gets slow and clunky when the restaurant is busy, and it is busy during social hour. Various people will come by to bring your food, and wipe the table if needed. They forgot to bring my drink until the middle of the meal. I also saw a waiter spill water on a lady. They say that they handle the pacing of the dishes for you, but it seemed that the pacing mostly relied on when a batch of food was finished being made. Otherwise, the order made little sense (except for dessert coming in at the end), and often two dishes would come at the same time.
