Baby Barnaby's////Some of the best brunch I've had. The wait was a little too long and as first timers, it was a little confusing how seating worked at first. But the food definitely was worth it. I had the green breakfast and let me tell you everything was fresh, full of flavor, and cooked perfectly. Apple sausage and potatoes were my favorite part! The orange juice was freshly squeezed and the service was great.
