JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////customer service was lively and friendly! They were speedy fast with the orders and I had a pleasant time for getting ramen! There are vegetarian/vegan options so don't be afraid to get the fried tofu! Such a plus, I'm definitely coming back if I am tired of the dollar ramen packages!!
