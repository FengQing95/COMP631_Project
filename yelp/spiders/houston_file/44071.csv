Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose//// I tried none of these things. So that means I will have to go back fro brunch, order a croissant and taste their cookies. Sounds like a plan to me! Â Common bond has a small parking lot in the back of the building but there is also street parking and tons of cool shopping in the area. So park and walk around a bit after you gorge on all the things common bond has to offer.
