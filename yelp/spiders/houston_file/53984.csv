Kata Robata////You know the food here deserves at least 4 stars. Not bad, I've had better for cheaper. What really knocks the review down is the service. We had a large group of about 10 people and they don't split checks. It really isn't about that though. We wrote down what we ordered and made it very clear. The waiter was such a jerk and was very condescending and asked that we divide the ticket mathematically to make his job easier. "I've worked at so many restaurants and this is a common policy" he said. Get over it. You could've turned your table over twice if you took the time to make your paying customers settle a bill a little easier. Also the spicy ramen wasn't spicy or flavorful so that was meh.
