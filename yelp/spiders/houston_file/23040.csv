Uchi////Didn't have a reservation, but we were fortunate enough to walk up to 2 empty seats at the sushi bar! It was a Sunday evening, early dinner - like 5:45pm. It was nice to order from the sushi chef and watch the kitchen roll out dish after beautiful dish. We ordered all 3 sushi rolls from the happy hour menu, as well as my all-time favorite app, the machi cure. Will be back soon!
