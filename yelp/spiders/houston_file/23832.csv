Uchi////I went to Houston, Texas for my birthday trip this year & after doing some research on Instagram I chose Uchi for my birthday dinner. Since traveling to Japan, I have become obsessed with Otoro bluefin fatty tuna & make it a point to search for it in every big city I travel to. I was very impressed with Uchi Houston. The menu was incredible, the service was phenomenal, the ambiance & other patrons were chic, and the food was amazing! The Otoro bluefin tuna is flown in from Japan & I enjoyed every bite along with everything else we ordered. The house sake surprisingly was some of the best sake I've ever had. My husband enjoyed the Australian Wagyu which was cooked on a hot rock table-side. Also, the fried milk desert was out of this world! Who knew you could fry milk into little crispy liquid filled balls. I definitely recommend this place and would love to go back if I'm ever in Houston. Expect to spend a few hundred dollars on dinner like any other fine dining sushi restaurant but the quality is definitely worth it!
