Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Go here! The most beautiful and delicious selection of baked goods and pastries. The chocolate croissant was great and so was the salted caramel chocolate Ã©claire, but my favorite part was the beet salad for breakfast! Their hot chocolate was wonderful too. Everything we all had.. was just great. And they have a beautiful space with great light and great bookshelves!
