Local Foods////The food was just okay.  I was excited about the reviews I had seen here in yelp, and I found the food to not be all that, at least the one dish that I tried.  I had the falafel sandwich with kale and home made fries, and I think the kale was the only good thing (but that's bc I love kale and its nutrition).  The environments was nice and cozy, but my dish and my friends' comments about their food was not that great.  One of them had the vegan chili and said it was delicious, so if I ever go back I will probably eat that.
