Kata Robata////Scallop sushi, spicy tuna and salmon skin handroll, and the crunchy eel roll.  Mussels were very fresh and plump...the sauce was great...made us wish they had given us some bread to dip the sauce in!  Spicy Chopped Scallop... man, this was heaven!!!  I usually never order it, but damn I'm glad we did!  I'm still thinking about it right now.  The flavor was so fresh and just perfect.  Other places make it too mayonnaise-y, but this was just right.  At $2.50 a pop, it better be great!  As for the handrolls and crunchy eel roll...they were just average at best.  Maybe we should have ordered one of their specialty rolls...
