The Pit Room////Decent quality bbq, moist and soft brisket, ribs are a little tough but still good. My personal favorite is the pulled pork, which has a good tangy/seasoned flavor and pairs well with the various sides offered (Mac n cheese, potato salad, beans, corn etc). The go-to bbq spot for inner Houston.
