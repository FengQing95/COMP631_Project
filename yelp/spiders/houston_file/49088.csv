Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Parking is not fun. My sister and I came a few months back on a Friday morning around 9:30am and got lucky to find parking on the street right beside the establishment but had to drive around 3 times. Other than that, wait staff was attentive and we were seated right away. Below are the dishes we had and their ratings.
