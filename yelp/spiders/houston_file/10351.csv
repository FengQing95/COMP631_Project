JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen is delicious and satisfying. Since it was my first visit, I wanted to judge them on the classic Tonkotsu Assari. The broth could stand to be richer, but there was depth to the flavor without being overly salty. I loved the chewiness of the noodles contrasted with the crunch of the mushrooms and bean sprouts. The pork belly slice (yes, just one) had the right tenderness and fat/lean ratio. I want it to melt in my mouth, but I don't want to feel TOO guilty. The soft boiled egg had my taste buds cheering. You can't go back to hard after you've had soft, trust me on this.
