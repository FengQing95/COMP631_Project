Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The pistachio croissant is the most recommended item. It has a pretty green swirl through it so it looks really good on photos. The first bite was delicious- slightly nutty and pistachio-y with a sweet kick. However, the marginal utility of each subsequent bite diminished faster than most readers' tolerance for my nerdy jokes. Moving on! By the time I got halfway through the pastry, the croissant tasted overwhelmingly sweet. So I recommend splitting one with a friend.
