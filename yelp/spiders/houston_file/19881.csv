Uchi////EVERY single thing we ordered off the hh menu BLEW MY MIND.  I have had sushi in many many different places, in many different cities, and without a doubt, there were the most creative, and best flavor profiles I have ever had, which is a strong statement.  The ham and egg roll was delicious, as was the walu walu, machi cure, and hama chili.
