The Pit Room////Good god, this place was a disappointment.  The brisket was okay, not a ton of flavor on the bark, but it was tender.  The pulled pork was dry as hell.  The venison sausage was alright (I'm not a huge fan of venison sausage because it tends to be dry but it's what my husband wanted).  The okra was flavorful but slimy as okra that isn't fried always tender to get.  But the mac and cheese.  Oh my god, I am so sick of people raving about mac and cheese that is just pasta in a runny cheesy sauce.  THE MAC AND CHEESE AT THE PIT ROOM SUCKS.  There.  Now you finally have a real review of the mac and cheese.  I can't believe someone actually wrote that it was one of the best in Houston.  No.  It isn't.  It has no real cheese taste, the sauce is runny, it was never baked.  Do not order it.
