Kata Robata////From the happy hour menu, we tried the yuzu salmon carpaccio, ceviche and taro chips, brussels sprouts, iberico pork shumai, and the "fish and fish." Of these, the clear stand-outs were the spicy and salty shumai (3 per order), which came with a pipette full of flavorful dipping sauce, and the light ceviche, which was served with taro chips, pickled cucumbers (so...I guess pickles), and a fruity sauce on the side. The roasted brussels sprouts, though topped with umami-filled bonito flakes, were OK but the ones at Uchi with caramelized fish sauce put them to shame. I wish the salmon carpaccio was a little bolder in its flavor profile. The Fish and Fish, two fish collars containing lovely cheek meat, had a nice smoky taste that popped with a splash of citrus.
