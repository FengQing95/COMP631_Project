Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This will be my favorite brunch place in Houston from now on. The wait is worth every bite. Don't see it as wait, see it as build up of anticipation to a food experience so rich that you'll be left speechless. We got the Benedict Duo and Pancake Flight which lets you mix and match different styles. Service is excellent, shout to Aaron!
