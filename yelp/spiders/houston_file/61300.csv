Baby Barnaby's////I would probably give this place 3.5 stars if possible. For one, the wait was about 45 minutes when they said it would be a 30 minute wait. We walked into the almost entirely empty regular Barnaby's next door on accident, but apparently that was only serving lunch - didn't seem like a very good use of empty tables. It was also hot hot hot outside and the large fan was not really doing much to help. There's coffee outside in large canisters, but I'm not sure how fresh it is especially on the hot days and since the staff seems too busy to refresh or clean the station. After a while, I was concerned that our name had been skipped over because there was an "X" next to it on the sign in sheet that they use to take names. Apparently an X means you're on the list waiting on a table, but I'm not sure why that's even a marking since you would assume everyone on the list put their name there because they're waiting on a table? Anyway, the boyfriend and I got a seat inside the hip retro diner looking restaurant at a small yet comfortable booth literally right up against the coffee machines. The vibe inside is very different than the outside where there's faux greenery wall seems very chic and perfect for Insta pics if it wasn't so crowded.
