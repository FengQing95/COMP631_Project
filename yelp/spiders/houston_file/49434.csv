Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I also ordered a side of chicken sausage. It looked like a ground chicken patty and when I bit into it there were pieces of bone or beak that were crunchy. I complained and the waiter brought it to the manager (or I think she was the manager on duty) and she actually felt the hard crunchy pieces and came over to apologize.She told me they get them already prepared from a supplier and they would have to talk to their supplier. Needless to say they removed it from the bill.
