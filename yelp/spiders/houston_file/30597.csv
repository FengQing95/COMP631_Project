The Pit Room////I rarely have to downgrade a review, but this Â was a terrible 2nd experience. So the first time I came I tried the beef rib and was blown away and even came back to Texas because I was craving bbq. This time I took 3 pounds worth, over 70 bucks back to California. Took it all to go and just trusted it.
