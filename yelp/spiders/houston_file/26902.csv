The Pit Room////Overall a good experience but I'm not going to say I was blown away. Brisket was tender with a good flavor but a little low on the sodium side and although it looked like it was going to have a great smoke flavor it didn't have one. Jalapeno sausage was good and had just the right amount of kick but the venison sausage had a dry taste and didn't quite hit the flavor mark. Happy with the sides (shout out for that okra!), and I thought the pork ribs were decent but once again nothing to write home about. If you want a decent meal at comprable prices this is a good place for you in the Montrose area but if I'm going to go for the best in town it's not the place. A little work and they will get there but they definitely have some improving to do to make that happen.
