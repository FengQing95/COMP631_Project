Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////LOVED THIS PLACE!!! My friend had been talking about this place for weeks because she had been to the Austin location and loved it so I finally agreed. Waited over an hour for our table but IT WAS AMAZING! I got the snooze breakfast burrito with green chili AND ranchero sauce. I liked the green chili sauce better. My friend got juan's breakfast tacos. We both added veggies to it. We also got the blueberry danish pancakes. Sooo good! I love everything about this place from the people to the the ambiance to the food!
