JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Tonkatsu black- this was the first ramen I tried here and honestly, it was so good that I got it a few more times before I tried something new on the menu. The broth was a good tonkatsu broth that wasn't too salty. The pork chashu is my favorite in Houston and always so soft and tender.
