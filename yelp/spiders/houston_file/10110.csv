JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////By far the BEST ramen I've ever had. It wasn't plastic feeling like other ramen restaurants nor was it pre-packaged ramen you would get at the store. Clearly authentic food.  The broth was tasty I almost drank it all.  The Pork broth is the best in my opinion. Ate here twice in a row.  Wish there was a Jinya in Jacksonville, FL.
