Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This time I was determined to get there earlier, which looking back, coincidentally was the same day as the Texans were playing. I think that was why the place wasn't as jam packed as the first time I visited. This time I got an almond croissant, strawberry shortcake, sticky bun, pain perdu, and macchiato with caramel. I also got a lemon tart, 2 almond croissants, regular croissant, and a plain baguette to-go. The lemon tart was still in my mind and I just had to have it. The shortcake was delicious! You get a little biscuit, cream, sliced strawberries, and a preserve on the bottom. I would've preferred the sticky bun to be warmed up slightly though.
