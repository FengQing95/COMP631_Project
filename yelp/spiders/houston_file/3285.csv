JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ramen Bar must follow specific design and atmosphere elements as mandated by our corporate headquarters. While we don't always agree with corporate's aesthetics -- I, for one, prefer dinner over soft music -- we are beholden to their ideas and instructions, so it's always nice to hear our customers' willingness to make their own compromises in these regards, rather than immediately downgrading us. Thank you very much again for the comprehensive, kind words regarding our food and restaurant, and we look forward to serving you again soon!
