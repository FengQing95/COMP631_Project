Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////After reading the reviews I was very skeptical of the wait but honestly, our estimated wait time for brunch on Sunday @12:30pm for a table was 20 minutes. We were sat in 10 minutes. The food came out in another 15 minutes after ordering. The staff gave excellent customer service. The only con I would see is parking, it was definitely packed. Had to park behind the lot in Jack in the Box. Additionally, the place is a little compact, but the delicious mimosas and mouth watering food is definitely worth it. Definitely coming back!
