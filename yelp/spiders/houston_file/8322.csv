JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is my favorite Ramen shop in Houston. Their broth is quite amazing and the food is great. I usually order the Tokyo Yatai Ramen while my boyfriend orders the Beef Ramen. Because the food is so good you need to expect to wait to get in here during peak time. Personally, I would recommend just calling and ordering takeout. I think the most I ever waited was 45 minutes but that was totally my fault because I went there around 6'O Clock on a Friday evening. Other times I've gone there around 12:00 on a Saturday and walked right in. During the busy times you can expect there to be a lot of noise since they are busy but the one steady thing is that the food is always worth it!
