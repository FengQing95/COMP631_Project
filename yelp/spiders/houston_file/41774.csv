Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We went on a Sunday and arrived only about 10mins after they opened and the line was out the door! However the wait was not long even though they were understaffed that particular day but the seating was almost immediately taken. Another negative was they didn't have any fruit tarts when I was there and I really wanted to try them. Was it worth the wait and were the pastries as good as everyone says? Read my full review here
