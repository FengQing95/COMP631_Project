Kata Robata////Service is pretty on par. Not super fine dining but they do a good job of describing food and staying attentive. The hostesses suck every time I come, they always look like they got something stuck up their a$$ or they too good for everyone. I freaking hate egos. Hello! Sorry , you're only a hostess :) get over it and serve with a smile PLEASE.
