Local Foods////I almost missed the place, because I did not realize that they share a parking lot with Â Benjy's and Kelvin Arms. When I entered I was positively surprised. I love their modern, yet comfy setting and the brightness of the restaurant. I also like that you order up front and then go and sit wherever you want to. I was alone so I just sat at one of those large wooden tables (beautiful). Soon some other people joined and started an interesting conversation (definitely a good place to eat out alone, very entertaining if you just listen to other people :), if you are a more outgoing person than I am you probably can have a good talk with folks there. I also saw a lot of guys with their lap tops, seems to be totally fine.
