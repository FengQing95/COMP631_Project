Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////These guys know their pastries!!! Their macaroons, chocolate chip walnut cookie and Kugelhopf are popular, but the croissants are the absolute BEST in my opinion! They're huge, fluffy and just ridiculously delicious! I don't think there are much better ones out there! My husband enjoys their coffee, which is in line with the high standards in the Montrose area. Yes, the parking is a bit frustrating and can get quite crowded during brunch hours, but the open atmosphere, beautiful space with indoor and outdoor seating and excellent pastries can't be beat!
