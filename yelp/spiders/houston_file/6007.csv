JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was slightly skeptical about trying ramen in Houston but I am glad I did. I tried a lot of ramen spots in New York and my friend who tried ramen from Japan to LA had to agree Jinya made some pretty good ramen. We both ordered the Jinya Black and they were pretty flexible about switching the thin noodles for the thick noodles. (We think the thick noodles absorb more flavor.) The broth was so flavorful and deep. Our server was very friendly and attentive.
