Kata Robata////Anyway, remember how I said Kata won my mother over? I usually am nervous to take her to different restaurants because I feel like I have to defend places I like to eat; fortunately, she could NOT stop raving about this meal. No lie, I had to hear her tell the story of omakase to different people. Multiple times. In the same week. I was so surprised she loved it - she's said that Kata is now her favorite restaurant in Houston! Whaaaaaaat!
