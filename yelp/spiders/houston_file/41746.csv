Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Probably the freshest bakery in the area, good coffee, great pastry selection, good size menu and nice atmosphere but the turnover is not as high as it should be since the parking area is limited. Prepare to spend a little bit more than usual for coffee and a croissant.
