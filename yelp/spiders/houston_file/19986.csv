Uchi////I had pretty low expectations coming here as I was afraid it was too fusion-ey and not traditional enough.  While in a lot of ways my assumption/fear was correct, it also pleasantly surprised me in many ways. The first time I came here we had a reservation, the 2nd time we were able to sneak in on a friday night without waiting which was pretty incredible.  I will say the cocktail menu is very limited so you should just go with sake, and you can never go wrong with otokoyama, its good for drinking alone or with sushi.
