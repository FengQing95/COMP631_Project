Baby Barnaby's////Their menu consists of typical brunch items but my number one fave would be the green eggs!  Unless you've had 'em, you have no idea how often I crave these when I'm back home.  Freshly squeezed OJ, waffles, breakfast tacos, steak 'n eggs ... their menu is simply divine!  Their menu is small, but completely filling and offers enough variety (in my opinion).
