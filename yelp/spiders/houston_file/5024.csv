JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Brandon - Thank you for your great review and for understanding our extended wait times during peak hours. With summer fast-approaching, please know that our regular slower period between 2PM-5PM will usually be a little busier as high school and college students will frequent our establishment more often than during the school year. Thank you again, and we look forward to your Â next visit!
