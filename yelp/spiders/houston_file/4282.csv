JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////And while it may not appear so much on the surface, please know that every single member of our staff at JINYA-Midtown works hard to keep the tables turning. As you might imagine, this is no small feat, considering that so many of our diners visit us with friends to not only share a meal, but to socialize, catch up, and just have a good time. We explicitly train our staff to NOT RUSH PATRONS in any manner whatsoever, so in a word, it's challenging. But we try our best, and like I said, we work hard every single day.
