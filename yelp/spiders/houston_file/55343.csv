Kata Robata////Whenever I'm in Houston, I HAVE to go here for ramen!  The first time my husband and I went here, it was for our anniversary. In fact, we drove all the way from Austin to dine here because we heard so many great things about it on Yelp!  Ok, so it wasn't the only reason why went went to Houston (my hometown), but it was a priority.  I ordered the Soy Spicy Ramen - interesting combination of ground pork with hints of spicy and creamy. I enjoyed it!  In fact, we loved our experience so much, the following year, we went again for our anniversary and had a feast of ramen with dumplings, pork belly with spinach, and seared scallops. After we ate every bite, we slowly walked after we had glutonized ourselves.
