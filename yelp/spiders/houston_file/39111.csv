Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I have been here one time before for Saturday brunch because I wanted to try the fruity pebbles french toast except they only offer it on Sundays. Womp womp. We decided to stay anyway and have brunch. Food was okay -- the only thing I remember getting was the pork belly poutine with the duck fried egg. We weren't huge fans of it because the huge potato wedges made it too starchy to taste anything else. Fast forward to this past Saturday for dinner....
