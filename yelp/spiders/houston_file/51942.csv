Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Menu is next on the list. Options options options. I love that they have so many options to choose from. It's a little overwhelming but in a good way. Since I'm trying to stay on my life style i went with the breakfast tacos and this was my first time trying a tofu meat substitute. It was really good. I thought i was not going like it but man oh man was i wrong. I also had a mimosa with it to compliment.
