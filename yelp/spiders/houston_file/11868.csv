JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My first experience for having real Ramen was indeed a great one. A friend and I decided to dine here for my birthday weekend. I was a bit nervous because the only Ramen I've had was 5 for a dollar at Kroger.  When we arrived at first glance it was cute and quaint with very sexy lighting considering I wasn't on a date lol. It was very busy that night and I thought to myself  this has to be some pretty yummy soup due to observing all the slurping going on. (no pun lol) I started with a lychee martini which was okay... I've had better. Then we ordered some tapas for starters. Spicy creamy shrimp tempura and the pork gyoza. Both delicious. Then I tried for my Ramen choice the JINYA Tonkotsu Black which consisted of pork broth, pork chashu, kikurage, green onion, nori dried seaweed,
