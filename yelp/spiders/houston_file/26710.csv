The Pit Room////This is an excellent barbecue joint and a welcome addition to the Houston barbecue scene. Many other reviewers have remarked on the high quality of the meats, and I echo their sentiments. The tacos provide a nice option for enjoying a lunch that isn't overwhelming, as a single taco and a side (the fajita-style okra is excellent) will do for most folks for a reasonable lunch.
