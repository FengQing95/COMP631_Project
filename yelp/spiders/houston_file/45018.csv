Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We were chatting with the manager for a bit and apparently they're in the process of opening a second location with further plans of expanding to other cities. That's exciting, but we just hope that CB's level of excellence doesn't falter. We love this place so much and would be heartbroken if their new locations weren't as good as the original.
