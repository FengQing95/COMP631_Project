Uchi////However I just came home from uchi tonight and was somewhat disappointed. Drinks were missing from the menu... and food quality was not up to par with my first experience. This time around the foie gras did NOT melt in your mouth. Instead it had a weird hard texture to it and you almost had to chew it. The fried milk was also a let down this time too.... I dont know if it was just an off night for the kitchen but I was very let down. While the flavor wasnt exactly lacking, the quality of the textures and experiencing each dish was not the same from my Â initial visit.
