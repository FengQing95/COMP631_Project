Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat is a great restaurant with menu items that anyone would like/enjoy. I highly recommend the Bosscat Burger (Chefs Way) which comes with cooked mushrooms, blue cheese and the Bosscat (Cajun style) fries. I have also had their Shrimp and Grits which is a great meal for lunch or dinner.
