Baby Barnaby's////What a place to people watch, or to take in the sun and enjoy the morning.  Sadly, I was unimpressed with the food.  Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad food, but with the reviews, I sort of expected a Snow White breakfast.  You know, the kind of breakfast brought to you by all the creatures of the forest on a perfectly prepared platter.  However, it tasted like a run-of-the-mill type breakfast.  I wouldn't wait more than 30 minutes.  Now if you can score some of their coffee, you'll be in for a treat.
