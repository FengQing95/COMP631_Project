Kata Robata////Overall, the prices are higher than most sushi places, but the quality and the service are top notch. I'd say you should visit this place if you were coming here during happy hour or if you wanted to splurge on your meal. The dishes are also great for sharing, which means this place is awesome if you're coming with a couple of your friends. This place would also make a really great date place (especially if you wanted to impress your certain someone).
