Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is my first time trying the Kugelhopf. It's not overly sweet, and has a nice slightly rich and chewy texture with raisins in it. It doesn't become my instant favorite and I will try some other offerings before going back to it. I also got a baguette to go.
