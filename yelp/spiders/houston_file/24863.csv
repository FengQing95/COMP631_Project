Uchi////I looked over their drink menu and order the Kori Suika cocktail (sake, watermelon, lime, and mint) for $11.  They used a giant cube of ice in it, and I feel the cocktail was super small.  I finished it in a few sips because the ice took up most of the space.  It was really good though.  It tasted just like sweet watermelon juice.  Even the ice cube itself was frozen watermelon juice instead of water that could dilute your drink.
