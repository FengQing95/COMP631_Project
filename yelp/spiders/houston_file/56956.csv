Kata Robata////The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because I have been going to MF Sushi for years now and to me they have the best sushi in town period! I feel that for the price you might as well treat yourself to some MF Sushi. I do however think that it's great that they are open for lunch and I always enjoy trying their daily specials.
