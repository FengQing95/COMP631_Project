Uchi////So about a week before my sister crossed the pond to visit she called & asked if I had been to Uchi. She had read an article about Uchi from one of the many mags she gets to curb her boredom from living in a perfect house in the beautiful countryside of Buckinghamshire. So I made the reservations.
