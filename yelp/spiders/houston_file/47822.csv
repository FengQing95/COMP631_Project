Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Went here with my friend for brunch. It was a long wait at 10 am, so be prepared. Totally worth it though! We got the omg french toast and the lower side side. They were absolutely delicious! The servers were very nice. My friend mentioned she didn't like alcohol and they were able to make a virgin drink for her. Excellent service!
