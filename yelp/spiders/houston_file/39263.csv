Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Kentucky "hot brown": (2/5) soggy bread, dry turkey, decent bacon, soggy tomatoes, and mornay sauce: oh my goodness. do not get this. I should've stuck with a basic burger. I didn't know what mornay sauce was and I definitely wished I looked it up beforehand. It was a white and creamy sauce with ZERO flavor. I could've sworn it was just flour and water. It's supposed to have cheese or something. The turkey was soooo dry... so dry. It left a bad after taste in my mouth. I immediately requested for Tabasco but received some other red hot sauce. lol I know what Tabasco tastes and looks like. Could've said "we do not have Tabasco", since I was specific. but whatever. the hot sauce didn't help. i was struggling to eat the dish. It needed some freshness, texture, spice or tang! Maybe raw tomatoes/onions, PICKLES, just something!!! it was just savory, but BLAND. ($13)
