JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Chill atmosphere, food was great. Only things I would change is the shouting each time a new customer comes in and not charging extra for hot sauce. Better a customer adds the amount they want than asking spicy and sending it back. I got the dipping noodles and they were amazing. Initially I was disappointed in the Japanese salad, not the normal ginger dressing or greens. But the arugula with the ginger pur√©e was legit. Friend got the vegan ramen and added an egg. All were good and portions were great. Super nice staff.
