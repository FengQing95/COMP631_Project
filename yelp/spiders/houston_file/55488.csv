Kata Robata////Would recommend sitting at the sushi bar for the full experience. Chef Hori recently won the Houston Truffle Challenge in Houston so there was a lot of truffles on a number of our dishes! Definitely was not complaining! The price will vary slightly but expect the bill to be around 130-150 per person pre-tax/gratuity. Can't wait to come back!
