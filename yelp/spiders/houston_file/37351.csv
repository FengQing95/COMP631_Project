Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We are staying at the Hilton Houston Galleria Area and where we come from, there is not much to choose from as far as unique restaurants like this one. As whiskey lovers we were instantly drawn. The 5 star reviews do not lie. Best customer service I have ever experienced. The owner was very social with the guests. Food was really good and the drinks were amazing. If we lived here, we'd go here often! Definitely a great place to eat and laugh.
