Baby Barnaby's////I nabbed me a "green eggs" - two egg whites with cheese, artichoke, and spinach served with potatoes, wheat toast, and sausage- they let me substitute the vegan sausage, which made my day. The coffee there is organic and perfectly delectable as well, and sitting outside means you're allowed to bring your dog AND that you may have to shoo aside a few flies. It's nicely shaded with ceiling fans galore though, and easier to hear yourself talk than inside.
