Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food here is actually really great!  We had the pulled pork hush puppies and spicy chicken dip and both were really yummy.  It took quite a while to get our cocktails and we were there at 5pm so it wasn't very busy yet.  The waiters kept hovering over our table to take plates and utensils and that was a little irritating bc we felt rushed.  The food also took a long time to come out for our order to only be soup and a chicken sandwich.  Other than that,it's a good happy hour spot
