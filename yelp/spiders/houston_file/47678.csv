Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was average at best. I ordered the breakfast pot pie. The individual components (flaky pastry, gravy) were delicious, but just didn't work well together. The gravy made the pastry really soggy. My husband ordered the spuds deluxe. The hash browns were crispy on the outside, but sort of wet on the inside, not soft and fluffy. The pancake flight was most disappointing. We tried the blueberry danish, sweet potato, and pineapple upside down cake. The sweet potato pancakes taste nothing like sweet potato. Actually, I couldn't taste much of any of the pancakes because every inch was smothered in syrup, butter, and sugary toppings. I love sweets, but these pancakes were practically inedible. Lastly, we ordered quesadillas from the kids' menu for our son. They were supposed to be cheese, egg, and potato quesadillas, however, there were no eggs or potatoes in them. They don't even have plain cheese quesadillas on the kids' menu, so I don't know how they managed to make this mistake. We decided to let it go since we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for it to be corrected.
