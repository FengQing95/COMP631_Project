Baby Barnaby's////This is our first time to Barnaby's with my folks. We drove here all the way from Dallas-Fort Worth area to visit friends, and we were looking for a breakfast place. On a Friday morning at 9 AM, we were able to be seated without waiting. We ordered the green eggs, breakfast platter, and the banana Walnut pancakes. The waitstaff was absolutely outstanding! They were very friendly and ambiance was not too loud. It is a small place with about 10 tables or so. The green eggs were pretty good, however, the only flavor I could actually taste was the butter. Â The chicken apple sausage that came with the green eggs were sweet yet savory with subtle smokey flavor that did not overwhelm the palate. The pancakes were outstanding! They were not too sweet, and the maple syrup complement very well. In addition the slices of bananas within the pancake made it not too dry yet fluffy with a crispy exterior. lastly, the portions of the meal were Texas sized (large portions). Would absolutely come back!
