Kata Robata////With all the great reviews I had such high hopes for this place, since I am a sushi lover. At first, everything was going great, until I found not ONE but TWO bones in one of my sashimi. I politely told the server without any intentions of receiving anything back. I just wanted him to know so future mistakes would not happen, but he blatantly told me "human error, what do you want?" He didn't even say sorry. When I told him I felt like they were judging me since they kept staring at my table I did not feel welcomed and I am so disappointed. NEVER COMING BACK!
