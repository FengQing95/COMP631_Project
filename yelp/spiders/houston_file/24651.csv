Uchi////Absolutely phenomenal dining experience all around. One of the standouts for me was the service. Our server was super interactive, friendly, and eager to offer recommendations. The quality of the sushi is on par with Kata Robata for me, and their desserts are one of the best I've had at any sushi restaurant (the foie gras candy bar and fried milk was a divine experience).
