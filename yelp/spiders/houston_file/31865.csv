Local Foods////Yummmmmmmm!  This place is great!  I have come twice, the first time as a happy accident, the second as the only restaurant I specifically requested on a two day visit to my family in Houston.  It's that good!  Both times I have been seduced by the truffled egg salad sandwich, which was amazing!  Just the right amount of truffle oil to make it feel special, but not overwhelm the well-cooked eggs.  Really they could have put that on a brick and I would have eaten it happily, but instead they have an awe inspiring pretzel roll and accouterments that launch it into a beautiful wordless place of glory.
