Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////2) Almond Croissant: In general, almond croissants are magical to me, and the ones at Common Bond are no exception. The perfectly crisped, buttery exterior is the best partner for the sweet almond filling. $4.50 is a little steep, but it's a good way to treat yourself.
