Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The pastries here used to be stellar, especially the kouign amman and all the croissants.  They were buttery and flaky, probably were among the best in Houston.  Parking was always difficult and line was always to the door, but then it was worth the logistics.  And my sweet friend used to bring some to-go for me so I didn't have to make the effort for their wonderful pastries.
