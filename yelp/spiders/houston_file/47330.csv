Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////First off, let me say I'm not usually a going out breakfast person.  A bowel of oatmeal, or eggs, or pancakes at home is fine for me and the family.  However, I must say Snooze is really good.  Everything was fresh and had great flavors.  Had the pancake flight and pot pie.  Our waitress was a bit distracted and just seemed unengaged with us - another waiter actually came by to ask if we needed anything.  Glad he asked - yes, more coffee please.
