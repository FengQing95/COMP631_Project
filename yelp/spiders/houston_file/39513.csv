Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Environment was like a very new, upscale Local Pour. Great space, music, patio and seating but the main difference is the tasty food and excellent service. Everyone was so positive and attentive that it's hard to even suggest improvements. The only thing that comes to mind is enforcing a dress code - was a little surprised to see people in short shorts and flip flops in the dining area. Also, as others have stated, $14 is a little high for drinks, but seems like the Newport Beach prices moved to Houston with the restaurant.
