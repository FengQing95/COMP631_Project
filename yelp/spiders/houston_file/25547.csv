Uchi////But c'mon dude. I don't care if they're advertising grade 20 wagyu--I probably wouldn't get it again. That hot rock wagyu was a bust, but I admit the novelty factor was a 10-out-of-10; but ponzu sauce for beef...? I guess they were going for something like a 'tataki,' and 4 itsy bitsy pieces that cant fit on a ball of rice...? The cuts felt extremely underwhelming; the wagyu barely had any fat lines and even though we tried very hard to maintain the tenderness & texture while trying to get a good sear, it just didn't deliver.
