Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've been wanting to try this place for awhile but the wait is always super cray. Decided to give it a go. The wait was 45 minutes to an hour... ok. I've waited for two hours on the reg for Hula Hut in Austin. I can do an hour. Um, no. Started off outside.... copped a squat on the curb but after 30 minutes the sun was cooking me and I don't have much padding on my backside so I wandered inside for some AC and give da booty a break. They have complimentary coffee but only have that green crap to sweeten it with. Coffee was mediocre at best. I waited about 50 minutes total. The waitstaff was excellent. Loved my waitress. I started off with a spicy Bloody Mary. Holy crap it was good. Ended up drinking two of them. I ordered the breakfast pot pie and I couldn't decide between the sweet potato pancakes and the OMG French Toast. The waitress offered to bring me a half order of the French toast and a sweet potato pancake "on her." I know they do this all day long. I wasn't special. But I took the offer anyway. The French toast was ok. The sweet potato pancake was awesome. The breakfast pot pie was pretty good as well. My favorite part was the Bloody Mary though. All in all, I would go back and try some other items, if the wait wasn't as long. I don't think the food is worth a 1-2 hour wait. Not sure what the hype is all about. It's no Biskit Junkie.
