Kata Robata////I have been a loyal Kata Robata customer for many years. I enjoyed their food and frequently dine in before the pandemic. However I experienced terrible service today when I pick up my online order(check #6) around 12:20pm. The hostess who delivered the food to my car was very rude and had a terrible attitude. She tried to squeeze in a giant to go package through the driver's side window and refused to walking to the passenger side to leave the package for me when I asked for. She gave me a really rude look and answer. This is unacceptable for a so called nice restaurant. When I read other customers reviews. I found others had the similar experiences about the bad services from hostesses. Manager please pay attention to your services.
