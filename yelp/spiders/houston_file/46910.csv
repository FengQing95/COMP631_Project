Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I am surprised I did not love this place. I came on the weekend and maybe that was the problem. I fully expected the long wait to get a table and then to get our food so that was not the issue. The food was not that good. I think it was too rushed due to the crowd so the food suffered. My scrambled eggs were under done. I sent them back and the girl took them to the kitchen and came right back in literally 30 seconds with looked to be the same eggs. My pancake was overdone and hard. The hash browns were mushy. Bacon was cooked just right. I asked for grape jelly for my toast and was told they do not have grape jelly. I found that odd for a breakfast place. They do not have regular soft drinks....coke, Dr Pepper and so on. They have the main root brand of soft drinks. I hate when places do that. It's like a hipster thing I think. Anyway, I have not tasted a flavor yet that tastes any good. The inside of the place is clean with plenty of seating. Staff was nice. Parking is not the easiest as their lot is small. If you park on the side street be careful to watch for all the signs that say you can't park or you will get towed. I will give this place another try maybe during the week to see if I get better results with my food.
