Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////hi nicole,  it took me a moment to reply to your message but i'm always glad to help businesses who want to improve their quality.  as i mentioned in my review, the biggest improvement you guys can make is to do something about how quickly the food is going cold.  i read some of the other reviews and many customers had the same observation as me.  the food is not just room temperature, it's ICE-COLD.
