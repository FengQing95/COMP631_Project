JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Very much impressed! I am a first timer.. I got the JinYa Bun which was delicious! Ordered the "Pork Chashu Bowl" and loved every bite! I tried my coworkers Takoyaki (octopus ball) yummy :) We got "pick up" .. it was super crowed at lunch time(Thursday). Looking forward to eating there next time.
