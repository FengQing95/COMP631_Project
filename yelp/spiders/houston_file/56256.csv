Kata Robata////My mom got very upset about the quality of the service so I asked to speak to the manager. Honestly, it seemed he didn't care that much either. Our server made a little effort after that, needless to say, our dinner was ruined already anyway. I work in the same industry, I gotta say, it was the worst service I've ever had. There are so many Japanese restaurants in Houston, I'll definitely go somewhere else next time.
