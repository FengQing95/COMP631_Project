Local Foods////I absolutely love Local Foods! I've been coming here since it opened, I've always ordered the Harvest salads with shrimp, the dressing is SO good. My only complaint is that mostly ALL of their sandwiches are not gluten free friendly, which means if I want to eat a sandwich I have to bring my own gluten free bread, that's kind of a bummer! I do appreciate that they have gluten free desserts and the best fresh squeezed juice. I always bring my friends here and they love it.
