Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the breakfast pot pie (replaced the sausage gravy with black beans and green sauce) and bf ordered the summer harvest. Both were great, filling, and not too heavy! We shared the omg French toast afterwards which made for a great dessert! Bf has ordered orange juice as well, but our server completely forgot about it so we let it go.
