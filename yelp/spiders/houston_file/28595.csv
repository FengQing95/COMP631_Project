The Pit Room////If you haven't been, this is an absolute must! I am from out of state and had to take fellow conference attendees then make another trip with family later in the week! The photos speak for themselves! The smell of bbq entices you from the get go! With extremely attentive staff, this is on my list of must visits in Houston!
