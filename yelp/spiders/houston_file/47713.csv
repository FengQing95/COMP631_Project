Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So, while I am happy for all the people who think this place is the best, I think it is really geared toward those who want whipped cream covered pancakes with chocolate chips, etc. It is not for someone who wants breakfast. I pointed out to the waiter the manager had said there was no charge and he went to check to be sure. They did take care of the check. I left a $5 tip as it is not the waiter's fault if food is not right.
