Baby Barnaby's////My co-workers and I came to Baby Barnaby's Cafe one morning after work. Baby Barnaby's can have a long wait on weekend mornings, so we were lucky to get there right when the restaurant opened. They offer a small menu, but it includes a wide range of breakfast items. I ordered the Smoked Salmon plate and WOW. Not only was it huge, it was delicious! It definitely hit the spot after a long night at work and I even had leftovers to take home for later. Looking at my co-workers' meals, all the proportions are huge. I sampled everyone's meals and everything tasted fabulous. The place is quite small on the inside, so if you'd prefer more room, snag a table on their enclosed patio. Another great place to add to my list of favorite brunch spots!
