The Pit Room////The Pit Room delivers the flavor, texture and tenderness that brisket is supposed have when it is properly smoked. We eat here often, and always suggest to friends and out-of-town guests. It's simple, reasonably priced and always filling. I have fallen in love with the brisket tacos, and though I take them away often, they are best eaten right away. Â
