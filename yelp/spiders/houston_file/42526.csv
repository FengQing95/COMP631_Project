Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Best ever ever ever. I only get baked goods here, as it seems like all of their savory food involves some kind of undercooked protein (not a fan!)... BUT their breads and pastries are second to none! They have a pumpkin croissant this time of year that is so rich I can't eat the whole thing. They used to have an olive-walnut loaf of bread that was my favorite. I didn't see it this last time - I hope they haven't stopped making it. Over all though, I've tried probably 20 different baked goods here and I've never been disappointed. My husband says they make great espresso drinks, too.
