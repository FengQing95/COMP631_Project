Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Just had an amazing dinner at Bosscat! The food was outstanding - my favorite, if I had to pick one, were the pulled pork hush puppies. The atmosphere was great - lively but not loud. Our server - Terry - brought just the right amount of fun, sass and expertise. He definitely created a great dining experience for us. I will be back!
