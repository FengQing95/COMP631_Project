JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is the second time I've been here. It was just ok the first time so I came to give another chance....to my dismay it's just as worse. The soup base was too salty and not good at all. Ordered an octopus balls as a side dish, was just a saggy potato with an inch of octopus inside. I will drive two hours just to get the best foods in town but this place I will never come back here again...even if they move next door.
