JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Combo: we didn't realize this the first time we went but the second time we saw that you can upgrade your ramen to a combo. I got the fried chicken/salad add on to my ramen and was totally worth it. The dressing on that salad is addicitingly delicious and the chicken perfectly hot and crispy (granted though I shared this with the hubby; so unless you have a big appetite, consider splitting this combo add-on with someone else)
