Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////WOW!! If you believe palates have orgasms, this is the place to get them.  On a date with "The One"? Skip your romantic expensive dinner and go straight to your 120 second sex session, when you wake up spend the dinner money at this place.  Is very rare to find breakfast places that would rival a good dinner, but i guarantee Common Bond will not dissappoint. This place has not failed to deliver. I love the idea that they are constantly changing their menu, so even when you don't know what you are going to get, you get quality ingredients.  The only thing that is a con about Common Bond is the parking, be ready to fight for a parking spot like the crazy ladies you hear on the news during the Christmas season.
