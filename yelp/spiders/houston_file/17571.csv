Uchi////Uchi finally got it right for me this time.  We didn't have to wait for our reserved table (though granted I intentionally made a later reservation at 8:30 this time), and every single dish we got was OUTSTANDING. We even let our waiter surprise us with one dish this time, which I was hesitant to do after my last bad experience, but he gave us one of the best dishes of the night! It was mussels with honeydew and basil and cilantro, and it didn't look like much but the flavors together were magic.  Best Uchi visit yet!
