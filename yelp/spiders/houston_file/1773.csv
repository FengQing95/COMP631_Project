JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Pretty good Ramen. Unfortunately my standards soared after Totton Ramen in New York which is everything a Ramen place should be like. In any case, this is Houston. Nice broth, good noodles and good toppings. My only complaint is that the place is too "fancy". To me, slurping a bowl of Ramen should happen in a no-frills humble abode and this place has really cold AC and techno music (which always decreases the quality of my culinary experiences).
