Kata Robata////When the hostess came to seat us she somehow only had a table for 2, despite us clearly telling her we had a party of 4, so we were seated on the patio. The service was subpar and the sushi (roll) menu was very limited. When we questioned our server about other rolls and options, we were told that they have all the 'traditional' rolls off-menu but couldn't put all of their rolls on the menu would be too big. Great, in theory, but how are you supposed to know what those options are?!? Especially if you're first timers, as we were. We asked if they had paper lists from the sushi bar and were told they didn't, which was super helpful as well.
