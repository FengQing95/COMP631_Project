Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went for lunch. Service was great - prompt, never an empty glass (bottomless mimosas), courteous. I wasn't too hungry so I had the avocado salad which was well chopped and put together and tasted great. Ambiance was great, perfect mix of chill with good pop music. Really want to come back to try the whiskey selection.
