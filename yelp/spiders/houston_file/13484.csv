JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Quantity / Prices: First off, the service here was pretty nice and fast, so hats off to Jinya for that. Now, just like most Japanese restaurants, the portion size compared to the price of the dish can be a little harsh. And in this case, even for quality ramen, the cost of the bowl of Ramen is pretty expensive compared to it's ingredients, portion, and work put into making it.
