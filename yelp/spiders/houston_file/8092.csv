JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Again, this is my favorite ramen place in HOUSTON. Their broth is good, but not the best I ever had. I just appreciate this place for giving a lot more options than other places in Houston. I prefer thick noodle ramen and this is the only place that meets all my ramen needs. I usually get the Tonkatsu Assari (original ramen).
