JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I loved the fish broth in the Cha cha cha ramen. It added an extra dimension to the ramen, which I liked especially since I find regular tonkotsu ramen fatty and one dimensional. The noodles were just right and the broth didn't burn my mouth. I think I would have liked some crunch woods ear mushrooms or some type of mushroom added. But it was my first time so I like to have it as they recommend.
