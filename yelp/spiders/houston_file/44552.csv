Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We've come here a couple times for regular food (and of course ordering an almond croissant to go), but it's just been ok. We've had the fried chicken and waffles and then also the monte cristo, but they just weren't memorable. Maybe I've just had bad luck, but my advice would be - stick with the baked goods and be the nice friend that scoops up the extra croissant - looks like a badass present in the to-go boxes they have ;).
