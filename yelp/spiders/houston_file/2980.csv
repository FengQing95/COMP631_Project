JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love Jinya - it might be the only place in Houston that I'll actually drive to for takeout since it's not on any delivery service. The ramen is just good and I love the various toppings that they have as adding options. Once, I ate there and ordered appetizers as well at the bar - that food too was very good as well. Overall, haven't found another ramen spot I like as much and while I wish they had delivery, I understand that's it very challenging to do so - it's very busy all the time because people like it as much as I do.
