JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////If you are a ramen fan this is the place for you! If you don't like probably shouldn't go to a ramen bar. Great service, great food. I have been here twice and had an excellent experience both times. You can't call ahead so depending on what time you go you may be waiting a while to get in. But it is so worth it!
