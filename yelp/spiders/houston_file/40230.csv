Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////delicious food and i was so happy they were open and accommodating during the winter storm. however i think that charging for sauces and refills on soda is a tad extra at a restaurant in this price point. That kinda turned me off. I'll be back but it went from a 5 to a 4 for the strange extra charges.
