JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hands down the best ramen place in Houston! I'm so glad this place opened up. It's opened late AND it's good! My go to place for ramen in Houston now. My favorite is the black ramen. Get the fresh garlic! It makes a huge difference. Also, I really enjoyed the Takoyaki as well. The fries were only alright. Not much to fuss about. But for sure everyone has to try this place.
