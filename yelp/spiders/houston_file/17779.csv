Uchi////I wish the service was less fast paced. They were quick to clear plates, ask if we wanted anything else, while we were not even done eating a dish. I didn't like this. I also felt a little hovered over. I don't know what's the deal with these new trendy places being like this. Provisions is like this too. It's great that the food comes out fast but give me time to enjoy it!
