Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////But onto the important stuff - the FOOD. OMG, their monkey bread french toast is the bomb! Hubs let me steal some off his plate and I shared some of my egg white omelette. Peeps - Let me just say that I get egg white omelettes at all kinds of places and this is by far one of the best places I've had one. Everything that came in it was just out of this world deelish. I also had their Mmm Mmm Mimosa and it was tasty indeed. What I appreciated was that they gave it to you in a nice size glass giving you your money's worth. Their side of hashbrowns were impressive too and I don't even eat hashbrowns.
