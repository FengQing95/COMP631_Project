Uchi////So my friends and I, a total of 5 people did Omakase where we didn't have a set number of courses, it was more of a "hey we'll bring us dishes until we say stop" style. Plus if you think about it, it's SO MUCH CHEAPER than the ones listed on the menu. We ended up having 21 dishes for all 5 of us. I repeat TWENTY ONE DISHES. On top of that, we had a bottle of wine and cold sake.
