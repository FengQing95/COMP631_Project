The Pit Room////The pulled pork was not bad, but not in the same class as the others. It was cooked well, tasted slightly vinegary. Don't know if they used a reciped from the Carolinas or Tennesse where it's often served with a vinegar-based sauce. I still ate it all and liked it. Might have liked it better with sauce.
