Local Foods////The food was very good and well priced. I had the shrimp & crab sandwich, which was very good. The Tuscan kale and 4 bean salad were both well prepared and have good flavor. The desserts are really "mom's originals," made in mom's kitchen right around the corner. Personally not a fan of the butterscotch brownie but the 7 layer brownie is killer. Must try!
