Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My husband & I and another couple went here for dinner during HRW 2017. Loved the atmosphere and all the decor in the restaurant and bathrooms!! We sat at a 4 top right by the bar against the window that looks into the kitchen. I would've preferred a table in the back & will make it a point to request when I make reservations. The cocktails were hit & miss. Tried 6 and only liked 3.... the guys tried multiple whiskeys and liked them all! Hush puppy app was ok, we really enjoyed the pork belly/potato app, ate every bite! Tuna wraps & Mexican street corn from HRW menu were both fantastic!!!!Husband got the shrimp & grits and really liked it. One person picked the snapper off the HRW, she said it was good, the other two ordered the short rib dish, also very good!
