Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////A few of my friends had been talking about this place and had recommended it for brunch. Being the brunch queen that I am, I made a reservation for 4 for Sunday brunch yesterday. The vibe was great; music was on point and it was a very cute venue. Shrimp and grits is my go-to when brunching, so of course that's what I ordered, and so did my friend. The other two people at or table ordered the fruity pebbles French toast and chicken fried steak I believe..
