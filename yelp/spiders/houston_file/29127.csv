The Pit Room////The beef sausage was fantastic...had a slight gamey taste with perfect seasoning. The brisket was perfectly cooked and the ribs fell off the bone. They had a few different sauces, all a great accompaniment to the meat. For sides, we got okra and beans. Both were very good. Make sure to not sleep on the chips and queso. Absolutely delish queso.
