Local Foods////Ok so we wanted to try something different and decided to try it. I had the Asian Chicken Slaw and my vegetarian husband had the tofu salad. Both of us enjoyed our lunch alot. Each dish had a very fresh taste to it because everything was very fresh. Something you can't find often. The salads had a very different twist to them so thumbs up for originality. The restaurant is very trendy even though its a coffee shop and sandwich restaurant. Very comfortable and warm. My only complaint was the lady at the front that was not very helpful that took our order. 28.00 dollars for 2 salads, a tea and a cupcake. Not too bad for a lunch.
