Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Stopped by for the first time after a concert for some drinks. Vibe is perfect. DJ set was on point but was super chill. Dan rocked out the bar with high quality cocktails and friendly banter. 10/10 recommend. 300 whiskeys available. Good spot for night cap. Going to come back and try brunch!
