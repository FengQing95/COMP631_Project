Kata Robata////Service: I made a reservation with OpenTable and we were seated within one minute of our arrival. Our waiter was really cool. Very informative and helpful with menu recommendations. He also brought out a strawberry shortcake with a lit candle for my friend's birthday. There was only one time which we waited for like 5 minutes to get our waiter's attentions so we could order more drinks. Other than that, service was good.
