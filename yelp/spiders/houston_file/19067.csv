Uchi////Not excited to write about this one because I may just get angry again (I will try to be as nice as I can). It was my friends birthday a couple weeks ago so she made a reservation at Uchi. The lady called her the day before and told her to get there a bit early because they wouldn't seat everyone until her whole party was there...understandable.
