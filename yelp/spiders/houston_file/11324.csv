JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We have been here several times but for some reason the salmon w cilantro and the spicy tofu salad were extremely salty today. The salmon did not have the citrus soy sauce taste as it usually does and the tofu salad was overly salty today. They did remake it but sadly, it seems the recipe changed bc it was still not good. However the California poke bowl is still consistently good.
