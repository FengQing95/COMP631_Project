The Pit Room////Our first time in Texas and our first time at The Pit Room.. holy shit was that good! There is a reason this place has a line out the door! The moment you walk in you get smacked of that smokey delicious smell. When you order it's like cafeteria style, you tell them exactly what you want and they carve the meat right in front of you and put on a silver tray platter, then you pick your sides.. and proceed to the cashier with your tray of glory. Starting with the  potato salad, it was flavorful well seasoned just right.. the jalapeño cheddar sausage, it's super smokey with a nice snap on the skin.. then the pulled pork sandwich, absolutely juicy and tender... good portion too, not dry what so ever. Then the brisket, literally melts in your mouth as you chew.. the seasoned bark is packed on.. you can see the thick ruby red layer in the meat... you know it's was smoked for hours. And finally the beef rib.. it was so fatty, dripping juice, tender AF, the rub was coated generously.. absolute mouth explosion! All of the meats weren't salty but seasoned well! They give you barbecue sauce on the side. There's also an area to get other sauces and pickled sides for free next to the drink fountain. Definitely never seen a place this packed in the afternoon!! Can't imagine getting a table here for dinner time. 10/10 for sure!
