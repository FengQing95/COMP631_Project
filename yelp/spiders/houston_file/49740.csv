Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////May was our waitress and super knowledgeable about the menu and personable! We split the benny duo with the chile Verde (added Barbacoa on top per May's recommendation) and the benny goodman. Both were amazing! Side of bacon is a must! And my most favorite thing... drumroll please... OMG French toast! The name was obvious after the first bite- definitely the best I've ever had!
