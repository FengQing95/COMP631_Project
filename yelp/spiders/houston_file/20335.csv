Uchi////The price was a little high but we tasted almost everything they had to offer including a small off menu chef tasting that was amazing. For what we ate and experienced I was fine with parting with a portion of my paycheck. You really could walk out of Uchi with a sub $100 per person bill if you didnt imbibe their creative cocktails and sake, or let the wait staff guide you through some amazing discoveries, but what would be the fun in eating at one of Houston's premiere restaurants without letting loose a little?
