Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The ATMOSPHERE: Very cool and trendy. It's dark which lends to the late night social vibe they are going for. There are TV's in which to watch sports, but it's not sports-bar-feeling at all, which I like! It does get loud in there, so be sure to be in a very social mood!
