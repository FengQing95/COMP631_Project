Uchi////Have visited multiple times.  My teen daughters love it,  High tastes!  However, last visit not what we expected.  Went for my daughter's 14th birthday - pretty impressive that she chose this restaurant.  Was not expecting a song and dance but her bday was barely acknowledged - would have expected comped dessert for a repeat customer.  Also, the server basically just placed the food on the table without explanation - in the past, great waiters have given lots of explanation - we love to know the unique items that we are eating.  I guess she figured she didn't need to do that for a repeat customer.  Food good as usual - love the brussel sprouts, fried milk, nigiri, ham and eggs!  take better care of your loyal customers......
