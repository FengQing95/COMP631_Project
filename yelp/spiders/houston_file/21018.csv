Uchi////Literally life-changing. From the moment you enter until dessert, you are treated like royalty. They run like a well-oiled machine. My husband and I went here for our anniversary and sat at the sushi bar. Asked for the omakase and were not disappointed. The place get packed early so make a reservation if you can. If you are prepared for a wait, they have a great bar, with knowledgeable bartenders and fix you ANYTHING your heart desires. Everything is SUPER FRESH and amazingly well prepared. There is no soy sauce to dip your little nuggets of joy. The chefs brush on the exact amount of sauce on each piece of fish before delivering them to your eyes with a flourish that is akin to a magician's wand. I wish I could give this place 10 stars!
