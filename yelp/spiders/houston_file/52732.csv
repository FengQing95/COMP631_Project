Kata Robata////The sashimi here is amazing! Well with the price and will go back for just that. However the rolls and other menu items we had were just lacking, either for what you paid for vs portion size or in taste.  Loved the Kobe beef bites but it's small and only 4 small bites.  The lobster Mac and cheese wasn't my favorite at all.  Anyway go for the sashimi, just don't get caught up in the rest of the menu!
