Uchi////No surprise, but I recommend reservations. This place is permanently packed from open to close. It's a moderate size restaurant and would be perfect for any date night. It's loud, but it's cozy enough to be intimate. We got a reservation and sat at the sushi bar. I think this allows for the best experience. You are thrown into the proverbial trenches with the sushi chefs and you get to watch them masterfully work their craft. The chefs are friendly, helpful, entertaining, and such a joy to interact with.
