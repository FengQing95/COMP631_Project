Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////2. When I placed our order, I was told that I could wait at the barista counter for our serving of orange juice. Â After standing in place for 10 minutes, I gave up. Our food arrived at our table before the orange juice was ready, meaning we did not have a drink with our food. Eventually, the orange juice was ready; however, ice had been added, which diluted the orange juice, took away nearly all flavor, and resulted in us having to throw it away ... a waste of $3.25 plus tax.
