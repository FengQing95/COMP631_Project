Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Loved the totchos and avocado toast!. The bosscat fries were pretty ordinary. we were also pretty disappointed in the country fried steak because there was a bit too much gravy and the flavor was strong. Other than that, the chilaquiles and the breakfast burrito was good.
