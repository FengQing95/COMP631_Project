Kata Robata////We started with the Kobe Beef Skewers. Pricey at $17 a pop, but pretty delicious and unique. My wife and I don't normally eat beef, but her eyes got big at tasting these little chunks of kobe. We also got the Hamachi and Jalapeno sashimi. It was pretty good, but I think it was one of my least favorite items of the night.
