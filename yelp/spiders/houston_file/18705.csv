Uchi////Dined here three days ago on a Friday night with my girlfriend. I hate brussels Â sprouts, but the way they make them here, I can't eat just one, keep popping them in ma mouth like eating popcorn. Ordered two machi cure and two walu walu, these are our favorite items. The foie nigiri is very good, but $9.50 is pricey just for one piece. The zero sen and ham & eggs rolls were great. My girlfriend had a glass of moscato, it went very well with the meal, and I had the Asahi.
