JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love it. This was our first time having Ramen. We decided to go here instead of Indian. We surely did not miss going for Indian food. All we ordered had its own original taste and different from the other bowl we ordered-spy you chicken ramen, spicy miso ramen, slurpy cilantro, cha-cha with vegan broth and kids ramen with wings and fries. Simply delicious and will be back!! Surely will try more and more Ramen!!
