Uchi////If I had a gripe, it would be with the pacing of the meal.  It started out good, with each dish coming out one at a time with a short break inbetween.  But at one point, we ended up with 3 dishes in front of us at once.  Not really an issue when it's not hot food, but I would have preferred it been a little more staggered.  But it was really a minor issue, and it did not distract from the meal.
