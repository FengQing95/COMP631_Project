Kata Robata////Eh I use to love this place, we came not very dressed up and the server treated us horribly like we couldn't afford anything. I been here so many times. The food was really awful this time especially for the price. I'll have to retry again and see what I come up with. There are plenty of good sushi places around Houston area!
