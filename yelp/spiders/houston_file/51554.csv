Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////One of my girlfriends suggested this place for a Saturday brunch, and since it was already on my restaurant bucket list, I agreed.  I had heard there was a long wait there, and boy they weren't kidding.  We got there around 11, and there was an hour and a half wait.  Geez.  Well alrighty then.
