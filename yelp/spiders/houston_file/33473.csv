Local Foods////4.5 rating? Really, guys? I had Local Foods on my radar as a must try place... I'm really confused as to why with so many reviews this place has such a high rating. The food was sooooo bland. I had their roast beef Sandhills and the soup of the day. I even let the guy at the counter order for me since I eat out so often and get tired of ordering for myself. He asked if I liked spicy rtf... Of course I said yes. Spicier the better! What came out was the most one of the most boring sandwiches I've ever tasted.
