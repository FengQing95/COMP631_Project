Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////So glad we came for dinner here! The ambiance was beautiful, staff was delightful (I forgot our great server's name... Jacky maybe?) Everything we had ordered was scrumptious. The short rib, the salmon, the fries (even though at first I thought they were burnt) I'm so glad Newport Beach has a location because we will definitely be going there in the meantime while we come back to Houston. Thank you guys!!
