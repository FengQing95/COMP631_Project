Local Foods////Why isn't this place closer to me?! I could seriously eat the crunchy chicken sandwich every day. I was afraid it'd be underwhelming, but it was SO flavorful, perfectly seasoned, the pickles added a sweet crunch, and the pretzel bun put it over the top! The truffled egg salad sandwich was really tasty as well and had the perfect balance of eggs and aioli.
