Uchi////Walu walu, ham & eggs roll, and the eggplant sushi (forgetting the name) are all GREAAAT especially for people who "don't like sushi." I am obvs not one of those people but I have taken a few to uchi and they are always amazed. The ham & eggs roll in particular is so delicious and creative. Actually the same goes for the eggplant...and the walu walu.
