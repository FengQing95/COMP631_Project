Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Finally came here and after waiting for 30 minutes for a table (which we expected), we waited an hour for our food to come out. When it did finally arrive, only one of the dishes was hot. The server and manager apologized for the delay and offered a discount but it did not make up for the long wait and cold food.
