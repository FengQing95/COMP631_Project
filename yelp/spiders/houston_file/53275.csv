Kata Robata////The Kobe beef short ribs were cooked until they were falling off the bone and served atop a fluffy cloud of miso mashed potatoes. I usually enjoy Kobe beef in it's steak version, but what a comforting dish! This dish was a great display of Asian/American fusion home-style cooking, probably best enjoyed during the winter months.
