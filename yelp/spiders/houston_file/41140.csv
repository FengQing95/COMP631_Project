Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We finally have the perfect baguette!  The fresh-squeezed orange juice is heavenly.  This place is about quality, and the pricing reflects that.  It's modern, calm and sophisticated...take some time to appreciate what is happening here.  So lucky to live nearby!
