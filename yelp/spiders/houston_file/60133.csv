Baby Barnaby's////I've gotten their pancakes, their green eggs, and pretty much every item on their menu before and I can highly recommend that if you love brunch, come here. If you don't, this place will make you love brunch. Even their bottomless coffee is solid. DEFINITELY get the green eggs if you never have before, and convince your friend/your date/your lucky other person who gets to also experience Baby Barnaby's to get the pancakes, so you can have the best of both worlds.
