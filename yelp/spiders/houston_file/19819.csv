Uchi////I may get shanked for my review, but I must speak from my experience at Uchi. I can say one word to sum this place up, overrated. It isn't horrible by any means, the service is top notch, very attentive waitresses and overall an extremely classy joint. Unfortunately the food didn't match the service quality wise and was way overpriced for what it was.
