Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////So here is more in the review. Music was loud, the service was very slow and the waiter was inattentive. Not many people in the place at the time and I still had to look around for him then we decided to leave. The drink was on the pricey side for what we received. Anvil is much better for the price and atmosphere as well. Really sad because I love bourbon and the bartender couldn't even do that right. Your establishment just doesn't offer anything special. Several establishments have a large bourbon selection. Try Whiskey Cake. Happy hour $5 old fashion made to perfection.
