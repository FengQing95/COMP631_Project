Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If your in Montrose part of town and are looking for good decent coffee and an actual legit parking spot this is the place to go . It's a little small and crowded but the drinks are good , did wish the servers were more attentive other than that the place is good for a nice cup of coffee and dessert . I do find it very helpful of the owner for having a parking area as oppose to the competing coffee shops since the neighborhood around their isn't what it used to be , if you leave your car around the streets parked people will break into your car .
