JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Moira - Thank you for your review. It has never been our intention to "hype" our restaurant. More than four years ago we sought to introduce something new and enjoyable to Houston since at that time there were not so many dedicated ramen shops in our city. Today, as you mentioned, there are many more options for ramen, and we strongly believe there's plenty of room in Space City for everyone. We'll never be all things to all people, but we work hard, and we do our best to provide a quality product. Thank you for giving us a try, and we wish you the best.
