Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The staff was cool, nice ambiance for a restaurant, nice bar area. I just was not impressed by the food & I tried. We ordered 2 salads which are huge dinner portion size but did not eat more than 3 or 4 bites. The dressings had lackluster flavor & the lettuce on one tasted like eating a pine tree. So bitter you could not bare to eat it. The other salad just basic with avacado & tomato on it with oil & lemon, can totally make a better salad at home. The Dr pepper Wings were so tough it was rediculous. They looked so good but fighting to get the chicken off the bone made them not so tasty. I was very disappointed by the food & although it's a beautiful restaurant definitely consider somewhere else if your extremely hungry for a salad. Maybe other options on the menu are better. Hopefully.
