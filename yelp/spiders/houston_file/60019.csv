Baby Barnaby's////I got the green eggs, which were so damn delicious. The chicken apple sausage and potatoes were also bomb. Our other friend got the breakfast plate, which he enjoyed. Service is sometimes forgetful. My friend only received his iced tea when we were almost finished with the meal. He ordered it before we even ordered food so that was lame. I'm not at all a germophobe but seeing the stacks of coffee cups in an uncovered outdoors area near the coffee grossed me out a bit. Whatever, the food rocks and it's reasonably priced. I'll be back ASAP.
