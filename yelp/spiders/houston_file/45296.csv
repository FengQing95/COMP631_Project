Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Hi, Amie. We understand your frustration.  Due to the fact that we have been messaging on Facebook Messenger about the incident already, we will continue to correspond with you that way unless you prefer Yelp private messaging.  If you need anything via Yelp, please let us know.  Thank you for the review and as mentioned, we will continue to coordinate with you as we have been, via Facebook messenger and can hopefully resolve the situation as we had previously discussed.  The landlord, and owner of the lot, tows after 11:30 pm, but we will discuss with you in more depth on Facebook.  Thank you again.
