Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The place is a bit pricey, but you honestly can't be stingy with your wallet with an establishment that really shines through each individually, crafted pastry. You can tell that detail matters to them. Not only are their foods a work of art, the packaging and place itself is visually pleasing and capturing. I promise you won't be let down. I hope you enjoyed this place just as much as I did!
