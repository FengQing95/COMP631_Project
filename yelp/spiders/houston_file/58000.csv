Kata Robata////Love this place. Their sushi is good but I come here for their robota menu. Kobe beef tender juicy Â and too die for. Lobster mac n cheese= never found a place that can compete. This is a must try. If you want to try something unique you can get the bone marrow too but I think portion is meh. Try to come around 4pm walk-in or get a reaervation for anything after cause this place be popping. For good reason too!
