The Pit Room////Very nearly the best BBQ I've ever had, and hands down my new go-to BBQ place to take people visiting from out of town. The brisket is ridiculous (but, like, in the best way). Their house-made sauces are on-point. The tacos? Oh man, the chicken taco with charred garlic is just stupidly delicious. I haven't tried all the meats yet and am holding off on trying the chili until it's closer to sweater weather, but everything I've had so far has been good. The only weak link I've found is that the elote tasted a little plain, it was still early days when I had it though... Excited to have a place for great BBQ in the neighborhood.
