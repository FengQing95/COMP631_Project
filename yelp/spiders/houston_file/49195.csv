Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////If you decide to eat brunch here after 7:00AM, be prepared for a long wait. Typically, the wait is about 1 hour to an hour and a half on the weekend. They text you when you table is ready and give you up to 15 minutes to check in. I suggest getting there earlier, putting your name in, and walking around the surrounding shops or getting coffee while you wait for your table to be ready.
