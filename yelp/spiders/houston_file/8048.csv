JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been coming here for about 2 years and the ever changing young staff is generally friendly and good. Be forewarned that there are rush hours when a table will be hard, if not impossible, to come by, and if it is crowded with drinkers and eaters (like any authentic ramen bar) you will be in for an exciting, noise filled time.
