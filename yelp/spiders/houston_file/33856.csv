Local Foods////There are already a lot of raving reviews for Local Foods, so I will probably keep this short. Out of all the places in Rice Village, Local Foods ranks in my top three (along with Torchy's and benjy's). I've tried a few of the sandwiches, and my favorites are the truffled egg on the pretzel bun, duck confit, and the gulf shrimp & blue crab sandwich.
