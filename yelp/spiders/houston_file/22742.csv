Uchi////A piece of sushi that was to die for was the nasu (japanese eggplant). The eggplant has a nice smokey flavor. The gyutoro changed my life. Okay, not really, but I like to talk a lot, and it shut me up for sure. It literally melted in my mouth... speaking of melting in mouths, the foie gras (duck liver) was amazing. I hesitated at first, but after just one second, it completely melted in my mouth, and was by far the richest in flavor of the evening. The last thing I will say about the food, is trust the chef's special/chef's selection. We ordered several over and over again, and everything was on-point. Last, the service is amazing, but that should go without saying considering what you (or your date) will pay! The only downside is that I've been ruined, because the sushi I can afford can't compare!
