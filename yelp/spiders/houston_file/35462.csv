Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Excellent selection of whiskeys and creative southern foods. Waiter Terry M is the best! Great personality, polite and knowledgeable not only on the food and drink, but the history. Meatloaf squares are a good place to start. As are the pull pork hush puppies with Salt Lick BBQ dipping sauce...although more pork in them would be nice. The place is lively and active, which also means loud, so expect it a place to go out for drinks and fun, but not a romantic dinner for two.
