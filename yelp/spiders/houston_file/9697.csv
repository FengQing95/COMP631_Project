JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Regardless, and above all, please accept my humble apology as we seem to have failed our primary goal for each and every guest, which is that they leave our establishment happy and satisfied. As you might glean from our Yelp reviews, we don't get too many 1-star reviews, especially out of more than 1,300 reviews so far, so I want to make sure you know we take your words seriously and with utmost concern.
