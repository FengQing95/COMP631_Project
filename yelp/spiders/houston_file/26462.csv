The Pit Room////Don't get what the hype is about at all.  Although I am a Midwesterner, I consider myself to be a barbecue connoisseur, I love barbecue.  I have traveled a lot over the years, and each new city I visit I make it a must to try barbecue.  So I have tried a lot of barbecue, and I can honestly say that there wasn't anything special at all about this place.  I got the two meat platter-ie-brisket and pork and two sides-Mac & Cheese and mustard potato salad.
