Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////expensive but very good! the egg scramble was so tasty and the feta cheese on top was divine! the shrimp bayou was superb and half of it went home with us to be eaten later. The fried chicken biscuits and gravy was great-- lovely coating on the chicken, jalepe√±o gave the gravy a bite but not too much and the biscuits were slightly sweet and very light. the Nutella croissant was a bit much and the croissant itself was relatively dry.
