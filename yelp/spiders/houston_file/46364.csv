Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Been wanting to come here since forever, but with all these bakeries in town I finally got around to coming here. The only reason really was because of the patio where I could bring my dogs. It is a nice place to bring your dog out. The food compared to others i would say beyond the looks the taste was just ok. Nothing caught my attention although they were all beautiful to look at. My pistachio crossaint did taste very good. The inside had some type of pistachio almondlike filling. The seasonal item i think was the stollen bread was good too. Overall not bad, but not one of my favorites
