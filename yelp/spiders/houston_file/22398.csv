Uchi////I may have been the lone holdout in Houston's foodie army to visit Uchi, but coincidentally the week I decided to take the leap turned out to include a visiting Paul Qui! A friend was lucky enough to snag an early reservation so off we went (even taking off work a bit early to make it!). Parking is pretty much just valet behind the building. All the spaces are a little tight, but not uncomfortably so. While waiting on the patio, you can get drinks and snacks. Staff was very welcoming and friendly. Our server was knowledgeable and thoughtful, offering suggestions and explaining the menu options. And here we go!
