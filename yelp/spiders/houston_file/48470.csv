Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've been hearing about Snooze so much, this morning I decided to give it a try. Parking is very minimal, but that didn't bother me at all. The wait for a seat wasn't too bad, I decided to sit at the bar. Whomever the lady was behind the bar was so NICE! She held casual conversations with all the patrons, and was welcoming to everyone. I ordered the scrambled eggs with a side of bacon and hash brown. The eggs were ok, slightly cold, bacon and hash brown were pretty good. Ordered one pancake just give it a taste, wasn't really what I expected but I wanted to try it out. Nothing was really special about the regular mimosa, but the specialty mimosas were pretty good. I'd have to say the morning margarita was AWESOME! Most of all, I love the environment in Snooze. I'd def go back to give it another try.
