Since I used to live right next door to this place for 2 years I can tell you how many yuppie, impatient snobs would huff and puff over the .5 to1 hour wait. Don't expect anyone to remember your name unless you're a local or regular... even though you've been by yourself 3 times. The waiters are always very nice even though they see tons of people in just a few hours. The food and coffee here is very fresh and hot! If you have time to sit back and slow down life and really enjoy this place, you will take something much more from the dining experience. This is definitely not a place for people in a hurry. Parking is everywhere. Just pick a street, any street. I moved away from the area but I try to make it in when I stay in the area at friends.
