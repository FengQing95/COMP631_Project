Baby Barnaby's////I had such a good time with the family today. The food was excellent and the service was warm and welcoming. I had the French toast and bacon, my partner in crime had a steak and the kids had waffles and pancakes stuffed with blueberries. I felt comfortable and was checked on the entire time I was there. I Â will definitely be going back!
