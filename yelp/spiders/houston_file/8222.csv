JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////- TAKOYAKI ($6.95): This appetizer comes with six octopus balls. The way that they are presented looks like six lollipops or cake pops. These were good, but not the best I've had. I didn't care much for the toppings or the sauce. I felt like the sauce was too thick for me to dip the ball in. Also, the ratio between the dough and the chopped octopus was not even. There was a lot of dough.
