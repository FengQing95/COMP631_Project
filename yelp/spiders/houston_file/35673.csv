Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////For our appetizer, we ordered the Bosscat Fries, which were really more like wedges. They were nice and crispy on the outside and fresh! For our entrees, we ordered the heirloom tomato bisque soup that comes with a grilled cheese and the Vietnamese chicken wrap that comes with 2 small wraps. All of the food was delicious and fresh! I was very happy girl. :)
