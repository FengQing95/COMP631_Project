Uchi////We ordered the Kara Kyuri (phenomenal cold sake drink with cucumber and Thai chili), wine, beer, escolar, bacon tataki, Zero Sen roll (AMAZING), the Hama Chili, brussels sprouts, shrimp tempura, and the fried milk dessert. Everything was excellent, fresh and flavorful with the exception of one dish- the bacon tataki. For pork belly, it was very tough and chewy, our entire table agreed and we sent it back. The chef remade it and the second order came out much more tender, but still not my favorite dish. I would not order it again.
