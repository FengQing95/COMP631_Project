Kata Robata////So Kata doesn't get 1 star because it puts out solid food, but if value isn't there, you expect a better than average environment and great cooked foods as well. Unfortunately Kata Robata didn't deliver. I would be willing to try this place again at a less busy time, but with all the other restaurants in Houston I'd rather keep trying new things or go to places that are consistently great quality rather than give a mediocre place another shot.
