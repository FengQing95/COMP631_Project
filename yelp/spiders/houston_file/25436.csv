Uchi////This is my favorite restaurant hands down for over the past year. The food and service is out of this world! I would honestly say this is the best sushi restaurant in Houston. The happy hour is amazing everyday 4-6 with an amazing selection for vegan/vegetarians!! I come here every week, literally. Evy and Nora are excellent servers!! Super kind and loving staff. I bring all my friends and family here and not one person hasn't liked it! YOU WILL LOVE THIS PLACE.
