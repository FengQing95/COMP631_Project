Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////What a great place! An eclectic menu to go along with a very unique atmosphere. The acoustics of the restaurant are pretty bad so it's loud but it was so enjoyable. I had the pork belly poutine and I damn near passed out it was so delicious. That meal is a culinary adventure. The bartender recommended that I add an over easy egg fried in duck fat and I should have kissed him on the face for it. I had the Irish mule and it was delicious. The servers/bartenders were very professional, on point in every facet of service. I was disappointed to not see any whiskey recipes with St Germain's but that's kind of my jam so I can't really fault them for that. This was an experience that I will remember. That poutine, I will never forget. Great job, folks!
