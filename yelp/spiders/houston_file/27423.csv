The Pit Room////Every aspect of the experience was great. The line moved fast. Seating opened up at the perfect time. The sauce perfectly completed the protein. Even the selection of Mexican and local beer was awesome. The brisket disintegrated in your mouth. The pork had perfect seasoning. Potato salad was perfect to end the meal. None of the food was overly greasy.
