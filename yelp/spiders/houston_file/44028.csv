Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'm giving this place 3 stars because I tried 2 different pastries and they were not great.. bummer.. also there wasn't enough seating so I was cramped in a corner outside. Lots of people were ordering a pistachio swirl pastry. Keep an eye out for that and if you pay a visit I'd recommend trying it.
