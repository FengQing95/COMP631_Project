Uchi////Came here with my husband to celebrate our anniversary. It was our first visit and we were both very impressed. Food was outstanding, and beautifully presented. The service was excellent; servers were knowledgeable, helpful, friendly and attentive. Meal was well-paced. Great sake list; I really enjoyed the one I chose (described as having caramel, coriander and earthy tones). Â Fried milk dessert was very special. We were stuffed and very happy! Even the valets seemed especially committed to excellent service! It was such a treat to dine here. Considering the level of food and service, the final tab, under $190 including the tip, was well worth it.
