Uchi////I got a few suggestion from my girlfriend on what to get, but the cold appetizer was from the waiter, which he suggested the "must get" Hama Chilli Cold App. That came out and it was the first to get but def didn't blow my hat off. The WaluWalu was the hot app we got and it was pretty good. Basically escolar fish cooked with a carmel sauce and glaze on top. Good but not something i think i would crave for.
