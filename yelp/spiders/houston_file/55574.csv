Kata Robata////Kakuni pork belly - came with some stir fried spinach and a poached egg on top. Per our server's suggestion, we broke the egg and gave it a good stir. The dish has the right balance of sweetness and saltiness. The meat was so soft and melted in my mouth. Definitely my favorite of the meal although I wish it had come with two poached eggs. I couldn't really taste the egg yolk at all after mixing everything together.
