Uchi////A verrrry festive group of 6 went for a birthday celebration, and it was one of the best meals in recent memory. Or long term memory, either.  Details are a bit fuzzy (lots of sake), but the overwhelming impression was  "MOREMOREMORE". We did both the 10 course tasting and the 6 course chef's special menus.  I recommend both, but lean slightly towards the 6 course. Don't forget dessert...who knew Beets could be amazing (yes, beets. Just try it. Really).
