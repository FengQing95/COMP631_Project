JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Our food came out quickly and our drinks were refilled often. I ordered the Spicy Chicken Ramen (mild) with an egg. My noodle were perfectly cooked and the broth was extremely flavorful. The egg.... My goodness the soft boiled egg was the perfect addition to my ramen! The yolk was creamy and paired perfectly with the noodles.
