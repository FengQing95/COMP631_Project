JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is one of my favorite ramen spots in Houston! Parking is slightly annoying (in the garage behind it), and there is always a line. Never be discouraged by the line, it usually goes pretty quickly, and it's worth the wait! Your entire party does have to be there in order for them to seat you. I would recommend smaller groups for this location (and ramen really in general).
