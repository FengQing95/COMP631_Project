Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Strike #1: The hostess with the long pony tail was extremely snotty when I asked her how many tables were in front of me. She pointed out that I have only been waiting about 10 out of the quoted 45 minutes. Thanks captain obvious, but that's not what I asked. After waiting more than an hour, I came back up to check on the status and they had obviously skipped over us. Instead of a simple answer like she gave the guy in front of me, she had me spell out my name and confirm my phone number. Then told me she would seat us as soon as they cleaned a couple of tables. At this point we had waited approximately 70 minutes. Arrived at 12:50pm and got seated at 2:00pm.
