Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I want to update my review to another 5 stars. I want to thank the regional manager for his amazing customer service. I won't say what he necessarily did but he gives my daughter with a surprise for her up coming bday and was just so nice to her while I waited in line. He was so friendly snd the staff and service was the best like always. I drive all the way out here from Katy that's how much I love this place. The coffee desserts and food are just to die for. I'll never stop being a customer here.
