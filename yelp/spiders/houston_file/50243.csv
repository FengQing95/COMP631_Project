Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've been dreaming of getting the pancake flight for quite some time, and so I indulged in the pineapple upside down pancake, the omg! French toast, and blueberry danish pancake. The French toast was my favorite while my hubby couldn't stop scarfing the blueberry danish. However, I wouldn't say these are the best pancakes I've ever had. The actual pancake itself wasn't enthralling (We all love a fresh, fluffy pancake--so you'll get closer to one at IHOP or Denny's), but the toppings/innards were interesting. We also shared a Bennie duo, with the chilaquiles Benedict and chile verde pulled pork Bennie. Wow! These things are incredible! I can say with confidence that they're some of the best eggs Benedict I've ever had. In fact, I dare say the chilaquiles is the top one on my list!
