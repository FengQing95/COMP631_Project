The Pit Room////I can deal with supply problems and attitude problems for great meat. This was not great meat. There was WAY too much seasoning and it was weirdly spicy. I had the brisket and the turkey. Both managed to be weirdly dry in spots, let left the biggest grease puddle I've ever seen from barbecue. It was kind of disgusting. The sauce couldn't save it either. It was too vinegary and again, weirdly spicy. That seemed to be a common theme for the Pit Room's food. I tried my husband's beans and they tasted like I was eating a jalepeno. The spiciness just overpowered all the other flavors in everything we tried except the mac n cheese. It would be more appropriate to call it cheesy pasta soup. I have never seen more watery mac n cheese sauce. Basically, the food was not great.
