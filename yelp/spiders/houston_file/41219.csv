Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Loved basically everything about this place! Food was great, service was good, and the way my dish was prepared was awesome! I had the Hawaiian Royal which was a pork belly perfectly marinated and cooked over Hawaiian styled rice with a warm buttery bun on the side. It was delicious!
