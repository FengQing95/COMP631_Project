JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I started with a Jinya Bun. It normally comes as pork belly, lettuce, a cucumber, and mayo stuffed in a bun. I took the cucumber out and had the mayo left off. It was good and the pork belly piece was spot on. I clearly did not agree with the set up of the bun, hence my modifications. My other friend thought the cucumber was not a good addition to the bun and messed with the entire composition of it, so he also removed the cucumber. I get they tried to add it to help the texture and crunchiness of the bun, but it did not work well. They should've just put more lettuce to create the same effect without taking away from the entire bun.
