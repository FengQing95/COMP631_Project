Uchi////My boyfriend and I came here for our Valentine's Dinner.  The waiter mentioned a few of their recipes have changed, so their when some of their dishes came out, we were a little shocked. There was only one change in a roll that I was slightly disappointed.  However, even with the changes, we still love Uchi and I can't wait to come back. Below are a few memorable items.
