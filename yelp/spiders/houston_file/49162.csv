Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So impressed :) We were trying to squeeze breakfast in in-between early doctors appointments in Houston and flying back home to Detroit. Not knowing the area, we were unaware of the automatic wait at Snooze. We had a pretty finite amount of time for waiting, eating, and traveling. When our wait time was getting close to ending, I asked how things were coming, and was told 10-15 minutes more, which unfortunately wasn't in our agenda. The hostess problem-solved and got us a table outside, where we could order right away.
