Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Not worth the hype. The wait on the weekends easily crests past an hour, which is completely unnecessary for the quality of the food. I've been a few times and have had it served on the colder side more than once. As for positives, the taste is great and the menu is very solid. The interior is hit or miss, depending on your personal preferences. Parking is definitely a pain. I'd highly recommend hitting this place up on a weekday if you have one off because the wait is far more reasonable.
