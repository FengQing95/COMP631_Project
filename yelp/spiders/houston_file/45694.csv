Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I got the Earl Grey and pear scone with a cappuccino. To be honest I was really disappointed in both. The scone was really dry and hard. Every time I ate a bite, I had to wash it down with water or coffee. The cappuccino was just okay. It was more bitter than I usually like it.
