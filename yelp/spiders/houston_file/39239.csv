Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We each had two drinks. I had a House Old fashioned (really well made) and a couple of fingers Stranahan's. My wife hard the 38 Special and the Kentucky Orange Blossom. The drinks really shine, which makes sense they are a whiskey bar. (They were all $14+, though, so be prepared to spend.)
