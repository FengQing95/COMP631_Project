Uchi////Average sushi for the overly hyped reviews. The sashimi doesn't taste as fresh as it should, for the price that they charge compared to any other Japanese restaurants I was expecting better quality. I was quite disappointed, having ordered at least 10 different plates on the menu. Â Flavor was lacking in authenticity to say the least. Skip the overrated disappointment and try Kata Robata, for better prices and fresher sushi/sashimi.
