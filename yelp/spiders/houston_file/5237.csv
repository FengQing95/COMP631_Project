JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I finally got around to trying this place. Usually when I drive by during dinner time, the line is always out the door--nothing is ever worth waiting in a long line to eat when I'm starving. Finally, on a Tuesday night around 6:30, I went with a couple of friends with no line! Service is pretty fast. I had the chicken ramen - it was EXCELLENT! I don't have that much ramen to compare this to, but it's definitely WAY better than the ramen from restaurants in Houston that serve it. Next time I want to try some of their appetizers and the ramen with pork broth. I'm so looking forward to it.
