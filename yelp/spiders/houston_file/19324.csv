Uchi////My fianc√© and I had dinner at Uchi this past Saturday and we cannot stop raving about it! We were given a gift card over a year ago and I must say we took entirely too long to grab dinner there because we can't wait to go back! Every single thing we tried was excellent... Drinks, appetizers, dinner, dessert, you name it, it was amazing. Just make a reservation in advance because they get booked up quickly!
