Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The ordering concept is a little confusing. You will see the counter with all the baked goods and a separated coffee bar in the middle of the store. You order all your items directly at the counter. You can choose to sit anywhere you want (if you can actually find a spot). I'm sure the patio is going to be great once summer is over.
