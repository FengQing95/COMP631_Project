Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The restaurant had a really nice vibe and atmosphere. The menu selection was not to big or overwhelming to chose from. I got the chicken sandwich it was ok, was a bit dry and too much breading. The fries were my favorite and the discs that comes with them. It is a spicy ketchup sauce, really nice flavor. However the drinks were not too good in my opinion. I ordered a margarita on the rocks and also an Irish mule. I feel the flavor could have been brought out a bit in the margarita. The flavors were fresh but I would have liked more lime. The Irish mule was a bit different I think maybe they left the ginger beer out to long and it became flat.
