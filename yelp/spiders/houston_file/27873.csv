The Pit Room////I visited Pit while in town for the week. Being from Illinois we went out of our way to find good BBQ in Houston and this did not disappoint. Compared to Jackson St BBQ, the meats were positively described as lean by my guests. The sides were all enjoyed by our group and I really appreciated the condiment bar with an assortment of pickled vegetables. The space is cool too: ordering is done at the counter and then you have the choice to sit in the smaller area inside the same building as the kitchen, go outside to sit on the huge deck with numerous table options, or go inside of a bar type space.
