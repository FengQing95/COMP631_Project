Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was... meh. My sandwich was overstuffed, overcooked, and teaming with kale and some kind of special sauce. It was the closet thing on the menu to a traditional BLT and was still pretty "meh". The OJ tasted old and fermented, like it hadn't been refrigerated properly. I told the waiter it tasted funny, and he politely argued back that they only served fresh OJ. I asked if it was squeezed or concentrate and he replied that they served it from jugs that they ordered; obviously cheap concentrated juice. I sent the OJ back and kept drinking the water. My mom's pancakes looked so sickly sweet with all the chocolate, caramel, and powdered sugar that I didn't even want to taste it. Her coffee was overly strong even with 2 creams and sugar.
