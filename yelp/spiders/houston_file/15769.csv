JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the spicy chicken ramen and my friend order ordered the creamy vegetable ramen with edamame. Neither of us were a fan. Mine was pretty bland. From the noodles to the chicken.and broth. I added some of the Ramen Seasoning but was hesitant when they described the ingredients to the seasoning as "everything under the sink"... the edamame however was very salty :/ but sort of helped add flavor to my pallet.
