Baby Barnaby's////This place was a good place that I found and that was referred to me by one of the locals in the Heights area. I can honestly say that I was not disappointed, as soon as I walked in I was greeted by two smiling faces. Â  I can honestly say that the green eggs was off the chain and I will definitely be back when I'm in the area.
