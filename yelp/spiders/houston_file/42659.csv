Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Trying out the common bond for the first time today. Loved it!!! Smells wonderful the minute you walk in. Cozy atmosphere. Expect a line though even at 9:30 in the morning. But the wait was worth it! ordered a chocolate croissant, an almond croissant, brioche, salted caramel and lemon macaron. Love love their croissants! Flaky and buttery.. I personally think their almond croissant is the best! A must try :))
