Local Foods////Got the gluten free bread for my chick sandwich. It was okay. I do have to say the sandwich was piled high in chicken, a bit too much for me. And a little on the dry side. Loved the kale salad (would have been satisfied with a big bowl of it) the olives, and the chicken orzo soup! Â I would come back but try something else.
