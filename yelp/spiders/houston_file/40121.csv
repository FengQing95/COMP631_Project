Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////At 11am (September 14, 2019), the guests start to arrive and the hostess that was working at the time was beyond rude and impolite. The information she was telling me was the exact opposite of what I was told when I called 2 weeks ago.(I called twice to verify too). I'm confused at why she'd try to turn down a party of 15 when at the time they had plenty of tables available...?
