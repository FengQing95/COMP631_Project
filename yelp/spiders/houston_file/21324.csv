Uchi////From all the reviews and hype from Uchi, I expected more from this place. Don't get me wrong, all the food was delicious. Never had sushi Japanese food like this, its a great experience. It was a special occasion, we came here for a birthday dinner. There was only 4 of us for this event, but Uchi is able to accommodate large groups, so don't turn away if you're thinking that. They have a private room for larger parties, but make sure you call and make a reservation.
