Baby Barnaby's////I got a $10 plate of medium rare steak, potatoes and sunny side up eggs, which is a great deal! Reasonable price for a simple all American brunch. Food is tasty and the portion is hefty for the price paid. If you're expecting out-of-this-world exotic spices then this isn't it, but it is simple and delicious for a filling meal. Expect long waitlist because it is a small cafe with limited seating, but overall a positive experience. Will definitely come again
