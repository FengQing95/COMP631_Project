Kata Robata////Jk - I'll give you a real review.. The cocktails were amazing, especially the shisito Mojito. the sashimi was out of this world. The fish collar, nightly special, Â was so delicious/fresh, paired perfectly with the sauce. Amazing flavor. It was a little disappointed that I could not walk in and partake in the whole Omaski Chef experience but the bartenders drinks and recommendation made up for it
