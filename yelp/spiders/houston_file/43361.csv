Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Food is pretty good.  But to me not worth the extremely long lines.  I would say though do NOT order a custom cake here.  The communication is horrible, on their website you have the option to submit an online order. I submitted my order on June 29th for an August 13th cake, i did not get a response from Mandy until July 10th.  I missed her call and never received another follow up call until literally 2 days before my cake was to be completed. I ended up going to H-E-B who wowed me on the cake and was 80% cheaper.  I had high hopes for this place, but not worth my time or money.
