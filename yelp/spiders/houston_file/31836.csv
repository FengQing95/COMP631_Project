Local Foods////Not worth going again. yes, food is healthy. Yes, it's organic (at least they claim to be). But the sandwiches are so bland, and with that kind of price? Might as well going to Subway twice. I would've given one star, but the dining place is nice, so I give them an extra star. Oh, and parking sucks! It's within Rice Village afterall.
