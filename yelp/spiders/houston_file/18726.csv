Uchi////Hamachi Cure 5/5 - The heart of a transcendent dining experience is evocation that doesn't fall too far in to imitation. Take the "sashimi nacho" presented here; slightly smoked fish, a nut, some fruit, sitting on a plantain chip. Combine all those flavors and textures and you evoke KC Masterpiece chips. Cannot be untasted. Always fascinating.
