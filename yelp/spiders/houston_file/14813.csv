JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Service was great. Food is so overrated though, I don't see the hype. This place is always so packed so I thought we would give it try but neither of us liked it. We got the spicy chicken ramen & it tasted like an upgraded Maruchan ramen noodle. Waste of money i am disappointed I wasted my time and money waiting to eat here.
