Uchi////Almost as soon as he left, we started getting dishes right and left.  We kept looking back at the menu, trying to figure out what each one was called.  Everything was fantastic- we couldn't get over the amount of flavor disguised in every bite.  Neither one of us is usually a fan of brussels sprouts, but wow- these seemed to literally burst with flavor.  Sweet, salty, hot and crispy, almost caramelized, we couldn't stop ourselves.  At one point they even served us a roll that appeared to just be a bed of rice topped with avocado slices.  They looked pretty average to both of us, until we tried them.  Where on earth did all this flavor come from?!  Hidden underneath the avocado was a slightly spicy, tangy sauce that left both of us shocked and wanting more.
