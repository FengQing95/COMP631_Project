Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I love Bosscat. Parking I feel is a little weird. They offer valet, but if you don't want to valet, there is a parking garage just down the road that is free. As soon as you walk in, it is clear this place is all about elegance. Towards the back there is a private dining and tasting area. It was my first time here recently so I was unsure of what to expect. We made reservations and I am glad we did because as dinner time cam around, it started to get crowded, so reservations are highly recommended.
