Uchi////Am I the only one that notice how expensive this place is? Yes the food was superb. But it was one of those places where the portions were extremely small that you knew you would be going to McDonald's after...and yes we did, McDonald's 20 pc chicken nuggets after a $100 per person meal at Uchi. Don't get me wrong, We'll spend the money at expensive places when we know we'll go home talking about the food (we've eaten at Michelin restaurants in Europe for 900 euros for 2), but spending $100 per person when you don't feel like you'll come back? No thanks.
