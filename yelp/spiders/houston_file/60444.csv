Baby Barnaby's////So many people have already raved about Baby Barnaby's and their delicious food so I'll keep it short. Baby Barnaby's is a super cute and tiny cafe known for its brunch. It's very popular, with lines that wrap around the block on weekends, so be sure to get here early and sign up on that clipboard! I ordered the Green Eggs and substituted the toast for biscuits and mm the dish was wonderful. The veggies added flavor and texture to the eggs, the biscuits were warm, fluffy, and sweet, and the sausage tasted unique and yummy. The only small thing that bothered me was that everything had salty undertones, making me really thirsty, but it's miniscule. The servers were so friendly and I'll definitely be back to try all the dishes on the menu!
