Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Ok I went for a brunch date with a few friends of mine. Im going to assume since its fairly new that was the reason for our ridiculous wait! The food was fair, for the time that it takes to get seated and receive your food you would at least expect it to be some what AMAZING. Would I go there again, maybe but I do not encourage going if you are super hungry. I got the French toast, cant go wrong with that!
