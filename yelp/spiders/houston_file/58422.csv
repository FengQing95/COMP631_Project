Baby Barnaby's////Plan on waiting about 30 minutes before you get seated if you arrive during meal time.  Since there is no hostess, do sign on yourself in on the waiting list hanging on the pole by the entrance door; otherwise, plan on fasting!  This place is really cozy and situated in the middle of neighborhood (very interesting zoning).  We tried the green eggs, hash brown and corned beef, and migas.  Their hash brown and corned beef is served on a hot plate and we found it to be really exceptional.  Service is very efficient and friendly.  I will definitely come back to visit this place!
