Kata Robata////I  ant believe that I'm writing this.  But what happened to Kata?!?  There HAD to have been a change in the kitchen.  I order the same thing every time I come here.  It's been about 4 months since I last came by, but such a huge difference in the taste and quality I'm so used to.  None of it tasted fresh at all.
