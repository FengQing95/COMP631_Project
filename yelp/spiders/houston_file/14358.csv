JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love coming here and honestly don't mind the community table at all. The staff are all nice and treat me well each time I've come. I love the vegan ramens and love the variety of choices offered! I tried the vegan tacos this time around and they weren't too bad, I may just stick to the ramen and fried spinach though.
