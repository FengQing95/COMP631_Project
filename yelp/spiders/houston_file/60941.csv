Baby Barnaby's////I wanted to try a new breakfast spot, when I saw the rating on this place I knew I had to try it. I called to see the wait for To Go orders and there was none, so I went ahead and pullep up their menu. At first I was going to get a regular breakfast plate, but then I saw "green eggs" and was intrigued so I went back to look @the reviews and holy moly! People were raving about the green eggs and the pictures of it looked tasty. I ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancake (recommended by the person who took my order), with Green Eggs and Chicken Apple Sausage. The food looked good, and tasted better than I expected. Everything was DELICIOUS! The pankcake was moist, fluffy, huge, and just perfect in every way. The green eggs, OMG! I've never ever had eggs cooked & seasoned like this @a restaurant. The chicken apple sausage was really good too. This is literally one of the best breakfast places I've visitited in Texas! The portions aren't skimpy either, I was able to eat off of my breakfast twice and was full both times. This is a bit of a drive from Katy, but it was worth every mile and minute. I seriously can't get over how good the food was and I'll be back for my next cheat meal.
