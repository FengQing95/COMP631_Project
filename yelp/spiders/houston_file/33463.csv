Local Foods////Everything here is sooooo good. Seating is weird, but the service is great. This location is actually better than the one on westheimer and Kirby, even though it doesn't have a full bar. The kale salad at this location tastes vastly different from the westheimer location, in addition to the menus not being identical. Parking can be a pain, but it's worth the headache.
