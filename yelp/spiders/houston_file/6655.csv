JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As such, we train all of our front of house staff to REPEAT their customers' orders (sometimes three times) to ensure accuracy. This is good business practice. Moreover, our staff and bartenders DO NOT ASK FOR TIPS. Our bartender says you handed her cash and a credit card, and she asked you how you would like the bill split. Full stop. We are professionals in the food-service industry in Houston, Texas. If our front of house staff asked customers to tip, we would be out of business so fast your head would spin. I have been in the restaurant business in Houston for more than 20 years. I know what I'm talking about.
