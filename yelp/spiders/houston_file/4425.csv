JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen here is quite good. The broth seems to be cooked twice. Boiled down, cooled and then boiled again to get a very milky color. The broth definitely sticks to your tongue, so it would be wise to drink a beer or sparking water in order to experience each spoonful anew.
