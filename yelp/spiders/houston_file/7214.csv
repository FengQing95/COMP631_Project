JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Hopjes - Thank you for the great review. I'm glad you enjoyed our fare. I do agree, however, that loud music is not for everyone. In fact, I prefer dinner over soft music. However, JINYA's restaurant concept is geared towards a trendy, loud atmosphere. And this is, unfortunately, one of the many guidelines we are legally bound to follow as a JINYA franchise. Regardless, I will relay your message to our corporate headquarters.
