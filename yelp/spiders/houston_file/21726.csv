Uchi////I have been twice to the Houston location and once to the Austin location. I find it's best to just tell the waiter what you don't like and let them pick a few dishes for you (but always get the Walu Walu). The way they combine the dishes is just magical. Things you would never expect and never order- you devour. Seriously, just go.
