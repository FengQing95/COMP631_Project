JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is my go-to for ramen in Midtown. Had their mini salmon tacos which was a great starter. Their Brussels sprouts with spicy mayo sauce has the perfect crunch. Finally, I ordered their new shrimp and chicken wonton ramen with chicken broth. I added bok soy, seasoned egg, and broccolins. Have no complaints! Delicious meal.
