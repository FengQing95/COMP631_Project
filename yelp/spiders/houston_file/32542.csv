Local Foods////I ordered the truffled egg sandwich with the lemongrass soup.  The sandwich was very, very good.  The pretzel bun was perfectly toasted, and the tomatoes, lettuce, mayo, and hunks of parmesan were a perfect pairing. My only issue is that, being an egg sandwich, you can't really monster bite into it without squeezing the eggs out the back, so you end up taking a bite of the bottom egg part, then a bite of the top veggie part, and hope the two mix in your mouth. But that is the nature of the sandwich and it was delicious. The lemongrass soup was an odd taste for the first two spoons--true lemongrass soup always tastes odd to me--but then my mouth got used to it and it was overall satisfying.
