The Pit Room////What a find!!  Thank you again Yelp! Hands down the best BBQ in my life. Carved to order, cooked to perfection and so flavorful. Even the sides are awesome. They had a Waygu rib that was fit for a Flintstone, but at  $35 a pound it would have cost $50. That was out of my price range.
