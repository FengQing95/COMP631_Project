JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Don't take this review personal because I will admit I'm biased. I don't even like ramen but decided to eat here because I was outnumber by my friends. To start of our night, they refused to seat us until our party was complete and we were missing one person. Working in the restaurant business, I would've been more understanding if they were actually busy, but it was not a full restaurant with plenty of tables opened.
