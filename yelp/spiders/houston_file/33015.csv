Local Foods////While I was at Rice, I went to this place ALL THE TIME.  I discovered it during my junior year, and regret not having found it earlier!  It's a bit removed from the main part of Rice Village, which is why I overlooked it for quite some time.  I made up for it by going there entirely too often after that.
