Baby Barnaby's////I ordered the green eggs and my friend ordered the Lox platter. Our food came out quickly and the serving size was huge! When I took my first bite I swear I was taken to another planet. Seriously, this stuff is delicious! My friend also tried my food and she was in heaven. The eggs were just amazing. I can't even describe it, haha. The chicken sausage was really unique and had a sweet taste to it that I enjoyed. My friend said her Lox platter was really good but it was a tad bit salty.
