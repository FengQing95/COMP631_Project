Uchi////My only regret after visiting Uchi was that I wished I would have ventured here a lot sooner! So my girlfriend and I decided to come here for a late dinner on a Wednesday evening. We drove around the complex looking for a parking lot just to discover that only a complimentary valet service exist. Â Any-who, upon arrival, we were informed that there would be an hour and fifteen minute wait for a table. Wowzer! But no worries, we decided to sit in the patio area and order drinks. So all the reviews on Yelp about a long wait were true. :P
