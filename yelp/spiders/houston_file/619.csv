JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////However on my second visit there were some quality issues. I came back with 4 of my friends and we ordered a few different appetizers to start. Brussels sprout tempura was excellent however the Gyoza tasted like the frozen kind you can get at the grocery store. The appetizers were the highlight overall because the ramen was just bad this go round. I recommended to one of my friends to give the spicy miso a shot. When I got it I loved it. When that came out from a distance it looked great. However upon further inspection there were some clear problems. The soup wasn't that spicy, but that's fine there's spices on the table. But it gets worse from there. The soup hardly tasted of miso and was very watery. It's almost as if they didn't have enough soup to make an entire bowl so they just added hot water to what ever was left. We sent it back to the kitchen and he got tonkatsu black and was okay with that.
