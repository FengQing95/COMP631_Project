The Pit Room////Came to Houston with my boyfriend for the 4th of July weekend. We had to try BBQ before we went back home to DC. I must say our first and only stop to have BBQ was here and was not disappointed. We tried the brisket 1/2lb and beef rib 1lb and it was soooo delicious and tender the meat would just fall off the bone. I had mac and cheese for my side and best mac n cheese i had ever had. My boyfriend had the potato salad and got food poisoning. That was the only food we had different and i did not get sick and we always share our food. Other then the potato salad everything was fantastic and the service was great as well.
