Baby Barnaby's////Came here for a Tuesday breakfast and ordered the green eggs. We showed up at 8:30am and snagged one of the last 4-top tables. We were immediately served with a big glass bottle of water, but when we ran out just after ordering food, we never got refilled...til the very end when we asked for it. And I mean, ASKED. We tried to make eye contact with the servers. We even had to raise our hands, which is something I avoid at all costs b/c I know how annoying it can feel to servers. But not having water for the bulk of our meal is also unacceptable. I really liked my green eggs though - it was on the heavy side but absolutely delicious. Came with toasted wheat bread and crunchy potatoes. My dining partner's blueberry pancakes were outstanding as well - soft and fluffy. Got upset again at the end b/c when we asked for water, the waiter had turned around before I had a chance to ask for a to-go box. Surprisingly though, he managed to bring one. As he dropped it on the table, I asked if we could get 3 little ones, but he had again turned his back on us. Again though, he brought the 3 containers. Hmm...I like to be acknowledged when I speak to people... I guess I wasn't completely ignored, but still. Overall, I've had better experiences at their other locations (4-5 stars).
