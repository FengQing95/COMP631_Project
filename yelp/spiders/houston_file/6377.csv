JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Got the chicken ramen, chicken bowl, and chicken appetizer lol..... They were all good. A bit overpriced for ramen though. It's just one of those places I'll try once just to try it. However, i would say it's the best ramen place in Houston so far. People made it sound like it was spectacular, but ramen is ramen in the end. Cool interior and cozy.
