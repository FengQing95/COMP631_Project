The Pit Room////I am very torn as to if I really want to do this review because then everyone will know how great the bbq is here.Since everyone that was working there was so kind I decided I would,lol.I know good bbq when I taste it and when I think the best I think of Franklin's and LA BBQ in Austin,Snow's in Lexington,Pinkerton's in Houston and Corkscrew in Spring.And for everybody reading this,no not Killen's' as it is the most over hyped barely average bbq place I have ever eaten at.The Pit Room is close in taste and quality as those mentioned.We tried the beef rib and it just fell off the bone without being too greasy and or fatty.I would stand in line just for one of those bad boys .I give it a nine out of ten. Wait,it gets better.The pork ribs were tender but still had some substance and nice bark.A nine.I am sounding like a broken record but the brisket had a nice smoke ring and was melt in your mouth .Again,probably a nine.The turkey was so moist and actually fell apart on my fork.A nine.The pulled pork was great but I want to try that on one of there home made tortillas next time.I hardly ever use sauce but it went great with the tender juicy pulled pork.Last but certainly not least was the house made venison sausage.It was juicy but when I dipped it in their house made mustard all I could say was holy sh-- that's good.A ten.When my better half says the potato salad is just as good if not better then hers then that is saying something.An eleven on a 0-10 scale !!They have a condiment bar that is second to none with their house made pickles and house made pickled onions !I didn't try their pies but did try the house made ice cream sandwiches and all I can say is wow.The staff was so kind and the pit master and owner both stopped by to ask how everything was.All I can say is guys,don't change a thing and keep making magic on those pits of yours !!!!!
