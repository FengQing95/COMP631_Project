Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////the manager came to our table.  she hinted that she recognized that  she had an issue with the employees at the door, and gave us our meal gratis.  (that was nice, but i would have much preferred to have been seated and served on the some basis as the rest of the clientele and paid full freight.)    then, the gentleman from the door came to the table and apologized, attributing our experience to a "technological error".     in his mind maybe it was.  i'd call it a moral failure.
