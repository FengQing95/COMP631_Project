Kata Robata////Very stingy with their sushi. We ordered california, spicy tuna, spicy salmon, caterpillar, and houston rolls. All had meager amounts of fish. The houston roll is 70% rice with tiny pieces of fish. If their prices are cheap, one would understand the need to have low quality rolls, but their prices are not cheap. In fact, their prices are way out of proportion of the quality you get. Go elsewhere...so many better choices in town.
