JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The interior is very dark and has a big common table. If you grt lucky, you will be seated in a booth. Ramen is very beginner friendly to those who don't eat it often. $13/bowl is always interesting for anyone used to top ramen but the taste is very generic and solid tonkotsu. Very fatty and delicious for a chain restaurant. Expect a wait on weekends for dinner
