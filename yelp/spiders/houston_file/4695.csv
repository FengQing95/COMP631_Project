JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi DW Y. - Thank you for the excellent review. I'm glad we rank among your favorite ramen houses. You are correct, though, we have cultivated a latenight crowd, especially on the weekends since we stay open until 2AM. But, overall, I'm glad you received good service and enjoyed our fare. We look forward to serving you again soon.
