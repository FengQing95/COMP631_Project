JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////If someone hadn't told me that this place was a chain, I wouldn't have known. The quality of the ramen is so good, I honestly thought this restaurant was a Houston original. The noodles weren't too soft, and the broth wasn't too greasy as I find is a common issue with most ramen shops. They load the bowl up with an ample amount of toppings as well. The portion was a bit small as I still wanted more afterwards, but maybe it was just because it was so good that I was still craving more. We also ordered the lychee mojito, which I really like because it was light and sweet. I'm looking forward to visiting other cities with a Jinya in town because this was one of the few ramen places that I thoroughly enjoyed!
