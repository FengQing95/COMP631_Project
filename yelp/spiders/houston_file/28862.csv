The Pit Room////I was looking through some Yelp suggestions on my home page, and that's when I came across The Pit Room. Reading all the reviews and salivating over the photos of BBQ, I quickly shared the page with my husband. He said, "the Pit Room--yeah I've been there before. It's pretty good." Wait a second...what?!? You've "been there before" without me, and didn't bother to bring leftovers?!? Once I got over the initial shock of betrayal, he offered to go pick up some food for takeout.
