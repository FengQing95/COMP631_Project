Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great food, good service. Another amazing brunch/anytime place in the Heights. They have all the yummy comfort food plus an amazing array of other items that are Tex-Mex inspired. This place is very popular and there's always a long line during popular breakfast and lunch hours especially on the weekend.
