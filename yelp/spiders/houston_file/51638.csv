Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is probably one of the best brunch spots I have ever been to. We joined the waitlist via Yelp and only ended up having to wait about 10 minutes before we were seated at the restaurant. Our server was very friendly and made the experience better. All of the food we tried was amazing! We ordered the sweet potato veggie smash up, snooze classic with a sweet potato pancake, and protein and veggie egg white scramble. The food came out quickly and was very fresh. The highlight was definitely the sweet potato pancake which was probably the best pancake I have had in my life! This place is worth stopping at and we will definitely be back soon!
