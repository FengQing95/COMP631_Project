The Pit Room////I also could not resist ordering the cherry pie [$4.50]. It was chock full of plump cherries. The pastry was a bit soggy in the middle but that's probably because I left it out in the heat while I ate the rest of the meal. The crust was firm and perfect though. Quite frankly, this cherry pie might have changed my life.
