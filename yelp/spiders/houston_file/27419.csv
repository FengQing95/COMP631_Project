The Pit Room////Shared the 3 combo meat with my bf and added a $23 beef rib. I've been to pecan lodge in Dallas and Franklin in Austin. This place can not be compared or even in the same category. We got the brisket, pork rib and chicken with a side of elote and Mac and cheese. The two sides were the stars of the dish. The meats were dry but oily with about 80% fat. I love fat but this fat had no flavor. The meat lacked in the flavor department. The rib was extremely salty (on the outside) but the meat itself was just dry and plain so the bbq sauce that it comes with is a must. That Bbq sauce made the meat edible. The elite was one of the best I've had. I'm from LA so we have our fare share of excellent Mexican inspired dishes. The Mac and cheese I liked cause I love cheese. I can see many not liking it however, it was lacking in the cheese flavor department as well and it was prob the most watered down Mac and cheese I've ever had but I still enjoyed it as something needed to go with the dry Bbq. Â We went on a Saturday around 12:20p and there was only one family ahead of us in line. No huge line and no wait was a plus for just meh Bbq.
