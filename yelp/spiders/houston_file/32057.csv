Local Foods////Never thought I would be excited to go out somewhere that mainly serves sandwiches! These are some of the best sandwiches I have ever had! I crave the veggie and the crunchy chicken all the time! Best brownie ice ever had: the butterscotch brownie here at local foods! I bought about 6 the other day to take with me to Santa Fe to give my aunt!
