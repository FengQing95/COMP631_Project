Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We had a reservation at 6, got there at 610 and we were seated with no fuss. Our waiter, Jose, was phenomenal. He helped us with ordering, we just told him what we had a taste for and gave us wonderful options. He was also really great with detailing exactly what goes into a dish and how it's prepared.
