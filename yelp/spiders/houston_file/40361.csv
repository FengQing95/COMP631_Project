Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I always have a great experience at bosscat! Shannon was an Â incredible hostess! She was really nice and attentive to our needs. Jerry was a very knowledgeable waiter as well. He took care of us in above and beyond ways. The food was also incredible and well seasoned. I'm from Louisiana so I am a stickler for tasty food. Overall, the best place to go to for brunch. I'd recommend the red velvet churros and the old fashioned meal. The mimosas are wonderful as well. 10/10
