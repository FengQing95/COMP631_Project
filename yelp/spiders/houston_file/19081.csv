Uchi////I recommend the brussel sprouts were delicious! I'm not brussel sprouts' #1 fan but they are so addictive. 15 pieces in, I realized I should probably let the other people at my table grab a few. My favorite dish to order is the ham & eggs. I have never had bad pork belly and this place is no exception. Probably one of the best things I've eaten in a long time.
