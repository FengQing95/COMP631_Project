Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////on my way to work and needed something to eat. I stopped for a muffin and a cookie. Only when I ordered a blueberry muffin I did not realize it literally meant 1 blueberry in the muffin!! You should order blueberries muffin and I should have gone to HEB and got a 4 pack of muffins for the same price. 2 strikes now so not going back.
