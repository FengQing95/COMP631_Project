Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////In the words of another reviewer "Folks, REALLY!!!!"  "We don't take orders even if you want 12 dozen croissants."  "We don't care if you are driving in from Austin to pick them up; we don't take orders."  "We always have plain, chocolate and almond croissants."
