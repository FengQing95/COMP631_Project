JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the spicy chicken ramen (spicy version) and added fresh garlic and an egg. It was AWESOME! I have never tried ramen before (outside of the college kid version), and it was heaven for my taste buds. I initially asked for it mild, however our server informed me that there is no spice whatsoever in mild and suggested I tried the spicy version and she was spot on. The spicy chicken ramen was the perfect meld of flavors and spice.
