Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I don' mind spending 15 minute looking for parking. I don't wind waiting in line for another 20 minutes to get to the counter. But running out of popular pastry around 2 o'clock in the afternoon after all of these is ridiculous. and believe me it happened to me 3 times in a row. I am sure many people like me will be discouraged from going back. It is not a rocket science to make more popular pastry and there are still 5 hours before you close.
