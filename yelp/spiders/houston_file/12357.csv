JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Wow! Jinya is so modern and makes you feel fancy. I always take houston visitors here to try the various unique ramen and appetizers. The culture here of the staff is also very cool and fun. The whole restaurant greets every guest loudly, it's like a celebration of service. Amazing experience!!!
