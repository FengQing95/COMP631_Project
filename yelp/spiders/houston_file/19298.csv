Uchi////I wish I could tell you the name of all 10 dishes we had, but they came out so fast I couldn't keep up. They did pace the dishes well, but as soon as we finished one, another one was already appearing. The staff was awesome and for every dish they told us specifically what it was and how it was prepared. I did love that. They were all attentive and helpful.
