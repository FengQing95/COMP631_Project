Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Rude male brings me my "cup" of tea while setting cup in a rude way on the table and stating "next time ask for a to go cup so the tea bag is left in there and you can get more hot water for a refill" Â okkk...sir! Now I now for next time but no one has explained this to me before or while making my purchase.
