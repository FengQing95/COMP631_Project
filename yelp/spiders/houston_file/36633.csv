Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I've been to Bosscat a few times in the past for brunch and a night cap and I've always had an amazing experience. Terry has been our waiter the past couple of times and he's always so much fun! Definitely going to continue coming here for the comfort food and my favorite whiskey drink, the Kentucky Orange Blossom.
