Baby Barnaby's////Baby Barnaby's was fantastic! Me and my extended family went here for brunch while we were visiting Houston for my youngest brother's college graduation. There were eight of us and we went at 10am on Saturday, so we had to wait for about 30 minutes, but it was absolutely worth it. The food was fantastic and the service was phenomenal. Highly recommend the green eggs, migas and corned beef and hash (best I've ever had!).
