Baby Barnaby's////Breakfast Tacos (3/5): I tried the breakfast tacos (chorizo, scrambled eggs, jack cheese with beans, potatoes, and salsa) the last time I was here.  Again, I do like the spices on the potatoes.  The tacos were good but just couldn't compare with Torchy's chorizo tacos; I'd give them 3 out of 5 stars.
