Uchi////Fantastic experience! Dishes were beautifully presented and tasted as good as they looked. The quality was comparable to high-end restaurants in the Bay Area. Service was attentive, authentic, knowledgeable and fun. Great crowd. Complementary valet made it even better. Looking forward to returning soon.
