The Pit Room////We have been to quite a few bbq places in Texas (like many others) and pit room is probably my favorite so far. I love brisket and sausage and I could not get enough. They have a pretty nice indoor and out door sitting area. The restaurant is close to nice coffee shops and in a walkable area so always a good option.
