The Pit Room////A good spot for bbq. I've had the chicken, brisket and pork ribs. Always good. I would say get there before the last hour because they can run low on different selections. The side dishes are okay, but the condiment bar is excellent. It has an array of pickled onions, jalape√±os,carrots that only enhance the bbq experience. The wife enjoyed the tacos from there as well.
