Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was very excited to try to place, but in all honesty was slightly disappointed. I attempted to come here 3 times, but the wait time was always over an hour long. Finally one day we got there around 9:30 am and was estimated a 30-45 minute wait and decided this was our time to tough it out. My absolute favorite brunch item is eggs Benedict and I get it at every restaurant and sadly this place wasn't the best. It was good, but not worth a 45+ min wait to eat in a cramped space (at least a 2 top). My boyfriend got the pot pie breakfast and was underwhelmed, although flavorful. Definitely needed something else. Â This place was good, but not really worth the hype in my opinion. Service was fine, but parking is sooooo inconvenient. I probably will not return here anytime soon, but will be at baby barnabys.
