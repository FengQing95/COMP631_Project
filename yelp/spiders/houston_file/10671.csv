JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Tokyo Yatai- I ventured out and tried this on one of my visits, and this was interesting...It is a lighter broth because it has pork and chicken broth. with chicken chashu. You can tell the broth is lighter than the usual pork broth. Still good, but it's not something I'm used to. If you're in the mood for something lighter, I would highly recommend this one.
