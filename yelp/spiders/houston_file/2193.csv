JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////1) "The place is ... relying on miso for soup thickness and savoriness instead animal meat/fat/bone." To make our two staple broths, Tonkotsu and chicken, we use pork bones and whole chickens shipped from organic farms to Houston via refrigerated. While we do feature a Spicy Miso Tonkotsu Ramen and Spicy Umami Miso Ramen, both of those dishes use a specific amount of spicy miso paste combined with our Tonkotsu (pork) broth.
