Kata Robata////Updating my previous review about their fantastic (yet pricy) food: They have removed many happy hour items, like the tropical roll and the Habenero Stud... two of my happy hour favorites. I hope this isn't an indicator of trying to make more profit by offering less, as sometimes happens once a place gets popular... On the other hand, you MUST try the pork-belly buns!!! Delish! I wish they could find a way to tone down the noise and bring a little Japanese ambience to such wonderful food! and PLEASE bring back the Habanero Stud!!!!! ;)
