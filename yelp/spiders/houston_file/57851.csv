Kata Robata////We went in happy hour which we were able to get the longhorn roll and spider roll for half price. We also got spicy salmon roll, vegan gyoza, fried brussel sprouts, fresh catch ceviche, and miso lobster mac n cheese. I really liked all of the items we ordered, miso lobster mac n cheese as my favorite one, longhorn roll was so delicious as well as the fresh catch ceviche and vegan gyoza.
