Uchi////I think if I had to pick my top restaurant in Houston right now, this would be it. This restaurant is just unbelievably good. The hamachi nabe is one of the best things I've ever tasted, the service is top notch, it can be a bit pricy but not too bad considering how nice it is. I'll probably right more later but for now I'll leave it at that. You need to try this place.
