JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Our waitress, Zoey, was a sweetheart and very personable. For appetizer, we ordered the Takoyaki (the brussels sprouts' reviews weren't as impressive), which turned out pretty good. 6pcs of steaming hot fried octopus balls smothered in Japanese mayo, tonkatsu sauce, bonito flakes, and...hard-boiled eggs? Weird, but it upped the creaminess factor and we loved it. Unfortunately, my usual plan of picking out a dish and forcing my fianc√© to order a different dish (because options!) didn't work...womp womp. He wanted the Tonkatsu Black as bad as I did, so we both went with it. And when it arrived, I just wasn't impressed. The broth had a nice spiciness to it and the pork chasu was tender, but the egg seasoning was seriously lacking, the broth was really salty, and it was THICK. Sipping up the soup was more like trying to slurp up oily mud... it was a huge turn-off. It fills you up really fast, too: I barely scratched the surface of my bowl before feeling completely bloated.
