The Pit Room////My second favorite bbq place after Truth. This is more expensive, but you get good size portions. They have crazy-priced beef ribs, which were just ok, not bad but not worth the astronomical price imo. Staff isn't as outgoing and helpful as other places, which would be nice, I had a few questions, but alas no one seemed interested in explaining. Mac and cheese was great, brisket good, meat isn't as high caliber, had excessive black char, and more fat, which some people like but I don't, so just didn't enjoy it as much as Truth...but we come here when in the area.
