JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The first time I came with my sister and I ordered the cha cha cha.. it was a no no no! It had such a pork flavor that I couldn't taste anything else. I was so disappointed and wanted to get something else, but I thought it was just me at first, but then my sister tried and said she agreed with me and I tried her tonkotsu black and it was much better. I won't be ordering this one again.
