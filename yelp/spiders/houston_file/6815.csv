JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We ordered a spicy minced pork noodles with extra chicken and the jinya tonkotsu bowl. both were flavorful Â on the oiler side, and i refused to pay the extra $3 for the corn and bamboo i wanted, so i was missing that in the texture. some bowls come with thick noodles, my tonkotsu bowl and others come with thin.
