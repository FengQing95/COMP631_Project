Kata Robata////Three of us ordered the Amberjack and Foie Gras appetizer. It was *amazing*. I really loved it! It was unctuous without being overhwhelmingly heavy and the bite just transcended the individual ingredients. I cannot tell you what I loved so much about it, but I definitely got a food high.
