Uchi////Visited last night for some amberjack and got blown away by pork joel, salmon belly, and the last pieces of barracuda Â ( which my friend dropped his piece on the floor but it was so good we insisted that he eat it any way ). Chef Paul (with the mustache) has the best attitude, and if you're just free ballin it, he has the best recommendations, sit in his section to see some of the best fish cutting skills in the world.
