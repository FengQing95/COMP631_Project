Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I have nothing but good things to say about this place! I have been waiting so long to finally try this restaurant out and I am so glad I finally have! It's true... the wait can be long but I promise it is SO worth it!! Their menu is vast and to be honest it is so so hard to make a decision bc everything sounds so good! I'm a sucker for eggs benedict so this is basically my go to dish. They have a good selection and a variety of different eggs benedict. I've tried about 4 dishes and every single one is so delicious, there's no way I could chose a best. I've had the classic ham benedict, chilaquiles, early harvest bunny, and Bella Bella bunny. All of them are amazing! I would highly recommend those. I've also had the pleasure of enjoying a cinnamon roll pancake and it actually WOW'D me! It's basically a fluffy-sweet-delectable concoction of pure glee (my mouth is watering as I type this). Go on now give them a try!
