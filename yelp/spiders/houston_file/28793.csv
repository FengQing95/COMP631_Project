The Pit Room////It was my first time here from the reviews it sounded like they were going to blow all the other bbq places I tried out the water but not what I expected the lean brisket was so dry and bland the charro beans were so spicy I couldn't enjoy them the jalape√±o sausage was ok and I think the best part was the potato salad and cucumber fixings for what I payed for I don't think I got my money's worth
