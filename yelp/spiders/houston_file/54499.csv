Kata Robata////The Spider Roll -- do you like soft-shell crab? I do. I loved this roll. Oddly enough it was not wrapped very tightly and the crab was seemingly trying to zombie-reanimate, get up, and walk out the front door. But I put a stop to that. Oh. How I put a stop to that with my stomach. Unfortunately the super-over-eager staff snatched the tray up from the table the second the last piece had been lifted so my wasabi disappeared before I got all of it into my little tray. Good service != before its time.
