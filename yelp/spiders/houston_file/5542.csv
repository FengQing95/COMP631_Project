JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'd still like to return to try their Umami Spicy Miso (that mother-effer looks MEANNN!) and other tapas, but for now, my fianc√© and I agree that Tiger Den's Garlic Black Bean reigns supreme over JINYA's Tonkatsu Black. Not terrible ramen for ITL, just not exactly the standard I was holding it to.
