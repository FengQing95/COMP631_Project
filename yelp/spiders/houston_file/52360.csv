Kata Robata////Underwhelmed.  Went with a friend today at lunch (June 23 2010), "Dung10" was our server.  The salad and miso dressing was tasty, as was a snack of edamame, standard Japanese restaurant fare.  The restaurant seemed to be out of fish.  Dung told us they did not have any escolar, but he did say they had toro.  Dung came back and said they did not have toro - he apologized.  So we ordered a plate of Japanese "snapper" sashimi (~$13), sauce was very lemony - mediocre at best.  I always associate citris on top of sashimi as a way to mask less than fresh fish - but I could be wrong on this.  It was too lemony for me.  Second plate of sashimi was "tuna" - again with a lemony / oil sauce, each paper thin slice topped with an equally thin slice of jalepeno pepper.  Again, mediocre at best.  Next we ordered the lunch sushi special, and the handroll and the rolled sushi pieces were tasty.  Underwhelmed by the tuna, shrimp and freshwater eel sushi pieces.  Also ordered a roll - don't remember the name - but the roll was tasty.  Finished it up with another "variety" plate of sashimi suggested by Dung, and it wasn't bad.  the tuna was smooth and buttery, as was the yellowtail.  The third sashimi fish was less than tasty - cannot recall which fish it was.
