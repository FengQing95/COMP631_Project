Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze, the location from heaven. Went there to celebrate my birthday with 3 other friends. One of the best locations, but the food at the other 2 I visited was also good. I forgot the name of the drink the Manager Indya recommended, but it was delish... She came to check on us to make sure our experience was enjoyable and it was just that.... The Sweet Potato Pancakes was OMG delicious..... Top of the line service...
