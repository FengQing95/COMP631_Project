Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////New Review March 15 - brought my kids with me today. As we are checking out, my daughter notices the beautiful challah bread along the back wall. She says Mom look at that challah but she pronounces with a "ch" like church. I correct her and the man behind the counter says oh you have to try it! And have us a free loaf! It totally made my daughter's day. Also it was delicious! They kept tearing pieces off in the car. That's how you make a great impression. I always come here but my daughter will always remember that.
