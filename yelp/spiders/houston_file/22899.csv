Uchi////I think the Machi Cure is probably the most popular item, as this dish also exists at the location in Austin, and the chefs were recommending this to everybody. I also ordered the Uchiviche, in which you can really taste how fresh the fish they serve is, and also the Ham & Eggs - pork katsu with creamed egg in a sushi roll. PHENOMENAL.
