JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////A bowl can get pretty pricey here, though, especially because I absolutely NEED so many additional toppings (how can you say no?), but I'm willing to keep coming back for more. The price is why I'm only giving a 4 and not a 5 - although if there were a 4.5 that'd be more where I land.
