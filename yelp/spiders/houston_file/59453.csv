Baby Barnaby's////Let me just say: locals DO NOT eat here. I live in the neighborhood and none of us eat here. Generally, these kids waiting in line come to get a ticket to a hipster experience and leave pretending it was super cool. Waiting in line for subpar brunch and, what seems to be, a growing hipster customer service mindset consisting of eye rolls and short, unenthused answers- isn't cool. It's sad and unsettling people have accepted this as standard. If you want legit breakfast with friendly service, you'll find the locals at Harry's or the taco truck next to Inversion. Those stars are because my eggs weren't served cold. And that's always a good thing.
