Uchi////I'm never disappointed with the food and service. Everything is beyond spectacular! The server recommendations are always excellent. The fried milk dessert is always the best way to end the meal here. My favorite dishes would probably have to be the edamame, brussel sprouts, hamachili, kinoke nabe and shag roll.
