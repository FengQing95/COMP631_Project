JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I am from California and am Japanese.  I must say that this place was pretty darn tasty.  We went here for sushi and Ramen.  Sushi was good, but Ramen was tasty.  I am not sure how prices are in Texas, but it was on par with California prices.  I would go again when I am in town.
