Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is a small but busy brunch favorite in Houston. I waited with my friend for 15-20 minutes on a Monday during lunch time. There was not a lot of room to wait since it was raining and most of their additional seating was outside. However, our server was very sweet and helpful. There were lots of choices and I decided to order the Shrimp and Grits. It was very delicious and a little bit spicy! Definitely in my top 5. I would absolutely come back next time I visit Houston!
