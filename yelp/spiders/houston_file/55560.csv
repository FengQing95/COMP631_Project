Kata Robata////Now on to the mouth watering oh so delectable foie gras over scallop nigiri! OMG! It comes 2 to an order and I sometimes could do 4 pieces by myself. It's definitely the first thing I order after I have finished my cocktail. Another thing that I always order first is the uni or foie gras Chawunmushi (sp?), it's like this yummy egg custard with your choice of uni or foie gras. It takes awhile to cook so order it first.
