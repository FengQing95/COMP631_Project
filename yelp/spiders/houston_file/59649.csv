Baby Barnaby's////There is a very friendly atmosphere all the time; the locals go nuts for this spot and the waiters seem to know the regulars on a first name basis. I try to come here during the weekdays as much as I can because there are too many people here on the weekends and their limited seating inside doesn't help the situation.
