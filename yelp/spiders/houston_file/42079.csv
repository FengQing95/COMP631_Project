Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love this place. The space is beautiful. There's also outdoor seating. Whenever I meet up with someone, this is one of the first suggestions that come to mind. I'm a fan of their almond croissants and chocolate chip cookies. In fact I don't think I've had anything I never liked here. This IS the place to get your sugar fix.
