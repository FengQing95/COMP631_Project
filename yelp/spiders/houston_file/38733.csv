Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Checked this place out for brunch Sunday which wasn't too crazily busy. I didn't know what to expect but I was surprised at how loud the restaurant was for the morning. I am not a fan of the loud music and the darker lighting (or at least where our table was). Because where we sat at as well (in the corner), it took a while for any one to come to our table for orders.
