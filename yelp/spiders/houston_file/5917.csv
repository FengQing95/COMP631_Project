JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had the tonkatsu black ramen and my friend ordered the spicy tonkatsu ramen. The black ramen came with thin noodles which were awesome. My friend did not like her thick noodles as much but still enjoyed the broth. I usually save the egg for last because it's my favorite part of the ramen, but to my dismay, this particular egg was very anti-climactic. :(
