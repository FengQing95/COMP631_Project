Kata Robata////The food here was wonderful but our waiter claimed he brought us a dish, but he had not.  He brought us a free replacement but continued to argue that he really had brought to us.  Except for this error and stubbornness on his part, the service was decent.  Not sure if we wii retourn or not.
