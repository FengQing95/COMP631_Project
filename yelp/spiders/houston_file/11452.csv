JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is a favorite of mine for ramen, but be warned that the wait times can be over 30 minutes on a popular night. The atmosphere is very laid-back and charming. I always get the spicy chicken ramen when I come here (spice level spicy, then I add more hot sauce accordingly). Interestingly enough, I don't care for the actual chicken in the bowl, as it can be a little bland alongside the broth, but the broth itself is very flavorful and seasoned well. There is also not an overwhelming amount of salt, which I am happy about. Overall, nice atmosphere, good food, decent price.
