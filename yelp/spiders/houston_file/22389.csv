Uchi////HAPPY HOUR (aka Sake Social).  That's about the best tip I can give anyone who's contemplating giving this hip place a try.  If you're coming here with a small party, there shouldn't be a problem grabbing a seat at the bar.  Other than that the tables do seem a bit crowded so plan accordingly!
