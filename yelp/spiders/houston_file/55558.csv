Kata Robata////The decor is beautiful, very Japanese with your usual bamboo accents here and there. Upon entrance, you are greeted by the smiling hostesses. Right behind them is a small bar. My only complaint is the bar area is a little small, maybe about 7-8 bar stools. Since I like going alone, the bar is my go to spot. The bartenders are really friendly and are great at crafting delicious libations. Some of my favorite drinks would be the spicy Pimm's cup, basically a Pimm's liquer with a kick. Another favorite is the Apple Blossum, or something like that. I love the big round ice and the orchid garnish! Lovely! If you get a chance to sit at the bar, you will most likely see Dale. He is the best! I will have a cocktail or 2 then move on to some wine. They do have a huge selection of wine and Japanese liquor and sake as well. Oh yea, if you dine at the table, ask for Thai, he is an awesome server as well. He's very knowledgeable of the menu, very friendly and he can almost suggests anything to your liking.
