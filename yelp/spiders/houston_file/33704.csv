Local Foods////Besides the sandwiches themselves, I absolutely love their side dishes. When you order a sandwich, it comes with two sides (or a cup of soup), so I typically indulge in the quinoa (black quinoa, cauliflower, lentils, tomato, basil, and sometimes pomegranate seeds) and the cabbage slaw (cabbage, edamame, tofu, miso vinagrette...yum).  Sometimes though, I opt for the tuscan kale (small strips of kale, golden raisins, pinenuts, and parmesan cheese) or the housemade chips instead.  Really though, I don't think you can go wrong.
