Local Foods////Came here for the first time today for lunch and was excited to here it's a branch of Benjy's. Unfortunately the raved about crunchy chicken and crab n shrimp sandwiches were underwhelming. The crab n shrimp was pretty flavorless and the crunchy chicken was like something I could have put together from last night's leftover rotisserie chicken from Kroger's and stale chips. The posole soup and the kale salad was the highlight of the meal. Probably won't be coming back anytime soon.
