Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I can't express how much I LOVE this place. From the food to the vibe, to the atmosphere and the fact that they play bomb ass music for brunch!! Classic!! I usually request Terry when I come in, he does an excellent job at taking care of us and making sure that service is top notch. This place is a hidden gem and I'm crossing my fingers it stays that way and doesn't get ruined as much of my favorite brunch spots have. Don't get stuck on menu selections thou, they are constantly trying new things and replacing items. They keep it exciting!
