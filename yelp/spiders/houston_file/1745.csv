JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love this ramen place!  We went on a Saturday evening around 7 PM and didn't have to wait to be seated, which was fantastic.  Wait staff was very attentive and knowledgable.  Absolutely scrumptious food!  I ordered the Jinya chicken ramen with seasoned egg, which was fantastic!  The cocktails looked a little odd, so I just stuck to wine which was good, but not amazing.  The modern decor and clean lines, as well as a welcome shouted from the back every time someone is seated creates a fun vibe, perfect for young professionals who want to grab dinner before heading out to Midtown for nightlife.
