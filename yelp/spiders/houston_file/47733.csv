Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I have been to the snooze on 99 In cinco ranch for my birthday and really enjoyed it. Great food, vibes and people, it was only natural that I would choose snooze again to host my monthly Houston lash artist meet up, this time I chose Montrose location because it's the middle spot for Houston basically. It was very packed and I liked that, meaning it had to be good. I waited for most of party to arrive before asking to get seated we were already (4) and I had told the hostess 5 Incase the last person was able to make it, while waiting to get seated the hostess came over and told us our 5 person was here just went back to the car. She never showed up, We got seated and out waiter seemed bothered by taking our orders, I asked for a macchiato and he quickly responded, "this isn't Starbucks, we don't have macchiatos here" ... well ok then... we place our order and he's still acting bothered by us! We get our food pancakes and potatoes.. the food was good. As we are enjoying our meal and almost over with meeting and our food.. the manager comes over and tells us " you can't get seated until your whole party arrives, next time you won't get seated until everyone is present" umm.. that seemed kind of rude, considering she saw we were almost done eating, obviously the last person didn't show up. We were only there for 45 minutes, normal I supposed not long enough for the manager to come and say something unesassary making it seem we were hogging the table, and our waiter just stopped checking on us all together. Really unprofessional from their part. Needles to say I definitely won't be going back. I'm still trying to figure out why there were so packed, the food is good not great, and the service is horrible. It's good it you have a small party but embarrassing to host any kind of meeting there.
