I can't compare to other versions but this is a great sandwich, from the ingredients to the awesome bread. I had two sides - kale salad (with pignolis, raisins and parmesan, lightly dressed) and 4 bean salad (edamame, kidney bean, green bean, garbanzo, with a curry dressing). The kale was excellent, the 4-bean very good but not special.
