The Pit Room////We went to the Pit Room on a Saturday afternoon around 2. There was still a decent crowd lined up. After much debate we ordered just about everything because it was too hard to choose... a brisket taco, a chicken taco, one beef rib, brisket and jalape√±o sausage and not to leave out the sides of mac and cheese, beans and grilled okra. I don't know the grilled okra is always on their menu but let me tell you, it should be! Holy smokes it was so delicious. The beans were flavorful and I heard the mac and cheese was great as well. The BBQ sauce is tangy and flavorful and the habanero mustard is incredibly spicy but if you can handle heat, you won't be able to stop eating it.
