Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The blueberry danish pancake was to die for. I cannot express this enough. The restaurant was bustling which is always a good sign. The service I received was sub par, but I attribute this to how busy they were. My food came out not how I ordered it and I wasn't checked on after it was dropped off. When the check came I was able to point out the discrepancies and to my surprise instead of the plate just being removed the manager comped my whole check which was unexpected and unnecessary. However it showed to me how much she cared about the customer service standards. I will be going back when I visit Houston again.
