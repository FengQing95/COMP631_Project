Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So, Common Bond has been go-to bakery/ restaurant since before the pandemic and now I appreciate this eatery even more. The food is just goooood! And the outdoor patio is perfect in the evenings. The food is consistently delicious. The service is always delightful and helpful. This sandwich is Memphis hot Chicken....one of the last entrees I've sampled. Oh my goodness! Come Try it!
