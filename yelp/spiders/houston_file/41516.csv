Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love egg salad sandwiches, but what you get is homemade rye bread (awesome, per comment above) with a bland "typical" egg salad on one half and a just-barely poached egg on the other.  The bread is sliced "Texas Style" (see comment above about serving size).  What you have is a sandwich that can't be eaten without being an absolute mess.  I don't know about you, but I don't like wearing my sandwich.
