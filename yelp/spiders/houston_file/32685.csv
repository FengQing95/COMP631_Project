Local Foods////Menu is great. Not an overwhelming novel for food. Just one page, decent picks with enough variety. I got the chicken crunch and cilantro soup and my wife got a vietnamese sandwich with kale and pasta sides. Both of our meals were awesome. The chicken crunch had a lot of flavor, great tasting in-house made bread. The soup was vibrant and citrus'y. My wife's sandwich was slammed with all kinds of good vietnamese flavors. Her kale side was that great, but the couscous style side was decent. Not a foody by no means, but food definitely worth the visit
