The Pit Room////My second visit several days later was on a weekday for lunch. This time I parked in their back parking lot. For a small restaurant, it does have decent parking space with some additional parking available across the street. This time I ordered a brisket sandwich ($8.75) and a side of cole slaw with a soft drink. With tax my bill was $15.70. Again fairly expensive. The sandwich was very good. I like the buttered bun and the brisket had some nice bark on it and I enjoyed the taste (4). The cole slaw was a vinegar based version with a lot of black pepper that I also enjoyed (3.5) even though I personally prefer more of a mayo based cole slaw.
