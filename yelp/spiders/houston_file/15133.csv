JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen and it was great. Highly recommend even if you're an omnivore! Vegetarian broth isn't usually unique, but this one was awesome. It was spicy and garlicky! The tofu was unlike anything I've had before: it had a jello-like consistency. If you don't think you'd like that, ask for it to be prepared differently! The spinach and sesame seeds were a really good addition the the noodles. If anything, I probably would've added Brussels sprouts in the Ramen because it would've tasted so good!
