Kata Robata////First of all, the restaurant was NOT busy at all. We came around 3 ish and the fact that we made a reservation hours ahead already and they still make us wait for a good 10 minutes. There were EMPTY TABLES all around the restaurant. The two Asian and tall with long hair girl was so so rude because the next thing happened was that one of the host FINALLY took us to our UNRESERVED table and THAT table was not EVEN THE ONE THEY WERE CLEANING! So we stood around 10 minutes for no reason. We were seated somewhere else instead of that table that was being cleaned off.
