Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I came here with my sister on a Saturday night for dinner a little after 9pm. The place was packed but we were able to be seated right away. First off, Cheers to "The Good Life", that's my new fav favorite drink. That was the first thing we ordered and we both loved it. We had the chicken flatbread which was good. For our main course I ordered the 12hr braised short rib and a side of mac and cheese, the ribs were excellent as I expected it to be, the Mac and cheese was just ok. nothing special about it. My sister ordered the Cajun crab pasta which she liked, I thought it was ok ,after tasting it it wouldn't Â be something I would order for myself. We had the fried apple pie and ice cream for dessert, it tasted good however I found it to be too heavy handed with the sugar sprinkled on the pie, it was a little too sweet. Overall we had a good experience. I'll be back again for drinks.
