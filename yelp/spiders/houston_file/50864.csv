Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////other petty faux pas, the knives need sharpening.  i wasn't even able to cut through my slice of tomato (not joking).  when you plate the eggs, please try to get them closer to the center of the plate.  as the waiter brought it to me it almost slid off onto the table.  the hollandaise was dripping off the edge, i shouldn't have to clean up before i start eating.
