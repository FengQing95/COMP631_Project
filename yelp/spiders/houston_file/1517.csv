JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went here for a few drinks and appetizers. The jenya bun was really good and so was the shrimp balls. I ordered a Long Island and it was really good too. Bartender was awesome to talk to! I wish I could have had more time to really taste the menu. But overall nice calming area and not too loud.
