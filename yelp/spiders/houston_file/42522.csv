Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I hate the layout of the seating in Common Bond.  If I didn't know better, I would say it is designed to elicit maximum discomfort in the shop's patrons.  The de rigeur common table,  narrow spaces (this is Texas, not some northeastern city), uncomfortable stools.  It's awful. I hate coming here, despite what I write below.
