Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////But other than those nuances, the food was amazing. I'm ordered the fruity pebble's French toast which was sweet and had pieces of bacon. So it was sweet and salty at the same time. There was also fresh fruit on the plate as well. My friends had ordered a short rib dish that was also amazing (I can't remember the name). My really good friend ordered the "breakfast in bed" shot which was surprisingly good! I really like this place for brunch, I will need to come back and try their happy hour and/or dinner.
