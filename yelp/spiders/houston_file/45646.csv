Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Hands down the best experience I have had at any restaurant in the Houston area.  The customer service experience just really enhanced my overall dining experience. Ms. Tamara Pagan and her team really went above and beyond to make sure that my family had the best possible experience.  There's not much I can say about the pastries other than that they are super delicious.  I really recommend the Pistachio croissant, plain croissant, nutella croissant, and their famous Kouign Amann! Simply delicious!  You just cant go wrong with any pastry choice.  They also offer a  very impressive menu that includes brunch, lunch and dinner. On this occasion we arrived for dinner and had the common bond burger, steak & frittes, parmesean fries and crusted salmon.  All plates were equally impressive. They were flavorful, fresh, and simply delicious. My favorite dish definitely was the salmon.  The salmon was not overcooked and paired well with the sauce and vegetables. The steak and frittes were so flavorful and the fries that accompanied the plate were delicious.  The common bond burger was juicy and served on a soft bun.  I was impressed with all the dishes because I thought this place specialized in pastries but as it turns out, kitchen items are just as good.  I cant wait to come back and try the brunch menu!
