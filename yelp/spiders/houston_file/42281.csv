Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The other nit - service. The people who brought our drinks and food were awesome, kept out of the way all fancy-style, and quick and all that. But watching the employees behind the bars dick around and use four pairs of hands to make one iced latte (which took almost fifteen minutes) is not a good thing. I feel like there are too many hands in the soup here, and it may even have kinda watered down the quality of the food. I just think we left Common Bond wanting something a little less common, bonding experiences notwithstanding.
