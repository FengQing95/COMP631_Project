Uchi////The most amazing-delicious sushi...maybe restaurant experience overall! From the moment you pull up and valet parking is complimentary, you know you have made a great choice. The wait time was about 30 minutes but we sat outside until our table was ready. The waiter was so helpful and educated about the menu and chef specials! The sushi was fresh and the flavors were amazing! If I am ever in the Houston area I am sure I will venture to Uchi!
