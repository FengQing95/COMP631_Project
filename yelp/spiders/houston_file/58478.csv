Baby Barnaby's////Food: The food was absolutely delicious! I ordered the breakfast plate and everything on the plate good. The biscuit was crispy yet fluffy with a hint of sweetness. Both types of sausages were succulent but a tad on the greasy side (which probably made it taste better :O). The scrambled eggs were well made and the side of potatoes were cubes of goodness. Potatoes are a MUST on every plate and they give you a lot so maybe split it with a companion. The blueberry pancake was a very good size and average taste-wise. The blueberries must have been fresh because the juices squirt out onto the devourer's shirt!. The chicken fried steak was nice and tender with the gravy being a good flavor. It came with potatoes! Go figure! The rib eye steak was on the salty side but had a wonderful texture and if it were a little less salty, I'd be raving about it more! The green eggs were one of my favorite items! Everything was right about this dish! The eggs had a perfect texture with the right viscosity overflowing in flavor that you would never think scrambled eggs or any variation of it would have. I didn't try the corn hash beef but those in my party were meh about it. They also have pretty good fresh squeezed OJ and pretty standard coffee.
