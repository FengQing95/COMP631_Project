Uchi////Absolutely delicious! All things considered, I believe that this restaurant offers the best sushi in Houston. Very expensive if you want to leave on a full belly. Great place to take your girlfriends to eat, or for a date, so long as your man is content with lots of mini-courses of "small bites". The portions are not huge but definitely fair considering the price and quality. I really enjoyed my visit last month, it was a treat. We tried to get around the menu by sampling one of their "cold dishes" (I was recommended by a chef I know to not waste my money on the "hot dishes" because the raw was best for your $$), something off the daily specials menu, the well-known brussels sprouts, as well as some red snapper sushi, a tuna roll and of course, dessert. The lime ash sorbet will blow your mind, and all the others looked so good, we were tempted to order more than one! Also enjoyed a nice bottle of sake. Service is a little strange here, not much talking with the server aside from ordering, and didn't see him much except when the food was delivered. However, I can't say that we were neglected, or wanted for anything.
