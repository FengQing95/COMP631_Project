Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The baked goods look and taste fresh. They are definitely an upgrade over a place like Panera Bread. The French macarons are tempting, but I have not tried them. Like I said, I come here for the brunch. My favorite dish: the one with the grits. Beef and grits, shrimp and grits. Both are tasty in their own right. One with tender, flavorful braised beef. The other has perfectly cooked shrimp. You really can't go wrong either way.
