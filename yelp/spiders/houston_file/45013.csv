Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The pistachio croissant was amazing as always, but both of our actual dishes were bummers. The quiche didn't seem to have the right consistency and the side salad was completely overdressed. The tamales had a tough/strange filling and the side sauce was oddly tangy. Everything was still good enough of course, but not at the level of excellence that we had come to expect from this place.
