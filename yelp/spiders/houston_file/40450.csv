Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We all ordered at the same time, myself included, but I didn't get my food unfortunately. All my friends got their food and were almost done by the time I got mine. Either my server forgot to place my order or the kitchen messed up. Nonetheless, it didn't matter. My server ended up coming out with a free beer and the manager came with my food and let me know it was comped due to the situation. I do appreciate the effort in the end because it affected my entire experience.
