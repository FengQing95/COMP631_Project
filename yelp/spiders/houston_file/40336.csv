Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We also ordered fried oysters, the pork belly poutine fries, a salad with salmon and the server (who was wonderful) highly highly recommended I get the brick chicken. Â The brick chicken was disappointing. It just tasted like any other pan fried chicken and didn't have anything special going on. I would not recommend this dish. The greens were incredibly salty and the whole dish was just lacking flavor.
