Kata Robata////Made reservations for a birthday dinner on a Saturday night a few weeks prior for 6 people and for what we ordered, it was pricey! Kata provides outstanding service and the quality of the fish is exceptional. We brought cake in and they were nice enough to bring it out and give us plates and forks to celebrate.
