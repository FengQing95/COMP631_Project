Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The wait is pretty long but you know there are things to do while you wait or just some good old fashion patience. The french toast flight was excellent. I didn't really like my egg dish which is probably just because I'm not a big fan of scrambled eggs. The whole business is just great though... the menus... the set up... the colors... the flow... the attentiveness from the wait staff and their knowledge of dishes. It was a pretty cool. I could actually go for some french toast right now. I believe we had the banana bread french toast.... OOOhhh nomnomnom
