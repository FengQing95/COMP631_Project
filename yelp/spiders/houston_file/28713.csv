The Pit Room////From food to service, our visit was ideal. My in-laws were visiting from NY so they wanted some good Texas BBQ. It was our first time here and boy did this place deliver! We ordered the Feast No. 1, a brisket sandwich, a pulled pork sandwich and their frito pie. My favorite meat was the brisket and the jalape√±o cheese sausage. Their mac-n-cheese, baked beans and elote were to die for. I wasn't too fond of the potato salad and that's one of my favorite sides. The only suggestion I would have, is that they make their side servings for the feast a bit bigger, especially since they're being shared by 4-6 people. Overall we had a great experience! What topped off our lunch was a mini tour of the BBQ pits, my father-in-law was beyond impressed. We will definitely be returning and recommending everyone we know.
