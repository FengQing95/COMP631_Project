Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went to Bosscat. They have a great selection of seasonal draft beers. And over 300+ whiskeys to choose from. The bartender took time to explain a few different whiskeys to me during a busy weekend and we found the perfect drink for me. Dan really is great and personable. Comfortable COVID protocols and a definite must go!!
