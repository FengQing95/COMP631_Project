Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Service was good, food was just ok. I had the HRW menu. The tuna appetizer was delicious.  The short rib hash was weirdly sweet and too saucy. Not good. The peach "cobbler" lacked sugar and had no real crust -just a dry crumble on top.  I tried the signature Bosscat drink. It was ok, but overpriced at $14.  The concept of this place is cool, but execution is lacking as far as the food is concerned.
