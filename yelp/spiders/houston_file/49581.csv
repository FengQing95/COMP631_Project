Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came here on a Friday at about 11 am and there was a 30 minute wait. Luckily we got a spot right in front and just waited in our car. They text you when your table is ready. We loved this place because they had gluten free pancakes and French toast! It is so hard to find gluten free French toast! I ordered the short beef hash. It was really good. My boyfriend had eggs Benedict and they were able to also make that gluten free! We were so surprised and happy they were so accommodating in terms of gluten. I also had the spicy Bloody Mary and it was very good. This is definitely a great brunch spot!
