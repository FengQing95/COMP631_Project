Baby Barnaby's////The only thing I didn't like was the wait time, this place is really packed but let me tell you why, the breakfast here is so damn good! The buffalo I had here I couldn't believe how delicious it was I never had buffalo meat before my pancakes were huge and thank as crisp on the side how I like it! The service was good the waitress was very good to me and my boyfriend always made sure we had everything, I recommend this place!!
