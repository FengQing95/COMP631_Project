Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Virtually impossible to get in without waiting for an hour, which renders it useless. Plus, the added bonus of the "parking lot nazi" coming after you to tell you where you can/can't park...so very nice in his attitude..no thank you. Â By the time I park, get in, get in line, and figure out it's another 45 minutes until I can even rationally believe I will get seated, it's just not worth even trying to get in here any more.
