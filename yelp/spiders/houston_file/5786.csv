JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Incredible... nice restaurant, nice waiters, very fast service (on a Saturday at lunch) plus a ton of options!!! I had the spicy vegan ramen (I got it mild- and I would suggest asking for extra garlic) and it was incredible... some of my favorite food that I've ever had. Please open a location up near The Woodlands!!!
