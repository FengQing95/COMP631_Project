Local Foods////Greatest vegan quinoa burger ever. I absolutely love this place & would recommend everyone to give it a try! The managers were having a little fun at my expense. I went to the restroom before my guest arrived and they made some joke assuming I just came to just use the restroom. I'm just sorry I didn't confront him. I would have loved to put the hipster d bag in his place but in reality he's the loser working on Saturday July fourth weekend.
