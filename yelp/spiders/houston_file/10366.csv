JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Another thing I liked about JINYA is their extra noodles. I saved enough broth such that when I poured in the extra noodles, it was essentially a second bowl for only $1.50 more! Even though my Tonkotsu Black came with thin noodles, my extra noodles were thick (which I assume was a mistake). Though I didn't mind since it allowed me to try both types of noodles. I would say the thin noodles are better.
