Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If I could only pick one restaurant in Houston I could eat at for the rest of my life, it may very well be this amazing haven of sweets and savories. As a bakery, their baked goods are without a doubt the freshest and most delicious. I'll make the drive every day from sugar land to get my hands on those perfectly baked pistachio croissants. The Kouign Amann is a flakey ball of buttery dreams. And their cookies - omg buy them all especially if they're fresh out of the oven. I want to try everything else but those three things take my heart (stomach) every time.
