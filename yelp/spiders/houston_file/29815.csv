The Pit Room////This place is solid; really awesome BBQ and while the lines might look scary at times, they do move fast and tables open up very quickly. We got the two meat plates x 2, both come with two sides and you can substitute chips for one of the sides with no extra charge. FYI the beef rib can't be selected as part of the meal plates, not surprisingly.
