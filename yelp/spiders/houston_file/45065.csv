Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We had a great experience last night at Â Common Bond cafe and Bakery. We started with a Texas Club sandwich (shared with wife) and tea. Something you would thInk would be so simple, was so good. The turkey was very tasty, the bread was fresh and it was a great prop portion size to share. We then shared 3 pastries with another couple. We had the almond croissant which had cherry undertones and was delicious, strawberry chocolate was very tasty and the caramel chocolate cream pastry with lattes - which blow away everything in a coffee rich option area of town. The atmosphere here is perfect for meeting up with friends and the staff were very helpful and nice.
