Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great food! A little bit of a long wait, but it was absolutely worth it. I had the frittata and a boss hog Bloody Mary. The frittata is excellent and the bloody was really great as well. I particularly appreciated the amount of veggies that came with the frittata, it made for a great meal. I will definitely go back. Get there early to avoid a long wait!
