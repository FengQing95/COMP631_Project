Local Foods////Gotta say, was not disappointed when all three assumptions came true. We collectively ordered truffle egg sandwich on a pretzel bun and two sides of quinoa and kale. Believe me, non salted, crunchy pretzel bun filled with velvety truffled eggs were to die for. I mean, who'd have thunk it to add pretzel buns to these things( thanks Wendy's!). The quinoa was not the best but neither was it off putting. Kale was delish! My friend ordered the watermelon mush soup as her side which turned out to have such a fresh, springy flavor to it that we almost regretted not getting the same thing. Its not your run-on-the-mill soup but if you want to try something different to spruce up your Friday evening, you would want to give this odd looking mush a second glance.
