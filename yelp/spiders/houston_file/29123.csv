The Pit Room////Went there tonight for my dad's birthday. We were happy with the food quality overall. The brisket is really tasty and I highly recommend it. However, we were really disappointed when my dad found a long hair in his potato salad. It wasn't like a hair that might've fallen on top. It was a long curly hair that was buried deep in his potato salad. Thankfully he didn't get the hair in his mouth but it was quite off putting overall.
