Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Food is pretty good in terms of taste. But boy it this place pricy - I'm fully aware this place is in river oaks and the price reflects the location. But...my fianc√© and I got an appetizer, split a burger, got two drinks between both of us, and walked out paying 33$ each. The service was also "OK", for the price it could have been better.
