Local Foods////I love you Yelpers whose ravings about Local Foods helped me talk a group of friends to meet there. Everyone loved the food and relaxed style service. The place has some charm and it spacious, but it gets pretty crowded. I had the famous crispy chicken sandwich, which is as tasty as everyone says with the tender and crunchy filling (no, it's not fried chicken) to the delicious pretzel roll. For sides I tried the kale salad (also very good) and house made chips (super good). I also liked that you pay for a drink and then could try the various choices at a help yourself station.
