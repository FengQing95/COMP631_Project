Local Foods////Got the beet salad and the house chips as my sides.  The beet salad is really nice, if you like beets, which I do, but I know they're not for everyone.  The chips were a total let down.  They were just SO greasy and SO lacking in enough salt and seasoning.  If I'm leaving fresh house made chips behind, there's a problem.
