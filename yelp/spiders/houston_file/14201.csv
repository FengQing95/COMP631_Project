JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Food was amazing this was my first time going, but mainly the customer service was 10/10 the bartender named Sho (Sorry if I spelled it wrong) but she was excellent helped with my first time experience explaining everything and gave me really good recommendations she was more than amazing, I'll definitely be coming back sooner than later
