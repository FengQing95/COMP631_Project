Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Always an ideal location for a casual breakfast. Of course folks are disappointed with the loooong wait. However, food is cooked to order and service can be improved (pending the person). Â Our server was fantastic. My reason for 4 stars is solely because the drinks lack alcohol. Our mimosas had more juice than champagne. We ordered champagne with juice on the side. The bloody Mary needed 2 more shots of vodka. The fide was filling and tasty.
