The Pit Room////I also got a soft drink.  The meat portions were extremely small, not that I would have wanted more based on the quality (or lack there of), the sides were okay size portions but inferior tasting.  The mac and cheese was nothing more than chunky elbow noodles with cheap melted cheese sauce ladled on top of it, no bread crumbs, no cooked in the oven, crisp, buttery taste.  The mustard potato salad tasted like grocery store potato salad that you would buy in bulk from a restaurant supplier.  The brisket was extremely fatty, and had zero taste.  The pulled pork had a weird taste, It didn't have much of any taste, but the taste it did have was weird, almost as if they used a cheap, inferior seasoning, the meat was liquidy, and not liquidy in a good, normal barbecue way, but rather a wet, lemony taste, perhaps almost like a liquid smoke.  The so called barbecue sauce was weird tasting.  And it does not appear as though any of this meat is cooked on site, no barbecue smell at all.  And $20.00 later.  Give me a small, ma & pa bbq shop any day, This place is too big for their britches.
