Kata Robata////Upon checking in with the hostess, we were seated immediately. When we got our menu, I noticed they had a list of featured dishes and one of them was an oxtail ramen! I cannot even begin to tell you how excited I was to see this. I grew up eating oxtail pho & love oxtail! I've never had oxtail ramen but could only imagine the yumminess & richness that is usually associated with oxtail broth. And I was NOT disappointed! The only disappointment was hearing that it was only a feature & would not be on their menu all the time. **Sad face x 3**
