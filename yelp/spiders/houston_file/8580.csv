JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Trying out this new place where our friend, Diego, works at and highly recommends it!  Thanks Diego for making us feel so VIP!  Who would have known that talking to Diego since he was sitting on the seat next to me yesterday from LAX to Houston would have brought us to this great restaurant!  Starting with the smiling hosts to our server Christina and of course the most personable and humble Diego Moreno that treated us like family!  For starters as a drink, the Japanese Slipper was so refreshing and made just right. Then the salmon sashimi was so fresh and tasty and then the chicken spicy ramen soup was just perfect... not too hot and not too bland... just right!  Definitely coming back and bringing friends along next time for a great meal and drinks... spreading the word...
