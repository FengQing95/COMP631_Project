Uchi////Scallop seasonal special 5/5 - Oh the games these dishes play. Seared scallop, asian pear, lemon foam atop a green tea brushed plate. It was one of the best-presented dishes I have ever seen. The lemon foam calls back to the old traditions of lemon juice on a scallop, and then the Uchi twist of the green tea and pear throw the whole thing for a loop. Dynamic stuff like this on the seasonal menu will keep me coming back bi-weekly.
