Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So we all finished up, finished up as in not clean plates but finished up as in we're done eating. We were in the middle of clearing everything and talking about the food when the fire alarm went off. I mean it went OFF!! Ear splitting would be an understatement. So the weird thing about this part of the story is no one moved, I mean all the employees and people eating just sat around. Looking at each other and I guess wondering what to do. Well we stood up and were out of there by the 4th ear splitting tone. Told our waitress to bring the check to the front and we would square up. Weird, I mean just weird there was no info or anyone taking charge, no manager saying it's ok or follow me out as we have to follow proper safety protocol.
