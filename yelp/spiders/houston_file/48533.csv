Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We ordered a few drinks and one sweet/one savory breakfast entree.  The drinks look like treasures on paper, but taste above average for a decent breakfast dig.  I'm particular about my hash browns and prefer breakfast potatoes, but these weren't stale or undercooked.  Crispy outside plus a hot inside works for me.
