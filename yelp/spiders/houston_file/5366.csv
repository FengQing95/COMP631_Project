JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Spicy miso ramen with thick noodle 11.95- add egg $1- wayyyyy too salty. Im a "water" person Â and if im eating a soup, i sip more of the broth than eat the noodle. I could not handle the sodium level n had to let it go. I felt the thick noodle was overcooked. Maybe thats how its suppose to taste but i like it a bit firmer.
