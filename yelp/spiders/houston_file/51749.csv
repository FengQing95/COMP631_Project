Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Being an eggs benny gal, I didn't even bother to look at the rest of the menu. They have a nice selection of about 7-8 eggs bennys. An added bonus is that you can mix and match if you want or just order one. I like places with customized choices like that. I ordered the avocado smash(and it was, a smash I mean) and added bacon. It comes with hash browns served in a neat cylindrical shape that's just, well, neat! I also ordered the Boss hog bloody mary made with bacon infused whiskey. It was just the hair of the dog I needed topped with an elaborate coliflor, pickle, olive garnish with a huge piece of bacon bobbing out of it. I felt guilty for a moment as my friend headed to the bathroom holding her stomach, but still managed to wolf and slurp everything down.
