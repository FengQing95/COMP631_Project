Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Best Cinnamon Toast Pancakes ever and not one establishment can duplicate it!!!  Can't stand the wait though...Snooze is one of those places you needed to visit every once in awhile or for special occasions.  In the time it takes to get a seat, I could look up the recipe for Snooze's Cinnamon Roll Pancakes, and make the pancakes myself...as a matter of fact, I just looked up a couple of them now, lol!  Looking forward to trying them...
