Uchi////* Be prepared to wait, even with a reservation. I was forgiving when they first opened, but they need to deal with this aspect of their service. We had an 8 pm reservation on a Wednesday and were not seated until 8:30. That can be the difference between enjoying your meal and falling into your soup.
