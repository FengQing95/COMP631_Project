Baby Barnaby's////The quaintness of a shack loses its appeal when it serves you attitude and wastes your time. It put a bad taste in my mouth by falsely advertising something that is the whole appeal to the place and ruining it with arbitrary restrictions. Not to mention the horrible customer service we received and of all days, on a day I'm celebrating my friends birthday.
