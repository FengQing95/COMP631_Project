Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common bond - your beautiful.  Local business done right - Clean, friendly staff, barrita that do coffee art, almond croissant that is airy and right amount of cream.   I cant give any higher compliment than to let you know that i was in houston for 3 days and went there twice for coffee and croissant.
