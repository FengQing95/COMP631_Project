Baby Barnaby's////Great salads! I get the Petaluma salad with grilled chicken and their honey-lime vinaigrette (it comes w/ a herbed ranch). Salad dressing may be my favorite part. :) I will buy extra when I run out, that's how much I love the dressing (marinate your chicken or shrimp for the grill in it, you will thank me). You can't beat their $10 bottles of house wine. It's a casual, seat yourself diner. I usually go after hot yoga class with my friend. We look like a mess, but it's ok and they don't judge. Service is usually pretty good too.
