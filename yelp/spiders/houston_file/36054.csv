Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This was our first time to this restaurant and it was by far our best brunch yet! We came with friends, all first timers, and Terry took such wonderful care of us. He was extremely helpful with menu recommendations, very friendly, and one of the best waiters we've had! Terry also gave us a tour of the whiskey room they have which is very impressive. The food was also amazing and the service was great as well. Will definitely be coming back!
