Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The line damn. The line. Can I repeat that...the LINE! But I love this place. The food is simple and perfect for the morning, especially the couple times I needed brunch for my hangover. The line allowed me to sign up and walk around the neighborhood for some photoshoots and exploring. The service is quick, cus the line is long, so it's not like top notch service, but good enough for what you go for.
