Local Foods////Picked up lunch from here on a warm Wednesday afternoon. The online ordering process was very seamless and straightforward. They're doing some construction right now but there's a dedicated pickup zone. They provide utensils upon request which I also found convenient. I got the Garden Sammie with chips and potato salad and my friend got the Avocado BLT. As someone who isn't vegetarian or vegan, I wasn't expecting too much from the Garden Sammie. However, it was absolutely delicious. The portion is very generous and I recommend getting it on the pretzel bun instead of the ciabatta. I think meat-eaters would equally enjoy it. The only downside for me, as a college student, is the price. Two sandwiches without drinks came out to $30 after taxes and tip. It's great if you have the budget, but it's more of an occasional splurge otherwise.
