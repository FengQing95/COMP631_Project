Uchi////The food was on point but the staff is subpar. My second visit was much better in terms of waitstaff. The first time I went I felt like my waitress was very judgmental and I do not think I received the same service I might have if I would have brought my Prada bag. She was very absent and short. And to top it off when my friend and I asked to split the check she notified us that Uchi doesn't allow split checks which is fine ; but this was not stated anywhere on the menu or on their website. The eyebrow raising part of all of this was the next time I went My table was able to split the check. This leads me to believe that my first waitress made that uchi policy up on the spot and that is very disheartening. I don't know why this happened but it left a very bad taste in my mouth
