Uchi////wagyu beef hot rock (3/5)- i was not a huge fan. The meat was very high quality. It looked very fresh and had intense marbling. They were pre-oiled Â and cut into bite sized squares. I guess this dish was meant to be very simple so that customers could appreciate the quality of the meat, but perhaps my taste buds just aren't refined enough, but i couldnt really distinguish this meat from say... angus.
