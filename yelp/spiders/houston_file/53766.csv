Kata Robata////Avant garde Japanese style. This bustling restaurant on Kirby can be noisy but it's always got great food and the cocktails are delicious.  The kobe beef appetizers are a must.  Whether you go with the bowls or sushi you will get a dish that is both interesting and well-executed.  Each dish here seems to have a twist from the traditional japanese version, always to the positive it seems.  Service can be a bit slow sometimes at peak hours but it's usually professional, courteous and helpful. Parking can be difficult so valet this one.  Highly recommend.
