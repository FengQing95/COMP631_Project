Uchi////As SW doesn't do fish, this is where we parted ways. Her evening progressed with the DIY hot rock waygu beef, cauliflower w cashew/caper/some herb, and sasami yaki (oak-grilled chicken breast with lemongrass/cilantro). All were described as tasty - the chicken melted in her mouth in a non-creepy way - but perhaps the flavors needed to be kicked up a notch, as was demonstrated by Thatcher, her pup, who rejected the leftover chicken I attempted to feed him when we arrived home.
