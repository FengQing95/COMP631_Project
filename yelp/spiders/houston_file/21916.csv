Uchi////What I found to be bizarre, I had a fish dish and a meat dish, but in sushi roll form.  Both dishes had an undertone of being smoked or earthy in flavor.   Almost like everything that comes out of that kitchen is going to have a smoked flavor one way or another.  I found that a bit disconcerting.  Yes, it's Texas and it's all about Steak, Smokehouses, BBQ's etc.... but I don't expect my sushi to taste like that.  Strange.
