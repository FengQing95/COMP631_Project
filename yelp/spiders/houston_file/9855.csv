JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen is hands-down delicious and impeccably prepared.  We had the tonkatsu, and everything from the basic broth and noodles to the finer details were perfect: the pork was deliciously tender, the egg was perfectly softboiled, and even the drizzle of red sauce on the pork was a nice touch.  Beautiful presentation and detailed preparation = awesome Jinya ramen!
