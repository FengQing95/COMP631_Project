Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We had one of these in California and I'm STOKED to have one now in Texas! These guys are epic! Drinks are on point, service is excellent, and they're WHEELCHAIR friendly unlike most places. They're super accommodating. I love the chilaquiles and the pimento cheese! I went 3 days in a row last weekend because it's really that rad. Sunday's there is a DJ for brunch. It's the best, most popping brunch in houston!
