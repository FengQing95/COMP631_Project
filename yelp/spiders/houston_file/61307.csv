Baby Barnaby's////Fianc√© got the migas and I got the green eggs, and we were both pretty unimpressed. I also don't even remember the coffee, and I always appreciate a good cup of coffee. His dish was just not notable, but I didn't even really enjoy mine. The green eggs were kinda strange to me (maybe it was the artichoke hearts?) honestly, so I ended up leaving most of them behind. We also were pretty underwhelmed with the potatoes too, and those are always a fun splurge for me.
