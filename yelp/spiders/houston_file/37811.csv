Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My aunt and uncle adore this place, they come several times a month! This is the first time I ate in and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Multiple servers were available to help us and would check in periodically. I had the salmon, which was great although it could use more oomf in the sauce. More muted flavors but appreciated all the veggies included. The Brussels sprouts were delicious even if you had a piece that wasn't covered in yummy cheese. Not to mention the whiskey, I couldn't talk enough about that. Will happily return every time my family does!
