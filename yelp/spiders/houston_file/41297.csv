Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Went for lunch.  Really crowded industrial type place.  Service was typical hipster edgy which was fine enough but cool.  Lunch was extremely mediocre but coffee and pastries were excellent.  Doubt I'll come back- too much hassle to park and get a seat for it to be worth it.
