The Pit Room////One of the few places that I believe are really doing some BBQ justice.  It is a bit pricey but for the area, quality of product, and solid staff, I am not sure it can be priced at a better bargain.  I really enjoyed true smoke flavor and great house BBQ sauce and bourbon sauce.   Definitely a satisfying meal with real pit flavor.
