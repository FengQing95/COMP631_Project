The Pit Room////I'm taking only 1 star off due to not have a spicy bbq sauce.  They have a coffee flavor for you coffee lovers.  Also 1 star taken off due to several flies in the restaurant.  Besides that it's a big Yay! I'm full, and yes give it a try if your thinking about or wanting bbq in the Houston Area.  I hear the line is out of the dooor during rush hour..so hurry :
