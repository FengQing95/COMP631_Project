Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We ordered a chilequilles benedict as well as a pancake flight to share. We actually ordered 2 pancakes and a French toast, but the waitress brought us 3 pancakes, one which we never ordered and didn't know what it even was. The portions of both plates were much smaller than what we would've considered a normal order at any other breakfast restaurant, and for the price this was definitely not worth it. Our waitress never even got back with us for a water refill, so we couldn't even make the order right with the French toast missing.
