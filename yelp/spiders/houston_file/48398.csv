Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great breakfast, atmosphere and Theresa, my server, was very attentive. Â Kept my coffee cup full and spoke with me by my name. Enjoyed my eggs over easy, sausage wheat toast and orange marmalade. I like it simple but the menu is awesome... with a huge variety of breakfast items.
