Local Foods////I had the Asian chicken salad. The flavors were amazing. So fresh and delicious! I love a good glass of iced tea, and they have a very nice iced tea. Even gave me a to-go cup as I was leaving at no extra charge. Next time I make it to downtown Houston, I'll be sure to go here again!!! Great staff as well, very attentive, fun and friendly!!!
