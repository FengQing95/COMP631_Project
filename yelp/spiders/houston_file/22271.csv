Uchi////You really can't go wrong with the food no matter what you order. Everything is fresh, well seasoned, and aesthetically pleasing. Some of my personal favorites include the walu walu, unagi, and maguro sashimi and goat cheese. The brussel sprouts were really interesting and not bad at all, but I wouldn't get them again. The tempura onion rings were also just ok. The fried milk dessert was very good and highly recommended!
