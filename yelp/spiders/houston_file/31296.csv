Local Foods////The Crunchy Chicken Sandwich is out of this world. The pretzel bun really makes the sandwich. Other favorites include the egg salad, the potato and leek soup, and the Mintade. I usually frequent the Rice Village location, but I have also been to the Upper Kirby location. Both have wonderful indoor atmosphere and friendly staff. The Rice Village location's patio leaves something to be desired with its small space, but the Upper Kirby patio is beautiful.
