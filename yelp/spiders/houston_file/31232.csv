Then there was a pecan spread on the bottom of the bread and chips at the top--both adding to the crunch. There's a juicy tomato in there too. I thought it was delicious. The cabbage slaw was also great, crisp and slightly sweet. I wasn't fond of the quinoa side, it was pretty tart, but my husband like it. He also liked his veggie soup and Bahn Mi sandwich.
