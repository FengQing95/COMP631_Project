Kata Robata////I came here with my boyfriend for the Sunday's happy hour. It wasn't crowded as expected but we had a reservation. We get seated and order two drinks, two appetizers from the happy hour menu and one of each roll on the happy hour menu as well. 10 minutes into ordering, our drinks and the fresh catch ceviche comes. So we devour it because we were so hungry. 30 minutes passed by and nothing. So we barely grab the attention of our waitress and order an actual meal from the menu, spicy soy ramen. Our ramen comes out 15 minutes later but still no rolls or appetizer we ordered way before the ramen. So we waited almost an hour for the rest of our food to come out and finally the waitress comes and tells us the printer wasn't printing the tickets for the orders. We were upset but it was understandable since it was a technical problem. We wait and finally get our pork belly bun and two rolls out of the four that we ordered. We finish the food and we're wondering where the rest of the rolls are. Our waitress comes by and doesn't even realize that the two rolls we ordered were missing. She apologizes and we decide we just want one since we were already having a bad experience and getting pretty full. So we finish that one roll and asked for the check. Before the check comes she brought out two desserts since they felt bad for the mistakes. We understood and decided to let that bad feeling go. After we finish the dessert, our check comes out to $69.28. After the receipt came to add the tip, the receipt had $85 instead. I wish I had asked for the copy of the $85 receipt so I could attach it to the review. I don't know if they thought I was dumb or it was just ANOTHER mistake on top of the many addressed from the review. So I let the waitress know and she apologizes again for the mistake. I feel like the numerous mistakes made created a bad taste in our mouths although they tried to make it up with free desserts. I would've understood if they had a busy day but it wasn't busy at all. It was saddening to have this type of experience since I love Kata Robata.
