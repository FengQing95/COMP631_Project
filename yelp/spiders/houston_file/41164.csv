Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Parking. Let's just say I live within a long walk of Common bond, and I don't have a problem finding a spot to park when I choose to drive. There is a small gravel lot a block down that always has a spot, and street parking is easy to find at most times. However, the parking is still awful - why? The enter and exit signs are backwards. They force you to do a left hand turn onto Dunlavy and then make another left back into the parking lot if you didn't find a spot the first time around. Easy fix, but still a problem.
