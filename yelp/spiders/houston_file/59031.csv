Baby Barnaby's////On a recent trip to Barnaby's I was walking from the car and I twisted my ankle so badly (because the sidewalks are not leveled) that I had to sit for a minute and scream... I thought no one was watching, but apparently I scared a 40 year old homeless man, who just looked like he felt sorry for me. I limped my way to the restaurant swearing off baby barnaby's and resolving to never again come back . . . after this one breakfast.
