Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We went here for dinner based on the outstanding yelp reviews. There is only one word to describe my overall reaction to Bosscat: underwhelmed. Yes, the ambiance is fantastic and the drinks are as well. The food? Not so much. We ordered the shaved pork chop sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, fries, and traditional macaroni. I was particularly excited for the macaroni. It was sooo cheesy and yet sooo bland. Not one ounce of flavor or seasoning in it. That seemed to be the theme with all of our dishes. Great on paper, great presentation, completely bland in taste. Service was excellent. Our waiter, Cristobal was so attentive and even hooked us up with some banana pudding (it was ok). Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place for dining. Drinks? Absolutely. Dinner? Â Nope.
