JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great ambiance - very contemporary and spacious. I tried their #1 which I thought was good, but I've definitely had better. I thought the broth could've been a little richer and could've had more flavor (salt?). I also had the takoyaki which I thought was delicious. Really big portions too!
