Baby Barnaby's////Always a pleasant experience whether I'm dining in or placing to go. Scott is always friendly and greets me by name. They have recently opened a location closer to me in the Museum District (maybe 5 minutes away) but I still drive to this location for the friendly service and attention they use when making my food.
