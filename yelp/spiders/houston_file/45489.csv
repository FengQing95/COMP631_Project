Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The food was great, but seating was limited.  The areas set up for bar seating along the windows was cramped and basically impossible to sit at if you didn't want to be part of a tabletop's backdrop (have your rear in the other diners' faces).  You can't put seats right on top of your other guests!!! I would also suggest having some laminated menus available for people waiting in line (especially if they are outside in the rain).
