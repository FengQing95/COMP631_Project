JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I tried the spicy chicken ramen since I figured the broth would be less fatty. I added fried garlic, which made a world of difference, and next time, I'll try the thicker noodles instead. My only complaint is that there just wasn't enough meat. Jimmy had the spicy miso (chef's special), which was definitely more flavorful. The only thing he would do differently next time is make it spicy and add an egg. You have the option to add other ingredients, so make sure you check out the list.
