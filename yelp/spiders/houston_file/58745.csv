Baby Barnaby's////They have fresh squeezed orange juice (you can actually see the juicer) and amazing food. I usually get the huevos rancheros: scrambled eggs, black beans and their amazing potatoes. They also always given Arriba salsa at each Barnaby's restaurant which makes me very happy as well. :)
