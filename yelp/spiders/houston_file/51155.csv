Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I arrived with my appetite, and opted for the Snooze classic with scrambled eggs Â with jack cheese and bacon (I opted to just have my bacon mixed in with my eggs), hash browns, and a buttermilk pancake instead of toast. Yeah, that was SO much food, and I definitely didn't finish it all! It's good to know that they take their portion sizes seriously here, haha.
