JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////But no worries! I came back on a weekend night and eventually found a parking garage right next to it (which I probably should've looked for when I went the first time lol) so we parked and walked to jinya and at first I was expecting a wait since it was a weekend night around 10pm but nah we got seated right away.
