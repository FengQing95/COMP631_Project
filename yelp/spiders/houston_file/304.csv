JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya Ramen is probably the best ramen restaurant in midtown. The broth (the most important part of ramen) is flavorful and delicious. The meat is cooked to perfection, falling apart easily at some prodding with your chopsticks. They accommodate your special requests (like getting the Tonkotsu Black with thick noodles) without any fuss. This is a really great place!
