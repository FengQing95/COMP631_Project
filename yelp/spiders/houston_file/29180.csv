The Pit Room////My 2nd visit recommendation (Local Favorite) would be their tacos. I don't think I could order again, without having at least one taco and a drink to compliment my dining experience. This taco is smokey, cheesy, and savory that is matched with a grilled tortilla that makes this a very "gourmet tex-mex" meal. I would strongly recommend not skipping this item.
