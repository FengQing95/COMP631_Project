Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Came on a 9 am on Sunday and there was a 45 minute wait. There was free coffee so wasn't all bad. The restaurant decor is bright and clean. The service was probably the major downside. It's slower. We sat for 10 minutes prior to be greeted or getting drink orders. Waters never got refilled. Assume wait times would be better if it was more efficient.
