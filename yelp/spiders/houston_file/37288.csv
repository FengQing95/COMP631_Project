Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I also want to apologize for taking a bit of time to message you. I had to make sure I spoke to everyone who worked valet the night of your visit. I spoke to all the valet drivers and the president of the valet company as well. They are all very sorry for the misunderstanding. The specific valet driver that spoke with you feels terrible for his miscommunication. It was explained to me that they always ask in situation like this to make sure that the customers don't double tip. In the past they've had one person tip for multiple vehicles but the other drivers didn't know. Therefore the other drivers would also tip. It puts the valet drivers in a situation that looks like they knowingly took double the tips by not saying, "No need, the first driver already tipped." Thats the reason they asked you weather the tip was for all three vehicles. They didn't want to assume.
