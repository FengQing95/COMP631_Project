JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First of all I was pleasantly surprised this place is open early, it makes me mad when I wake up and want ramen but I gotta wait till 5pm. Tried this place with a party of 7 and we all loved it. It took some time for us to get a table but understandable since we had a big party. I want to compliment the service, from the lady behind the bar she was very nice and professional until we got seated. Our waitress was fantastic, she was attentive as far as refilling our drinks timely and answering any questions we had about the menu.
