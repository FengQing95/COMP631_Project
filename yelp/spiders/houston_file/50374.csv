Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Life at Snooze gets a better now. In walks the manager, Leah. I explain what happened and she is beyond apologetic. I had seen her through what seemed like 'my day experience at Snooze' and she has been roughing it being the bar. All wet from cleaning, running around everywhere. Super hard worker. Anyway, she says that she has just come back from vacation and there are things they working on and will be meeting with the staff soon, which made me feel relieved. She immediately got us seated at the next available table. Brought us a complimentary cinnamon roll pancake (the bomb) and made sure we were well taken care of. After that things were so much better all thanks to Leah. It's the small stuff and a smile on someone's face that can change your mood in a split second.
