Kata Robata////I told him that I did make reservations through the website but no dice. He gave me long story about how they have to reserve the food and blah blah. I didn't argue and I wouldn't have been upset if the table next to me hadn't gotten a menu. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the couple made reservations but didn't specify HRW and still got it. The only difference b/w this couple and us is that they pitched a fit. Maybe I should have been rude to my server so I can get what I came for.
