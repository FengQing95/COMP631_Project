JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya has excellent ramen and a variety of vegan appetizers and ramen options for every lifestyle and diet. The staff are amazing and the service is quality. I prefer to sit at the bar too enjoy my meal or grab a drink when I get food to go. Everything on the menu is delicious. Highly recommend the spicy creamy vegan ramen or vegan harvest. The vegan bun and edamame is also a great appetizer while you wait.
