Uchi////Awesome Food Even If You Don't Eat Sushi!! I went there with my daughter & her fiance. I loved everything we ordered: My Favorite Gyutoro (72-hr short rib), Delicious Biendo (tempura shrimp spring roll), Flavorful Bok Choy, Wonderful Ham & Eggs (pork belly), Excellent Hamichi Nabe (yellowtail & koshihakari rice), Tasty Hana Tataki (roasted cauliflower), Marvelous Karaage (chicken) & Nice Shag (salmon tempura roll). For dessert we enjoyed Irresistible Fried Milk & Scrumptious Peanut Butter Mousse. I need to mention one issue I had for those that are handicapped like me. I arrived early and had to stand for 20 minutes until my reserved table we ready. I could not sit down anywhere while I waited. I could not sit outside while it was raining & the bar was full. Next time I have reservations, I will try not to show up to early.
