Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Hi, Kat T., thank you for your review and for bringing this to our attention.  We are very sorry about your experience and understand your frustration.  We have not built our business on serving sub-par products and this is certainly not what our cookie should be served like.  Please let us reach out to you about this situation. We would appreciate the opportunity to make it right or at least refund you appropriately.  At your convenience, please private message us your phone number or email address.  Again, thank you for taking the time to review Common Bond and for informing us of your experience.
