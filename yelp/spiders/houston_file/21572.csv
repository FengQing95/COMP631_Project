Uchi////).  So good!  This delightful dish comes out in a piping hot stone or clay bowl.  In the bowl is rice, baby yellowtail, and an egg.  At the table, they pour soy broth in the bowl and mix it as the dish cooks before your eyes.  The more I ate of this dish, the more I loved it.  The rice becomes really crispy and has great flavor.
