Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We were very happy to get a quality, yet casual bar-restaurant close by, and we have been here several times already.  The atmosphere is fun and cool, great decor, and the window wall separating the kitchen from the dining room/bar area is entertaining.  The garage door windows to the outside are often opened, which is pleasant during nice weather.
