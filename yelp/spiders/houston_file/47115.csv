Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Everything you could ever want for breakfast, and even things you didn't know you wanted. The food is delicious and there are lots of options to personalize your order. Definitely get there early if you don't want to wait and want a parking spot. We got there around 7:30 on a sunday and were seated almost immediately.
