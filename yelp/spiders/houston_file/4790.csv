JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Robert - Thanks for the great review. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay with us. Thank you for bringing this spilled-water incident to my attention. I will consult with our servers to determine how this was handled, and more importantly, how it should be handled in the future. Moreover, we do sometimes get hit with a spike in demand for certain items. As the owner of three JINYA locations, I rely on a large team of chefs and prep cooks who must find a balance between keeping our inventory full and not having to throw out items that expire. In a word, it's tricky, but we try hard to do our best every single day.
