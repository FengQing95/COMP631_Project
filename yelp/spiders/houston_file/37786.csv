Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I am so glad I came back and finally got to try their famous fruity pebble french toast and it was amazing! The french toast was not overly sweet which was great. I also paired it with the short rib chilaquiles for something salty to balance with the sweetness and it was tasty as well.
