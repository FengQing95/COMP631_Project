Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was really great. Highly recommend the chilaquiles Benedict, and my hubby likes the ham Benedict. Our toddler son devoured the hash browns. Restaurant is cute and lively. But service is pretty bad. Our server seemed to have little to no waiting experience in the past. She rarely checked on us, got simple things wrong (e.g. Water no ice for our toddler), and made dumb excuses when it took over 30 min for our simple order to arrive. Then, on top of that, they made it wring the first time. For a restaurant this busy, the kitchen and serving staff need to get it in order. There's a fairly long wait at 9 am (45 min).
