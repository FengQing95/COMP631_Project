The Pit Room////Meat ,meat and more delicious meat. My partner and I are from NY and immediately upon coming to Houston we knew we needed some BBq. It looks the Pit room was well recommended ! The brisket was juicy and tender . The Pork ribs were off the bone tasty. We really felt like we had the best bbq ever ! Service is quick and staff are super friendly. Nothing like good ol' Texas Charm. These NY'ers are leaving quite content. Only thing I would say is that I have had better Mac and cheese but considering it's a bbq place - I am not really complaining ! Such a great meal !
