Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Open for dine in but everyone is required to wear a mask prior to entering the bakery. The fruit tart crust was crisp, not too sweet. I had the mascarpone pastry which is a wonderful combination of brownie, chocolate mouse and mascarpone with a touch of espresso....amazing pastry! The Father's Day special, "the mustache" pastry is a chocolate mouse, too sweet for me.
