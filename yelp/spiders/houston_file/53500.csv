Kata Robata////Thank you to Houston yelpers for directing me to this tasty sushi place. I will openly admit it - I am one of those whiny West Coast sushi snobs. I like my sushi fresh and no-frills. This place delivers on both counts. Granted, there are some fancy rolls with fancy names, but Kata Robata truly delivered on the basics.
