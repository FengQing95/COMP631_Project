Local Foods////It's pretty obvious that the sandwiches here are their marks of fame, unfortunately, I can't  have gluten so I decided I'd have to settle for a salad.  Now, usually when this happens at a restaurant, I lower my expectations because salads are typically pretty mediocre.  NOT the case at Local Foods!  Literally, the best salad I've ever had... and the biggest!  This salad can literally feed someone for 2 meals, and it's phenomenal.  I had the Chopped Greens with balsamic chicken, tomato, feta, eggs, pine nuts and beets.  SO GOOD.  After my first bite, I tasted something really unique - they put chopped basil in the salad!  That was a first for me and it tasted great.  You can definitely tell when a salad is fresh or not and this was so incredibly fresh.
