Baby Barnaby's////The menu: I have probably tried every dang thing on this menu and it is all freakin' delicious. Fresh ingredients and always consistent. I trade in between getting the burger (with bacon, blue cheese, AND avocado of course), the hawaiin jerk chicken, or one of the amazing salads. I also sometimes just skip a meal all together and get those blue cheese bacon waffle fries all to myself. yes i love blue cheese and bacon a little too much. Also very important:: the huge fudge brownie and icecream, and the carrot cake.
