Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've wanted to try CBB for some time now. So, I just visited them on a random weeknight. Parking in their back lot was good. But, I think I went when it was their non-peak time. Walking in, I'm immediately greeted with the smell of coffee and freshly made bakery goods. The lighting was bright enough in here, but not too bright to be blinding. IMO, the decor can best be described as industrial chic. Ceiling pipe design and modern clean lines. Seating is adequate as well. There were several Â tables that can seat 4 people, bar seating where the barista concocted espresso drinks, and a few booth seats towards the back.
