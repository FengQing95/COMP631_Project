JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Leroy - Thanks for your review. I'm a little confused by your review. You said you ordered a Chicken Chashu Bowl, but received an item that "looked like dog food, but on a plate next to some rice." I fear you may have been given a Tokyo Curry Rice, which by all admission, does not have the most appealing appearance, though its contents and flavor profile do match traditional Japanese curry.
