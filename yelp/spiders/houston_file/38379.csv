Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Pretty good for a chain restaurant. They have at least two other restaurants in Orange County, but we went to the Bosscat in Houston. Lively place, with plenty of specialty cocktails and of course whiskey. They have whiskey flights as well. We went for brunch and had the pork belly poutine (not cooked to crispy, so pretty fatty and not fall apart) it had andouille sausage gravy on top - meh; Pulled pork hush puppies were crispy and full of pulled pork/BBQ sauce - ok; Pig candy - ok. Short rib chilaquiles was good, tender braised short ribs a top of crispy corn tortillas, sauce and fresh avocado. Â Ambiance is high energy for a Sunday brunch, very noisy; servers were good, some of our dishes came out later than others at the table, so all of us were not served at the same time. Will have to visit the OC locations and check out their menus.
