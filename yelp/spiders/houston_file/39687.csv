Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We came to visit Houston from Chicago and researched some "must eat" places in the city. When we saw some Fruity Pebbles French toast pictures from Bosscat on various sites we knew we had to make the trip. I mean come on, fruity pebbles on French toast.... YUP! Well we made the trip and Bosscat did not disappoint. Not only was the French toast truly incredible, but the ambiance and decor was top notch. You won't be disappointed!
