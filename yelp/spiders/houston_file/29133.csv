The Pit Room////I had the chicken and pork ribs, mac and cheese and potato salad. Chicken was good seasoned right, ribs were skimpy like barely any meat on the bone (they gave 3 small slivers by husband had 1 big sliver). Potato salad could've been hitting if they used the right mayo, added some pepper and paprika. Mac and cheese -- no! The sauce was just meh. It didn't have a kick, it was like a base sauce (open pit without the tang)
