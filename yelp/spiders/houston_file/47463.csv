Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I had to look at the menu a day ahead because it's so extensive and I still didn't know what I wanted upon arrival. The place is extremely cute and reminds me of a chic diner. Since I'm off alcohol until the month of February I wasn't able to try any of the drinks that they have to offer. I ended up getting a single pineapple upside down pancake, bacon, and one scramble egg. The amount of bacon they give you as a side is more than you will get at most places which is great. The bacon was very thick and had a smoky flavor which I loved. The scrambled egg had nothing worth really reviewing about. Had to season it myself. The pancake however was amazing. It had chunks of pineapple in every bit and the size of the pancake had me extremely full. Even though the times Snooze is open is a little difficult for my schedule I will try and come back here and try other items when I can. The only reason I'm taking a star off is the gnats (flys) I had to deal with around my table.
