JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Karina - Thanks for your great review. I'm glad you enjoyed your Cha Cha Cha. It's definitely one of the more popular dishes we offer. And you are correct, Sunday at 4:30PM is what we call the "calm before the storm." We get especially busy on Sunday evenings due to a torrent of to-go orders via DoorDash, Postmates and Favor.
