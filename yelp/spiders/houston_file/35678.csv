Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat exceeded all my expectations. I am a Yelper at heart so when I saw this place had a solid rating, good food and good cocktails, I was in. What I didn't know was that I was in for more than just good food and drinks. The place was crowded but not overwhelmingly so (we were able to find two spots at the bar) and the open atmosphere and garage style open doors were perfect on a nice evening. The bar tenders were very attentive and even took us into their whiskey room for a tour. We ordered the pimento cheese dip which was quickly devoured and the bosscat fries were everything I want and need in life. The sauce was amazing. They took care of our special requests on the meal and everything turned out just right. I will be back very soon!
