Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Came here with a few friends honestly I've been wanting to come here since i moved to the area. I am not impressed at all the service was horrible the waiter was rude... we did wait but that's anywhere. 2nd I had a hair in my food which is fine since again it is a restaurant and forgot my pancake order the food was ok possibly just a wrong day to go on.
