Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The only time Common Bond has ever disappointed me was with the Chef's scramble which is described as having "seasonal ingredients." I assumed all the seasonal ingredients were vegetables but it actually ended up being some sort of smokey tasting steak which was quite unexpected. So vegetarians be warned :)
