Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////In the mornings there will be a line but it isn't too bad, maybe thirty minutes. In the late afternoon there are no lines but you run into the risk of them being sold out of most things. Lunch/menu service ends at 3:30 I believe, or maybe 3, and after that you can only order the bakery goods and drinks.
