Uchi////Both dishes turned out well.  Especially the Yellowtail roll.  The Wagyu Roll was not cooked like they told me it would be, but rather it was on the rare side, almost like it was seared pieces of meat but the entire inside was a bloody red color.  They told me sorry and that they would take it back and make me another one, but since I was starving hungry.... I choked it down.   It didn't hit the spot, but rather took my hunger pains away instead.   I'm not afraid to eat raw meat, just wasn't expecting it after my extremely attentive waiter told me it was not raw.
