Baby Barnaby's////This is one of my "ALL-TIME" favorite spots for  breakfast. If you want an incredible server ask for the 'silver fox' -- he is amazing and sexy -- grrr.... The pumpkin pancakes are so 'holiday' that you feel almost guilty for ordering them, but I am all about good food. The migas are incredible and the fresh squeezed OJ (and machine) -- YUM!  Don't underestimate this little gem in Montrose -- hobnob with the kaleidoscope of Montrose and expand your horizons.  It is a "4" thumbs up rating for me and my sweetie !!!
