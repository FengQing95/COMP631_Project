JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Unna - Thank you very much for the 5-star review. We greatly appreciate it. And we're especially happy you and your boyfriend gave us a try in the first place. More than two years ago we opened our first JINYA with the simple hope that folks would enjoy authentic Japanese ramen. Today we read reviews like yours and we know all of our hard work has paid off. Thank you for the kind words, and we look forward to serving you again soon!
