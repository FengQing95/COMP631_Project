Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Hands down the most over hyped place I have ever been to. It's just alright. Plain food that I can make at home, yet this place is hella over priced. I honestly don't understand what the hype is about. And I'm usually one to agree with the hype but not when it comes to this place.
