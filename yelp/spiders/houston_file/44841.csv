Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So I've been doing this ketotic diet thing where I don't eat carbs, fruit, or dairy 6 days a week.  It's a pretty miserable way to live, or so I thought it would be, but I'm actually faring okay with it.  I do break the diet once a week on cheat days though, and what better way to do it than at Common Bond?  My last two cheat days have been at the Breakfast Klub with fried chicken, waffle, and biscuit, also an excellent way to load up on carbs - but really, Common Bond packs the happiest punch per bite.
