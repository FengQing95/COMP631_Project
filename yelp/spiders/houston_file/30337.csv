The Pit Room////Brisket was great. Got a slice off the point and a slice off the flat with my two meat dinner. Point was candy so tender and juicy. Honestly the fat was great as well. Good bark too!  Jalapeño cheddar sausage was great. Sauce is very good too but I used it more for my bread and Mac an cheese which was very creamy and moist. Saw a beef rib on table next to use that looked great as well!  Definitely will be back.
