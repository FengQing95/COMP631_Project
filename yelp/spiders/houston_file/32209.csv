Local Foods////I've been meaning to try this spot for a while, but I rarely am in this area, or when I am, Local Foods is closed. (Glad to hear they are open 'til 8pm now!) I finally was able to stop by 2-3 weeks ago to pick something up from a friend. To be honest, I had no intentions of eating here since I had to attend a birthday dinner in less than an hour. Well, that decision obviously changed. After a long debate on what to get (everything sounds so good on the menu), I finally decided on the Duck Confit Sandwich. Best decision ever. All the ingredients perfectly complemented each other. I was afraid the duck confit would be dry, but it wasn't. The bread was perfectly toasted. When I ordered my sandwich, I told myself that I would only eat half (I even asked for it to go so I can take the other half home since I had that birthday dinner that I previously mentioned)...welllll, that didn't happen. I couldn't control myself! Within minutes, I had devoured the whole thing! GAHHHHH why must I think with my stomach?! Who eats TWO meals within 30 minutes of each other? THIS GIRL. Ever since that day, I have been daydreaming about that sandwich. I cannot wait to go back and order the sandwich, again. This time, I'll make sure to not have any lunch or dinner plans right after.
