Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We came here for Sunday brunch in expectation of an amazing experience. That's true, for the most part. Our server came and took our order immediately. She was very helpful, knowledgeable and had a great personality. We all ended up ordering some beers/cocktails as well as food afterwards.
