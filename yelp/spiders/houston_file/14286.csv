JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Personally I am not a fan of Ramen, but after it was recommended by a friend I gave Jinya a try! Interior was well decorated, environment was welcoming and staff was friendly! I decided to go with their vegan option and it was the BEST spicy vegetarian Ramen I have had!
