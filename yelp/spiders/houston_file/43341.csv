Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We were served quickly by a friendly employee. Got an iced tea, an oatmeal cream pie and a vanilla latte. I'd give the food 4 stars, the oatmeal cream pie is delicious and the cream cheese frosting was so good I'd eat it by the spoonful, and at $3.75 it was one of the more affordable options. The latte was nice as well.
