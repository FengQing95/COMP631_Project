Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Best Sunday Brunch in Htown.....The King is flavor on a pancake I have never experienced before. The sticky bun burger and fries was to die for. The bartender sent over a Breakfast in Bed shot with candles for my birthday.......it was so freaking good....the waitress, Bree, was one of the nicest people to wait on us.....the chef came out to check on us, the manager came over to wish me happy birthday.....we sat next to the kitchen window and that kitchen is spotless and organized.....Bosscat is a well oiled machine and when you walk in, there is a smooth vibe....the way that jazz music is smooth. Their whiskey wall is impressive and everyone is informed on the place. I had such a nice and relaxing time there. I suggest making reservations to get the good seats.....I am definitely going to be a regular here. Kudos to Bosscat.
