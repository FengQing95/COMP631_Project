Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze has the phrase "the best of both worlds" down, esp when there's a constant internal conflict of eating savory vs sweet during brunch-  there are options for half savory half sweet,  options for different eggs Benedict and even a pancake flight. Definitely would recommend!
