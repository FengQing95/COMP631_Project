JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Fried Brussels Sprouts: 1/5 - PASSSSSS on this, please. Seriously, it was pretty bad. There was so much tempura batter, I felt like I was eating... batter. The brussels sprout flavor was long gone, left behind in their fryer or something. I much prefer mine grilled. The bf said this tasted like broccoli..
