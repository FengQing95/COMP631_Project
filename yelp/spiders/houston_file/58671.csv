Baby Barnaby's////Food is good but ordering for pickup is always a disaster. So much attitude. Literally 50% of the time they're too busy to take my order right away and just put me on hold by setting the phone down and walking away, so after about 5 minutes I just hang up and order somewhere else. If it weren't for the good food and good sized portions, the servers would definitely deter me from coming back!
