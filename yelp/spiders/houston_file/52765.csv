Kata Robata////Kobe Beef Carpaccio - yumtastic! Diver scallops with goat cheese, jalapeno and some crispy accents, it was like velvet soooo good.  Tuna Tar tar which was by far my favorite! A thinly sliced white fish which was drizzled with this citrus oil that was the perfect treatment. One of the ladies at our table doesn't each fish so the waitress had the kitchen make a veggie roll for her and it was really tasty too.   Upon the recommendation of our server Kelly, we had the watermelon sorbet for dessert. It was the perfect end to a light and lovely meal.
