Kata Robata////Another place I can't believe I have not been to yet, after ten years this place is still packed on a Friday night. I Recommend making reservations! We were 6 people, so we ordered a few appetizers and mains to share. I started with the house salad, I chose the miso dressing. It was a great size, and was delicious. I loved the combination of walnuts and cheese they chose with the spring mix. We shared the rising sun roll, as soon as you put it in your mouth the truffle oil tastes come alive. It's one of the best rolls I've ever had. We ordered a few more things, but this one by far was my favorite. I was not a huge fan of the eggplant Â and rice, the rice was a little too burned for my taste. I also got the peppercorn salmon, and scallop sushi. They were excellent as well. The service was excellent, everything came out quickly. Fun atmosphere!
