JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had the jinya no. 1 (I think), and it was delicious! The broth was incredible, toppings tasted great, and was very filling. I kind of wished I didn't had anything to eat the earlier that afternoon because I couldn't finish my bowl, but I wished I did. Would definitely recommend ordering your bowl a little spicier than you think you can handle, because however spicy you think your bowl is, it's really not.
