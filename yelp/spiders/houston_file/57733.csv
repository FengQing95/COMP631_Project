Kata Robata////We had 12 courses and literally not a single one disappointed me. All the favorite staples I dreamed of were included - fatty tuna, salmon sashimi, wagyu beef - but to my extreme surprise, they weren't even the stars of the show for me. Of course, they were all so good I wish I could relive each bite over and over again, but I was completely blown away by how decadent every other dish was - some unexpected favorites were the scallop with foie gras and the Japanese milk bread sandwich with literally the most tender, juicy, fatty, and flavorful beef I've ever tasted. It took the concept of melt-in-your-mouth to a whole different level I couldn't have fathomed. Â
