JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA always provides a great atmosphere and consistently good ramen. The JINYA Tonkatsu black is my go to. Creamy and robust broth always has me ordering extra noodles so that I dont have to leave any of the broth behind. Their pork belly baos, while a little pricey, are absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try. Wait times have always been reasonable for a place so popular, and their late night hours and delivery make it a great ramen option at any time of the day. Solid ramen, with a good assortment if side dishes, great atmosphere and wait staff, and the late night hours make JINYA my go to ramen in mid-town.
