JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Mmmmmmmmmm!  So so good!  I'll be the first to admit that there are several great ramen places around Houston, but this one is my favorite so far.  I like it because it has more variety than some other places, but that doesn't sacrifice the quality or authenticity of the ramen.
