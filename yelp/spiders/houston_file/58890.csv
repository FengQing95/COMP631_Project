Baby Barnaby's////This is one of my favorite breakfast places in town. They have all one would want in a traditional breakfast such as eggs, sausage, and pancakes, however the ingredients are healthy and the flavors are more interesting than you'll find in your average neighborhood diner. For example, their sausage is chicken and apple, and they offer egg whites if you'd like.
