Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Two of us visited on a Tuesday late morning. While you stand in line, all of their sweet and savory baked goods tempt you to the point you just want to try them all! Â We decided on coffees, a pistachio croissant, a fig & goat cheese macaron, and the biscuits & gravy.
