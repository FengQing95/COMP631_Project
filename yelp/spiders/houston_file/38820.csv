Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////LOVE this place! We were out-of-towners just looking for good food, good drinks and good vibes and that's what we found. The staff and cooks were great and made us feel at home. All the food was delicious we couldn't stop eating. Food was all reasonably priced as well. When we visit Houston again this will be our first stop! Hoping one day they will make their way to Seattle and open up another location!
