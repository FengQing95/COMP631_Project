Local Foods////This is the place to definitely go to if you love a really good, hearty, yet healthy sandwich. I had the smoked salmon on a sesame bagel. Like any other great salmon and bagel, it was fresh, but the best part was the onion jelly. it made the sandwich sweet, savory, and super aromatic. I thought i couldn't finish it, but i did.
