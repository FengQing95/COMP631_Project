Uchi////We went there recently for a celebratory dinner, our first time back in a while. Service was great, as always. We ordered the machi cure, always a favorite, and while we enjoyed it, the yellowtail lacked a bit of the usual smokiness that make it great. We ordered the nigiri sampler Â and were glad we did. Small pieces, but ooh la la. And of course the Brussels sprouts. If you are real nice to your server, you might even get a surprise to cap off your great night. And no, you dirty minds, not the kind of happy ending to get you in trouble with your wife!
