The Pit Room////It's a pretty straight forward menu, with your usual brisket, ribs, sausage, etc. One unique addition is a lil Tex-mex flair with tacos and chips and salsa. I didn't go for tacos, but went for the chips and salsa, as they were one of my dairy free options. I also went with the green beans that were saut√©ed with onions and bacon. They were really good, and with all of the meat and the sides, I filled up, fast!
