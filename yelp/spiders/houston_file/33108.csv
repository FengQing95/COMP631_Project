Local Foods////I don't think I've ever had a better sandwich than those served at Local Foods. I've had almost everything on the menu, and nothing disappoints. My personal favorites is the velvety smooth and indulgent truffle egg salad - and that pretzel bun! The rotating soups are always yummy too.
