JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Andrew - Thank you for the great review! We really appreciate it. Not many people know that the valet service in the parking garage is free (though the valet guys rely on tips to earn their keep), so that's always an option. However, in the coming months we plan to open more JINYA locations in Houston, which may alleviate some of the crowds that flock to our Midtown spot. And, lastly, you're correct that we are franchise, but I'm a lifelong resident of Houston, and my general manager Keith is BOI (born on the island) from Galveston. So as far as our bench is concerned, we're very Texan.
