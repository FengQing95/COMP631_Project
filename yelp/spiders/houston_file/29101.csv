The Pit Room////The turkey our friends had looked pretty good, so I'd try that next time. They also have giant beef ribs, but bring your appetite if you want those. They only sell it in 1-pound increments. The Mac and cheese was phenomenal, and perhaps a reason to come in itself. The perfect amount of cheesiness, just soaking in gooeyness. The beans were good, but I won't write home about them.
