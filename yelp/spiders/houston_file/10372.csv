JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ordered the saut√©ed Shishito peppers with bonito flakes and the takoyaki for starters. LOVED the shishito peppers. They were sweet and had a hint if bell pepper taste. The addition of bonito flakes makes the peppers just salty enough. I just wish the portion size was bigger (I could eat these peppers for every meal)! The takoyaki octopus balls were large and freshly deep fried. Served with a sweet sauce and salty bonito flakes, this was definitely a great appetizer.
