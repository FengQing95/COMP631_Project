Baby Barnaby's////One of our favorite brunch spots! Green eggs, migas, huevos rancheros, the lox plate, steak and eggs, and the Belgian waffle with fresh berries are our favorites! Super-casual hipster-esque, dog friendly patio, and friendly service (excluding one girl there that has never failed to disappoint)... Just don't bring large groups, and there is usually a wait for parties of 2 for about 20 minutes when we brunch on weekends.
