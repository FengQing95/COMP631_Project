Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love this place, everything is fresh and delicious! My favorite pastry is their morning bun but their kugelhopf are amazing as well. Honestly all their food is delicious. My only suggestion is to please put a sign that says order first and then sit yourself. There is nothing more frustrating than someone coming in and grabbing a table while people who have waited and followed procedure are left without a table.
