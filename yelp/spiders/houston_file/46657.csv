Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I really like the appearance of the cafe, it is very well decorated and the color scheme of the restaurant is great. I also like the touch of the marble counters and the bar stools for the coffee bar. It's also clean and I would highly recommend their pistachio croissant and Lavender Latte!
