Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Visited for first time a few days ago for lunch. My friend and I both ordered quiche  with salad.  The quiche fillings were excellent and the pastry delicious.  We were served our food in a timely manner.  We have tried to go there for breakfast a few times but no parking had been available in either of their parking lots or on the streets nearby, so lunchtime again it will be.
