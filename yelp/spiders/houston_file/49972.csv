Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze Spuds Deluxe: 4 stars. You get to pick 2 ingredients to add onto the dish.  The flavors were good, but the hash browns were NOT brown at all... more like "hash whites." I've never seen such white/un-browned hash browns before.  Kind of weird. Not sure if that was an error or if that's how it always is here. FYI the soy chorizo is quite salty. Overall, I would order this dish again though.
