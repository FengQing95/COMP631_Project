Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Truly, the mushroom fries were a disappointment. The mushrooms we cut into large slices, battered, and brought out with this amazing spicy dipping sauce. The mushroom "fries", however, had absorbed much of the oil, did not have a pleasant texture or flavor--the group of us tried to get through some of them, but in the end it felt like we were struggling to eat them by slathering the dipping sauce which contained all of this great complex flavor. The restaurant understood, took them back, didn't charge us, so props to them for being great customer-service wise!
