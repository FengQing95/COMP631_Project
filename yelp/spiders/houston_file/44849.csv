Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////That plain croissant. Is the best croissant I've had, and by far - including the ones I had in Paris. And whatever that thing that I can't pronounce is called, that's really good too; it's reminiscent of monkey bread sans cream cheese. The breads were great - my fav was the olive. And I must admit, the sweetness of the pastries was amplified when I heard the family that sat next to me say they're already out of the pan au chocolat. Ah, sweets with a hint of smugness. I sipped my coffee quietly. It's not nice to gloat.
