Uchi////Perhaps it was valentines day and hectic so I will have to visit another time and see if it's the same which I hope not. I was not impressed by the experience with the service. The food was however very nicely displayed and very flavorful, creative presentation and originality of food combination. Every course was pretty well designed, except there were some discrepancy with some items in the course which I think the waitress just added to our order since the original course got replaced and later she added those extra items to the bill which I didn't order. She took it off and apologized when I mentioned it. I would love to give it a 5 star but I had a mediocre experience and it didn't live up to the ratings and the hype, will give it a second chance and hopefully it will be better the next time around.
