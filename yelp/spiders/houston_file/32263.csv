Local Foods////First time here. AND it was SUPERB! Food was fresh and came out very fast! Staff was nice and helpful! Very yummy and healthy! I feel so good already. Small menu so it's easy to choose. Parking might be a hassle on the weekends and maybe rush hours. They have a small parking lot which serves four restaurants in the same plaza. Nice music too. Try it out!
