Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was able to find some street parking pretty early but parking can become an issue as the parking lot is quite small and fits only about 8 cars. Â I was able to be seated immediately at the bar which was good cause I was a party of one. They did a good job of still maintaining social distancing. They separate the 3 seats at the bar and you can only have a party of 2 for bar seating. There is sanitizer at the door, the staff is wearing mask and gloves so all COVID protocols are covered.
