Local Foods////The 1 star taken off is mostly bc of the not so family friendly menu and atmosphere. I couldn't find a high chair or booster seat anywhere so my kids were all over the place. Next, the only options for kid meals were a PB&J or grilled cheese. Well, my kids don't eat bread (maybe a sandwich shop was a bad idea for dinner?! Parent fail!) so I was hoping they would have a fresh fruit or fresh veggie platter w some of the delicious meats we had in our sandwiches, but they didn't. I don't even think they had milk, and I asked for apple juice but they didn't have that either. The closest thing to juice was the mintade, but luckily my girls LOVED it. I gave my girls the vegan chili w chips for dinner but the chili was too spicy, so they just ate chips (which also have a spicy seasoning to them. Me and my 18 mo old loved the spice, but my 3 to had a hard time) and I made them another dinner when we got home.
