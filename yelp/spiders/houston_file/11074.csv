JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm a regular at Jinya, and I usually go for the most taken bowl the Tonkatsu Black. A good sized ramen bowl filled with broth, vegetables, a soft boiled marinated soy sauce egg, ramen, and pork. There's nothing like taking a small group of friends here for lunch or dinner being seated by young staff and enjoying the vibes of midtown while you wait in line (inside or out)
