Local Foods////Came in for a quick bite and tried the market veggie sandwich, it was awesome! Now I have two sandwiches that I love from here, and that's only because that is all I have tried so far. Â For the longest time I would order the salmon sandwich, but now I will have to choose which one I want because they are both so good! Inlove the crispness of the ciabatta bread it come on, it's not too soft or too crispy. Flavorful, juice, and crispy are the words that come to my when I take a bite out of this sandwich.
