Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We tried the pulled pork hush puppies (3.5/5), frog legs (2/5), and pork belly poutine with a fried egg on top (5/5). The pulled pork hush puppies were ok, but the breading to filling ratio was off. However, the Carolina bbq mustard dipping sauce was really nice and complimented the hush puppies nicely.
