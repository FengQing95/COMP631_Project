Uchi////I've used yelp for years, and have eaten at countless  restaurants but have never left a review. For 2017, one of my resolutions is to begin writing reviews. I'm starting with the best restaurant in Houston. It's so difficult to name your favorite song, your favorite movie, your favorite book...However, there is no doubt that my favorite restaurant is Uchi.  I've never had a dish that wasn't excellent. The service is always perfect. . My last visit in November was the usual perfect dinner. There was only one hiccup. My Hamachi nabe bowl was too hot and there was slight burning on the bottom. The waiter did not even allow us to lift a fork and he immediately took it back and replaced it before i could say a word. I could lick the plate after finishing the hama chili. The brussels sprouts could make me go vegan.  The cocktail kara kyuri is so refreshing and strong at the same time. Rarely, can a restaurant that is so hyped actually live up to the hype. Uchi actually exceeds the hype!
