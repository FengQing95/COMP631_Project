The Pit Room////Had to try as the reads were, Written up in Texas Monthly. Maybe I should write for TM.  Ordered the 2 meat dinner. Portions were adequate.  Selected the jalapeño sausage and brisket. Asked for the slaw and macaroni and cheese as my sides. The brisket was good not great. Their sauce was way on the vinegary side for my taste this kind of sauce better suited for North Carolina blond style  barbque not Texas style. The sausauge had the taste of jalapeño but not of sausage, strange?  Slaw was wet and tasteless and the mac and cheese was good. Drank tea. The ambiance was nice small and cozy. Price was a little higher than average but affordable. Self service
