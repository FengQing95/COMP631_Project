Baby Barnaby's////Good breakfast places are surprisingly difficult to find. When you do find one, they're very likely to have a wait. Baby Barnaby's is no exception to this rule. If you come on a weekend morning, you can just expect a wait. Deal with it. The payoff, the reason you'll happily withstand the muggy H-Town heat, is what you can expect once it's your turn to have a prized seat at their table: great food, friendly service, and a truly relaxed, inviting atmosphere. Warm and comfortable, it immediately sets you at ease. Taking my own seat in the shaded patio area, a pleasant and all too rare sensation came over me, a sense of homecoming after a long, tiresome journey. Like the sweet smell of mom's apple pie and the warm embrace of an old friend. Yes, it's true, Baby Barnabys had me at hello. A place this welcoming was likely to get pretty high marks as long as the food wasn't awful. And it wasn't. In fact, the food just reinforced this feeling. Our friendly server promptly took our drink order. While sipping on the ice water thoughtfully left in a carafe on the table (attention to detail's important people!), we perused the menu, finally making our selections. Hubby chose the pink and white scramble and I decided to try their breakfast burrito. Â This burrito generally is made with egg whites only and when I asked if they could include yolks, there was no issue at all. Side of tomatoes was changed to potatoes and I was a happy camper. After the food arrived, we were even happier.
