Local Foods////It was very delicious! The sides are all amazing. I've never been a fan of squash, but even I liked the acorn squash side that they had. The ingredients taste very fresh. It was our first time visiting here and we were very pleased with the food. They definitely stuff the sandwiches. We're pretty excited to go back and hopefully really soon!
