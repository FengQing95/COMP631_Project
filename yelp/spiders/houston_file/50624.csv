Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I understand a long wait time on the weekend; I really do. But there is absolutely NO EXCUSE for you to get quoted "20 minutes" and not get seated until "60 minutes later"..... If anything, the hostess should ALWAYS over-estimate your wait time. I wish they had just said it would be 1hr and a half wait. We would have went somewhere else to occupy our time until our table was ready.
