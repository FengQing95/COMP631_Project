Local Foods////I also got to try the egg truffled sandwich everyone on yelp is thrilled about. It was not 5 stars.. if I could grade it.. I would give it 1 star. I felt like the tuna or chicken.. or whatever it was.. it was so dry! The side of soup.. I think it was a lemon grass chicken soup.. tasted exactly like eating a stick of lemon grass.
