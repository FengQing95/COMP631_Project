Local Foods////I had previously given this location five stars and I've been here many times, but today I got the vegan taco salad (which is my usual meal) and I kept getting this bizarre taste like spoiled milk every so often. I stopped eating it because I was scared I was going to get food poisoning, and the jury is still out on that. For some reason, saut√©ed squash was added to the salad as well, which is not normally included on the salad, so I'm not sure if those vegetables were bad or not. All in all, it was a very disappointing visit.
