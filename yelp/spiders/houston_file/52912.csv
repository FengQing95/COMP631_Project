Kata Robata////One thing to note, if you do a carry out, you'll have to scream into the phone as the receptionist is located right near the speaker and they usually can't hear you.  Other than that, this place has a pretty relaxed ambiance and friendly people.  I would recommend this place to my friends to check it out.
