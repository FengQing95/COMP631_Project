JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Otherwise, to your other point, JINYA's concept is geared towards a trendy, loud atmosphere. In fact, for each of our franchise locations, we are contractually obligated to play our house music -- provided by a Â Corporate-mandated music service called GrayV -- at specific decibel levels. Failure to do so violates our franchise agreements, and could effectively put us in default. That said, I have relayed your message to our corporate headquarters, and we always recommend our guests do the same. The employees in JINYA's head office do listen to customers' concerns.
