Local Foods////I've been wanting to try this hipster haven out for quite some time, and i'm glad I finally did.  I had the crunchy chicken sandwich with the lemongrass soup.  I absolutely loved my meal!  Among the other things my lunch companions ordered were: The gulf shrimp sandwich, the smoked salmon sandwich, quinoa, kale and slaw.  All 3 sandwiches were fantastic, but my favorite was the crunchy chicken.  I thought the sides were all so-so.  We all agreed the slaw was the best.  The Mintade is fantastic, also.
