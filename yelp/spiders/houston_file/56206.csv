Kata Robata////This place is amazing. I'm so glad I stepped outside of my comfort zone and stopped on by. The food is so delicious and my server was very helpful with recommendations. I ate way too many sushi rolls (all of them were A++). I also decided to get the Spicy Soy Ramen and it did not disappoint. I think I fell in love.
