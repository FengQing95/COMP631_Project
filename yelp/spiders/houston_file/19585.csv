Uchi////By the time we got in ( we waited almost 1.5 hours!) we were starving.  We asked the waiter to keep bringing us food until we got full.  When our first serving arrived, it was tiny but delicious.  The waiter described the dish in detail and even how to eat it!  It was almost like a presentation on art...not food.  Cool!
