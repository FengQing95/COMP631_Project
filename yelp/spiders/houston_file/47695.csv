Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////For the eggs we chose scrambled, and for fillings chose fresh spinach and caramelized onions.  O-M-G every individual ingredient in this item was delicious by itself, and the combo together was superb.  Scrambled eggs perfectly prepared, hash browns just the right balance of crisp brown and softer white shreds, perfect amount of melted cheese, fresh spinach perfection, plus sweet and lightly brown caramelized onions.  I would say Snooze served the best version of this combo than any version I've ever eaten at any other restaurant.
