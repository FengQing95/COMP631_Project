Kata Robata////I was at Kata Robata for a birthday dinner. We allowed the waiter to pick our dishes, which was fun enough. One of the dishes was a seaweed salad. It was quite nice, but the portion size was very small. It's the amount of food that makes you think that everyone around you is judging you for being so pretentious - oh look at him, not eating fish at a sushi place and eating such a small plate blah blah blah - but then you realize you're paying $60 for four-ish dishes and suddenly you realize how right everyone's judgments are.
