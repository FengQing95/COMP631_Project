JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Rachel - Thank you very much for the 5-star review! We greatly appreciate it. I'm also glad you received good service and enjoyed our fare. While we do experience extended wait times during peak hours, we do our best to keep the tables turning without rushing anyone along. Thank you again for the kind words, and we hope to serve you again in the near future.
