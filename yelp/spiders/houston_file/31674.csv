Local Foods////I've been fortunate enough to sample the crunchy chicken sandwich, kale side salad, the arugula salad, and Asian salad and all of them have great flavor and taste. Personally, I love the arugula salad with it's tangy acidic flavor from the salad dressing, which is equally balanced by the cool flavor of the boiled shrimp. I doubt you will dislike any of the food on the menu as I found each of their dishes to be unique and flavorful.
