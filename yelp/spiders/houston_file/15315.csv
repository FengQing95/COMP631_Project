JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We ate here just now and had a great experience. My gf ordered a chachacha, which is a ramen from the old menu but they were still able to serve it. It was rich, thick and delicious. I ordered the signature tonkatsu ramen but didn't like it. The garlic black ramen was great though.
