Uchi////Went for a Mommies HH. The HH rolls were ok (will try other rolls on regular menu when I return), but the other small plates were delicious! There were 5 of us, and we ordered 1 of each HH food item, which was perfect. The "machi cure" was my favorite. Ribs were fall off the bone delicious. Great ambiance.
