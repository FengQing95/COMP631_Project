Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////4 stars so far because I never visited the place and didn't know it existed until today when a friend offered me a loaf of bread and some pastries. The rye bread is what I have been searching for and could never find in my 18 years in this country: a sour taste that a real Russian rye bread has. The pastry I tried is a scone and amazing.... I am driving there from the heights from now on to buy my bread...
