The Pit Room////Delicious!! We got the chicken tacos, sausage, ribs and brisket. A word of warning -- the two plate dinner is a lot of food, even if it doesn't look like it at first. You can't split meats on the one plate dinner so recommend getting two with different meats and sharing with a friend. My friend from Washington literally had a religious experience upon his first bite of brisket.
