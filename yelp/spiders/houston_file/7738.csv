JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I typically don't do negative reviews and to be honest, this is more of a public service announcement.  I was greedy today and ordered my typical spicy chicken ramen...food for the Gods I tell you....and ordered sweet potato fries (I know, who orders sweet potato fries from a ramen place...lesson learned, thank you very much!).  This is what I received for $4.80, pre-tax....13, yep, counted them, 13 fries.  And they weren't even fried all the way through.  Beautiful job on the ramen Jinya, short on my $0.37 a piece sweet potato fries.  Still love ya though!
