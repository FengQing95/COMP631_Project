Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////There's the part of waiting with the masses for 30 minutes which artistically summons up feelings such as those experienced getting molested by the TSA or waiting for your driver's license. Then should you choose to eat in, sitting on sad metallic bar stools that are most uncomfortable and don't really mesh with the whole "I hope you enjoy buttery softest goodness" vibe that you think would go in line with bakery/ delicious food. It's more of a "sit in this airport and people watch trying not to think of your 15 hour hellish flight" setup.
