JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////FOOD: I am a traditionalist, so I got a Tonkatsu Black. The broth itself was very good. I found the broth not overly seasoned, salty, and the likes, but had the right amount of fat in it for a good bowl of ramen. The noodles as well came out just right. Prefect consistency, right amount of chew, and quantity was good. The pork on the Tonkatsu was a bit leaner, and I think that's okay. I prefer a little bit more fat on my pork for a nice bowl of ramen, but I think a bit leaner cut is good too.
