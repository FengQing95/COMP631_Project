JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Trying not to sound like an arrogant butt here, cuz life has beat me down and so I'm not arrogant. But my group and I lived in Asia a long time, and we've had cheap ramen, and this is cheap ramen taste/quality, but priced way higher. The normal eaters said the place is being video game cheap--by relying on miso for soup thickness and savoriness instead animal meat/fat/bone. Come on, even instant miso soup is tasty. It's like using eggs (always good) to hide weakness in rice. As a vegetarian, I ordered the vegetable soup (this place's ramen answer for vegetarians). Gross: broth was soy sauce and water.
