Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Waaaay overrated.  Another one of these 'manufactured wait' places (you'll end up waiting every time you go there, they think it creates a buzz and makes the restaurant more popular... and who knows, they might be onto something judging by the glowing reviews).  Parking is a pain, also.
