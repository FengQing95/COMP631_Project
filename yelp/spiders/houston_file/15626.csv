JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We were about to get up to leave (12 minutes had now ticked by with no one coming to our table, it was as if we didn't exist) when I grabbed a young looking kid and begged him to take our order and bring us water. He said he wasn't our waiter but would find our waitress. He instead came back, apologized (he seemed new, and flustered) and said he would take our order for her--she haughtily acknowledged us as he took our order (she was serving the table NEXT to ours, girl wtf, you saw us sitting there dying for over 10 minutes, how rude), and I almost asked her if anything was wrong (hey we all have bad days but damn girl) the guy did all of the work and I point blank asked him at the end if he would get the tip, as I didn't want her to take it. (Crazy right?) She FINALLY came up to the table at the very end and asked "everything taste good?" And last we saw of her.
