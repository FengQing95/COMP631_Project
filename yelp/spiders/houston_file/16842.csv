JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Extremely salty like the Tokyo Tonkatsu. I'm not sure why they used different noodles for this one, but I enjoyed the chewiness and thickness of this noodle a lot better than the Tokyo Tonkatsu. Spicy level is pretty low, I could barely taste that it was "spicy" and I have a low spice tolerance.
