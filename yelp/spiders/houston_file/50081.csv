Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food wise: Â I personally love their burrito. The green sauce they put on the top really does it for me. I'm not much of an eggs gal but they taste so good in the burrito. The portions are huge so I would share this as well. OMG french toast is a must. It's more of a dessert than a meal so get it at the end to share with friends.
