JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Gastic C. - Thank you for your great review and feedback. I wish we had twice as many seats as we do, but no restaurant is perfect, and we make do the best we can with what we have. Furthermore, during peak hours, countless factors come into play when seating guests -- last-second cancellations; inter-party miscommunication on whether everyone is present; seating preferences, to name just a few variables. But as far as physical space is concerned, we sometimes request parties of 5 to seat three in the booth and two in chairs in order to accommodate everyone. It's not always ideal, but we try to keep it fair for everyone.
