Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Great atmosphere and best almond croissant I have ever tasted.  I sampled 5 different items all were good except for the almond croissant (GREAT) and the Macaroons which were ok at best.  I love the decor and vibe but to me it is overshadowed by slow service and high pricing.
