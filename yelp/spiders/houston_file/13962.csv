JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Can we get this place to open in the East Bay, CA pleaseee! I did not expect I would have such good ramen during my stay in Houston, but was really pleasantly surprised! The ramen here was one of the best I have had this year. Such a bang for your buck at $10 a bowl and the ramen is super delicious. My friends and I came here twice in 4 days, that's how good it is!
