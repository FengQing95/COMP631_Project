Uchi////If I could give Uchi 6 or 7 stars (or more!) out of 5, I would.   We were in the mood for sushi and, instead of hitting up our usual places, decided to try something new.   When we arrived, I must admit that even though the ambiance of the restaurant was great, it was more casual and laid back than I expected.  After being seated and looking at the menu, we had trouble deciding what to try so opted for the chef's selection, which includes multiple courses.  It is pricey but worth it especially if you are celebrating a special occasion or just feel like treating your good self.   Chef's selection changes, but our's included more dishes than I can recall, all of which were just delicious.  There were items that you find everywhere, like edamame and Brussels sprouts, but more delicious than anywhere else, and lots of other items I'd never seen elsewhere, also delicious.  The Brussels sprouts are soooo good!  I also had several bites in the chef's selection that were among the single best I've ever had, like the pork belly and short rib.  There was so much food in the chef's selection, I was more than full.   Make your reservation in advance and give it try.
