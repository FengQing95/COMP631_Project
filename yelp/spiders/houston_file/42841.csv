Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////There was a long line when we arrived but it was expected. We ordered multiple croissants and an oatmeal cream pie. My favorite croissants were the almond, peppermint chocolate and pistachio, in that order. We ordered this beef cheesy grit plate and the steak frites. Both were great, personally loved the beef cheesy grit one the best.
