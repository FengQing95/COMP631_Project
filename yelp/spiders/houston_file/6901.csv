JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love JINYA, I can only eat one thing here which is the only complaint I have but I'm happy I even have the one vegan option. The service is always great, I've had many different waitresses and waiters here and was never displeased. I love the fact that they have a community table, I always come alone so I usually sit here or at the back near the cooking station. Their creamy vegan ramen is great with a side of fresh garlic, bok choy, and wet seaweed. Their wet seaweed is essentially a seaweed salad in a little cup, I eat it alone! They have hot sauce you can throw in there if you want a little spice. Very yummy. I spend way too much of my money here at JINYA but the quality of the food is worth it and I will continue to come.
