Uchi////Solid 4-4 1/2 stars for Uchi!  I have been here a few times in the past, but another visit was long overdue.  The food was outstanding.  We started with the brussels sprouts, the only way for me to eat those sprouts.  Then we had the hot rock wagyu beef, the hamachi nabe, and the avo bake, one of my favorites.
