Uchi////Anyway, we sat down and the waiter came over soon afterwards. He was a nice guy but it was kind of irritating communicating with him because of the nature of the tables - he was basically standing behind me so I had to crane my neck to see him. He explained the menu to us and recommended we try the 6 course tasting, which ended up being about ~$45 a person. We thought this sounded nice so we went with it. I will say that the waiter did an OK job throughout the meal but felt a bit absent. I finished my beer really early on and he never asked me if I wanted another one, whereas he asked my wife if she wanted another cocktail. And just in general, it didn't really feel like he was paying too much attention to us. Granted, it was a busy night, but you don't really want to feel that way regardless :)
