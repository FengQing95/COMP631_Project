JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I recommended this place to my group of friends so we came here for dinner over this weekend during a convention. This is amazing ramen. This is coming from someone who travels to Japan every year and has the real stuff often. I had the Tonkotsu Black and it was delicious! I usually get Shoyu ramen at places like this, but I heard really good things about the Tonkotsu (it also had the biggest photo on the menu so that was a clue as well). The broth is so much more savory than other ramen places I've been to, and believe me it makes a difference between good ramen and excellent ramen! I'd say so far from all the ramen places I've been to in Texas, this has to be the best. I also had the Takoyaki which was also wonderful and tasted very authentic. Overall really happy with this place and I wish I lived closer to it!
