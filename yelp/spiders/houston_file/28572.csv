The Pit Room////Amazing tacos, amazing bbq, nice service! What more can I say? I love that you can bring your food over to the Patio, but I do wish there was more seating at the actual Pit Room itself. There is also not a lot of parking, but that is pretty standard for this area. I definitely recommend the brisket and all the sausage!
