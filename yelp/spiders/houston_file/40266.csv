Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Mac & Cheese (3.5/5) - Delicious, but not unforgettable. As far as mac & cheeses go, it's pretty mild and probably won't offend. A little bit more crispy topping would have been nice to offer that textural contrast. Wish I could have tried the French onion version, but it contains beef (which I don't eat). The portion size looks small but the rich creaminess will fill you up!
