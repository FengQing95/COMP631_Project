Local Foods////Great! Everything I expected and more. I finally got to try the crunchy chicken sandwich on a pretzel bun and it was glorious. Plenty of meat and tastes fresh and light. I also got pumpkin seeds and soba noodles on the side. Their chocolate pecan cookie was delicious and even better the next day. The Mintade drink is sweet and citrusy like lemonade. My friends got lemongrass soup as their side. Apparently they keep the same soup base (coconut milk, chicken), but change some ingredients for the soup every season. My friend's favorite is the current version (winter) of lemongrass soup. No wait on a Saturday during Superbowl weekend. I am salivating while writing this review. Highly recommend!
