Uchi////All in all, we had the zero sen, akami, shag, kinoko nabe, and hama chili, with a glass of the Four Graces white wine. All worth the money in my opinion. For dessert, we had the fried milk and an extra dish with sorbet I received as a birthday gift. The fried milk definitely lives up to its reputation as being creamy and flavorful.
