Baby Barnaby's////Popular place. When we first came up there was quite a line, but it went amazingly quickly. I'm so glad we waited. Fun place, great service. Our breakfasts were both really delicious. Fresh fresh (& strained) OJ was really the best. Biscuits were perfect. So glad we found this one on Yelp and went for it.
