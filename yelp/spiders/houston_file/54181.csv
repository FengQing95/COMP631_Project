Kata Robata////The sushi bar items - unlike the stuff that comes out of the kitchen, the quality of the sushi bar items fluctuates.  Somedays, it is amongst the best I've ever ate (and we've made the round through the Micheline stars, etc, around the country and in Japan)  - like the Hokkaido uni, the yellowtail belly roll.  The perfectly flavored sushi rice and the freshest ingredients where the umami explodes in the mouth.  Yum.  Somedays, it's mediocre.  What surprises me is that the quality can even fluctuate during the same meal when we order additional items from the bar.  I'm starting to believe there must be one master sushi chef and the bunch of apprentices.  That wouldn't surprise me about a Japanese restaurant.  Maybe we'll start sitting at the sushi bar and try to figure out who it is.  Maybe in the future, we'll be the obnoxious customer and insist the master chef make our sushi :-P
