Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was great! I came here with my best friend and we were both amazed by the food. They have lots of unique plates and they have great quality. We also got a pineapple mimosa and the orange snooze and the drinks were okay. Nothing special and I personally would not order again, however the food was so good I know I'm going to be thinking about this place for a while!
