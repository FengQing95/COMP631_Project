Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Despite the fact that it was really noisy I love this place! I had the pancake flight platter which was amazing. I ordered the upside down pineapple pancake, OMG French toast, and the peanut butter cup pancake. My favorite was the OMG French toast and peanut butter pancake. I wasn't talking too impressed by the upside down pineapple pancake.
