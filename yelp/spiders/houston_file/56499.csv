Kata Robata////What surprises us the most was when they served our desserts with a lighted candle to celebrate my friend's birthday! I have totally forgotten that I left a remark on the online reservation that we will be there to celebrate our friend's birthday. It was really thoughtful and sweet of the server to take note of what was written on the reservation's remark! Great service!
