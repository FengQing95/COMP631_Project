Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I am from New York and this place was highly recommended. Although it was a long wait it was very much so worth the wait. The customer service was excellent the food was served in big portions. My only bad review is that they don't really monitor how long people stay at the tables for example there was a party of three sitting at a table playing chess for 3+ hours, I can tell because I know that they had brunch and when we finally got to sit after waiting one hour they were finishing their food and then started playing chess and we left before they left.
