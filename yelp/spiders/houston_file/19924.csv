Uchi////After dropping a small mint at the Uchi in Austin years ago I decided to save HOUchi for a special occasion. Extra glad a friend insisted on happy hour (termed social hour), because it was a delight. The ten menus put in our hands were a little overwhelming but well managed by the entire staff's ability to recite, explain and culture on each item. At points the number of staff hit diminishing returns. But we filled our bellies, only strayed once from the social hour menu and left happy and each only $30 lighter. Will def. return. For social hour.
