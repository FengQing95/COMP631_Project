JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Moneesh - Thank you for the great review. May I ask how your service was mediocre? I would like to review whatever issues you may have had with my staff, as this is the only way we can improve our station. Also, if you visit us again -- and I sincerely hope that you do -- please know you can always inform a manager if something isn't right or needs improvement, and he or she will do everything in their power to make the necessary corrections. That said, I very much appreciate your consideration in this matter.
