The Pit Room////The sausages are amazing, the brisket and ribs amazing.  Dinners are served with your choice of two sides and one slice of white bread.  I have always gotten the two meat variety for $15.95 and can barely finish that.  And for the sides, I've had the Charro beans, Cole slaw and mustard potato salad. I can't complain about any of those sides.  Sauces?  Try them all as there is a dispenser to get your sauce on.
