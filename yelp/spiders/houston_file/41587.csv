Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This past Sunday, I finally made it here. There are limited amount of parking but I was able to get a space. I love the modern style of this bakery. It made me feel like I was somewhere else instead. We came here for brunch. Most of the popular brunch items were sold out. I got coffee and pastries. Everything was good. I need to take my mom here next time. She adores places like this.
