Uchi////As first-timers at Uchi, we instantly felt overwhelmed by the menu.  My boyfriend's roommate had recommended the 10-course tasting menu and we thought it would be a fun way to try out everything and step outside our comfort zones.  Our waiter (who was great, by the way) was very helpful and told us that the 10-course tasting menu typically samples from the daily specials.  Since it was our first time and he wanted us to try their classic dishes from the regular menu, he specially designed our own 10-course menu to try a mix of not only the specials, but their most popular regular dishes as well.
