JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love coming here for the best ramen in town! I love that I can choose my spice level and the service is always great! I really love the cilantro sashimi and all of their interesting appetizers. I always get 2 eggs because I love them that much. So many ramen options and I love the broth! I will return:)
