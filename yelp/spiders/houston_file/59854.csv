Baby Barnaby's////I personally am not in love with this place. Maybe because we went here on new year's day and waited 1 hour, I'm not excited. The food wasn't amazing. I had a pink and white scrambled eggs platter. Eggs tasted like eggs with ham and a couple of cheese cubes and potato bites on the side. Waiter mixed up our ticket afterwards and we waited further until they reprinted the correct one. Thanks but I'm taking a pass on this place.
