Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Love this place, the wait is a bit daunting, but worth it. We've had everything from the muffins to the breakfast sandwiches, all have been wonderfully delicious. Our daughter loves their macaroons! The only complaint I have is when we ordered a custom cake, not worth the money if you ask me, the cake tasted old and dry, and the filing was not what I Â thought it would be, it was thick, gritty, too sweet, and was very skimpy on the fruit (a lot of cream cheese base? couldn't really even taste the fruit). That aside, for everyday eats it's really a great place and you should make time to try it out. Tip: they have an extra parking lot right down the road that's just a very very short walk.
