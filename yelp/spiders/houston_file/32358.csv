Local Foods////Local Foods is the rare casual lunch spot that shoots for something better and hits the mark. My friend and I split two sandwiches - the nut crusted chicken and the pastrami. The chicken was crisp and nicely cooked, and their subscription to the pretzel-bun craze is put to excellent use here as a slightly sweet complement to the saltiness of the meat. Paired with an ice-cold Mexican Coke, this was an excellent bite. Although nothing earth-shattering, the pastrami was well-cooked and the sauerkraut added a nice crunch.
