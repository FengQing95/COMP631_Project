Baby Barnaby's////Really enjoyed my experience here! Came for brunch with friends. The wait wasn't too bad considering it was Saturday. Service was super friendly and nice. He was very attentive with all of the guests and made sure we were taken care of. The inside is pretty small but it's nice. I had the French toast with potatoes and eggs on the side. It was all really tasty and the potatoes had a good seasoning and crunch to them. Would definitely come here again!
