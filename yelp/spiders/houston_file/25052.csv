Uchi////My first Uchi experience was take out during Covid. They canceled our reservation because they'd stopped serving indoors recently, and so we had to order to-go. VERY STRONG 4.5 overall experience probably because I'd had high expectations, but the food was delicious regardless. In my opinion, as a first timer, the zero sen ($12.50) is a must. We tried eight fairly popular dishes, and that was definitely our favorite.
