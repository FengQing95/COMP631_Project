Uchi////For my two visits, I went with non-raw sushi eaters both times.  No problem for the creative souls at Uchi.  The hot and cold tastings are phenomenal.  The second time we asked our waitress to create a menu based on the no-sushi rule.  Although she brought two sushi rolls, the choices and menu she created for us were outstanding.
