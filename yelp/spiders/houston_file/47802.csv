Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Today I decided to try this place out. Since I read the reviews the 2 hr wait time I was quoted was not a surprise. I was in a "party of 2" and decided to Â go to the bar to order a Bloody Mary and a pineapple mimosa, now I specifically said add bacon (an extra 1.25 but no biggie) and waited for the drinks. Mind you there was one seat at the bar and I proceeded to sit down and was told by MARIAH in a certain tone that it's full service only. Now I might have thought I was trippin at first but her tone was very I won't say rude, but it wasn't in a nice way. I brushed it off and we got our drinks.
