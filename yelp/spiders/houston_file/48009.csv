Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is for sure one of my favorite places to go. I was never a pancake fan, but their pancakes changed me into a new man. The wait took a while but was worth every minute because the food swept me off my feet (There's free coffee for you to get while you wait). The service is wonderful especially if you get Sugar as a waitress, she's beyond great and definitely gives a good laugh. Snooze is worth giving a try.
