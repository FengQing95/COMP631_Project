The Pit Room////The serious kinks to iron out in my opinion are supply and attitude. My husband and I came at 1pm on a Saturday. If your stated hours are 11am-4pm, with an intent to expand your hours over time, you shouldn't be out of all of your sides except beans, mac and cheese, and chips less than halfway through your day. If you are, you should also tell customers that before you cut the meat and put it on their two meat plate. It put me in a really awkward position because honestly I probably would've just gone elsewhere for lunch had I known they didn't have any sides I was interested in, but I felt like a jerk doing that when they'd already started my plate. I also didn't appreciate the serious attitude 2 out of the 3 guys behind the counter gave me in conveying this fact. They acted like I should feel lucky they were giving me any sides at all and seemed pissed that I just wanted the meat alone. The guy at the cash register at least seemed a little apologetic. Curiously, when it became clear they weren't going to be able to sell me any of the sides available, they suddenly also had coleslaw. No one offered my husband coleslaw as a side option. It's off-putting to me when a restaurant doesn't offer something until it seems like it's the only way to make a sale.
