Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My friend & I have been tracking Common Bond since it was just a sad dirt lot sitting next Agora. This year, it has transformed into a marvelous "rustic modern" bakery-coffee shop hybrid that daily provides customers with a variety of freshly baked goods and delicious coffee (and other food, but I have yet to explore the brunch menu). Am I a fan? Yes.
