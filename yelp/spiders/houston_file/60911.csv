Baby Barnaby's////I have been here twice (midtown location) for brunch and I absolutely love the atmosphere! Â It's tiny and can get a bit loud, but there's also outdoor seating. There's also coffee while you wait, and its such a nice spot there's bound to be a wait. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the food is not mind blowing. It is very good, but not anything that I would crave. The chicken and waffles were good, and it's so nice that they have healthy options as well. The staff has always been super nice, welcoming, and makes great reccs if you're indecisive like me. If you're looking for a good standard breakfast, with great and friendly service this is the place to go!
