Kata Robata////We started off with the yellowtail and jalapeño sashimi (4/5 rating).  it was very fresh and had the perfect amount citrus flavoring.  Next we ordered the Lobster Mac n Cheese (4/5 rating).  This was excellent although I wish there were more lobster pieces in the dish.  The dish as a whole was huge (the only thing that we ordered that was a big portion) and would probably be best shared in a group of 3 or 4.  Next up was the 72 hour cooked kobe beef skewer (5/5 rating).  This is just straight up melt in your mouth goodness.  2 Skewers to an order with 2 pieces on each.  Then came the Miso Marinated Black Cod (5/5 rating).  This was absolutely delicious.. Fish was so flavorful and moist.  Easy to share too because it flaked apart evenly and easily.  Finally, we finished our meal with the Carribbean Roll (4/5 rating) which had fried lobster in it.  Great roll but 6 pieces in an order at $16 was the story with every dish.  Good but expensive.  My rating just on food alone would be probably be 4.5 rating as a whole.
