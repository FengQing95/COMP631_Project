Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Put myself on the waitlist from the hotel and the wait list was at 6 to 21 minutes then showed up and was told it would be another 20 minutes. Staff were rude and will definitely never return to this business. tried Harry's in town and it was a much better customer service experience. better seating, better customer service, better food, and just a better overall suggestion. Definitely try Harry's over this place would be my suggestion.
