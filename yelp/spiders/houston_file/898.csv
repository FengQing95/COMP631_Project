JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Service: Now - here's where I got a bit iffy. Our waitress was really nice and helpful, and her service was great. But, when we were served our ramen, the lady who served it to us had her THUMB inside our bowl. This is very unprofessional. If you are not able to handle the bowl alone, the protocol is to place a plate under the bowl & and carry the plate instead. This was huge issue for me. I hope they see this & realize it needs to be changed because you can't put your thumb where people eat.
