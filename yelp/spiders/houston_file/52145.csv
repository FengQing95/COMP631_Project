Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered Spuds Deluxe.  Again, 2 eggs over hash browns and I added bacon & jalapeños.  I should have specified sautéed jalapeños, they were raw and very, very hot.  I thought the hash browns were a bit under done. I'd prefer them more crispy.  I'm sure there was bacon in there.  But it was chopped up rather than an actual slice.  Still, very tasty.  And portions were perfect.  Satisfying without distressing.
