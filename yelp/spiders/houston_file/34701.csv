Local Foods////Speaking of sides and soups, I highly recommend the Lemongrass Chicken soup when it's available (usually in the winter). It is so warm and comforting and perfectly spiced. The Tuscan Kale, with its combination of golden raisins, parm, and pine nuts, made me fall in love with kale. The Acorn Squash and Quinoa are also good, but I'm not fond of the Soba Noodles, Pumpkin Seeds, or Housemade Chips. The chips are actually kind of disappointing, since potatoes are my #1 favorite food. They are made in-house, but as a result are unevenly cooked, with some burned and others oily and soggy.
