JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Tina - Thanks for your great review. If I could go back in time, we would have leased and built-out a much larger space than what we came up with three years ago. But having been in the restaurant industry more than 25 years, I can say that there is one undeniable truth about this business: There's no such thing as a perfect restaurant.
