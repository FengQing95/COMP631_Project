The Pit Room////I've come here multiple times at various hours and the experience has always been consistently good. Definitely a good choice for BBQ if you're not willing to wait at a place like Killen's. Don't get me wrong, it gets crowded if you got at a peak time, but the line moves quickly and will never snake around the building.
