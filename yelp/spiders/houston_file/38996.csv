Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food.. pretty delish! My Bacon Fruity Pebbles French Toast with a Condensed Milk Syrup and Fresh Fruit was definitely rich and sweet but it wasn't soggy and the French Toast had a bite to it, which I liked cause of how much Condensed Milk was on the dish. The fruity pebbles added a bit of fun color and unique flavors. I also liked the addition of fresh fruits and bacon bits to cut the sweetness. If you don't like sweets, this dish is probably not for you but I loved it. The portions are not huge, by all means, but a good size. 3-4 small slices of bread. My friend ordered the eggs Benedict on a skillet over crispy potatoes and biscuit. This dish was also fantastic and the potatoes were so crispy! We ordered the bosscat fries with their chow chow sauce on the side cause they did fried potatoes so well. Apparently the chow sauce was made with fresh tomatoes and veggies so it was a nice take to normal ketchup.
