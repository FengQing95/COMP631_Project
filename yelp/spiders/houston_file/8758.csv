JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm Extremely disappointed with my experience tonight. I'm a dedicated Jinya Costumer and I love the ramen, but tonight I was let down. I asked for mild chicken ramen with a seasoned egg and extra noodles. I paid extra for both resulting in a $15+ bill. My food was ordered to-go so once I got home and checked my meal, there was no egg and there was no extra noodles. To top it all off, there was barely any broth at all and only two tiny slices of chicken.
