Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////In contrast to the surrounding cafe's, Common Bond is not a "hipster hangout" like Agora, Brazil, or even Bacchus. Personally, I think this distinguishes them to their benefit. I'd rather come here to talk than to study, as there isn't a ton of private space to study.
