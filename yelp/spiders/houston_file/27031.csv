The Pit Room////I had passed this place many times and was always intrigued by the outside appearance. Well, I finally made a trip and oh man. The brisket was everything I had been hoping for. It literally melted in my mouth. The decor on the inside is so perfect, lots of wood. I just really enjoyed the entire experience and I'm dreaming of my next visit already.
