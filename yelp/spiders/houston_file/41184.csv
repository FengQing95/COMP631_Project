Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Came in at 5:15 and everything was sold out. Said kitchen close at 3. I don't know how it operates until closing at 7pm on Sunday! Only thing left was brioche raisin bread which was dry, lemon tart was ok but not worth $7, apple tart wasn't worth it either. Two other thing left was chocolate cupcake and macaroons. Wouldn't recommend. I would rather go to French Riviera.
