Baby Barnaby's////This is my favorite breakfast place in Houston.   It's very small (seats 35 inside and about 15-20 outside.   Go early if you don't want to wait for a table.   Ecclectic mix of people, great staff, and WONDERFUL food.  Try the Green Eggs (the best thing on the menu).  The Migas are also delicious.   I just cannot rave about this place enough!
