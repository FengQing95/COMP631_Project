Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////First time there today and overall it's a solid breakfast/brunch spot. The wait took about 45 min on a Sunday morning around 9:30 which isn't too bad. Once we were seated, the service was prompt and efficient. I ordered the corned beef hash which was absolutely delicious, but the portion is a bit on the skimpy side. My friends ordered the eggs Benedict with lox and cream cheese, that was a good sized portion and came with hash browns.
