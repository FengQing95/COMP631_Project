JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Food: I previously ordered the Tonkotsu Assari and the Cha Cha Cha and loved those bowls. This time I ordered the Tokyo Yatai Ramen ($10.95) to try something different. Sadly, I was pretty disappointed with the Tokyo Yatai Ramen and should have ordered the Tonkotsu Assari. The broth was absolutely delicious and the thin noodles were perfect. However, the chicken didn't fit well (or maybe because I was spoiled with the other dishes) and would not recommend people to get the Tokyo Yatai Ramen (unless you really like chicken). The Tokyo Yatai Ramen dish gets a 3/5.
