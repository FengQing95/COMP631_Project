Baby Barnaby's////Great vibe, friendly and competent staff, reliably good breakfast fare.  "Green" eggs are fabulous, as is the vegetarian sausage, even if you're a devoted carnivore (I promise).  You may have to wait a while for a table, but that's because Baby B's is so popular, not because the food service is slow once you're seated.
