The Pit Room////This is now probably my favorite BBQ place in this area that I've found. The price actually is pretty reasonable and the sides were really good. Granted, I only say that because they happened to have green beans on special the day I come (otherwise, I'm not a big fan of anything else they had except the macaroni and cheese).
