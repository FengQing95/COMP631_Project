JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////If you want appetizers, I recommend trying the jinya bun. It's $4 each but you only need one. I loved the moist meat inside paired with the spring mix veggies for extra crisp. Also, you can order a side of dumplings and add it to your ramen... It's pretty good together.
