Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If you want the one of the best sandwiches of your life, you need to try the Tomato &Burrata sandwich at Common Bond Bond Montrose.  I could eat this sandwich every day and not get tired of it. In fact I ate them regularly throughout my pregnancy.  The crunch of the sourdough and the balsamic onions mixing with the burrata as you bite in to it. It is without a doubt one of my Top 5 Favorite Sandwiches.  Go check out Common Bond for delicious sandwiches and the bonus of all the amazing pastries and breads!
