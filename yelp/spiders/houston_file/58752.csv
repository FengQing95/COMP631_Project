Baby Barnaby's////It is very cozy, the waitstaff is awesome (especially Scott) and the food is delish!  If it's your first time here I recommend the green eggs, biscuits and fresh squeezed orange juice.  Once you've tried that, then move on to the breakfast plate, breakfast tacos, Bob's Healthy Plate, and then basically follow that up with the rest of the menu.
