JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is my favorite ramen place. I always get the Jinya chicken ramen with a poached egg, and it is excellent every time. The broth is very flavorful and the chicken is very tender. It comes with spinach and green onions as well as delicious fried onions on top. If you're interested in getting drinks, they don't have much besides sake, but I'm typically DD so it doesn't make a big difference to me.
