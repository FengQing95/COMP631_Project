Kata Robata////Dessert: We ordered the green tea souffle cheesecake. BLEH. Not sure where the cheesecake came into the mix or the souffle part for that matter. It tasted like a sponge cake and not in a good way. Plated beautifully but taste wise it was just a no for me. The red bean icecream was good though.
