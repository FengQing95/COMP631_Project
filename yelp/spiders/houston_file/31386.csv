Local Foods////Excellent food! Excellent service! Excellent atmosphere! What else could you want? I went for a late afternoon lunch and was greeted very courteously. The girl who took my order gave excellent recommendations. I had the Duck Confit Sandwich with the quinoa as well as the beet salad. The sandwich was probably one of the top five sandwiches that I have ever had. Well worth the $13. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a great meal in a modern atmosphere and doesn't want to break the bank. Next time I'm know town, I'll be sure to come back.
