Uchi////Last night, we went with two friends, and also got a nice bottle of wine plus appetizers and two omikases.  So the bill was pretty hefty.  Despite that, our service (by Aaron) was awful.  We had to ask multiple times for simple things like water and to order.  I get that it's a Saturday night, and that they're busy, but one of the things that always amazed me about Uchi was the service.
