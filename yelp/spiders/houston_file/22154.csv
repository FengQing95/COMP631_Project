Uchi////Their creative dishes had interesting combination of different ingredients and complex flavors that went together pretty well, but none of them really wow'd us. Like the king crab meat in citrus cream, which is interesting and not bad flavors but I wouldn't come back to order this. What we enjoyed the most were the nigiris. I liked how they put coarse salt in the nigiri, though I found some of them a little too salty. Chicken karaage served with pickled vegetables had too much sauce and again, almost too salty along with the salty pickles. Duck with mushrooms in Thai style curry sauce wasn't bad, but the duck was pretty dry and there were little pieces of bone. I usually find food served in small portions more delicious, like the samples you get at grocery stores, lol but it wasn't the case for me with the creative small plates I had at Uchi. For dessert we got an off-the-menu Omakase dessert along with their famous fried milk on the house. The fried milk was probably our next favorite after the nigiris.
