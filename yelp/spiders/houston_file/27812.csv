The Pit Room////It was very busy on a Saturday night and there were five in my party but the bussing staff were able to quickly clear a table that had just turned for us. The chef then came over and brought a little fresh habanero sauce just to be sure we had the best flavor with our meal. All of my work colleagues raved about their food too. It was clear that a lot of thought and care went into the menu items and quality of the product. I was even impressed that they had beer and wine pairings for specific BBQ dishes. Over all the food was incredible but the special service and attention from the staff but most especially from the executive chef makes me want to go back there every night on my trip!
