JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I tried ramen for the first time at this restaurant and became an instant fan. I ordered the tonkotsu spicy ramen. The noodles in the ramen were so yummy and flavorful. The pork slices in the ramen were also tender and well-seasoned. I am planning to return to this restaurant and would highly recommend! There is also a bubble tea place next door.
