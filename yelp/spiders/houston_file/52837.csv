Kata Robata////It's been almost 5 years since I first visited Kata Robata and I have loved it since then (I go there almost once every month).  However, all the changes they made during the past few years made it harder to stay a patron .  My brother used to order their braised pork belly with rice but about 3 years ago, they started serving it without rice so that they can make a few more bucks from a side order of rice.  They made a couple more changes such as only sitting full party and the 15 minutes, which I totally understand and agree with. The real game changer is their policy for bigger parties.  They only offer online reservation for up to party of 4.  A bigger party will require reservation by phone. I called in earlier for party of 8 and was told that for party this size you'll need to spend a minimum $85 per person.  Not sure how they got that number when individual plates on menu are mostly $20~ range/ $35 for chirashi, especially with kids in the party.  I guess I just need to explore and get the chirashi somewhere else.
