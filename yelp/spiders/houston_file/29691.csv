The Pit Room////Unfortunately, they were out of pork and beef ribs, so we had to settle for the sausage and the brisket. We ordered a brisket sandwich, a 2 meat dinner plate (with some brisket + sausage, and a few extra sides: elotes, Mac and cheese, potato salad). WOWOWOW. It all hit the mark! The meat was tender, everything was well smoked & flavored and the service was great! Would recommend! (It's also open later than it's other Texas BBQ competitors!!!)
