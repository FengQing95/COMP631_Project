Uchi////Once seated our waitress was super sweet and kept checking up on us, even though I could see that it was busy. The food came out a little slow but she was super apologetic and the service and the quality of food more than made up for it. It was busy and during their happy hour so I expected things would be kind of hectic and so I was not upset at all.
