JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love this place! The ramen and broth have a great flavor and are super filling. Highly recommend the beef or pork for flavor, but the chicken is really good too! The shrimp tempura and edamame small plates are good go-to starters. Seating is tight and only seated when the full party is there so get there early or go during the week
