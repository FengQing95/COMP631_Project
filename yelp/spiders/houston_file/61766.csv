Baby Barnaby's////We came here for breakfast on my bday and I was really pleased with the food and the service. I ordered the green eggs which were amazing and I don't even really care for scrambled eggs but these are delish. My husband ordered the steak and also thought it was really good. Our server was personable and attentive. Will definitely return
