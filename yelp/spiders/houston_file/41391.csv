Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is awesome! I went for lunch and had a Cuban sandwich with a side of chips. The bread was great as were the meats. The chips were homemade and very good. Â Slightly high price point but worth it for the freshness. Parking was a disaster and seating was difficult
