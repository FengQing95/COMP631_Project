The Pit Room////In the words of Backpack from Dora the Explorer, yum yum yum yum yum delicioso. I've been wanting to try this place for a while, but the constant line out the door always deterred me. Friday night was no different-- we waited in the heat outside for 20 minutes before finally getting a whiff of AC. The entire time I was standing in that line, I was praying that this BBQ would be worth it. Hint: it was!
