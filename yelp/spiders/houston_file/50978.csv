Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Ordered delivery from Snooze - got a tofu scramble, a breakfast burrito, a benny duo, and a pancake flight. The pancakes were incredible as were the tofu scramble and the breakfast burrito. However, one of the eggs in the benedict was overcooked and the yolk was completely solid. The other egg was perfectly runny though.
