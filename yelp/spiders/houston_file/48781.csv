Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Con: WEAK bloodies beware. Eggs Benedict was undercooked (both mine and hers). Pancake (blueberry danish) did not at all resemble anything danish like, and was really just plain pancake mix with blueberries. Plates are smaller than appear in pictures, especially for the price.
