Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Everyone knows there is always a wait time at Snooze. Therefore, my friend and I decided to be there at 10:30AM on a Saturday to get a table by 11:30AM. To our luck, we got a table around 11:10. They sat us down. We were just sipping on our water and chit chatting while waiting for our 3 other friends to arrive. About 20 minutes later, an employee (probably a manager of some sort) approached us and asked when the rest of our party was coming. We responded that they should be here soon. She said we should check up with our friends because other customers who are waiting won't be too happy when they see an empty table (we didn't order any food yet since we were still waiting). FIRST OF ALL, our table was at the very end of the restaurant (next to the bathroom). No one would have noticed us unless they purposely stand at the edge of our table and stare. I wonder if she acts like this with other tables who are just taking their sweet time to finish their food. WE CAME THERE TO EAT so WE WILL ORDER. If your point was to get us to order something first, then just say it. The way you acted made us feel like you wanted to take away our table that we legitimately waited for. Although, I will give her some kudos for trying to lessen the wait time for the other customers since we were still waiting for our friends.
