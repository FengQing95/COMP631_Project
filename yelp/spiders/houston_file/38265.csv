Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My first time going was the New Years Brunch yesterday and it was the worst breakfast I ever had. Hash brown was burnt. Toast was burnt and harder than a crouton. Eggs were runny after I told him I wanted them scrambled hard. My friend and I also got bacon and it was so hard it knocked on the plate. I tried to break one piece and it just wasn't happening. The waiter new it was bad and that's why he didn't ask me how it tasted. He asked my friend how she liked her meal because she got the pancakes (it tasted like cake btw). It is only getting one star because the outside decor was nice. But don't come here for breakfast.
