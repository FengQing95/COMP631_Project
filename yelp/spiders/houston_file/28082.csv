The Pit Room////We came right after spending a few hours from the Houston zoo and we were pretty hungry. We ordered the feast #1 under "sharing" on the menu. We substituted the turkey for another order of sausage. The food was for four adults and one child. We came with an empty stomach and left with a full stomach and a box of leftover food. Would recommend for anyone to come and try Texas bbq!
