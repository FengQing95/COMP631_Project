Uchi////The reason I'm saying that; we sat down around 7:30, after we decided to go with the waiter's selections, I felt the dishes were planned ahead of time because everything came quickly some even came 2 or 3 dishes at the same time so pretty much within an hour or so we had 16 courses but to order more it would take at least an hour, it doesn't make sense, we didn't wait an hour to get our "16" dishes and was at the peak time after 7:30! a restaurant like this has about 10 chefs behind the sushi bar working constantly, it would take at least an hour to order a dish that I've never experienced or heard of it regardless how many sushi restaurants that I've been to, no matter you have a full house or just have one customer if takes an hour to prepare a dish, you have a problem!
