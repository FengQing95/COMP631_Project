Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I like the layout and vibe of the place.  Obviously counter service, then find a seat.  Booths, tables, and counter seats scattered about.  A small patio outside.  All in a comfortable modern, minimalist vibe.  Like I said, the line is not hard to get through, but trying to find a seat is really an adventure. Between meandering through service, other customers, and and trying to find a seat you are lucky to not fall flat on your face.  While the servers obviously bring the plates out to you, it does not seem anybody cleans up...ever, when somebody leaves. I sat at one of the counters, and between three bowls of half eaten food, and saucers of old coffee there is literally no room.  Nothing was cleaned up the entire time I was there.  Considering kitchen times are pretty long, I was here a while.  They also ran out of silverware, and it was impossible to flag somebody down to have them refill the silverware trays.
