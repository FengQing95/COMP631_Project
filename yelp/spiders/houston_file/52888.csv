Kata Robata////...your sushi chefs were visibly chewing gum as did the waiter that brought a course to our table.. the food was lacking!  ramen soup was a complete waste, oily very oily, not true Japanese style cooking we are accustomed to from better dining establishments!  A vegetable bento box that presented well but  had questionable mystery taste & was quite overpriced as was entire meal...will not return and will share this dis-pleasurable eating experience!  :(  note: place a negative sign in front of the 1 star!
