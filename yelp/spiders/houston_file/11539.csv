JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was praying to the food gods to send me a decent ramen place and my pilgrimage is finally over. This place is a bit cozy but it is totally worth it. I wasn't prepared for the communal tables that are in the middle of the dinning restaurant. This would be great for a large party but I am anti-social to an extent. Like when my mother said to be wary of strangers, that lesson stayed permanently embedded in my cerebellum. I like don't mind being around people but I hate making awkward eye contact with some stranger in front of me. On top of that, I catch myself looking at them eating which conversely means that they do the same. That makes me uncomfortable but then again that is a never ending list.
