The Pit Room////Went on Labor Day and was happy they were open. First time having Texas barbeque and a bit disappointed. Meat was wildly inconsistent with friends having very moist brisket and some including myself very dry. The venison sausage was not fatty enough and was quite dry. They were out of pork ribs which was unfortunate. BBQ sauce was good and so were their mustards. Three meat dinner was more than enough for one person and way more affordable than where I come from.
