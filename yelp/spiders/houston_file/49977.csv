Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food shows up pretty fast and again our server is awesome. Everything hits the table and it looks good, the apple chicken was a little odd as it looked like a big chicken nugget from McDonalds. We all dig in anticipating the best, well to be honest it was ok. I mean the pancakes were good, the pineapple one was the best. The Ham Benedict III was ok, not knock your socks off good but just ok. The apple chicken aka nugget was ok, not an oh wow that was pretty good.
