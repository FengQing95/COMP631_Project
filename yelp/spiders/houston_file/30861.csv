The Pit Room////I held out on writing a review until now since I had a not so pleasant first time but I gave it a second try and yea I can definitely see why this is one of Texas' top spots for bbq! Like all top bbq spots, their brisket is superb. Theirs is more peppery than the other ones I've tried and a heavier on the salt. It isn't overly salty but I'd skip dipping it into the bbq sauce. The ribs are St Louis style ribs so they are meatier but not as tender as baby backs. They are ginormous, savory and oh so delicious! I don't have a good indication on sausage since I'm not the biggest fan but theirs seemed alright to me. The sides are all good but the must get for me is their string beans. They have a nice crunch and its covered in pepper and drippings from their bbq meats. SO GOOD!
