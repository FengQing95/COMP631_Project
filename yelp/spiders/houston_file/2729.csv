JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Moved to Houston on early 2016 from Singapore, I have been on the quest to find a nice and AUTHENTIC ramen place in Houston. Well, my quest was over when I found Jinya. The ramen broth just delicious and the most authentic taste of Ramen in Houston. As someone who was born and raise in South East Asia and Japanese food has been part of my diet, it is nice to have Jinya around when I crave for a good bowl of noodle.
