Uchi////I had a bit of everything with my +1. The server asked us what we liked and picked the dishes for us. We had about 4 plates to share. Everything was of course super good & fresh. I liked the salmon and other fish dishes. I was still hungry though and had to order a 5th savory plate before dessert. Desserts were yummy.
