JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is the bomb. I've never really had ramen before outside of the $0.60 packets you get at the store so I was very excited and also nervous to try a real ramen place but let me tell you this food is delicious! You have to wait during peak hours but you can grab a drink at the bar while waiting and it'll be time to eat before you know it. The ramen is so flavorful and filling, I couldn't even eat my whole bowl. 10/10 food, will definitely be returning soon.
