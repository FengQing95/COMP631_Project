Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is my favorite Houston coffee spot. Every time I go, I always start out thinking that I will order something different, but I always cave and end up with the almond milk lavender latte, decaf because my Doc makes me. They just make them so special, I swear each one is crafted with love, and sometimes I wonder if they also put a little crack in them . Just kidding! But I find myself thinking about them and one time I even had a dream about this lavender latte dancing along the macaroons. I do wish the parking was a little better, that there were more seats, and that they carried more gluten free options... but if your looking for a consistently good cup of coffee and some pretty yummy food, this is the spot. Be sure to go there early or late, as lunch time gets super crowded.
