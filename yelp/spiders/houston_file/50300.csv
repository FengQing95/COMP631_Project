Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've heard about the Austin location but was very excited to find out there was one in Houston! I arrived early to beat the crowds. Being greeted by the parking attendant and the hostess was such a delight. Definitely woke me up. There's plenty of seating but I can see how it could get packed quickly during a rush hour. The decor is a bit like an old school diner with a modern hipster twist. Very trendy.
