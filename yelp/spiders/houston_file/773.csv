JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Dear David, Thank you for your review. I'm sorry your take-out meal was prepared improperly. There's no excuse for an order to be missing ingredients since all of our dishes are prepared according to a set standard -- regardless of whether you're dining in or ordering take-out. Unfortunately, the only logical explanation I can offer here is human error. Please call us at (832) 925-8596, and we will be more than happy to remake this for you at no charge. Or mention this to any of my managers if / when you return. We would like nothing more than to make this right for you. Thank you in advance for your understanding.
