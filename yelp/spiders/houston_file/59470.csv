Baby Barnaby's////The only reason this didn't receive 5 stars is because they don't serve alcohol. I was so excited to have mimosas during Sunday brunch-the homemade orange juice is awesome! Food is great, I had the pink & white scramble with an extra side of bacon. Unlike most places, their bacon is thick cut and cooked to perfection! Love the atmosphere, I always enjoy sitting outside. You're not going to want to pass on this place!
