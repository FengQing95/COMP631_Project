Kata Robata////so I went back to Kata Robata Sushi a few sundays ago after church with some family. The restaurant was empty which was fine but there were flies bothering me the entire time which kind of bothered me because if there are flies near me and my food where were they before I got there. The food was ok. The first time I went I loved it but now since I went a second time I think it was just ok and i think I have had better. I hate to say it but my family felt the same way. I guess its back to my old sushi restaurant that always go to.
