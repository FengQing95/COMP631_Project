Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Visiting friends in Houston and got recommendation to visit Bosscat.  Obviously had to because the name in itself.  Sat at the bar and met Matt!  Perfect cat to recommend drinks for someone who likes it all.  Had the Bosscat w basil Hayden, citrus, bitters and rosemary.  Delicious! Cornbread and Bourbon Chicken flatbread were Scrumptious! Will definitely be back!
