Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was great. The atmosphere was pleasant. The service left a lot to be desired. The server was prompt when taking our orders, and that's where it stopped, and everything went on pause for 10mins then 2 of 6 persons receive drinks. Pause 10mins then we had found someone for the other 4 Â to have their thirst quench. It wasn't the best of times.
