Local Foods////Creative flavor combinations that work.  Very high quality ingredients, including EXCELLENT breads.  I bought some pretzel rolls for the road.  The community seating make the line move quickly, so don't be intimidated.  Didn't love the sides, though, so will be trying the chips next time.  Still worth 5-stars.
