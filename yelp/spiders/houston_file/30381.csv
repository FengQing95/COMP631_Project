The Pit Room////Top notch quality and for me, the value in what you are getting and paying for is easily 5 stars. Â Based on the founders, the heart and soul of the pit room are two, custom-made, barrel-style offset smokers with a vertical sausage cooker sitting adjacent to one of the pits. As for the meats going into the pit, they'll be of high quality. All beef will be U.S.D.A. Prime and all pork will be a heritage, Berkshire-Duroc breed from California.
