Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Went there for breakfast and coffee. Delicious food and drinks. Staff was friendly and nice. The place get very busy and can get very cramped inside. I would try to go early or wait till the weekdays to avoid the rush. I will be returning, but maybe not on the weekend.
