The Pit Room////Parent group up in Hill County, Tx, just south of DFW. Brisket was a staple of any large gathering. Pawpaw firing up the smoker to run overnight, foiling, then serving the next evening. This brisket brought me very close to that experience. Along with great sausage, sides, beer selection, and hospitable staff, this ranks as my favorite BBQ place in Houston.
