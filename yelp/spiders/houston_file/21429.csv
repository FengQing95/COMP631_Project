Uchi////While visiting my roommate from college in Houston where she lives now, she kept raving about this restaurant for months! She kept checking to see when I was actually visiting so she could make reservations weeks in advance. At first I thought, "Uh oh, one of THOSE places," but once we actually got there, I truly had a one-of-a-kind experience!
