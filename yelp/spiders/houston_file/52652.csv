Kata Robata////The End: I definitely think the wait staff was on point and the fish was fresh, but the rice just killed it for me. It was just so disappointing. I literally had a pile of rice on my plate from me just picking out all the good stuff. I would definitely say that I would go back, but I would hope their rice was a little bit better for a place that's know for sushi. Especially on a busy night like a Friday. If it's the same, then I would say that there are definitely better places for sushi in this town.
