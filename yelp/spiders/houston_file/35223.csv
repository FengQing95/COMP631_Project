Local Foods////Love the Local Foods concept. Clean eating that is locally sourced. And the food is always, always tasty. They usually rotate menu items every few months, but there are always plenty of vegetarian items. My favorite is the sandwiches. Every sandwich I've tried here has been delicious and flavored perfectly. The sandwiches come with two sides. It is a bit on the pricier end for sandwiches, but you won't be disappointed!
