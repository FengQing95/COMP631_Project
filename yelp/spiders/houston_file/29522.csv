The Pit Room////If you're going all out on barbecue, you have to try the beef rib here. It's juicy, fatty, and delicious. It's like the best brisket you've ever had because it's a barbecued beef rib. Of course, if you aren't ready to shell out over twenty bucks for a whole beef rib, the brisket here is solid, too, with a peppery rub. The sides are great, and I really like the coleslaw and the corn. The sausage I'm less of a fan of, with great flavor, but a somewhat dry texture. The pork ribs seemed a bit more average, but I do want to try the pulled pork the next time I drop by.
