JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We all ordered the Tonkotsu Black which is their #1 and my friend ordered the Spicy Chicken Ramen. It was all tasty. The broth is very flavorful and fills you up satisfied! Flavors are deep and wonderful, chasu was generous, and the egg provided was boiled PERFECT. Solid white, runny yolk. Yum.
