JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Maybe I had higher expectations, but the food was below mediocre. I got the miso ramen and the noodles were a little hard, the broth was also bit salty. We had ordered Takoyaki before hand but it arrived after the ramen. I've had ramen at a dump prior to this place and it was amazing. The Takoyaki here had no flavor. The prices weren't worth it.
