Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I feel like every time I come here it's always full of trophy wives. The pastry display is amazing, which makes it difficult to choose just one pastry. I ended up getting an oatmeal cream pie to go and a vanilla scone to eat with a lavender latte. The latte was solid. It had a strong lavender taste, which I like. The scone was eh. I felt like I was mostly eating hard bread with no flavor. Very disappointed. But I am pleased to report that the oatmeal pie made up for it. It was nice and chewy and the cream had specs of vanilla bean.
