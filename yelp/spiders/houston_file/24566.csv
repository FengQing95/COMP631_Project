Uchi////Stopped in for a small bite before heading to a concert.   Love this place.  Service was fabulous our waitress was  very helpful with questions and recommendations. Reservations are highly encouraged at this very popular spot.  We tried several items from the tasting menu and the social hour menu.  We had the Walu Walu which was delish as well as the spicy crunchy tuna.  Will definitely come back!
