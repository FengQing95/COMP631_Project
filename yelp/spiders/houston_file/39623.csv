Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I wanted something on the lighter side, so I got the cajun brick chicken and bosscat fries. Overall pretty good flavor, and unique preparation, so food was great! Chicken had a good cajun flavor, with the skin nice and crispy, served over jambalaya style rice.. The bosscat fries where fried potato wedges. Bigger chunks, nice and crispy on the outside.
