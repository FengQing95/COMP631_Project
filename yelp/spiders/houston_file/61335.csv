Baby Barnaby's////If you've never been, be forewarned there is no host to greet you. There is a sign up sheet prominently posted just before you get to the front door that asks for your name/party size/seating preference (indoor, outdoor or first available). Myself and the remainder of my party of two (first available) missed it, so I figured I'd pass the pro tip along and save you the embarrassment of wandering aimlessly as we did.
