Kata Robata////Highlights of meal were the kobe beef skewers, they literally were melt in your mouth (not in your hand lol) goodness! Â Since I'm a hamachi fanatic I also liked the hamachi with grapefruit and leche de tigre. The dish was light and nothing overpowered the fish. Also tried the famous lobster mac 'n cheese too. It surprisingly wasn't heavy but it still had that comforting cheesy-ness that all mac 'n cheese should have.
