JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food was great. I live in Indiana and ramen isn't something I get to eat very often. The broth both times was flavorful and the portions were enough to keep me stuffed. What can I say? I enjoyed it so much that I made sure to visit it twice in the same weekend! I'll definitely be back again whenever I'm back in Houston.
