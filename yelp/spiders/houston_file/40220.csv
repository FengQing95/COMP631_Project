Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I ordered the short rib chiliquiles. They were the bees knees. Full of flavor and awesomeness. Very filling. Atmosphere was great. Beautiful day to be out. They even have rolling garage doors and opened them up. I'll definitely be back. They had amazing drink prices, food prices were fair.
