Local Foods////We stayed near the Local Foods on Dunstan while helping my family for a few weeks post-Harvey.  There are so many great places to eat in Houston, yet most nights we opted to come back to Local Foods for the relaxed atmosphere, the lovely staff and most of all for the delicious food.  We enjoyed everything we tried: the salads, the Bhan Mi, the avocado toast ($5!) with freshly ground pepper and salt (would love a couple of poached eggs with it), etc.  But my obsession was with the Chicken Posole Soup...I could eat it every day.  Thankfully, the manager gave me the recipe which I used over the holidays, making some new converts in NYC.  I wish we had a Local Foods near us!
