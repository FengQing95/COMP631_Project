JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We ordered the pork gyoza appetizer & it was great. I highly recommend y'all try it. We decided to try something different so we got the Spicy Chicken ramen (somewhere along those lines) with medium level spice. The food was great & we even took on the extra noodles deal. We really enjoyed our experience there -- up until we found a hair at the very bottom of the bowl. We weren't looking for a refund since we did finish the bowl. We just expected more quality out of what we paid/waited for. We told our waitress and she quickly apologized & informed us that she will speak to the manager. We received no refund or discount (but it's okay). We're not mad at her (since it's obviously not her fault), but we just wanted for them to make sure strands of hair doesn't get into anybody else's food.
