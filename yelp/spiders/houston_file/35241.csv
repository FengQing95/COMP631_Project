Local Foods////I visited Local Foods for the first time today and was extremely impressed. The interior was very nice and absolutely pristine. Additionally, from the moment we walked in, staff was welcoming and helpful. We actually had a hard time trying to figure out what we wanted to eat (despite the streamlined menu) because everything looked so good. I settled on the "Crunchy" Chicken sandwich with pickle spears and fresh fruit. My wife ended up with the Gulf Shrimp and Crab sandwich with homemade chips. They we're both phenomenal. I don't mean just good, I mean crazy, mouthwatering awesome. The sandwiches were both stuffed and the sides were also delicious. One plus is that we got to enjoy a nice early afternoon in the shade of their patio, which offers a pretty decent view. Â
