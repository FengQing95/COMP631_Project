Kata Robata////We had the beef lollipop looking things and I will say those we so tender it literally melted in my mouth. Definitely a high point considering it's a seafood place. We also got the fatty tuna sashimi and it was also godly. Definitely come here man. Also a low lit romantic vibe here too if you're looking for a cute date spot
