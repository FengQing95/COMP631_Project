Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////2) Second time: Is it ironic that we tried coming back at a later time to catch the lunch menu but found out the kitchen closes at 3pm? COME ON NOW! Seriously? It sounds like I have the worst luck in the world. (Mind you, I believe we probably got there very close to kitchen closing time). Sooo in result, I ended up getting a couple of macaroons (pb&j as well as passionfruit, rating: 2/5) in which the taste and the prices of each were't memorable or delectable; and a chocolate cupcake that I only took two bites of because it was just not my kind of cupcake (rating: 1/5). Let's just say I was not thinking about coming back another time after these experiences...
