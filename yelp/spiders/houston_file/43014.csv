Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The thing I like about Common Bond is that it truly is French in the dishes that it chooses to serve. The menu changes daily or so it seems and has a different menu for breakfast and lunch. since I am late to rise I've missed breakfast twice with intentions to eat it but instead ate from the lunch menu. Yes, this is one of those places that you will order something you most likely have no idea what it is and how to properly pronounce it. Most likely it will turn out very delicious, but there's always the fear of eating something unfamiliar. As you walk to  your seat (self seating) you wonder which dish is yours in comparison to the others that are eating around you, because you really don't know what you just ordered. But hey here's to spontaneity. As you're waiting you'll serve yourself a glass of water because that's how it is at all the local Montrose coffee shops now, and wish it were a tad bit bigger- to last more than one gulp.
