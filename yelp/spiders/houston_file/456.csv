JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////One of the best ramen places in town!  I love the way they cook the egg - hard boiled yet runny yolk in the center.  I like that they have a variety of choices and different noodles as well (I always get the tonkotsu black with thick noodles).  It can get quite busy which is a minus but I have always enjoyed the food.
