Uchi////The big negative was service. Â Our server herself was knowledgeable and attentive, but the food was served by other staff. We were offered food from other people's orders twice (which we declined), while two of our dishes went missing (enjoyed by others, I'm sure), and our server didn't realize it until I pointed it out when she was ready to offer the bill. She did eventually get the food to us and took the charge off from one of them but then proceeded to charge us for the "complimentary" appetizer given to us for the delay in seating. This was also corrected after she conferred with the manager, but these service issues are unheard of in other high end restaurants. I'm not sure I'll be in a hurry to return or recommend Uchi to others after this experience.
