Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Totchos: 4/5. We started with the totchos which come with the tater tots, chorizo, nacho cheese that's almost like a buffalo sauce, and a sunny side up egg on top. I was surprised by how flavorful the sauce was. The crunchy tots, the rich sauce, and the egg melded beautifully together.
