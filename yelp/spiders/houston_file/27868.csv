The Pit Room////One of your big challenges if you go when it's busy - Friday, Saturday or Sunday for dinner - is parking. The Pit Room has a small parking lot. You can find street parking in front of the place, or you can brave crossing Richmond Avenue to park on the other side of the street. And then if they're having a good day, there may be a line to get in the door.
