Uchi////I received a phone call yesterday while at the office that there was a reservation cancellation for the Community Table Dinner and they asked if I'd like to join. What a wonderful surprise! I had forgotten that I had even signed up on the wait list. The Community Table Dinner is a place for Uchi to showcase new menu ideas and to let the sous chef as well as the pastry chef try out new things. It's a steal at $45 per person.
