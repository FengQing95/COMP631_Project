The Pit Room////The beans were some of the best I've ever had. They were spicy frijoles with tomatoes, jalapeños, cilantro, and bacon. I could eat them all day. The homemade spicy BBQ sauce is delicious as well. When you go through they line they give you a good sized cup of it on your tray. I also like all the free jalapeños, onions, and hot sauce. It a very spicy-heavy breed of BBQ, which I really love. Oh, this is a small thing, but I love that they give you a big water cup. I don't see that much anywhere.
