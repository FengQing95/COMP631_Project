Kata Robata////On both occasions, I ordered a mix of appetizer starters, a "delicacy"/featured dish, and sashimi. The sushi was fresh and tasted clean with no funky aftertaste that you will get if the fish is old. The flight of oysters is absolutely a must to try if you are an oyster lover and are looking for a different twist on the traditional raw oyster. It is 4 raw oysters served on the half shell with 4 different sauces atop each individual oyster, and they vary in taste and flavor giving the oyster a makeover.
