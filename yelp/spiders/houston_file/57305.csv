Kata Robata////Last Saturday, I dropped by with a couple of friends for a quick snack and drinks. We sat at the only bar table and ordered some nigiri pieces, sashimi, and some drinks. Lesson learned is that it gets crowded here on Saturday starting at happy hour 5 PM and the bartender will easily forget about you so if you need extra attention, don't sit at the bar table. Beyond that, drinks and food were excellent as always.
