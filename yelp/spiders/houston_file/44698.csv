Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The lavender latte alone is worthy of 5 stars and repeat business!  While I also tried a kouign amann, I was unfortunately not as pleased with that item.  However, the quint space, amazing latte and sight of so many other amazing food items quickly made me forget the lackluster pastry.
