JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The business was packed again, but we only had a five minute wait to be seated.  After being seated, our waitress promptly came and took our drink order.  We ordered two appetizers: Seaweed Salad and Takoyaki (fried octopus balls),  We also ordered the Jinya Tonkotsu Black with an extra egg and the Cha Cha Cha with hot chili oil.  Our appetizers came out quickly and were hot and tasty.  Our soups appeared shortly afterwards and were hot and correctly prepared. I love the silky texture of the broth in the Tonkotsu Black -- the perfect soup for a cold winter day.
