Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My best friend and I came here to have brunch to celebrate my 31st birthday. We had never been here before and wanted to try something new. As soon as I walked in, I saw the live music playing great acoustic songs. Then I ordered a Rose' Bellini to quench my pallet. The brunch menu is delightful with lots of different options. Our server Terry, made sure I understood my options and offered his assistance. He was quick to bring out our drinks and was right there when we needed a refill. Terry brought out food out quickly; my friend had the Chorizo Benedict while I enjoyed the Chilaquiles. The food was wonderful, the drinks were perfect for the summer heat, the music was quaint, but the service by Terry was top notch. You will never go thirsty or hungry while he is taking care of you. Overall, a wonderful experience for a trendy brunch.
