Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I would say this was definitely worth the hour and a half wait for brunch. The food was absolutely wonderful and the mimosas were on point. I'm a huge fan of pancakes and there choices are just so much to choose from. I would say order a couple of items when coming here because I'm warning you now it's all worth it.
