Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If the food and coffee weren't great, I'd probably be giving 2 stars for service.  Their organization could use some work.  They give you a number to take to your table, but the staff go around asking people if what they're carrying is what they ordered.  It took quite some time for our food to come (for two), and the coffee even later.  The waiter was anxious to take away the number even though many parties were still waiting on items.  It was overall very disorganized - you could tell the staff was stressed.
