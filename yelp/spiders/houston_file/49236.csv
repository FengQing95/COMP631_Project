Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Getting to the food... the selection is immense, which will add to the time until you're able to eat if you cannot decide quickly. Once you decide what you want out of their many selections of eggs benedicts, pancakes, and breakfast pot pies (one of my favorite items to get here), then you have to wait another 15 minutes or more for your food. But everything is reasonably priced for a sit-down brunch place, and is very good quality and large portions.
