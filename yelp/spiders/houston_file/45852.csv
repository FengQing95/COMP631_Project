Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I had been hearing for years about how awesome Common Bond is.  I finally went with a friend who was visiting from out of town. The pastries are beautiful and delicious.  We ordered lunch sandwiches and went to find a table to wait for our food.  The tables had been cleared, but not wiped down. I approached the manager and asked if he could get someone to wipe our table before lunch was delivered.  He was very dismissive of my request and proceeded to completely ignore us.  Our food arrived, to an unwiped table.  We ate, and the sandwiches were good, but the attitude of the manager royally pissed me off.  It is not inexpensive to eat there, and we even tipped on the total.  I will likely not return, at least to this particular location.  For someone like me who has been in the foodservice hospitality industry for 30 years, this manager's disdain and crappy attitude is unconscionable.  Do your job.
