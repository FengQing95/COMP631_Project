Uchi////My favorites include the Hama Chill (yellow tail with ponzu and thai chili's and oranges), the Machi Cure (smoked yellow tail, yucca crisps, almonds asian pear, and garlic brittle), Brussel sprouts (crispy w/lemon chili). I also like the hot rock wagyu beef [not really unique here, but good], and the brie ringo (fried brie, apple chutney, and sweet potato crisp.. different). The sushi selection is really good and fresh, with reasonable cuts of fish. For dessert, I recommend (Im sure everyone else does as well) the Fried Milk, and also the Lime Ash Sorbet.
