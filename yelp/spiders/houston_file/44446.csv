Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Hazelnut brioche: So rich and chocolate-y; as a serious chocolate lover, this hit the spot. The chocolate is so incredibly creamy and is what I imagine love tastes like. There are these little balls of unidentified crunchiness (maybe rice crispies?) that provided a nice contrast to the smoothness of the chocolate. However, the brioche tasted a little bit dry.
