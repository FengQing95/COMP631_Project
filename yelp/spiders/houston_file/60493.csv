Baby Barnaby's////This past Sunday, though, we were unlucky enough to be looked after someone new (I think by the name of Ana). She was pretty inconsiderate, and really ought to be working in fast food. Another Yelp-er seems to have had a similar experience on November 2nd (so I guess it wasn't anything personal). I hope she's not around the next time I visit, at which point I look forward to jacking the rating up to the 5 that this place deserves.
