Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Everything here that I've gotten so far is worth getting. Brunch? check. Macarons? check. Desserts? check. It's always so packed but if you can manage to find a seat you'll enjoy every second of it. It's also in a great location for a break during some thrifting/antiquing, but be prepared for lines on weekends! Overall though, still love this place- I'd consider it one of my staples.
