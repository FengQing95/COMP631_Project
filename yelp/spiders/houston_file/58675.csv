Baby Barnaby's////In my personal opinion,  this is the best breakfast in Houston.  My friends and I are regulars and visit at least 2 times a week. I've probably eaten everything on the menu,  and have even had custom meals made on a few occasions. The staff is always friendly and the food comes out fast.  If you go on the weekend, expect a crowd. It gets pretty busy, but well worth the wait.
