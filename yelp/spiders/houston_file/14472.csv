JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////However she told our server and she was very helpful and immediately helped her pick a different one. This time it was the garlic ramen which was much better than the first one she got and also better than my black ramen. It was also hot so my guess is the first ramen sat around waiting for the appetizers and that's why it got cold.
