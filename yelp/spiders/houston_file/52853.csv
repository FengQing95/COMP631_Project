Kata Robata////Love this place, I have been there twice, once last year when I was in town to visit family and again about a week ago when i was down visiting those same family members.  This time I had the New Zealand Salmon  Sashimi and the Blue Fin Sashimi, both were amazing.  The blue fin especially melted in my mouth.  I also had the Pork Belly and Kobe Beef Skewers, super tender texture and great flavor.  I highly recommend this restaurant.
