Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Can't say enough about this place! Sophisticated hip, trendy with a little Htown edge! I'm sure a group full of ladies can be a handful but Terry just joined the party and made us feel like we were his only table! My meal came about 7 minutes after everyone else's but a manager quickly came over to apologize and offered me a free cocktail before I could even complain! I also ordered Terrys recommendation of the Blood orange cocktail but it just wasn't for me and he quickly replaced it. Food was to perfection, cocktails on point and superior customer service! It is a tad pricier than most but after my experience, it is absolutely justified. I wonder if the same DJ is there for Saturday's as well bc he did not play one bad song! And Terry, just amazing. I truly believe that a waiter can make or break your entire experience, especially when you're trying to enjoy a night away from the kids. For any future visits, I will always ask for Terry and can't wait to return for date night with the hubby...I hope the service and reputation of this place will never be compromised as the years go by!
