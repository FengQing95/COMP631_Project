Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was good. I had the bravocado toast and I really liked it but it was not above average. I also tried the pancake sampler and out of the 3, my favorite was the sweet potato one. As for drinks, I'm not a fan of vodka but I was hungover and ordered a Bloody Mary, but then I saw they have a Bloody Maria, which has tequila instead of vodka so I ordered that instead and it was bomb. Definitely recommend this place for brunch. It just gets really busy and the wait time is long so if you can, get on the waitlist on Yelp ahead of time
