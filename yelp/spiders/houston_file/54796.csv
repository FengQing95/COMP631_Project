Kata Robata////Walking up to this strip mall restaurant you would not have any idea. The decor is very nice but not over the top. Sat at the sushi bar and it was a great choice. They have some fish I had not had. The sushi bar is a great place to learn about some high end fish. Highly recommend it but make sure you are ready to shell out it's not cheap but worth it.
