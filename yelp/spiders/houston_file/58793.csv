Baby Barnaby's////The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly, with bright colors and cozy booths and tables. The portions are generous, and the price is right, you definitely get a quality breakfast. Any time we're up for breakfast in the morning (we like it any time!), Baby Barnaby's will be our first choice.
