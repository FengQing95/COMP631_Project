Kata Robata////Handroll kit is awesome and a pretty good deal. You get lots of fish and a ton of accompaniments - spicy mayo, masago, panko, sesame seeds, cucumber, jalapeno, half an avocado...(wish we had more spicy mayo and masago though). Also 2x miso soups. Â Plus it comes with toro in the kit, which was soooo delicious. So much food. Fish quality was amazing.
