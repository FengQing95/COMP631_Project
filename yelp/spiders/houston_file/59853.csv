Baby Barnaby's////I found hair in the most horrible, dry pancakes I've ever had. If that's not disgusting enough, the somewhat rank, damp seats and sticky tables should finish it off for you. I have no idea how this place is so well rated. Please, if you're coerced into dining here, your future self will thank you for not ordering the pancakes. And hopefully you don't have the pleasure of pulling long curly hairs out of your food. Yelp has never led me this badly astray.
