Kata Robata////Their menu on the first page had daily specials and we decided to try out their Hokkaido scallop sushi. It came with a big piece of scallop and was so soft and buttery! We also shared the sushi platter which came with 10 pieces of sushi and a side of your choice of tuna or salmon roll. The platter had a great variety of the chefs pick and was all very fresh and delicious. We especially liked the otoro, yellowtail, unagi, and ikura!
