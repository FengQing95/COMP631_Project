JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Vi - Thank you for the 5-star review. We greatly appreciate it. I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen, though I would like to make a point of clarity: We do charge for extra noodles. But I'm pleased to know you received good service during your visit, and we hope you'll come back again soon.
