Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I am in LOVE with this place! A friend and I had lunch there and everything was perfect! Love the diner feel when you walk in. It's a self sustained establishment so everything is recycled, paper straws (you must ask for one), food is composted etc etc. We had the most adorable server...shout out to Gabriel! We love you! But before I give him all the praises on the awesome recommendations I need to tell you what we ordered! It was super hard to decide what to get! Benedict? Coffee? Mimosas? Pancakes!? We finally decided on the Shrimp & Grits and my friend ordered a Barbacoa eggs Benedict which was also amazing! But we actually got to sample the pineapple pancakes with chocolate butter and Wowzers! Those were off the chain! To top it off I ordered a Chai coffee rum drink and Gabriel warned me it would have a kick to it. I had to sip it slow! Lol I will be back to try more stuff off the menu like the pretzel bread sandwich and Cubano YUM!!! It's much different than the one in Orange County. All local grown stuff and local farmer supported. Snooze rocks wherever you go!
