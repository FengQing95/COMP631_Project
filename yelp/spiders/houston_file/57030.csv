Kata Robata////There was no wait for Saturday lunch and we were seated immediately upon walking in. We only went for the Nagasaki noodle and ordered right away! The broth was on point, with so many different kinds of seafood and chashu being mixed together, it was so savory and full of flavor. (Note that they also put a lot of ginger in the noodle, so if you don't like the taste of it, ask for it to be taken out when you order). The noodle was cooked perfectly and everything was perfect, except for its portion.
