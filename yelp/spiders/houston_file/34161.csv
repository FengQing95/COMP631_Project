Local Foods////I think I found another place to take my money! Everyone I know seems to have a good opinion on Local Foods, and it looks like I will add to the general positive opinion. I never got the chance to try until today, and I did enjoy my sandwich a lot. This is a sandwich place, but the sandwiches are each unique in their aspect. Freshness is what it sells, and it does this well.
