Kata Robata////Of all of these options, the shumai, octopus, and Rising Sun roll clearly stood out. The shumai were served in 3 big spoons with a marrow oil base and chili oil on top. This was one of the heavier dishes, but tasted decadent, rich, and bold. The octopus had a great sear with hearty oyster mushrooms and tasted almost like a meat protein. They were salted really well and had a nice mayo-based sauce underneath. Lastly, the quality of the tuna on my sushi roll was incredible. The tuna also had a good sear, and flavored with a fragrant and light truffle vinaigrette. This combined with the yellow tailed fish and avocado made for one of the best rolls I've had in my life. The cod was flaky, buttery, but fresh, and deserves an honorable mention too.
