JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love JINYA. I'm originally from LA and this place is a little bit of home for me. I LOVE the Tonkotsu Black and the shrimp appetizers. I've been here twice with one or two friends. I also went with a group of about 10 people. The staff was great, accommodated us in a timely manner and took great care of us and our orders. (Keep in mind I didn't just drop 10 people on them. I gave them fair warning an hour out so that's part of why things went smoothly.)
