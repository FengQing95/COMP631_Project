Local Foods////I love the falfel sandwich, and dare I say it's better than some falfel's that I get from Middle Eastern places. It's on toasted wheat bread topped with pickled shallots(I think, whatever it is, it's good), pickles, and a yogurt sauce. Heaven. It comes with two sides or a cup of soup. I like the kale salad and beets. I've also tried the orzo, it's not my fave, but I do like the cabbage slaw which has an asian flare to it as it has peanut sauce. I've also tried out the chicken soup which is coconut based and it has lemon grass in it which makes it refreshing, perfect for this chillier weather.
