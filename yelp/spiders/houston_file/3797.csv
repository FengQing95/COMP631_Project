JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Michael - Thanks for your review. I regret that we don't have more gluten-free options. However, I have been informed by our corporate headquarters that they are working on a gluten-free ramen, and we will surely make a big announcement if and when that comes to fruition. Otherwise, we appreciate your understanding.
