Uchi////After hearing all the hype about this place I had to come see what it was about. I visited here for dinner and may I say that it was a total disappointment.  As with Jessie V.'s review, I felt that it was nothing special.  If you want to have sushi at another level then you should visit Nobu's.  I'm giving a two star rating for the nice staff and decoration.
