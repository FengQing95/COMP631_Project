JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For my ramen I added spicy sauce and an extra seasoned egg and im super glad that I did since this is one of very few places that actually SEASON the egg lol. also the texture of everything from the noodles to the egg was absolute perfection - the eggs had the perfect amount of yolk ooze!
