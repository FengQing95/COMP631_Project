Uchi////We had to wait about 3 hours before we got seated. I know I didn't have a reservation and shouldn't be complaining about the wait but when I called and asked, why not tell me over the phone that I should expect to wait three hours? I tried to get there as early as we could thinking that the earlier we get there would be better than later on a weekend. If I had been told by the hostess that if you don't have reservation you will have to wait until all the people with reservations are seated first then we would have come closer to 9:00 or 10:00 p.m.
