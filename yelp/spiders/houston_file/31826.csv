Local Foods////This is probably my favorite sandwich shop in Houston hands down. All the ingredients used are delicious and I don't think I've ever had a sandwich here that tasted bad. My favorite sandwiches by far are probably the crunchy chicken and the salt and pepper roast beef. I always find myself ordering those when I go. I really like all of the sides I've had also. The kale, quinoa, and the beers are my typical go tos for my sides. I like the fact that they have craft beers also. There's also this one drink they have that they keep in a dispenser which is like a mint orange drink if I'm not mistaken. It's DELICIOUS. I've tasted various other sandwiches off of friends and family when I've gone and all of those were also great. This is a place if totally take someone to get a real sandwich!
