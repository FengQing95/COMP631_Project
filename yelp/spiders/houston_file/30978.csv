The Pit Room////I've heard about this place many a time. We stopped in on a whim and ordered a little bit of everything. The brisket Â is my fave, it's tender and moist w/ a great char on the edges. They also have a bar next door called The Patio, I believe, where you can drink and have them send your food over, too. We'll be back!
