Kata Robata////As soon as we walked in we were cheerfully greeted and seated right away since the place had almost no one there. Right as we were seated our water glasses were filled. We looked around and loved the atmosphere of the place. I really liked the different types of tables so that you are able to choose, Like tall tables near the bar, booths and tables with chairs. The design also is really nice and modern but not cold. Time to look at the menu.
