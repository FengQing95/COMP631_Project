Baby Barnaby's////The breakfast here is phenomenal. My friends went back the very next day. In comparison to the wait at most breakfast places in the same area you can't beat it. I was afraid it was because the food was somehow inferior but that's definitely not the case. The staff make you feel at home and I didn't try one thing I didn't like. Because I definitely ate off my husbands plate as well.
