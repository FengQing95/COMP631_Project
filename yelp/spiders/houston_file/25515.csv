Uchi////I come here pretty often and my expectations are always exceeded. However, I came during the day and the food was so lackluster... everything's temperature was off. Hot foods weren't hot enough. The pistachio desert was awful,  sorbet tasted like straight vinegar and the cake was dry.. first desert I've had here that I did not like. This is my favorite restaurant but the food was just off.. not sure if it's because it's morning shift and the chefs aren't as knowledgeable or what ‍
