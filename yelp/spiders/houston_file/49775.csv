Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Big spacious place with a huge patio. There service was on point. They have a private parking lot but it's too small so look for the street parking instead. We had a wait time of 30 min on a weekday but they called us sooner. There food is yummylicious. Their French toast is to die for. It is a must try. The quantity of the food is so worth the price. We had ordered orange juice and it was so fresh. Their burrito is so unlike others. It was so good with omelettes and fried hash browns. The food overall was very filling and was completely worth the price. Highly recommend this place to everyone.
