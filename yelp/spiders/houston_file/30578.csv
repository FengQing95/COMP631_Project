The Pit Room////I come here with my family almost every time they come visit Houston. This time they had the wagyu special and it was good (little fatty for me but I think that's just how that cut is). I also got the chili for the first time and it was flavorful but a bit too oily and kinda overpriced for the serving size. I an a potato salad fiend, and I really like their potato salad and macaroni sides. Sausage is good too. They give so much barbecue sauce
