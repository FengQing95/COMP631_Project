Baby Barnaby's////One of my favorite places to go for breakfast in Houston.  Last time we went I tried their Pumpkin seasonal pancake, and it was definitely one of the best pancakes I've ever eaten, not to mention the largest.  The service has been outstanding every time I've gone.  The waffles are always good as well, and I can always be amused for a while watching their amazing Rube Goldberg-esque juicing machine.
