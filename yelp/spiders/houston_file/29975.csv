The Pit Room////Been here about 3 times and I've never been disappointed. Came here during COVID and sat outside and the staff is incredibly helpful. Constantly cleaning down tables. But on to the food! The brisket can't be beat. Incredibly flavorful and moist. The pork ribs were also very good. I tasted my GF beef sausage and that was also very good. The BBQ sauce hit different, a bit of sweet with a tinge of tangy that supplements the meats well. For sides, I really enjoyed the elote (being from LA it brought some nostalgia) and the potato salad was good. They give you pickles and jalepe√±os on the side. I'm not a fan of pickles but these pickles have changed my mind!
