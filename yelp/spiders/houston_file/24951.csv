Uchi////I'm still tingling from the wagu beef and the fatty toro which melt in the body upon contact. Tradition has been whipped into the shape of futuristic risky flavors. Taking ordinary slices of fish into the outer rings of Saturn. With such combinations of sour, sweet and savory that sting your very soul, burning this pleasure into your memory for eternity. Various hands push and pull dishes in and out of this session silently disappearing into the abyss. The dance of service was graceful like a Parisian ballerina whirling and twirling. We had a front row seat at the bar of Benito bondage from which I did not wish to ever escape from. No safe words needed. Uchi virgin alert! Ginger, soy and wasabi available upon request, if you behave yourself. I was being very bad. Shhhhhhhh! Just eat.
