Local Foods////Local foods is one of my go-to spots when I'm craving something fresh and healthy! I love that all of their salads and sandwiches are full of super unique, flavorful combinations of ingredients. I also love how you can turn any sandwich into a salad - I almost always get the garden sammie as a salad, which is literally one of my favorite things I've eaten in Houston.
