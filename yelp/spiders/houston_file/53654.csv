Kata Robata////The problem was the server, Evan. He first forgot my uni and put in a few orders wrong, including my bf's hand roll. The kicker came when he charged $126 to me for ANOTHER bill! So guess whose account this morning has TWO pending Kata Robata charges that have yet to be sorted out resulting in my account being too low to pay some bills and do groceries. Awful.
