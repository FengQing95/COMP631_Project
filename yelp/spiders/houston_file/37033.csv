Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////So I came here for the first time for HRW, and I was disappointed. I had the crab pasta which was good but lacked seasoning. I got the brownie for dessert and it was cold. I was expecting the brownie to be hot since it had ice cream too. I have heard great things about Bosscat and was let down.
