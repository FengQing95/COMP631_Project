JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My significant other and I have decided to start coming here atleast once a week. This week we took my mother and she loved it as much as we did. My first trip I ordered the spicy chicken ramen and the second time I got the same thing except with spicy pork. My s/o refuses to order anything except the goku because of their tender brisket. Amazingly, It literally fell apart when he picked it up with the chop sticks. I'm hesitant in trying new things but this was definitely a fun experience.
