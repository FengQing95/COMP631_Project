The Pit Room////love that its open late!  friendly and diverse staff made me feel comfortable.  bbq sauce is decent, wish it were thicker.  stay away from the cole-slaw, i found a hair in mine.  not to worry, staff reimbursed me the price of the sides.  good place, fair place.  i will be back again.
