Kata Robata////We went for HH on a Â Friday and got lucky enough to snag a table for 4. The ambience is very very nice. The HH selections were very diverse. We chose the kobe baos. Which was very delicious. They have a few rolls on for HH. Cocktails $11 and under for $6. Bartender is very generous on the alcohol cause those drinks were strong. We also ordered 8 sets of sake bombs because they have a very good deal.
