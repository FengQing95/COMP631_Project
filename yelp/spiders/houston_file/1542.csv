JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Let's get one thing straight: the food is not why this is getting three stars. Every bowl of ramen I've ever had here was to die for!! However...the staff can be kind of rude and judgemental. I always feel like I'm going into a hipster coffee shop when I sit down because it always feels like the servers are rolling their eyes in their head every time I speak. And also the prices are a little hiked as far as ramen in the city goes, but it's in midtown so that's not a huge surprise. I'd still say go for the experience~!
