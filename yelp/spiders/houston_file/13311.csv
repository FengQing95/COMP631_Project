JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Kemi - Thanks for your review. Thursdays and Fridays do tend to be some of our busier nights, and wait times can and have extended upwards of two hours at peak. So while I am pleased we were able to seat you quickly, I do regret that you felt rushed in any way. I remind our front to slow things down a bit, especially when the dining room (and the waiting list) fills up; however, I would add that our servers operate with the assumption that guests have been waiting in the foyer or outside the venue for at least 20 minutes, so they're hungry and ready to eat !
