Local Foods////Hands down one of my favorite places to eat in all of Houston. I'm seriously addicted to their Crunchy Chicken sandwich, every bite is a mouthful of awesomeness. The pretzel bun is a delicious compliment to the tender chicken, cucumbers, crunchy spread (not sure what this is and too lazy to google it, sorry yelpers), and ranch that's enclosed inside. I typically hate ranch but I had no idea it was even in the sandwich until recently. Lol. The sandwich is just simply amazing, a must try. I took my picky family here recently and for once my mom said "great choice, I loved it!" Lol, I've been waiting for that statement for 25 years!! They loved their buhn mi sandwich (sorry for spelling?), noodles and soup. My personal favorite is the vegan chili (not the gumbo-the chili is seasonal). In any case, all their soups are bomb! The management is also great, I mistakenly asked for the vegan gumbo thinking it was the chili (it wasn't bad it just wasn't what I was expecting) and the manager didn't hesitate to swap it out for another soup. Y'all are the real MVPs lol! Â CRUNCHY CHICKEN IS LIFE.
