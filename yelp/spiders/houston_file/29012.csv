The Pit Room////The first restaurant (in houston) that comes to mind when people crave bbq is probably Killen's, but for us inner loopers... it's far and there's always a ridiculous wait. Having said that, I think it draws the touristy crowd or the "once in a blue moon" venturers (is that even a word?). Anyway, I found a spot that satisfies my craving, that's trendy and pretty darn good. Disclaimer, though, I would never call myself a BBQ expert. I'm just a gal with a simple palette who loves food. Everything you see in the pic was delish.
