JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love this place! Hate the wait on the weekends, but totally worth the wait! They have a pretty good beer selection. If its just you having a bite to eat, the bar is the perfect place to eat. If you run out of noodles, just ask for more and they will order it for you st no additional cost. Everyone that works there is nice and explains the menu well just in case you are feeling a bit adventurous and want to try something new.
