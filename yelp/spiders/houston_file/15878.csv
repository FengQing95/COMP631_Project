JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya Buns omg my taste buds exploded! I'm officially addicted to them. We ordered take out from here and it was not bad. I got crispy chicken which was Eh. We also got some Gyoza and sticky rice. My boyfriend literally just got multiple Jinya Buns as his meal... we tried coming here on a Saturday night at 8 and it was an hour and a half wait. Good Luck getting in on weekends!
