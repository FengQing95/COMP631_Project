Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Had the Benny Duo, which was excellent. Only reason not 5 stars is the wait time, with the bus time and seating a new party was longer than should need to be. More than 15 minutes at several tables. We were told 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hour wait, and were seated in 1-1/4 hours, which gave us plenty of time to observe turnover.
