Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze was nothing short of delicious.We came on a Monday and we had to wait around 30 minutes to be seated and about 20 more minutes to actually receive the food, but when it came oh my! I had the Benny duo where you get to select two of the eggs Benedict off the menu to try. I got the classic ham and the Bella. The hollandaise sauce they use here at Snooze is to die for. Eggs Benedict is my favorite breakfast food and they definitely did my favorite food justice. The bella had an overwhelming smell of balsamic but believe me it was perfectly balanced. My partner had the breakfast pot pie and the rosemary sausage gravy was heavenly! The hash browns were a bit bland but I prefer the natural taste of potato. I can't wait to come back! I'll have to add this place to my weekly rotation.
