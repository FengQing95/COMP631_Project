Local Foods////Having been invited by the Justice League of Houston Yelp*, I was a bit wary of this very shiny and trendy place in the Rice Village.  Sure, it has been around for a few years now but, as I get older, I think places need to last longer before I'll give it the time of day.  (I think I'm up to a minimum 10-year existence period now. Kidding!)
