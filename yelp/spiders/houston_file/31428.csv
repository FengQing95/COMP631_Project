Local Foods////My 9yo latched on to the Thai-inspired lemongrass soup, and my husband asked for a sample to ensure he (and the other kids) would like it before ordering a full bowl.  The employees were happy to give us samples big enough for everyone to taste it, and we all fell in love with the delicious, creamy, soup.  They also let us know that they have off-the-menu kids items - grilled cheese and PB&J.
