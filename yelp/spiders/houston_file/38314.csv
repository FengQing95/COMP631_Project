Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Some girlfriends/boyfriends and I came here for brunch where we had reservations. We decided to wait for our party before seating which was perfectly fine. Note, you can't bring in outside food/drinks but the hostess offered to hold my friend's tea at the front until our meal was over!
