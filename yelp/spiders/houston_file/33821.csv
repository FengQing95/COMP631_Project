Local Foods////BOMB what's not to like about this place. We literally have came back to this place 3 times. Fri-Sun-and now today Monday. Crunchy chicken sandwich with soba noodles and kale salad on Friday Slow BBQ pork on Sunday and then again today with the chicken sandwich with soba noodles and quinoa. My wife fell in love with the Chicken Pozole and black bean sandwich super delicious and amazing serving sizes. Definitely a must try!
