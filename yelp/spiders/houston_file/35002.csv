Local Foods////Whenever I am up in Houston if time permits, I try to hit a new restaurant. If I am by myself for some reason, it's usually a pretty simple place; if with my wife, we try something a little more exotic or requires a longer sit down meal. This place appealed to me by name recognition (friends had mentioned how much they like it), a quick sandwich fare, and good reviews on Yelp. I will try to come back again another time to try more of this menu. Looks good.
