JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jasmine - Thank you very much for the awesome review. I'm so glad to know you consider us a favorite. We are honored! And thank you, as well, for understanding our extended wait times during peak hours. We try to keep things moving at a steady clip without making anyone feel rushed. It's not always easy, but we strive to keep it balanced. Thank you again!
