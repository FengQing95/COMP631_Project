Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It's still a little chaotic at lunch but they'll get it together. It's new. A clean, white L.A.-smug bakery with the best croissants and baguettes in Houston if not all of the South. Not to mention the cookies and macarons and loaf bread and sandwiches and good dark coffee in white cups. It feels like a place on Abbot Kinney in Venice Beach except the aproned servers say "y'all." it's in Â a coffee ghetto with Brasil, Empire, and Agora all on the same block and four others close by. IMHO this place has the best coffee.
