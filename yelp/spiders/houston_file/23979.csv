Uchi////I only have one recommendation: be bold and take a risk! Don't come if you plan to be stingy, or if you are afraid of trying new things. If you are on a budget, go with a partner or a group of people so you can try more things! You need to spend money here and come in with an open mind to get the best of Uchi. After all, you will probably have to wait a while to be seated, so you want to make the most of it!
