The Pit Room////Surprised by the really high reviews. I didn't care for the sauce and the beef sausage didn't hold together well and didn't have great flavor. The potato salad was super gritty, and the mac and cheese super watery. The place is cute and convenient, but it just didn't live up to the hype.
