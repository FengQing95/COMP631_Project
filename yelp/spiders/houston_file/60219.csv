Baby Barnaby's////Monday, 10 am - my friend and I parked across the street, signed our name on the hanging list & waited on the patio about 10 minutes for our name to be called to enter. What a charming little restaurant it is! We had the best seat in the house to view the entire brightly lit room, which at max capacity can only hold 35 people.
