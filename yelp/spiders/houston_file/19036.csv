Uchi////During this whole ordeal, my girlfriend told me that she was disappointed that Uchi didn't do anything for my birthday. She told them when she called in the reservation and when we got there that night that it was my birthday. When we went in to address the non-ordered items, the management told us that if it's a birthday, they'll comp dessert or a non-dessert order, but they won't tell you that they'll comp it beforehand. Well, they did neither that night for us. Empty gesture.
