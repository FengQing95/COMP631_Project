Kata Robata////The food and atmosphere is great.  As a Japanese, I have recommended this restaurant in the past to other Japanese, as a place to find fusion along with authentic taste.  But with many other great restaurants in Houston to choose from, any restaurant should not forget to train all employees to focus on customer service, and that anyone can make mistakes and delays at times, but when they do, make sure to apologize and show courtesy and sincerity to service.
