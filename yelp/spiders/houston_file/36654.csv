Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place was awesome for brunch! We tried it before going back to Dallas on a Sunday, and the place had a great vibe. The DJ was awesome, and the food was great. We both had the Simple Burger, and my friend and I both agreed it was one of the best burgers we'd had in a while. We will definitely be back!
