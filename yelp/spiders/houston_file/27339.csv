The Pit Room////Good not great food, crazy expensive though. It would be 5 stars but for the food, ambiance, and price point did not align. I was very disappointed in my brisket and the beef rib was excellent. Sausage and pork were spot on. They should not pull brisket from the smoker early. Best to say it is sold out vs serving $hitty brisket to make money.
