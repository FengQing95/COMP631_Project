Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I was referred this place from a friend and it is amazing. I live in Spring but it is worth the 45 minute drive for their pistachio croissants. The most important quality to me for a bakery is consistency and Common Bond has it. I've been here about 10 times over the past year and every time I come I am blown away by how fresh and delicious all the food is. The place can get a little cramped from time to time but is very much worth it.
