Uchi////  When you order  once sat be prepared for small but beautifully executed plates to arrive but it isn't your typical sushi restaurant. I do suggest ordering a few items knowing this if you go with empty stomach. The server forgot one item for a member of our party but we just asked her to remove it from the tab and it was not an issue. Their mint chocolate dessert is delicious with little house made dip dots wrapped out a delicious meal. I look forward to returning with more friends or another family outing.
