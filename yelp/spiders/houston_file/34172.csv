The best thing, they finally brought back the original grapefruit mintade. They changed it to watermelon mintade for a year or so and although we liked it, the grapefruit is the best. The chips were also super fresh as well. If only they bring back the cabbage slaw from years back although we did enjoy the kale side as well. Great lunch as always.
