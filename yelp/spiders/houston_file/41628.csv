Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////2) Employee conduct. Working hipsters--get it together. I don't care if you look too cool to be in the place you are with those hats...you are working. Approach customers so they don't need to grab your attention. Explain wtf each item is and I don't care if there is a fancy word for chocolate or the ingredients, I need you to explain in layman's terms. Greet customers like you care and smile!! I arrived with my partner and not only were we ignored up to the cash register, but once an employee realized that these 2 other guys did not approach us and ask what we wanted, they had spent the time before talking about how much people needed to STOP coming in as it was close to closing time, to which, the employee sang a few words from "Closing Time" and then when they realized we were staring, then did they ask if we've been helped. Super special. Once again CHEFS--you come from where? Top notch restaurants? You have top notch specialty in your background that this is NOT your first rodeo, right? Because I am questioning.
