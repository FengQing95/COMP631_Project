Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The kitchen closes at 3p, so my hopes of getting a sandwich went downhill. You walk up to the 'counter' which is a long, bright, window-case of pastries, only we saw mostly blank space. They had sold out of almost everything, so we could only choose from 3 diff cookies, 2 chocolate 'cupcake/tart looking' items, and macaroons. I believe there were a few slices of cake left (these looked like those perfect square slices you find at a buffet dessert line...like at a resort or chinese restaurant...but they probably taste good). I couldn't help but notice a small, perfect rectangle of cheesecake was $6.95...no thanks.
