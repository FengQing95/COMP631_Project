Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I did not head the warnings of the wait times enough.  My suggestion is to put your name down for a table (they don't take reservations ahead of time), walk around the corner to the Blacksmith Cafe for pre-brunch/coffee/biscuits, or just anywhere else in the general area, while you wait for Snooze to text you that your table is ready.  They let people wait inside and by the bar, but there are so many people waiting there's no room; I waited in line at the bar and never got to the front; they have a small space outside with games as well, but I couldn't bear it in the Houston heat.
