Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The only negative thing about this place is that it is very trendy so it attracts a lot of inconsiderate and clueless people who do not feel like the rules of counter service apply to them and insist on using the entrances as exits. This restaurant could benefit from having a hostess to keep everything running smoothly like at Tiny Boxwoods.
