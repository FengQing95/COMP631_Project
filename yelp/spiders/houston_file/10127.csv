JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I opted for the tonkatsu assari. My broth was a normal thickness with thick noodles. I didn't have them spice up my ramen for me but they have tagarashi spice and other condiments to help flavor the broth to one's liking. I tried spicing it up for the right flavor but something was missing still. Overall, I liked the ramen and will likely try another the next time I visit.
