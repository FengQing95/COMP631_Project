Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've been craving "diner" breakfast food for weeks, but being from NYC/Boston, my idea of a diner style breakfast is pretty hard to come by. That said, I'm so pleased with Snooze.The interior is a retro, diner feel and their branding is excellent across the board throughout the whole place.
