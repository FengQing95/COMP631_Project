JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My first time here was not good. I thought it was just meh and the hype was too high. After the hype died down a little I have it another try and fell in love. I got the chicken wonton ramen and the fried chicken. SO GOOD. I came back again last night and got the same exact thing because I was craving it so bad. I'm not a pork fan so I'm so glad there's a place with chicken wontons. There are also so many sides to add on. The wait is LONG but worth it. The ambiance is really nice too. There is a bar and I've only had two of their drinks. I'm not very much of a drinker so i felt as if it was too strong for me, but maybe for someone else that does it'll be good. (:
