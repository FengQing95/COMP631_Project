Uchi////This is the best sushi restaurant in all of Houston! My boyfriend and I went for a late Valentine's Day/10 month anniversary dinner and had the best experience of our lives. Our waiter Nick was super attentive and knew exactly what we wanted before we knew we even wanted it ourselves. The Hokkaido uni was a definite must-try as well as the Wagyu hot rock plate. The satsuma sake cocktail is to die for as well! Nick also came through with a complimentary Fried Milk dessert and it was me and my boyfriend's favorite plate of the night! Please try this place, it is to die for!
