Kata Robata////It's the little things that make the difference. The sushi rice, soy sauce and wasabi at kata robata are all outstanding. The flavor of the soy sauce doesn't overpower the fish, you can feel the heat of just a little wasabi up your nostrils, and their sushi rice is the best I've ever tasted.
