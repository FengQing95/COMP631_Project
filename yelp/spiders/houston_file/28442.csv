The Pit Room////Had their BBQ catered to the office & it was so good that it encouraged me to visit the restaurant.  Parking is good since they have a few surrounding parking areas.  Seatings is adequate inside but they also have outside patio seatings.  My friends & I had the moist brisket sandwich, pork ribs, chopped beef sandwich with sides of Elotes, charred green beans, potato salad which were delicious.  The highlight was the pickled condiments bar which was so good & tasted fresh.  Will definitely return with the families.
