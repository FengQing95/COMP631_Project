Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The hostess. Walking up to the restaurant, I had some casual conversation with someone who turned out to be the hostess while she was sweeping away water due to the recent downpour of rain. I walked in and waited for someone to approach the hostess desk to be seated. Hostess comes inside and decides to take care of the folks who walked in behind me. Some advice: pay attention to your patrons. Fool me once, shame on you.
