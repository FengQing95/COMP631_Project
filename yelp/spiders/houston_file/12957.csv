JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jessica - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry you had to wait so long during your first visit to JINYA. Unfortunately, we do experience extended wait times during peak hours, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. And in hindsight, had we known the impact authentic Japanese ramen would have on the Houston market, we probably would have sought a much larger space. But there's an old saying in the food-service industry: "There's no such thing as a perfect restaurant." So we try to do our best with what we have.
