The Pit Room////It's all about the food! The brisket was PERFECT. The Venison sausage something special. Pork ribs... very nice. Beans GREAT. Okra side as good as it gets. The cafeteria style service... you order and get your food on the fly was sort of disappointing at first... then I realized wow we got our food FAST. They have a good system in place. Friendly folks who know there stuff. Nice beer selection. I only not going five stars because of the space it's in. It's an odd not very comfortable space... overly lit and oddly laid out. In light of how good and reasonable the food is... it's a minor complaint!
