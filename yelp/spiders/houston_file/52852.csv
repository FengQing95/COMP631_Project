Kata Robata////We know one of the bartenders here so he was able to direct us towards the delicious food this restaurant has to offer. Â We ate a variety of foods from their menu and were very happy with our food. The pork belly rolls and Kobe beef skewers ate realllly good. As far as rolls go we ate the soft crab and salmon and crunchy eel roll they were awesome!! Definitely will be returning :)
