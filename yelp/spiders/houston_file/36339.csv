Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////But I would encourage you to STAY FAR AWAY from the $32 bottomless mimosas 'deal' that includes one brunch entree. My friends might well have gone into diabetic shock before catching anything close to a buzz as the so-called 'mimosas' were PURE ORANGE JUICE (no bubbly at all!) and for which we had to approach the bar to refill time and time again because the staff was short. After about 20-30 glasses of alcohol-free 'mimosas', we ended up having to order bottles of wine, which only added to the insanely ridiculous price tag of the low-par brunch. (Be sure to check in on Yelp for a 10% discount on your bill, which they will probably forget to discount, as they did with our party until we repeatedly reminded them).
