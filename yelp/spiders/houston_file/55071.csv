Kata Robata////I got there and it was a retail center joint, nothing special. Then the good came and I was flabbergasted at the quality. The unique mixes of taste and the preservation of traditional dishes with a spin of Asian fusion. The service was amazing but the food put it on the top of my sushi restaurants in Texas.
