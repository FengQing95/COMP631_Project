Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place was amazing! My husband and I were looking for a brunch place to try and even though we had to wait almost an hour to sit down, it was well worth it! The variety of food and the different types of pancakes were amazing! Our waiter was nice and attentive. He even made suggestions for what we should try since it was our first time. It is a must try! We will definitely be coming back again
