The Pit Room////If you search for the best BBQ in Houston, the Pit Room routinely finds itself near or at the top of most lists.  I finally decided to make the drive and check it out yesterday.  We got there right around noon on a Tuesday.  There were lots of people inside, but service moved fast and we ordered in a few minutes.
