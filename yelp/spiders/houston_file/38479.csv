Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great food and ambiance but Terry along with all of the staff truly made the experience! Very unique drinks, the bosslady was superb, it features elderberry! We ordered the cornbread madeleines, spicy chicken, pork hush puppies and portobello fries, which were all delicious. Great unique flavors and varied selection. Will be back for brunch!
