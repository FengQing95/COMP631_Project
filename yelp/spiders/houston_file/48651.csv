Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Don't Snooze on the Snooze, lol Really good food! My brother and I went here after a meeting and we had brunch, whoa, buddy so good. I had the cinnful pancakes with bacon, mmmm. Melts in your mouth and not in your hand. The best pancakes that I have had in a very long time and the bacon was exactly the way I like my bacon, crispy, a little greasy, and crunchy. I ate really good when we went here and I will be back again. I would have givem them five stars but the wait was long.
