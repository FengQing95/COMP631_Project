The Pit Room////I've had the opportunity to try some pretty darn good BBQ in the past year, and I gotta say that The Pit Room definitely will be one of those spots to remember. On our short trip to Houston over the weekend, this one was on our radar to check out since it was just a quick Uber ride from our hotel. We definitely did not leave here disappointed!
