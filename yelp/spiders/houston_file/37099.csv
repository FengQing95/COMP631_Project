Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Tried this place out, very nice layout and very cool atmosphere. It looks like part restaurant and part lounge. Everyone was very friendly from the guy who greeted you when you first walked up and opened the door to the hostess, the server and one of the owners that walks around greeting everyone asking how things are which I thought was very nice. Â I had the simple burger and the bosscat fries. The fries do not come with the burger they are separate. They are huge thick cut fries my friend and I easily could have shared them which is what I should have done because I couldn't finish mine. Burger was really good cooked how I like it well done but still nice and juicy.
