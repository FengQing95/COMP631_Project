Kata Robata////In its sushi selection, Kata Robata seems to focus on the fancy rolls. Fine, some people like jalapenos and guacamole and fried things in their rolls, I get it. But its easy to make something taste good when its doused in mayo. And the rice to fish ratio of the rolls was a bit off, especially given that the rolls were priced from about $13-16 (sometimes for only five pieces).
