Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We have also gotten various pastries to go.  These, admittedly, are very pretty, almost as pretty as those boxes they come in.  They are, unlike the savories, mostly decent, but they universally suffer from "Everything is bigger in Texas" syndrome.   Let's get real.  As everyone knows, only the center of a sticky bun is any good at all, so Common Bond's, which probably has its own gravitational pull but consists mostly of yeasted dough, is merely meh-average.  The almond croissant doesn't have enough frangipane to ensure a good sweetness to crumb ratio.  Similar issues with the brioche and the kouign amann.  The law of diminishing returns sets in pretty quickly with these pastries, somewhere near the 50% mark.
