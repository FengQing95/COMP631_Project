Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Cheers to that. Ordered the cornbread medallions. Very yummy! Here is the thing they say that it's served room temp but they was cold. Still good. Excuse given was because they don't want to serve them dry. So hint, they are pre made! I would rather them say it takes how ever many minutes to cook so they could be served HOT! I would wait because if they would serve them HOT these things would be the BOMB!!! The spread that comes with it would melt as soon as it touches the cornbread but it's still a great combo!! The Brussel sprouts were delicious! We ordered with no bacon and they were yum yum yum!!! Next was the bourbon chicken flatbread. It was tasty but honestly it was served luke warm. I Â wanna try their brunch menu!!!
