Uchi////Came here when it first opened, and it was so hard to get reservations but we managed to get one.  While we were waiting for our table, along with a lot of other people, and were given samples to eat which was nice since we were pretty hungry.  When it was our turn, we were seated at the sushi bar.  I suggest if you're a party of two, try to sit here!  It really gives you a completely different experience.  We had a view of the kitchen and was able to watch the chefs work their magic.
