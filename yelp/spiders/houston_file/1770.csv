JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is ok. Maybe it's just my imagination but it seemed a little too much MSG for my tastes - and I like ramen! Ramen is ok on Houston standards, too much umami and overpriced on mine. Watch out for the $7 beers. $50 for two ramens and two drinks? Guess they have to pay rent too.
