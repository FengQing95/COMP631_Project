JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Sameet - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry you weren't overly pleased with our Spicy Vegan Ramen. It's possible the ramen chef made a mistake in preparation, but regardless, if you're ever dissatisfied with any of our food for any reason, just let your server know and he or she will make it right. We do hope you'll come through and try another bowl, as we would hate to be judged by just one dish.
