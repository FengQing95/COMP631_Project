Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So disappointed. Comparable to a college cafeteria.  Loud, dirty, in your face phony smiling staff. Dirty, torn menus and very slow kitchen. All this at 1030 weekday. Parking nightmare. Speciality sweet potato pancakes were so heavy they could sink a small ship.  Heavy with a caramel syrup and candied nuts. Death by sugar.
