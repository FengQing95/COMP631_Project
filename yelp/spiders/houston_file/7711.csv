JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love this ramen bar. I went during early lunch today and it wasn't a long wait. I was sorted quickly and served quickly. My server was very nice and left me to my business before bringing out my food. I had the chicken ramen with garlic on the side and it was heavenly. Just what I need to finish off my week. I'll be back soon!
