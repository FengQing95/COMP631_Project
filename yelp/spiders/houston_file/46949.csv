Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Superior grub at an excellent value.  Sure, the wait can be excessive. But that's bc, as I may have mentioned, it's superior grub at an excellent value. I have waited much longer for much less delish. If you're truly committed--show up pre-7:30am and avoid the wait altogether.  We will be back--next time at 6:31am.
