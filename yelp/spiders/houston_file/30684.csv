The Pit Room////Ordering was easy since there was a team of staff assigned to different portions of the meal. First person asked about the meat choice, next person asks about sides and the last takes the payment. I got the turkey, green beans and potato salad. A meal is amazing when I enjoy everything and I definitely did. The turkey had a nice smoky flavor and was moist and tender. The potato salad was mustard based, seasoned well and tasty. The green beans might've been my favorite - they had a smoky bbq flavor and came with saut√©ed onions. Although the onions were a little salty, everything tasted great.
