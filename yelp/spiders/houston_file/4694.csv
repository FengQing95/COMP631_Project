JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Probably my favorite ramen that I've tried so far, broth was excellent- flavorful and thick but not cloying. I surprised to find the restaurant full at midnight on a Friday night, but we were sat right away at a communal table (probably the only detractor in the experience, it being so loud and everyone else being so close). We also got the agedashi tofu (bland and not worth it) and the takoyaki (excellent, they were soft and the octopus was tender). Service was quick and efficient. Overall it was a great experience and Ill be back for more ramen.
