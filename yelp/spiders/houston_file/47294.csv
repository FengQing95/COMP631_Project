Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze never lets us down. Beware there is ALWAYS a wait, but it's all good--You can grab a drink at the bar or hang out outside. I've been here a handful of times and the food is always good BUT their pancakes is what truly separates them from other breakfast/ brunch stops in the area. Be sure to try a pancake flight so you can try 3 of whichever pancakes/French toast you choose. Also be sure to ask your waiter what pancakes or French toast aren't featured on the menu. The drunken monkey French toast (chocolate banana) is amazing but is seasonal, and the Blueberry Danish pancakes are great as well.
