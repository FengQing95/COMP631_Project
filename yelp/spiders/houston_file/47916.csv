Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////After hearing about this place from multiple people, I decided to take the plunge and try this place out knowing that there is always a wait. I figured it HAD to be excellent for there always to be a long wait. To my disappointment, this place is mediocre at best. The service is seriously lacking, took almost 10 minutes to be acknowledged and order drinks from the waiter. The food came out at a decent time but I felt like we waited a while for the waiter to come back and refill our drinks. I ordered the pancake flight and it was not impressive at all. The pancakes were very chewy and did not taste fresh. They tasted as if they had been sitting under a heat lamp all morning. Inside is loud with so many people since it is a pretty decent size establishment. The parking lot is tiny so more than likely you will have to find parking along the street.
