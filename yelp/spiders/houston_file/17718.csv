Uchi////I went on a date here last night and I must say that this place is more of a social restaurant where you come with tons of friends. It was a little crowded, the staff kept bumping into our empty chairs. I love the decor - lots of earth tones and lots of different uses of wood. Â Again, I don't know why they skimp out on the bathroom design - it's clean but isn't as fancy as the rest or the restaurant. We had a reservation at 6:30pm on a Tuesday night. We arrived a bit early and got seated right away. The service was amazing!!! Everyone was so nice, since it was our first time there they explained how to eat the dishes. I tried every ingredient on their own and then put them together. Even the valet guys did an amazing job!!
