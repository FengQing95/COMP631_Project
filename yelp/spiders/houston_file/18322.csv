Uchi////Sooooooooo good and lived up to all the hype / reviews. The service was top notch- everything from the valet - hostess- wait staff. Â The waiter helped guide us on what to order and was honest about what we should skip or wait to see if we were hungry to add on later. Every dish was amazing!! Fried Brussel sprouts & tempura cauliflower were a high light. All the fish was outstanding. Can't wait to go back.
