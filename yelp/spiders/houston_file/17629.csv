Uchi////I've now tried 30 sushi joints in Houston and have been to Uchi twice. It is the champ of the Houston sushi scene. Even better than Kata Robata, though only by a hair. Reasonable minds could conclude that Kata Robata is better (it is certainly pricier). Some might say The Blue Fish is better (it isn't).
