JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Service was nice and pretty fast for how busy it was. I do not like that most of the tables are for smaller parties, so this wouldn't be a place to go if you had a big group. I was with three people and we had to sit in a line along one of the benches, which made conversation a bit awkward. We would have had to wait longer for our own table though so we just went for it. If you are craving authentic ramen, this is a trendy, fun place to try. Although it isn't the best ramen in Houston though...
