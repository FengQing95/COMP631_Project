JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////On to the food! For appetizers, we ordered the pork gyoza, brussel sprouts tempura, takoyaki (octopus balls), jinya bun w/ chashu pork, and the spicy peppers. For us, there wasn't actually one particular "stand out" appetizer as they were all good in their own way, but nothing "wow-ing."
