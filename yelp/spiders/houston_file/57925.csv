Kata Robata////Kata Robata is one of my favorite sushi places! Their sushi always tastes fresh as well as their other menu items. Their ramen is also so good! Broth js really flavorful! If you're into salads I recommend the house salad with miso dressing. It's a pretty big salad and can be shared. Service is always great and staff is friendly. I will add that it's recommended to make reservations or you will be on the waitlist for hours. If you're craving sushi or Japanese cuisine this is the place to go!
