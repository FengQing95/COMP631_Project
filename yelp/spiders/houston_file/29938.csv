The Pit Room////Service was great. Super fast through the line and efficient at checkout. Nathaniel was taking care of the dining area while we were there and he was so kind and attentive. He cleared everything away as soon as we wanted and brought us to-go containers. He even encouraged us to top off our drinks and got us lids and straws. I went back to add even more cash to the tip jar because of him!
