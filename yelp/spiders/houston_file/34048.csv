Local Foods////I came here for lunch with my friend who introduced Local Foods to me.  It has such a great concept:  Freshly made foods with local ingredients!  The atmosphere is very "green" feeling, with big windows and sun light shining through.  Benched tables or booths to sit at and the smell of freshness floating around at your nose.  They have a parking lot in the front that share with the neighboring restaurants.  I didn't experience any parking problems since we came a little after the lunch rush (1:30PM).
