Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We ordered the Benny Duo and the pancake flight, and both were great, classic breakfast favorites.  They have about 8-10 different kinds of eggs benedict, and the benny duo allows you to pick two kinds on one plate.  And the pancake flight is three smaller (though not small!) pancakes--I picked the chocolate chip, sweet potato and pancake of the day (bacon!). My favorite was, surprisingly, the sweet potato pancake--it was the lightest and fluffiest of the trio and topped with pecans.
