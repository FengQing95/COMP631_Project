Local Foods////Service isn't amazing here, but you order your food at the register, so there's not much interaction with workers other than that. What's nice is that they allow you to taste test the side dishes they have before choosing which ones you want with your meal. Personally, their side dishes are not my favorite; I prefer their soups.
