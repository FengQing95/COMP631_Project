JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Recently visited here after a suggestion from a friend.  The atmosphere is very casual.  I was a little surprised by the seating-  it's almost like sitting at a hibachi restaurant, where you sit with random people - but it wasn't bad. Makes for a friendly type setting.  I order the spicy noodles, they were great and spicy just as promised.  The service was decent, took a little long to get the food, but overall not bad at all.  I would definitely go back.  If you're in the mood for soup or noodles this place is good pick.
