Kata Robata////This place gets it right every time.  The sashimi is fresh, the menu has something everyone can enjoy and the lobster mac n cheese is the best in town.  The wait staff is very friendly and helpful.  Their suggestions are designed to push what the place is trying to get rid of but tailored to ensure a pleasant dining experience.
