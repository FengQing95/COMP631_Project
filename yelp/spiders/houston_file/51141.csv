Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The menu is very extensive. My friend & I took a while to decide on what we wanted. You have to read the menu carefully or else you'll skip some cool combos they offer such as the Benny Duo (combine any two egg benedicts) and pancake flight (pick 3 different flavored pancakes). You can even substitue your toast for a side of a [huge] pancake!
