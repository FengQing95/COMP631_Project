Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Everytime I visit Houston, I must stop by The Common Bond! Their pastries are delicious and neatly done. Their food is never a disappointment, and never forget to get the latte! Beware of arriving on Sunday brunch! There is usually a long line, but it moves quickly. I recommend this place for all travelers. The place is clean and neat, and the service is wonderful.
