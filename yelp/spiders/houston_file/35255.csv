Local Foods////Still a great sandwich place, just wanted to update with my favorite sandwich - gulf shrimp and crab. This sandwich is so delicious! There's a really generous amount of seafood and the bread is always pleasantly toasted. I've tried this sandwich catered and in-restaurant, and would recommend the latter (it's just better fresh). I also tried a few more sides - the kale salad is amazing, delightfully fresh and seasoned. Still love the housemade chips, but I wasn't a huge fan of the sweet potato side.
