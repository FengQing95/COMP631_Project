The Pit Room////As a tourist in town, I found the Pit Room off Yelp.  When we first walked in, I didn't really know what to expect.  It was packed, but I wasn't expecting it to be a counter service type restaurant (sans waitstaff).  Anyways, we took our  Lyft there so we were eating there regardless.
