JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Appetizer: Tempura deep fried Brussels sprouts (4/5) I really love Brussels sprouts and this was a different take on them, but nonetheless it was still good! Only downfall was that for smaller cuts it seemed like I was having more of the tempura than the actual sprout. Great when dipped with the soy sauce mixed with the chili paste!
