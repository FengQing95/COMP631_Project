Uchi////And finally, the reason why we were at Uchi in the first place... the foie nigiri. Fun fact, foie gras is banned in California. Foodies of California must leave home to try this. And this was the first time I have been able to. And it. was. fantastic. The flavors in this dish make it heaven in your mouth. There was a point where I wonder if I lost consciousness. Truly the highlight of a wonderful meal. And easily the heaviest dish of all -- even if it is one heavenly bite. We ordered three desserts: Â the lime ash sorbet, peanut butter semifreddo, and lemon gelato. All were excellent works of art but the peanut butter semifreddo was my favorite.
