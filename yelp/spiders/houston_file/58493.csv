Baby Barnaby's////Dined on Sunday around 10:30am with a group of 5, and they managed to accommodate us within a fair amount of time. Two had migas, two had green eggs and one had the breakfast platter with many mugs of delicious coffee to go around. The food was hot and fresh out of the kitchen and tasted amazing! I had the green eggs and I don't think I put down my fork once as I scarfed down every perfectly crisp potato cube, creamy spinach and artichoke eggs, awesome pan seared chicken and apple sausage and to top it off, hearty wheat toast with Dickinson's jelly. It sounds like a lot of food but everything was in manageable portions. We sat in front of the orange juicer and it smelled so yummy and it made for a mesmerizing side show act.
