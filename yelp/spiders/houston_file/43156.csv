Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Everything is very trendy, and I guess I would describe it as "clean and colorfully rustic" if that makes sense. There are tables, booths, longer tables, bar seating, and outdoor tables that you can sit at. On Saturday mornings, it can get pretty crowded, but don't let that stop you! I've never had to wait for a table, and I've come here at least two dozen times in the past 7-8 months. The people who take your order are extremely friendly; don't be afraid to ask what is inside the pastries. They all have weird names (many that I've never heard of before) so I had no idea what to order the first time I came. Added bonus: the servers all wear fashionable hats!
