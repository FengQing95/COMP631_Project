Uchi////This is a very good Sushi place. Though its very pricey and expensive but some of the dishes really match upto the expectation like the Brussels sprout agemono. It was sooooo yummmmm. These are just mini crispy brussels sprouts sauted in sweet sauce and lemon chilli. The spicy crunchy avacado Makimono is good too. The sushi rolls are above average. They did not serve the sushi rolls with the typical wasabi and gari unlike other sushi places. I did not like the cauliflower Hana tataki. It was too tangy and not at all worth it. I being a vegetarian could try only the veggie options. They have plenty of options. They have a separate Vegetarian menu card. You can ask for it. They also have some vegan dessert options. PLEASE MAKE A RESERVATION IF YOU DO NOT LIKE WAITING. The average wait time is 2hrs on a Friday-Saturday. They have a patio or waiting lounge outside where you can have some drinks and Edamamme until your turn comes up. They also serve free sushi rolls during the wait sometimes. Overall a must try once.
