Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The wait wasn't too long for a Saturday at 10 am but I still advise to go earlier than later. The brunch was good but nothing crazy good. The biscuits and gravy was okay but the breakfast sandwich was awesome I recommend it. The best things were the baked goods the croissants were awesome and (sorry I forgot the name but) the caramel muffin was amazing super moist and airy and had great flavor. If I go back again I would honestly just go for pastries and coffee they were both killer
