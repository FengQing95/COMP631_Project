Kata Robata////I wanted to love this place. I'm not a creature of habit. I enjoy changing things up, so finding a new favorite sushi joint has actually been on my running list of "things to do". Unfortunately, I was hardly impressed. The food just wasn't stellar. I will say that we only ordered two items, so maybe it's not a fair assessment of what else they have to offer.
