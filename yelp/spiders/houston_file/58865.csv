Baby Barnaby's////Delicous breakfast options, including some healthy alternatives for lighter eaters.  Everything is very reasonably priced and the service is attentive, if a bit rushed as they try to turn over tables.  I had Huevos Rancheros, which I would recommend.  Although when I go back I'm getting Migas.  A plate of it came by after we had ordered and I had a bad case of food envy.
