Uchi////love this place, it is a revalution of tasete, you must make reservation otherwise it is usually at least 40min wait. It is very expensive, and the portion is very small. my friend recommanded to let the waiter order for us, we gave him $50 per person bugget, and he did a great job with it. There is one dish i cant forget it is made with sizzing rice in a hot pot with some seafood, if you go there, that is one dish you must order!
