Local Foods////I love finding these "hidden" gems. This place rocks! From the moment you walk in, to the moment you leave. Rice Village seems to have gained another cool restaurant that will have me coming back for me. Located right next to the already famous Benjy's, Local Foods offers unique, freshly-made sandwiches that seem to be growing in popularity all across Houston.
