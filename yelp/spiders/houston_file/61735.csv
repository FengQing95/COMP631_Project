Baby Barnaby's////Stopped in on a weekday for a solo breakfast. So glad I went early because this location is small and shortly after my arrival, around 9:30am, several people came through the door. All were directed to sign in on the clipboard until seats became available. It's so small, I wouldn't recommend it for parties larger than 4 plus there also isn't a ton of parking. The upside to all of this quaintness is the home-like feeling it yields. The staff knew their customers which added a certain charm to a well-known chain.
