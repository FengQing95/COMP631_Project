Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I know I'll come back to Common Bond not because I'm in love with it, but because it's just so conveniently located (off Westheimer near Montrose). If I were taking a friend shopping around the area and wanted a more chill place to hang out, I'd definitely go here just because of the convenience factor (even though I love Agora, which is right behind it, Common Bond is much better suited for quiet/casual conversation). Also parking is not bad here at all. The ambiance is pretty bright and cheery, so it's really easy to hang out here for awhile whether you're inside or on the patio. And if you're just craving baked goodness, this is a really easy place to pop in and just grab a cookie or croissant to go.
