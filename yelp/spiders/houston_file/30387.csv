The Pit Room////I got the brisket, jalapeno sausage, baked beans, and mac & cheese. There's a condiment station with free unlimited pickled veggies and sauces. So had my helping of that (really liked the pickled onions). The brisket was to be honest a little on the dry side. My cut of brisket was tender but it wasn't really moist. I should've asked for a more fattier cut of meat. However, I still liked the meat because that smokiness is so unique to Houston. It's very different from any of the bbq places I've tried outside of Texas so I gotta give them credit for that. That's the real smoky flavor that you want when you're eating bbq. You can also see a nice smoke ring on the outside of the brisket. The sausage were very juicy and spicy. The sides can speak for themselves, it's baked beans and mac & cheese you cant mess that up. So they would've gotten a 5 star if my brisket was more moist.
