Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////A little disappointed in our trip to snooze today. I recently just moved to Houston and had tried snooze one time before and absolutely loved it! This time I decided to bring friends who were also new to the area.... 3 of us total. Both me and my friend ordered the shrimp and grits and both dishes had several hairs. The server was okay and made a new one for my friend but I had found my hairs later in the meal and my dish was half eaten and nothing was offered to replace or compensate. As a former server myself I was just a little disappointed that a manager wasn't notified or stopped by to address the situation. Maybe I'll try a different location next time...
