Local Foods////The pretzel bread was amazing.  We had the egg salad and crunchy chicken salad which had a choice of two sides or a soup.  Both sandwiches were great.  Ingredients were really fresh.  We had the chips and orzo as sides.  The chips were too salty and were almost on the burnt side, I was not a fan.  The orzo was good because of the quality of the ingredients.
