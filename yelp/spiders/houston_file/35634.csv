Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////After having this place recommended by 2 different friends in 2 days, we had to check it out! Atmosphere is dark and stylish, but is very cold if you end up at a table by the door like we did. Every time the door opened, we were hit by a cold wind (and so was our food!), so that was the low point of the experience. The fries are cut thick - which I like! - but overcooked for my taste (read: a little burnt). I would order them again and ask for them to be cooked medium-rare . My boyfriend got the Bosscat burger and said it was good. I got the black eyed pea burger and liked it, although it was a tad greasy (the bread shouldn't be so greasy when the patty is already fried- it's overkill). I was disappointed by the mixed drinks - the Moscow Mule was awful. The Southsider tasted of cucumber and not much else. They have a cool looking whiskey room that we wanted to check out, but a private event was going on. Nice whiskey selection. Overall, I would say go try the food and whiskey and avoid the mixed drinks.
