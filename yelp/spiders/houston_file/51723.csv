Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Here's a 5 star review!!!  From the time I entered and i was greeted by 2 nice, professional gentlemen.  One of them took me to my seat with guest.  The server, a female, greeted us promptly, took drink order.  She came back in less than a minute.  She took food order; cane back a few times to refill drinks, bring condiments, let us know food is on the way.  I ordered the shrimp & grits which was heavenly.  Not too much, not too little.  My guest ordered the 3 egg omelette with hash browns and tortillas which he said was great.   The staff seemed to work well with each other.  Parking available.  Clean spot.  Definitely recommend.
