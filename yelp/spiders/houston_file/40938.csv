Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Yea this place is one of my new favorite brunch spots in Houston now. A little crowded on this inside, but that is to be expected with the number of people who wish to dine here. Everything on the menu is good and worth giving a try. We got the tater tot with egg appetizer (not sure the name), and personally, I got the fruity pebble french toast which I don't think could have been executed better. Alongside that, I got the protein pancakes and they were actually really good, don't let the description deceive you. Would 100% recommend if you need a brunch spot.
