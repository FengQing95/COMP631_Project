JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Yes, at Jinya  we do often have a wait.  Based on the number of parties waiting and the size of the parties, we often times cannot seat guests right after other guest get up from their tables being that we may be required to hold and merge tables to accommodate large parties waiting.  My goal as a business owner has always been to seat our guests as quickly as possible in hopes of cutting down the wait time.  I am concerned that you observed our hosts seating "friends" as that is a complete no-no in my book.  I will definitely investigate your claim and make it known to not only my hosts, but to all my staff that such actions will not be tolerated.  It's first come, first serve.
