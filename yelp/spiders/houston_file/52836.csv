Kata Robata////Went there couple days ago and ordered the chirashi (same quality with a variety of fresh fish) and miso marinated black cod.  The cod was clearly burnt and pretty hard but when telling the server, she told us the piece of charcoal-black fish was "caramelized" and it always look like that.  I insisted her checking with the kitchen and we ended up getting a new order from kitchen with truly caramelized fish (golden brown instead of half piece of charcoal). Disappointed for the service with the price we paid.
