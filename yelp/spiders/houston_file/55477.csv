Kata Robata////Every sushi item was delicious, but the uni stood out to me the most. Usually, I am not a huge fan of uni sushi, however I loved how CREAMY and sweet this uni was at kata robata. I didn't get to try the "premium" uni, but I would like to try it next time if the second best uni was this great. Also, yes, you should try the barracuda.
