The Pit Room////Meh... went with the two meat dinner. Chose Brisket and Venison sausage, Cole Slaw, and Mustard Potato Salad. Side items were bland and needed some salt. Portion size on all items was sufficient for the price. Venison sausage was dry and brisket was a little tough. Brisket did have good flavor and their sauce was really good. Venison sausage had good taste and a bit spicy but couldn't get past the dryness. I did enjoy their homemade condiments and pickle bar. Place was pretty clean and decor was cool. I feel you pay for the marketing of the place vs quality.
