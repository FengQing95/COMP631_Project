Baby Barnaby's////Yay! I am a fan! or at least that's what Yelp says this rating is. I have been here a few times but the wait is always long. The food here is amazing but honestly, sometimes I come and wait an hour to be seated in a tiny house. The house is quaint but I do appreciate and enjoy space sometime.
