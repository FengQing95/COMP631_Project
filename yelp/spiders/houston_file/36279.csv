Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Had dinner here and not too impressed. The place is super loud. Practically impossible to carry on a conversation. Service was good. Food is underwhelming and overpriced. Had a sandwich ($15), rib plate ($25), appetizer ($10) and 3 beers ($8/each). Total with tip was $100. Just can't recommend this place due to crazy loud atmosphere and overpriced and not special food.
