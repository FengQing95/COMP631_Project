JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Arkhamknight93 - Thank you for your review. For the record, we receive routine health inspections from the City of Houston, and we have passed favorably and are in good standing. We set EMPTY pots on the floor beside the dishwasher, but otherwise, our soup pots are carried from the racks in our walk-in cooler to the gas burners that are located behind our ramen stations. Please let me know if you have any further questions. Thank you again.
