Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Decided to try this place out because of the great reviews. Came here with some foodie friends, who had also never been here. Our experience was frankly, mediocre. Waiter was nice enough, really accommodating, but the high point, food-wise, seemed to be the dipping sauces. We had the spicy chicken and cheese dip, mushroom fries, Cajun brick chicken, the bosscat burger, and the potato fries.
