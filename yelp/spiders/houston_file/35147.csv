Local Foods////I ordered the Crunchy Chicken Sandwich with the Tuscan Kale and Soba Noodle side dish. I loved the sandwich and they were not selfish with the amount of shredded chicken they put in the sandwich! The only thing that I didn't like was that it was a little too sweet for me. It tasted really great at first but then after a few bites, I stopped eating it. I'm not a huge fan of sweet and savory. The tuscan kale tasted amazing. Though, the soba noodles were very bland and slimy in texture. I do not recommend getting the soba noodles. I also got the Blood Orange Mintade drink, which is quite bitter yet addictive.
