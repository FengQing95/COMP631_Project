Kata Robata////The rest of the menu looked really promising. I wanted to try all the other great dishes that fellow yelpers were recommending but I was too stuff. This just gives me a reason to come back & come back I will! Also, a huge shout out to my waiter who also made this experience a 5 star experience. (So sorry I forgot your name though!) Love Kata Robata!!
