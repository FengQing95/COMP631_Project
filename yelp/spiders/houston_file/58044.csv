Kata Robata////Happy hour is totally worth: there's plenty of drinks and a couple of good food items. Babe got three old fashioned cocktails and thought they were pretty good. I got a mojito and beer. Shisito mojito was different from the usual but I enjoyed the kick! As for food, we shared Kobe beef tacos, spider roll, shumai, and salmon carpaccio. I'm not a big beef person but my jelly belly is and he only thought the Kobe beef tacos were okay. I did not care for it. Spider roll had soft shell crab in it, and it was pretty basic. The shumai and salmon carpaccio were BOMB. Shumai came out hot and full of flavor. Salmon carpaccio had such a refreshing taste! I would've ordered another one if I hadn't ordered too much food already.
