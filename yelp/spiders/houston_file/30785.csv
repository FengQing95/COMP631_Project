The Pit Room////I've lived in Texas all my life, my family is Mexican, so you know we know something about barbecuing lol. This is literally the only barbecue joint I will go to in Houston. The brisket is AMAZING. It's always fall apart juicy and never dry. Also the barbecue sauce is great. I will get whole briskets from here when we have family functions, is that good. Don't waste your time going anywhere else, I don't care the other places reviews say. if you can't eat here just go get a burger or something lol
