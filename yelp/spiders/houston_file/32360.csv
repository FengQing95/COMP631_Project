Local Foods////Great quality food.  However, THE MENU HARDLY EVER CHANGES!  I'm so tired of the SAME OLD THINGS that I just can't eat here anymore until they give the menu a drastic seasonal change.  I used to dine here at least 3 times a week... but as you can imagine, after trying the same food for so long, it's easy to get tired of it.  The used to have a killer pastrami sandwich, but they took it off the menu. (So bummed)
