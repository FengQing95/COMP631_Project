JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Nice place and location. Ruben, our server, was nice and attentive. My husband had the pork bao and shrimp balls. I had the cauliflower, salmon fish tacos and the truffle fries. All the appetizers were good. We did not have ramen, next time we come back, we will order the ramen.
