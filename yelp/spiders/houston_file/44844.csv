Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I also got to meet Johnny and Hugh and gave them my 2 cents on how awesome this place is (way better than B. Patisserie in San Francisco - which they apparently had visited the week before... sorry, Brenda, but the croissant and the kouign aman are just better here in Houston).  Pretty cool to meet folks who care enough about their craft and practice to travel to renown bakeries in the country.  Hugh and Johnny, did you guys make it out to Bouchon? (Their macarons are the size of oatmeal cream pies and their croissants are pretty darn awesome too.)  And if it be in the stars... can you pleaaaase make paris brest available?  It's up there with kouign aman as my favorite pastry in the world...
