Uchi////The final straw for me was the poor poor service.  We went on a Friday night and the place had a very strong hip and young crowd.  Our 10 course "shared" tasting lasted 3 hours!  No good pacing at all, seemed like the staff was really rushing every step but somehow the dinner still lasted 3 hours.  We had a jug of water to refill ourselves on the table which is fine but when the jug ran out, no one cared to refill because they were too damned busy!
