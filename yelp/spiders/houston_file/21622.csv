Uchi////For one, make a reservation well in advance considering it can take up to three weeks to get the timeslot you're looking for. My insider tip is to come here as soon as they open at 5:30PM for social hour (no reservation needed), in which some menu and beverage items are lower in price. Next, only select seating at the sushi bar. I say this because it's perfect for date night and you'll get to interact with the chefs. Even if your sushi knowledge is minimal, it's an enticing opportunity for the two of you to experiment with the novelty of Uchi. An extra secret tip--if the chefs like you, they may provide some complimentary food. Also, if you can handle the dent, put down for some omakase, an 8-10 course menu for each person based on what the sushi chef feels best fits your tastes. Omakase will cost roughly $80 per diner. Finally, order dessert. I don't know how Uchi is able to do it so well, but seeing as they have a personal pastry chef, you'll be able to satisfy your sweet tooth with an upliftingly sweet meal.
