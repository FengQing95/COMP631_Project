Uchi////I understand the place is packed, but I had made reservation in advance for a month, plus it was our 9 yrs anniversary.  I was courteous to call them, to let them know we were running late.  But they couldn't inform me your table will not be ready, it will take a few more minutes. Or to let me know, that is all I wanted to know.  What is the point in having a reservation if  you have to wait.
