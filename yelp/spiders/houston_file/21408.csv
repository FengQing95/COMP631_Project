Uchi////Overall, I would definitely come back. The plates were just so complex and it was an experience to have for sure. Anyone trying to push you off with the portion size complaint should possibly be ignored and you should just try it yourself. Especially the omakase. It allows you try the menu out and is pretty filling and satisfying.
