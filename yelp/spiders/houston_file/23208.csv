Uchi////Probably one of the best meals I've had in Houston! My friend and I decided to do the chef's tasting omakase and wow it did not disappoint! Every dish was so artfully prepared and had such interesting flavor and texture combinations! It's really hard to pick a favorite! Our servers were also so kind and helped us understand each course we were eating, making recommendations on how best to enjoy it all. Also since it was our first time at Uchi, they gave us a complimentary order of their fan-favorite brussel sprouts which was (as expected) so tasty too! Definitely well worth the money and a great treat-yourself/lovedones restaurant!
