The Pit Room////Worth it. Always. Just go and you won't regret it. The pulled pork tacos are to die for and so are their sausages and all the meat if you decide to go the classic BBQ route. I can't put into words how excited i get when I go here. The staff is always super friendly and you leave always full. Also when they do green beans (special side item every once and a while) theyre SO good. They taste like if asian food and bbq had a baby.
