The Pit Room////First time visit. I am a uber driver and I dropped gentleman there tonight said he was told it was one of the best places in  Houston for bbq. My next rider lived across the street from the restaurant said she never been there but heard it was good and good. So after completing my day of driving I went back there. Yes the line was long but was moving fast. The employees was extremely nice and helpful. I ordered 3 meats beef sausage, pork ribs, and chicken with beans and potato salad.  All was good and favor full. Now can't ay my favorite but good. I would go back when I am in the area!
