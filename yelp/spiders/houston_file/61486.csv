Baby Barnaby's////I loved my meal, I ordered the Breakfast Burrito. It was larger than expected, filled with black beans, egg and cheese, and comes with more potatoes than you can finish with a mild salsa on the side - a perfect combo if you ask me. My meal was simple but delicious, and I can't wait to be back and try more of their food!
