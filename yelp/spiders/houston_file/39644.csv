Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Friend and I came at around 11:30 and took the open bar seatings so we don't have to wait. When we left around 12:40, though, there was a short line of people waiting for seating and the bar was full. The atmosphere is very laid back and hip. Great casual hang out spot to watch sports and whatnot. It is a bit loud for intimate convos, though.
