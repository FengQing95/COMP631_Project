Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I would like to give this place zero stars for their awful service. They quoted us a 20 minute wait on a Friday at 11. We didn't get seated till 12 and watched as people who walked in after us get seated right away. They're extremely rude and Incompetent.. and the food isn't even that good. Dont waste your time
