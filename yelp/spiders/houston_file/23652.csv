Uchi////Japanese Sea Urchin (uni hokkaido): $12 It was our (boyfriend and I) first time trying this delicate....My boyfriend didn't really like it because it was too mushy. It looks like orange frosting decorated on a piece of sushi rice. I thought it tasted pretty good. Keep in mind that my boyfriend doesn't like mushy food in general. He doesn't like avocado, durian, and etc...I would still recommend you to try this dish!
