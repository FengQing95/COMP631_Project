JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////They also ran out of thin noodles on the night we went. Not sure how you run out of noodles when you're a noodle restaurant. I got the Tonkotsu Black ramen and the broth was just okay. I found it lacking complex flavor and it sort of just tasted like a sodium-packed salty broth. I also didn't think the portion size was that great. The only plus was the perfectly cooked soft-boiled egg.
