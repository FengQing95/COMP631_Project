Baby Barnaby's////This place was great! Really good food and timely service. Be aware there might be a little wait but they do offer coffee while you wait. This place is dog friendly as well so feel free to bring the pups a long. The chicken fried steak and eggs is amazing and the "green eggs" with chicken apple sausage was excellent as well!
