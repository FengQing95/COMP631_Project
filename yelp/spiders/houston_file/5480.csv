JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I went for the second or third time last week. Wasn't impressed with the quality of the soup. For me, the actual broth is important and mine wasn't as hot as it should be. Heat wise, not mentioning spice. The egg was whole. I am used to it being cut in half. Maybe I'm nitpicking. Service was great. Our waiter was very timely and quick to serve our food and drinks.
