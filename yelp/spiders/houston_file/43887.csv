Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond makes some wonderful pastries and baked goods here in Houston.  The pastries are good, though some of the chocolate ones were too heavy for the summer (my fault, though).  They make a great assortment of goodies for all tastes.  There are even some gluten-free options (macaroons and a strawberry passion pastry). *Disclaimer*, if you are concerned about cross-contamination, I would advise against Common Bond.  My coworker with celiac enjoyed the strawberry passion pastry and did not suffer any ill effects, though.  The drink selection is fine.  Parking is pretty good for that neighborhood.
