JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I am in love with the Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen! I highly, highly recommend omnivores to try it as well! It is soooo tasty! You can also veganize the vegetarian ramen (which has more veggies) in two ways. One option is to order the vegetarian, switching to the thick noodles (vegan) and eat as is, the other is to also switch to the spicy creamy vegan broth. All three of those options are amazing on their own, but I always end up adding fresh garlic and brussel sprouts and I'm in heaven! The brussel sprouts taste so good on their own too! **Note the spicy broth is really not spicy at all, we often add two table spoons of the table sauce to make it truly spicy! You can also ask for the chili powder to give it an extra kick! If you're vegan, do-not ask for a spicier level, as the sauce they add to it in the kitchen, is unfortunately not vegan. You have to use the table sauce and spice yourself, but no biggie it still tastes delish! As far as drinks, my favorite on their menu is the lychee mule and I highly recommend it.
