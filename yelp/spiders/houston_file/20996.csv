Uchi////Service was also fantastic.  At the bar, my friend and I got scooted over one seat in the middle of our meal, and they provided an extra dish for us on the house.  If I could, I'd do it over and over and over again.  It was the Hamachi Nabe, and it was absolutely delicious.  One of the highlights of our meal, along with the ham and egg roll and fried milk.
