Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I only came here for the sweets, and decided to try a whole bunch... why not right?!  I ordered the chocolate peanut butter cupcake, a lemon tart, and a macaroon (don't judge, I was sharing!)  they serve it to you on a beautiful plate, you grab a fork from the middle cart, and dig in.  Oh and this may seem silly, but the fork was a SOLID fork, not just one of those run of the mill flemsy forks in a bucket... felt like real silverware which was just a nice touch.
