Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond is the place you go when you are stuck in an airport on a long layover. Its easy to forgive airport food because it's.....airport food. But I've had lots of airport food better than it. Common Bond is cutesy and looks appealing but at the end of the day it's just a place to go to get the job done on your way to whatever is next. For me, it was a trip to McDonalds to get a McGriddle. Although I'll have cramps for the rest of the day, I'll at least have tasted something and not feel......common.
