Uchi////Friend of ours dined at Uchi on a prior occasion, so my BF and I let him guide us through dinner. Smarties that we are, we decided to come during happy hour to take advantage of cheap sake and discounted seafood. This is a MUST if you can make the hours. Don't remember exact prices, but items such as the walu walu were at least 50% off. Big fat YES. Also, you have much better chances of finding parking. I don't do valet unless I absolutely have to, so the availability of street parking was an added bonus.
