Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I am in flaky, buttery pastry heaven. I love boulangaries and their beautiful display of goodies. I wanted a little of everything when I walked in. The "oohs" and "aahs" did not stop as I looked around. I ordered the kouign-amann, almond croissant, chocolate, and plain croissant. I loved each and everyone...lol. No shame, must try more when I come back.
