Uchi////Our trip to Uchi last night was a total let down.  As someone who has had fantastic meals at Uchi and Uchiko in Austin and a wonderful 10-course tasting for Savor Dallas at Uchi Dallas, I expected the same quality and experience from Uchi in my hometown of Houston.  I won a gift card to Uchi (any location) at a travel and dining auction this year, and wanted to save it to treat my mom to a special meal while visiting her this week.
