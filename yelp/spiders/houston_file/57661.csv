Kata Robata////Seriously may be my go to sushi spot from now on! Came for lunch, and the plaza was already packed by 11AM! We had to circle and circle over and over just to get a spot. The wait time must tell you something, for the restaurant just opening and having to wait 20~ minutes just for a party of 2, must mean it's popular and worth coming to!
