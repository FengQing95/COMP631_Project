The Pit Room////I'm visiting Houston and wanted some great BBQ. This place is amazing. I had the Brisket and Jalape√±o Cheddar Sausage with Elote and Mustard Potato Salad. All were exceptional. The brisket is the kind where adding sauce would ruin it - it is so tasty on its own that adding sauce is a sin. You can't go wrong with this place.
