Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered a Benny Duo since I couldn't decide on only one type of eggs benedict. The Ham Benedict III is your classic and really hit the spot. The Bella Bella Benny was good but the flavors just weren't my cup of tea. The balsamic glaze cut the richness and creaminess of the rest of the dish, but just wasn't what I was going for on this day.
