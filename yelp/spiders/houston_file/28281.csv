The Pit Room////Look I'm a southern girl who comes from a long line of bbqer's and cooks and while this place is ok, it's not good in my opinion for price and enjoy-ability. It feels stiff and boujee. If you're a real city slicker you'll probably like this place but if you're a Q expert, you'll leave saying I've had better.
