JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Monica - Thank you for your review. I will speak to our back of house about your review. When it comes to working in a high-volume, high-turnover restaurant, it's very easy for staff to transfer their stress and anxiety to physical tasks such as wiping the plates dry, or drying off the spoons that come out of the dishwasher. We appreciate your bringing this to our attention.
