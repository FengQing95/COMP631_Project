Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Don't believe the hype, this is a flash in the pan. Went here for lunch today and it was a major let down. Parking is a biatch, but that's to be expected and didn't influence this review. The servers were super friendly, but the food (and isn't that what we all come for?) was mediocre at best. My friend had Juan's breakfast tacos, which seemed delish by description but had ZERO flavor. I had the corned beef ruben which was passable but mostly just a salt-bomb and nothing special. We both felt sick to our stomachs after we left. This place is 'hot and new' by Yelp standards, so come here and Instagram pics of your pancakes to show all of your friends how trendy you are, but I doubt you'll come back for the food. There are far better places in the hood (i.e., Empire, Brasil, Common Bond, etc.). Meh.
