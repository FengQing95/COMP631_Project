Local Foods////Fresh and filling! I had the vegan caesar salad, which was HUGE and absolutely delicious. They've got a wide selection of salads, sandwiches, and other sides, including house-made potato chips. Very busy, even on weekdays. Wish I had one of these in my neighborhood, 'cause I'd be there alllll the time.
