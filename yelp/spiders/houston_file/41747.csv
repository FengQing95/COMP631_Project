Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Probably the cutest bakery in Montrose. Solid & unique menu options. I love that! I had the grilled cheese (not your regular Kraft & toast) and carrot cake cup cake. Both were delicious! The only reason I'm not giving a 5 this time is because there was something in the icing of the cupcake (like a small bug) I usually wouldn't go back but I think it was an oversight and not the norm. The place is clean and cute!
