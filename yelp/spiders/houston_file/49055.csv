Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I like snooze and will go every so often; but I honestly believe its WAAAYYY over rated. Its like a fancy IHOP and people are loosing their minds over it? You will have to wait usually 45mins to 2 hours (I was told this once and left); to be served "upscale" and eclectic diner food; by an even more eclectic, laissez faire staff. All of this after fighting for a parking space. When I go; Ill walk because parking is that much of a headache.
