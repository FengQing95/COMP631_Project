JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is one of my go to restaurants whenever I am craving ramen. I always receive great service, great drinks and amazing ramen. I always order a leechee-tini Brussel sprout tempora and the spicy chicken ramen in the spicy flavor. Â The drink is strong yet light. The brussel sprouts are cooked fresh and always arrive to the table hot. The ramen here is top notch!
