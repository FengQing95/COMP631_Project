The Pit Room////The staff & service was AMAZING . The food was very good . Not exactly what I would call "the best BBQ in Houston " but it was good & quality. The chicken was tough , which was disappointing & the BBQ sauce is very interesting , kind of a sweet / spicy molasses tang to it , It definitely does not have a Texas feel . Not to my & my husbands liking Â but then again , to each their own .
