Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////If you want a great breakfast place with a bar for bloody mary's or try the flight eggs benedict.. from sweet to savory the food is yummy. The atmosphere and design is a throwback to the sixties. Â Definitely expect a wait if you are past 9AM ;-).. A must try... #JoeFoodTour @JoeFoodTour
