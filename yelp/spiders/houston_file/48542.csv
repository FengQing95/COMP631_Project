Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Came on a Friday around 11:30am. It was a 45min-1hr wait. There's free coffee while you wait or you can order a drink at the bar which also has its own line. They text you when you're table is ready so you can wander to Walgreens or the consignment store next door. We ordered a little bit of everything off the menu. Pancake flight (blueberry danish, pineapple upside down, and peanut butter cup), OMG french toast, breakfast pot pie, benny duo w/ chilaquiles and chile verde benedicts, a side of bacon and an omelet. Out of everything I'd get the benny duo and bacon again. Not really huge on sweets but the blueberry danish and pineapple upside down pancakes were best. An added plus was the hash browns were nice and crispy. Service was great. Our waiter was knowledgeable and had everything down to the T. I don't know if I would wait over an hr to eat here again but glad I was able to get in while I could.
