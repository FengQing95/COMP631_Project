Baby Barnaby's////I beat my french toast up, but I want to try the pancakes the next time i go. And let me tell yo u, this place ranks high on the PPP: Pierre's Price to Portion meter they get a 4 out of 5.  I am always suspect about places that do sit down breakfasts.  Bu this place came through on a morning in which I really needed to make sure I had a solid meal.
