Baby Barnaby's////The rush is real. You have to sign in on a yelllow legal pad sheet. Waiting is awkward. One guy requesting needs. Very tightly fitted. If they make their round, it will be awhile before they come  back to  you. Not an impressive situation. Not even Mel and FLo. Can not say that I would recommend to other. Attention not extended well. If we  hadn't have waited, would personally leave. We have not  even order but have  been  Seating for over 15 minutes. Well the food was outstanding and the service picked up.
