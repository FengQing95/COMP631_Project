Kata Robata////Super busy during weekend evenings - make sure to reserve. Ordered the Hakata ramen, two happy hour rolls (Spicy salmon and Long Horn), Chicken skewers. Everything was exceptional. Ramen soup was milky. It's quite pricey though but I guess you pay for the modern environment and fancy presentation of your food.
