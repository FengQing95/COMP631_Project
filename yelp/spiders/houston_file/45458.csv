Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The ambience of the place is extremely laid back, and again, the staff is super friendly. Based on this alone, Common Bond is worth the visit to pack on some calories and not be judged by how many treats you pile on your plate, or how long it takes you to order it. There is plenty of seating, and a great place to people watch as you down a cup of coffee.
