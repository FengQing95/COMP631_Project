Baby Barnaby's////I had the burrito for breakfast. The 'chicken' which it comes with is sliced like ham and put all in one corner of the burrito I couldn't find it until after half way. There was no seasoning I could taste on the whole meal. It was basically a bunch of bland egg in a cold wrap with a few black beans thrown on top and a sliced whole tomato on the side. Also a shortage of variety on the menu
