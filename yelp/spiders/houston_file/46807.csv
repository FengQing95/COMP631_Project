Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was great! The wait time is a complete drag especially when you are hungry. We were also sat in a area beside a window that was beaming heat right on us. It's a little hard to enjoy your food when every crevice is sweating. I'll definitely request a seat with shade the next time and come not so hungry.
