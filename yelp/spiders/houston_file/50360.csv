Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The service here has been great during each of my visits. The servers seem to work in teams and they're all attentive. Expect a long wait, especially during peak hours where you could wait as long as 2 hours! Bring a snack to munch on while you wait. In my opinion, the wait is worth it. :) Also beware of their tiny parking lot! I never have any luck in that lot so I usually park on the streets in the surrounding neighborhood.
