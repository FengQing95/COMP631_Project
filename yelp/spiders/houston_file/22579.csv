Uchi////So, presently, I've only been to two Sushi-ya that are owned/run by non-Japanese that I would consider going back to on my own initiative.  Sushi Puzzle in SF, and now Uchi.  Now, the difference is that, despite being opened and run by gaijin, Uchi has talented Japanese chefs and training and managing.
