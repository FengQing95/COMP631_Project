Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I made a reservation within 15 minutes of the scheduled time... walked in and had no issues getting a table. I ordered shrimp and grits in which it was decent. Not the best I've had but still tasty. I also had the taste for salmon so I ordered a side and mixed it with my entree. Pretty tasty! To wash it all down I had a nice red blend wine called "12 crimes uprising"!
