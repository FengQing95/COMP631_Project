JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had the basic Tonkotsu which is what I usually always go for if not Miso. The tamago (egg) was pretty good, although I would have preferred it to be a little softer. Just slightly softer would have been better. The noodles were meh. I've visited a couple of ramen places outside of Houston that would ask how I would like my noodles (soft, chewy and so on), but this place didnt. It ended up being too chewy for me. The chashu in the ramen was a little too hard. Idk why but it tasted a little different from the ones in the rice bowl. The soup was pretty good. I did think it was slightly salty but I may be biased since I've been eating low sodium meals for a little bit. Ramen menus need a little vamping up I feel like.
