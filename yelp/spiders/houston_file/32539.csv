Local Foods////Not exactly the cheapest place to dine in at but definitely an awesome one. The atmosphere is nice for a date and the food quality is superb. That being said, I wanted to highlight on their sides. I've tried 4 of them, all in one sitting (stole a lot from my partners hehehehe) and I must say. WOW. I felt like I was cheating life. For food to be that good AND that healthy? That's textbook definition of life-hacks. The Kale and the Couscous were definitely my favorites and will be future go-tos. As for sandwiches, I tried the salmon and the chicken salad one. Both just absolutely fantastic.
