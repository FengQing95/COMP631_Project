Baby Barnaby's////I host a baby shower brunch at Barnaby, and it was perfect! The place has different rooms and big tables for groups. The backyard is very beautiful with a pond, fountain and mini bridge, a great place for kids as well! Their brunch is buffet style that has wide selections of meats, veggies and fruits. It can get very busy during weekends. So make sure to make a reservation, especially when you have a group of people coming.
