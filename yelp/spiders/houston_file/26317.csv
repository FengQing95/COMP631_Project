The Pit Room////We are in town for a basketball tournament and tried to buy ribs at two other closer BBQ joints and The Pit Room was actually a recommendation from another restaurant. Inside BBQ people know their stuff. Pork ribs were amazing and brisket moist with the perfect hit of smoke. I highly recommend if you are in the area. Next time I'm getting the giant beef rib!
