Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We arrived in Houston hungry. We googled the top brunch places in Houston. The atmosphere was so fun and the music was great! Let's get into the menu. Shrimp and grits : delicious. Hands down best meal on the menu. The shrimp were large and the grits were full of flavor. French toast was next! Team yes! They drizzle this with a light icing and fluffy bread. Next avocado toast! Yum! I added salmon lox. This took it to another level. The bread was soft, the honey jam was delicious, the egg was cooked to perfection. Pancake was next: this was light and fluffy, not too sweet! The egg white omelette was great! But the toast with the raspberry jam was great! The least favorite was the potatoes. They definitely needed some seasoning.
