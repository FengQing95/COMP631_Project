JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It just keeps on getting worse and worse. First, I am frustrated that they took off the Tonkatsu White on their menu - it was my favorite ramen! Nothing tastes like it. I ordered the chicken ramen and there was a gross film of fat on the top of ramen that needed to be skimmed. I understand if there if there is some fat, but I'm not exaggerating when the entire bowl was filled with fat. Very unappetizing and needs more attention to detail.
