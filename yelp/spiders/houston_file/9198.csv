JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So I did actually come back and gave this place a try again and I was still disappointed. I came back in May (late review I know) and I got their monthly special which was the Cha Cha Cha ramen which is their garlic ramen, and it just wasn't flavorful for me. The broth felt lacking and the noodles were bland. I ended up not finishing my bowl. Also, my boyfriend pointed out that he saw the manager rub his face with his hands and ran a bowl of ramen to a table. When I looked back, I saw one of the other staff (not sure if he was a server, busser, food runner idk) rub his face with his hands and then ran food. That's disgusting. I wouldn't want somebody's nasty, snotty, oily hands anywhere near my food. If you have some itch on your face you HAVE to scratch, or your nose is running or whatever, use your sleeve or elbow.
