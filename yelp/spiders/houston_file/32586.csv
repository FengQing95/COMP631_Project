Local Foods////OMG, my favorite sandwich place in Houston. I will never eat another sandwich from another store. My favorite is the crab and shrimp and my second go to is the vietnamese bahn mi. The crab and shrimp sandwich has so much crab and shrimp, you'd think you died and gone to heaven. I also tried the sides but I prefer the soup as I am not a barley, kale quinoa kind of person. The soups change but every time I Have been it is been delicious. Â Portions are quite large and I have half a sandwich left over. I eat the other half just cause I can't let it go to waste or the fact that it's so hot here in TX you can't store the food in the car.
