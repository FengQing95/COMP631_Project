Baby Barnaby's////I ordered the green eggs and chicken apple sausage with biscuits. It was really the best breakfast plate I have ever had in Houston. I just wish this place was in Sugar Land! My boyfriend had the steak and eggs which he thought was very good also. It isn't too expensive and the food is fresh. Staff is really nice and you can tell that there are a lot of regulars.
