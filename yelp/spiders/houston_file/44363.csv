Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The cafe is easily very trendy and gourmet.  They're a little higher in price, but you can tell it's worth it by the quality of the food, presentation, and atmosphere.  When you first walk in, you're already in line to order, which I can see going out the door if its busy.  Perhaps they should rethink how the entrance line works.  In any case, you can see the plethora of baked goods through the glass case as well as pick up a menu to order something that needs a little more prep time, like their sandwiches, soups, salads, etc.  Once you order, you're given an number so that they can bring to you what they couldn't already give you in line, and you pay before being seated.  They have a variety of coffee and teas and other hot and cold beverages.  There is ample seating inside and some outside.  And i'm glad they have a somewhat spacious parking lot with some overflow just a block or two away.  They also have plentiful friendly staff to assist you if you need it.
