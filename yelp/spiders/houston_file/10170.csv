JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya has awesome ramen and they have so many varieties available! Some personal favorites are the Sprouting Up Ramen (with brussels sprouts!) and the Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen (which really isn't very spicy). I love their Jinya bun (pork belly bao bun), but each order only includes one. The buns are a great price during happy hour, so that's the best time to order multiples! Caramelized cauliflower and tempura brussels sprouts are great too. Most of their seating is family style on long benches, but they do have some booths. It's always very loud in the smallish shot-gun style space, so it's not the best place to try to have a conversation. Just happily slurp up your ramen and wash it down with a cold Sapporo on tap!
