JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is a welcomed addition to midtown...I live and work walking distance from here and it's great to see more variety and options becoming available in this area.  The place has a modern very upbeat feel to it...I ate by myself for a quick lunch at the bar...The bartender was very friendly and attentive.  I ordered the tempura Brussel Sprouts...They had a very interesting texture and was not too greasy...I ordered that soupless Ramen dish what had great presentation and ended up being very tasty and not very spicy...Next time I may ask them to kick itup a notch...I am glad this place is here and I am sure I will eat here often for lunch and I look forward to exploring the menu... Cheers
