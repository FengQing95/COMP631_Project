Uchi////One of the best sushi places I've ever been too.  Similar to sugarfish in LA. My co worker and I were bummed to be seated at the sushi bar, BUT it ended up being an awesome time! The head sushi chef was also our server and he was fantastic. Really made the experience a great one. Highly recommend and will be checking out the Austin location in August!  fried milk is to die for and I would suggest skipping the hot rock (meat)
