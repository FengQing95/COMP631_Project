Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great food! Highly recommend any of the benedicts and the french toast neat. If you are in a hurry this may not be the best place to go for brunch, since there is usually a wait for a table and it can take a while for food to come out, but if you have time to spare it's definitely worth it!
