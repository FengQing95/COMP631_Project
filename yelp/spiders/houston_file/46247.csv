Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////What a fun place to go! Definitely recommend for the younger crowd as the music is loud and there is a bunch of movement throughout the restaurant. When you arrive at Common Bond you walk past all the pastries, it's impossible to go without ordering one before arriving at the register to order. The restaurant is a seat yourself kind of place. There is a good amount of seating for the amount of space they have, you can sit inside or outside, but I wish they had more tables. When I was in line I was afraid we would order and we would have no where to sit! That's also a great thing as it shows it's a popular place. We ordered a chocolate croissant, it was the perfect amount of flake and butter to match the chocolate filling! I had the avocado and bacon toast. I felt as if I was eating at a farm to plate restaurant as everything on the toast was so fresh! I was a little underwhelmed with the poached egg, it looked poached on top but on the bottom it looked as if it was fried. We also tried the sausage and egg sandwich, let me tell you one word, WOW!! The entire thing was delicious from the buns all the way to the cheese. They have nailed their sausage recipe, the flavors burst with every bite, I could've eaten it all day. They also did not skimp out on the sausage either. I was expecting a thin piece of sausage but it was dense but not too dense where it over powered the entire sandwich. We will definitely be coming back and I will be ordering the sausage and egg sandwich!!
