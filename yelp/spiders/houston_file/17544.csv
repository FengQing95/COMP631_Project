Uchi////Love it..!  Food is out of this world... only downfall is the wait and the price!  Hostess was not friendly and seated others ahead of us.  When asked why we were still waiting after 1.5 hours.. she said your next but it was almost 2 hours.  Waitress was very good and because we were seated so  late.  They were out of the desert we wanted.  We were given a free dessert.
