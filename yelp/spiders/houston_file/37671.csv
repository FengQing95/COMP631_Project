Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food, drinks, and service were absolutely perfect! Our server was Jose, who made the dining experience even better. He knew the menu inside out. He was extremely knowledgeable about all the different whiskeys that Bosscat had to offer. Definitely sold us on certain items without being a pushy salesman at it. I ordered the "Havana Bowl" although the photo doesn't do it justice, the pork was cooked perfectly leaving enough crisp. Also, the Dr. Pepper wings were ahhhmazig! I would definitely recommend this place to others and come back here myself!
