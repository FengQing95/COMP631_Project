Baby Barnaby's////I had the high protein egg white and chicken burrito. The flavor of the fresh guac and tortilla pulled it all together. Service was spot on and the staff was very friendly. My girlfriend had the pancakes and the apple chicken sausage. I had to try some of her plate and was very pleased. Don't skip the sausage!
