Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Fantastic Brunch spot! I've had the opportunity to visit twice and have thoroughly enjoyed my food each time.  On this last visit I had the Flap Jacks....the healthier offering for someone craving pancakes.  They came with scrambled egg whites and chicken sausage patties.  I cleaned my plate and washed it down with a few mimosas.  They offer a variety of flavors in mimosas (pineapple, grapefruit, cranberry, etc) but I went with traditional orange.  Saturday is a great day to visit because even with a visit at around 2 pm, it wasn't overly crowded and with our reservation, there was no wait.
