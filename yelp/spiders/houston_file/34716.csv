Local Foods////Bahn mi was awesome, piled high with pork that was reminiscent of a smoky teriyaki flavor, pickled red onions and jalape√±os. Crusty bread sealed the deal. It comes with 2 sides of your choice: the soba noodles were light and fresh (perfect pairing); the tabbouleh had a mild curry flavor and was my least favorite but still good.
