Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Mudslide Cookie- I love cookies. I love cookies that look flaky and crispy on the outside, but are chewy and doughy on the inside, like myself. The cookie itself was cooked to perfection and you could mush it out with your tongue, but I think my cocoa defense levels were just too low to handle this. Only get if you're prepared for the chocolate haymaker. I didn't giggle too much. Giggle points 6/10
