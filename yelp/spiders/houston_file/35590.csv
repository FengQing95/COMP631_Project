Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////If each item were priced a few dollars lower - say, $11-12 for cocktails and $17 for my entree - I would probably have given it an extra star.  There are just so many options in this city in the same price range as Bosscat that I think deliver a bit more on flavor and execution.  I would be willing to give it another chance though, it is a fun place and a good location.  Wishing them all the best!
