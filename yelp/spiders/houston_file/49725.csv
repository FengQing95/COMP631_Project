Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The complementary cup of coffee in the orange cups at the front was very pleasant! I appreciated that while waiting, but kind of don't get then why you have to pay for another cup when you sit down if you order one. Could i just go refill my orange cup? I am not sure how this is supposed to work here.
