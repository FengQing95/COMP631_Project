Kata Robata////Lobster mac and cheese-- need I say more?  It's delicious!   The ramen was very good (love a good broth!).  We tried the kobe beef skewers (in the specials menu)-- they literally melt in your mouth.  I saw my friends' reactions after they ate a piece and still, I could not resist saying out loud, "OMG this is sooo good."  The last time I was there, the waiter called the toro tar tar (one of the specials) a 'must-have'...well, to be honest, it was good, but it was not a 'must-have'.  The fish and poached egg blended together gave the dish an overall slimey texture, which I imagine would be a turn-off for many (although the taste itself was pretty good).  I generally would recommend trying one of the specials though!  Oh and the scallop carpaccio with goat cheese was excellent (yes, the scallop is raw)!
