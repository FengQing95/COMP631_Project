Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Went to snooze on a Friday morning around 10am. The wait was about 35 minutes for a table and they text your phone when your table is ready. Their is a coffee station set up in front for you while you wait. Staff was super friendly and our waiter Â (I think his name was Aaron) was really funny and made the experience more enjoyable. We ordered the Mm mmm mimosas while we waited on our food. They were pretty tasty and I will order them again. The food was really tasty and flavorful with a nice presentation. Minus one star because there is not enough parking and no valet. Unless you wait for someone to leave you will most likely have to park down the block on the street. Worth a visit though.
