Baby Barnaby's////I like to eat the food at this franchise, I have been going to this particular barnaby's for a years now and let me just say DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!! DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION. Unless you want the rudest service of your life. The Two guys with the orange hair are the RUDESTTTTT SERVERS ON THE PLANET. I absolutely cannot stand terrible service. Every time I come here they are so rude and act like they don't have time for you, they barely come to your table, and walk away before you finish ordering half the time. I cannot tell you how many times I was in the middle of changing a side, or ordering an extra drink, and I was walked away on in the middle of speaking. My boyfriend eventually decided that we wouldn't go here anymore in January 2021, today I decided to give it another try since were so close. The taller, bigger guy with the orange hair approached our table asked us about our drinks, I said I'm ready to order and he WALKED AWAY FROM MY TABLE, my boyfriend and I both raised our voices a bit to let him know we were ready to order AND HE STILL WALKED AWAY. I am sick and tired of the service at this place. I'm not one to write reviews, but these guys suck and give the worst service and are super super rude. DONT EAT AT THIS LOCATION. Go somewhere where the people don't hate their job.
