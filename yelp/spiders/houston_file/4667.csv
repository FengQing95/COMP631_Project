JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First time coming here and it was amazing!! I had the brussel sprouts to start which were super good!! Â I felt like I needed to dip them in something but were amazing just the same. I then ordered the Tokyo Tonkatsu which was out of this world. Service was very good and everyone was friendly. Definitely will recommend this spot to anyone.
