The Pit Room////One and done.  Classic example of how one person can ruin an entire experience...in this case the manager.  Rubs were great.  Okra is excellent.  Problem was one of our beef ribs consisted ENTIRELY of fat.  My brother in law, who brought us here and dines here frequently, went inside about it.  The person behind the counter was going to exchange it, but the manager saw what was happening, came out and said there was nothing that could be done and that all the ribs were fatty...these weren't just fatty (which I like), there was literally no meat.  So, my brother in laws family will never return and neither will mine.  3 generations of two families alienated.
