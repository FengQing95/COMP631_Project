Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////It was okay. We went to Â brunch today for a bday gathering. Food wasn't really good. Our fries were cooked too long and tasted burned. My avocado toast wasn't toasted. It was piece of regular bread with avocado on top. The meatloaf hash tasted scorched so that was sent back. The Moscow mule was sent back as well because it was made with a flat ginger beer. Our server was rude. Threw our food on the table twice. I just really wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
