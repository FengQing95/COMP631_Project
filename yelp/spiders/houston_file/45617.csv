Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First time trying this and was so happy there is ample parking and the food was delicious and I felt worth the price. I ordered the Texas Club with the Parmesan fries and both were very good. The peppercorn aioli and thick slice bacon finished off the sandwich which I really enjoyed. They don't sell fountain drinks but the ice cold water is self serve and comes from this cool tap canister that dispenses ice cold which was great because I have to have my water ice cold. And it was even without actual ice. I will be back for sure and this time save room for one of their gorgeous desserts.
