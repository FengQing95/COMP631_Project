JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The broth is good but it's not really that flavorful but again taste is very subjective, the chicken karaage can be a bit too chewy so you really have to be blessed with the best chompers to chew on it. The drinks are amazing! And the chicken curry can be a bit too sweet. Overall I loved it here and I know that with time this place will get better! Would recommend people to come here.
