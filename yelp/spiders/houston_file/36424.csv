Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We went based on the great reviews. Drinks are expensive but very good. Food was good (although the hush puppies were not great). But we practically ate and ran out of there because the noise level is so extremely loud that it's extremely uncomfortable. You have to yell to your dinner date. The design is such that there are no noise absorbing surfaces at all and sound bounces around the huge seating area. I would not recommend it for a date (or any situation where you want to communicate with your dinner companions, unless you like yelling). Even the servers have to yell at you.  Oh! And a last note, my sandwich was sooooo tall there was no way to eat it but opening it up and just picking at it with fork and knife. It wasn't built  for a human.
