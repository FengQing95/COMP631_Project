Uchi////Brie Ringo 5/5 - That's some salty brie, and the texture was harder than expected. It had the consistency of almost queso fresco. Side effect of frying? It wasn't a bad thing. Plantain chip and mango chutney made for an excellent combination. I think they mentioned apple there somewhere (Ringo = Apple in Japanese), but I can't remember.
