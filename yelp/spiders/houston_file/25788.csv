The Pit Room////Good barbecue, but I really go for the chips and queso. The chips are thin, perfectly salted, and fresh. The queso didn't look right to me, so I was skeptical, but it's crave-worthy. I tried the mac n cheese several months ago. It was ok but a bit soupy. Eying other people's trays on subsequent visits, it does look better/thicker now. I usually order tacos. The chicken tacos are good, but the brisket tacos are better. The brisket is moist, flavorful, and tender, and the portion size is more than I expected. My only complaint is that their salsa, while tasty, is too wet for the taco, so the tortilla becomes soggy quickly. Next time, I'll get it without salsa and add my own at their A+ condiment bar. I don't love the plating. Putting everything on one tray for, say, two people feels crowded, greasy, and messy. But I guess bbq is supposed to be messy.
