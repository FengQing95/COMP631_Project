The Pit Room////Some of the best barbecue my Texan self has ever had! The line on a Friday night was out to the door, but we gladly waited because the aroma as soon as you walked in was so desirable. The line moved extremely fast. Maybe 5 minutes passed and we were already sitting down stuffing our faces. Would highly recommend the brisket - and the BBQ sauce is to die for.
