Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Bakewell tart and pistachio raspberry tart are amazingly delicious! The place is fairly new, extremely well kept, clean, organized, and the employees are friendly and knowledgeable. My friend and I were told the history of why it's called Common Bond- because everyone shares a common bond of well prepared and baked goods. Their butter is flown in from France so hey, I'm down with that if it makes the croissants taste yummy! I did not try any of the three croissants because they were sold out! I will take that as a sign that they are delicious. There is some parking, but limited number of spaces. There was a great deal of seating inside and outside, with decent shading outside. I cannot wait to come back here again. Thankfully, I work in the area and can come by every day. (I might do that until I taste everything on their menu, including coffees!)
