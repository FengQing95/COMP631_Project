Uchi////The food was great, solid, not a bad dish. I really enjoyed the chef's special makimono, having two different types, and thought they were both amazing. Highly recommend letting the chef freestyle your roll! The real standout of the night for me, amongst rolls, tempura, hot tastings, cold tastings, and veggie sushi was the Tom Kha hot tasting (I forgot the name of the dish). It was exceptional! You must try it.
