Uchi////My very first experience was great; our meal felt worth the price. However, the second time around, I felt like they served very generic dishes and very basic selection of fish that I could get at any other sushi restaurant. I will give 2 stars for their dessert and the server Matt. For the price of 1.5 omakase, I would have expected more. Will not be returning to this establishment soon.
