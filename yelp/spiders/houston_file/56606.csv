Kata Robata////Amazing! We went for our anniversary and splurged on the omakase to get the full experience. Our waiter Thai was super informative and knowledgeable. It was a customized dining experience where we told him what sorts of things we like and he spoke with the chef to tailor the dishes to our wants. He gave us a ballpark price range to shoot for and told us when we were getting close to that amount in food so we could decide if we wanted to stop or go for more. There's almost nothing we don't like so we were open to trying it all. I wish I did a better job of remembering each dish and their descriptions as well as taking more pictures, but I was too busy savoring every bite. The sushi and sashimi tasted super fresh and melted in our mouths. Gyoza was delectable. The finale was the wagyu katsu sando sliders and it was so phenomenal, I still dream about it. Not pictured was the foie gras, wagyu sliders, sushi, cucumber ice cream, and dessert.
