JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This was my first Ramen experience and I went within the first week or so of being open. It was incredibly busy and there was about an hour wait time. We were sat in the middle at this long communal table. If you want more privacy I would recommend asking for an actual table when you put your name down. Once we sat down our waiter was very nice but he did seem a bit rushed. I wish they had taken a little more time to explain the whole concept to us, seeing as this was our first ramen ever. I don't remember exactly what I ordered, but it was delicious and had a new flavor with every bite. Just remember, if you order spicy, it SPICY!
