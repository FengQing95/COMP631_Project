Baby Barnaby's////The food is outstanding.  You start with fresh-squeezed orange juice, the best I've had in Houston.  Next you've got your choice of traditional American breakfast dishes, all with a Barnaby's twist.  I'm hooked on their scrambled eggs and bacon; there's something remarkable about the thick-cut bacon they serve, it's incredibly flavorful and has the almost-crisp texture that is as close to perfect as I've found.
