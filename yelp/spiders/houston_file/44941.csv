Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I can see why this place is so good and popular! Think of this place as a really amazing La Madeline. Like a million times better. Went here with some friends the other night and had a croissant that had butter and honey? on top. My friend recommended we try it with coffee the next morning and it was so good. Sweet, flaky, buttery...all the feels for this place! I'll be back to try their savory items which also looks delish. ;)
