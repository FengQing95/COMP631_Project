Local Foods////My friend told me about this place as we stopped by after class one day. I love their sandwiches! So far I have tried the Truffled Egg Salad and Gulf Shrimp & Blue Crab sandwich. Both were very tasty! These aren't normal sandwiches, they have the best ingredients. The portion sizes are great as they come with 2 sides and they are worth trying. I can't wait to come back to try the rest of their menu. Each item seems delightful. Everything looks fresh and tastes homemade.
