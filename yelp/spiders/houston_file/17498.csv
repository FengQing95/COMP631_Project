Uchi////You get frozen milk, a very soft cake/brownie which I think represents chocolate milk, and a chocolate waferish cookie. All of these are 4.5 stars but the fried milk on the side is what takes this over the top. The fried milk looks like condensed milk coated in a batter and fried. When you eat it, it tastes slightly like french toast crunch and it's the perfect way to end your meal.
