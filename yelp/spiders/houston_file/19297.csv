Uchi////Once we were seated, we found our waitress to be very helpful. The menu was a little overwhelming, so my friend and I decided to split the tasting menu, which included 10 dishes. We also ordered the brie and brusselsprouts on the side. Every single dish was amazing! I've never had brusslesprouts, but now I am a fan. The way they cooked and seasoned them was absolutely perfect! And I'm a bit of a brie snob, and found their brie dish just as delicious.
