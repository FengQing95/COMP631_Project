JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ordered Ramen to-go after midnight to bring home, and when I went to eat it, it smelled really strange. I tried it anyway and it all tasted sour. Like really really sour. I've had Jinya before and I know this isn't the norm, but my entire ramen bowl is inedible, which sucks, because I paid extra to add egg and tofu to it. The only thing I can think of is because I ordered it late that some ingredient/s had been sitting out in the restaurant most the day.
