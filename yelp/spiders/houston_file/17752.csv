Uchi////This is the very first review I've ever written, good or bad, about any restaurant I've eaten at before. Having said that Uchi is far and away my favorite restaurant I've ever eaten at. I spent 5 years traveling the U.S for work and eating at every well rated restaurant I could find on yelp and I've never been completely amazed at the quality of the food as I was at Uchi. To be completely straight forward, eating here will cost you big time. I don't even want to mention that because it might detour some individuals, but I've never left a restaurant after spending so much and thought "Now THAT was worth it!" This place is the first and only place I've spent that much money on and left completely excited to Â return irregardless of the price. I took my fiance' here and she loved it as much as I did.
