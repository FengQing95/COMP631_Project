Baby Barnaby's////This is a good breakfast place. I had the Bobs healthy plate and the green eggs plate.  I love the healthy plate because they already have egg whites ready for their customers. I don't need to be one of those healthy difficult  customers asking for sub this and that. The chicken sausage is definitely delicious. Not the most healthy thing on the menu but you got to live a little. It also comes with wheat toast and cup full of colorful fruit...MELONS! I love melons.
