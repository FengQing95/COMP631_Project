JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////When I just stepped out of my seat for 10 minutes after dessert to go to the restroom (there's only 1 stall each for men and women), the hostesses already tried seating another group of people without asking our group if we were done yet. My friend had to tell them she was waiting for me to get out of the restroom before heading out. This was kind of rude of the hostesses to do that. I know seating is tight, but come on!
