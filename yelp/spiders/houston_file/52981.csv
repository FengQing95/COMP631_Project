Kata Robata////We tried the tasting menu.  Everything was good, several things were very good but only a few were outstanding.  Overall a good experience but, for the price, we felt it was overrated.  Not sure I'll be back for the price point unless I have specific recommendations for particular food items to try from trusted friends whose pallets I tend to agree with.
