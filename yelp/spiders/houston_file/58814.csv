Baby Barnaby's////I got the green eggs and it was amazing!  The eggs were cooked just right and not runny.  I swapped out the wheat toast for the biscuits, and I believe that was the right call.  The biscuits were crisp yet fluffy, buttery yet not greasy, with a hint of honey for sweetness.  The potatoes were golden crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  My mouth is total watering right now reliving it...
