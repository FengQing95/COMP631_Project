Uchi////My foodie friend and I started with tender and delicious shishito peppers, and then the parade of excellence ensued: hamachi, salmon belly, anchovies, short rib, foie gras, and my absolute favorite, blue fin otoro. Wow, every single dish was outstanding. The foie gras was sublime - perfectly decadent flavor and texture. The otoro was so spectacular, even at $55 for 6 slices of sashimi, we placed a second order.
