The Pit Room////We also tried almost all the sides including the mustard potato salad, the coleslaw, the elote, and the mac n cheese. I thought the elotes were delicious but a little oily. The mac n cheese and mustard potato salad were also pretty good. The coleslaw was nothing special, but it was refreshing.
