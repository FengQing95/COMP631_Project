Baby Barnaby's////We came here this morning for brunch at 11:30 and got seated at 12:00 so expect a wait and be ready to order when you get it.  The interior is kind of  small which explains the waiting issue.  Not that it was bothering others but we were seated by the entrance doors which constantly slammed and let cold air in.
