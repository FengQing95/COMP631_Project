Local Foods////This was one of the best lunches I've had in recent memory.   A friend and I each ordered the generously portioned 'crunchy chicken' sandwich (very good) along with a side of soup.  I had the chicken posole soup which was spicy and flavorful and full of everything good & comforting about a bowl of soup.  Loved it.  I practically scraped the enamel off the bowl.   My friend got the watermelon gazpacho which was equally excellent and comforting, though a completely different temperature and flavor profile.  Limp, bland soups these were not.  I'm kicking myself for not ordering a portion to bring home.  We shared the house-made dill pickles because we're both from the Northeast and a good deli pickle can be hard to find in these parts.  They were crisp and tangy though perhaps not quite worth the $3-$4 price range for a pickle sliced into quarters.  Minor quibble.  The environment is charming and eclectic, as is the crowd--- students, doctors, moms with kids, business lunchers.   Staff was very friendly and welcoming.   Already planning my next visit!
