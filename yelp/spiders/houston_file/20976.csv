Uchi////Best sushi I've had to date. Each bite is it's own bundle of wonderful flavor! The prices aren't bad either. My only complaint is that the tables are quite packed together to accommodate more and more people as the restaurant is very popular. This makes it very loud and crowded. Last time I was there we specifically requested a booth in the back for privacy and so that we could actually talk without shouting. The food is AMAZING I cannot over state it but the amount of people packed in so close to each other felt greedy. Also, keep in mind there is no walking into this restaurant, you must have a reservation.
