Kata Robata////First time to dine here and the food were awesome except Â for the fresh seaweed we had as a starter. I did not enjoy it as much but the other foods we ordered like the Kobe beef skewers is a bomb...melts in your mouth once you take a bite. Uni king crab spoon is one of my favorites too. Try this one and for sure you wanna come back to dine here. Love the rising sun sushi with my ordered pimm's drink, I went home with a smile in my face since we had a wonderful dinner. A bit pricey but worth it.
