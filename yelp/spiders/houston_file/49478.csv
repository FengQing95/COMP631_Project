Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I met a friend here for lunch on a Saturday. Thankfully, I got there earlier than planned and was able to get our name on the waiting list. It was about a 50 min wait with very little outdoor waiting area. When we got seated, our waitress was nice and friendly, however, when I asked her about the breakfast pot pie she described it as a sausage gravy on a pastry with eggs on it. Sounds good right? Well, when I got it, barely any eggs, and the gravy had carrots and onions in it that was sort of watery. I would not suggest that. I did like the atmosphere and other people's food looked really good, so I will go again. Prices are fairly cheap. Just be prepared for a wait and crappy parking. I parked a couple of streets down which wasn't bad because it was shaded.
