Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My friend and I went here for the first time the other day. We went around 3:00 on a weekend and there was a pretty long line. We ordered an almond croissant and some kind of delicious brownie circle (picture attached below). The cafe has a very clean, French ambiance. Extremely friendly staff. The croissant was a little pricey and would have been better if it was heated (I'm sure I could have asked). The brownie concoction was incredibly rich and definitely worth the price.
