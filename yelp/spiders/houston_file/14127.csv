JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Professor Beans - Thank you very much for the stars. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay with us. And we appreciate your understanding our extended wait times during peak hours, as well as our seating arrangements. And it's true: Our FM1960 location is the largest JINYA in the nation, and has a lot more room for guests and large parties. Thank you again!
