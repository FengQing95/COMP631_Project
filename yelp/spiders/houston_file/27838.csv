The Pit Room////Hands down the best BBQ I've ever had! If you're in Houston and haven't been here yet, shame! Wish I had found this gem earlier. The sides are almost as delicious as the BBQ itself, they have indoor and outdoor seating. We sat on the patio and it was just perfect! Everyone who works here is also super friendly.
