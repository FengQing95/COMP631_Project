Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Good service, sat at the bar.  Tasty cocktails, saw a lot of good food at other tables/bar.  I had the chicken sandwich and French fries.  The chicken sandwich was just ok, should have gone with the burger or pork sandwich as they looked really good.  I'm a French fry snob so these are not for me.  These were more like potato wedges, thick cut, large chunks.  Not for me.
