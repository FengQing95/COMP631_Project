The Pit Room////The staff did not seem very friendly. The meat was OK but not the greatest. The fixings bar seemed like they were trying to hard to make barbecue into shabby-sheek. It was definitely on the high side of what I would expect to pay for what I would consider meager portions sizes. The sauce had a very heavy vinegar taste as well. I don't see myself coming back to this stop anytime soon.
