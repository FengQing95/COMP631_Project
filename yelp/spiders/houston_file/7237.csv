JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////And then came out the main entr√©e. I am not a fan of pork so I chose the Wonton Chicken Ramen (I also can't do spicy what-so-ever). Holy crap. The broth is indescribable. It tasted like fried chicken without the oily goodness. I substituted the thin noodles for the thick noodles and it was the best decision (in my opinion). My boyfriend and our other friends had the vegetarian ramen which I thought was quite flavorful (sometimes hard to get when you can't use meat stock). Another one of my friends had gotten the Tonkotsu (pork) broth. I already mentioned that I am not a fan of pork but damn, the broth was delicious. The pork bits were also very juicy and well cooked.
