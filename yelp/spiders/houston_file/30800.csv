The Pit Room////Very good BBQ w/a twist (a bit of Mexican flavor).... elote corn, jalapeños on the condiment bar with escabeche, & charro beans. Everything was delicious. The sauce  was a bit more vinegar than sweet. (47.00 for two), 1/2 lb pork ribs (3 bones), 1/2 lb of brisket (4 slices with good burn & smoke ring), 4 sides: charro beans (yum), slaw,
