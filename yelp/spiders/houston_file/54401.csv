Kata Robata////Drinks - Their drinks were horrible. they use mixes and its just horrible. I ordered a lychee martini which was pink and I've never seen one that color before. It was too sweet and it didn't have a lychee flavor to it. Then I switched to moscow mule, and that too was sweet and it came out white (almost like milk) which I've never seen before either. If you were to order drinks from here (unless you like sweetness) I would suggest getting something on the rocks or stick to beer and wine.
