JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Pork chashu bowl - 3/5 - Decent taste, poor value. I love this dish, so I was disappointed by the tiny pieces of chashu (nothing like the chunks in the menu) that might've filled a shot glass. For the same price, I could get a regular size bowl with 5x the amount of pork elsewhere.
