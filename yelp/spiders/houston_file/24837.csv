Uchi////Exquisite as always. For special occasions, the chef's tasting is absolutely the way to go. My favorite dish so far was the salmon sashimi with golden kiwi and coconut Thai chili sauce with candied ginger. They have a very great and affordable happy hour though! Also make a reservation and get there early, because there's even a line to wait in for reservations. Also their blueberry cake with taro mousse inside and coconut lime ice cream is ahhhhmazing. The staff is always nice too and all of them (we had many different people bringing dishes) remembered my birthday! I like the cool ambiance too but it is very dim and busy inside
