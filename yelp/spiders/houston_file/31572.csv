Local Foods////Just had the best salad of my life! I know.... How can greens be that good? But trust me... The Winter Harvest Salad was loaded with spicy/peppery greens, toasted almonds, pomegranate seeds, roasted acorn squash, and feta cheese. Throw in THE BEST ROASTED BRUSSELS EVER and you will never want winter goodness to come to an end!
