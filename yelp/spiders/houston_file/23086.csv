Uchi////Ordered two more dishes after that ( Machi Cure: Smoked yellowtail, marcona almond and yucca crisp and Taraba Imo: Alaskan king crab, sweet potato and ikura), again aspects of each dish were good, but not worth the prices. I also waited nearly 30 minutes between these two dishes being served. Apparantly there was a large party in front of my order and again received Â ZERO communication from my server in regards to the delay in the food.
