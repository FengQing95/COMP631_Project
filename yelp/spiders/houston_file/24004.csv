Uchi////This was our first time at Uchi. We came in having no idea how to order, what was good, etc. Anja was our server and she did such a good job walking us through the menu and getting us acquainted with how to order throughout the meal. While we were there, it was during happy hour, so she made sure to point out to us favorites on the happy hour menu.
