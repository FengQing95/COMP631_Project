The Pit Room////The brisket and pulled pork tacos were perfection.  Meats by the half and full pound - brisket, ribs - were simply delicious.  Mac and cheese had a rich taste but not heavy and slaw and marinated veggies were great, full of light vinegar flavor.  We are in town for a few days and we found this place thru Yelp and will be back again before we leave town.  The bar is set high for the rest of our trip!!
