Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Our food took 30 minutes to come out, after our 1 hour wait time. Also, we didn't get the cinnamon roll pancake initially... they gave us two pineapple upside down flavors and one french toast. Then it took an additional 20 minutes for us to get the pancake we actually ordered.
