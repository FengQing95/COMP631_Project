Uchi////Fried Milk Chocolate- toasted milk, iced milk sherbet, this is a very popular dessert so i had to try it.  The Fried-milk that is lightly dusted and toasted was very creamy, and the iced milk sherbert was very 'milky'. The dessert was like a very cold and refreshing glass of cold Whole milk. This was the heaviest dessert of the 2 that we ordered but I really enjoyed it.  It wasn't too sweet, and the dark chocolate compliments the milky flavors.
