Uchi////We have been going to Uchi for years and it has always been a great experience.  This time, we did their curbside takeout as we have twin toddlers and could not break away.  After placing the order, I received a confirmation email with instructions.  I was to pull into one of their street parking spots, click a link in the email, enter the spot number, submit, and someone was supposed to bring my food to my car if they were not already waiting for me.  I even paid a decent tip hoping for good service.
