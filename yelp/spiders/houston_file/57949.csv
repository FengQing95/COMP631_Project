Kata Robata////This is now my favorite and go to spot. Their duck with cold soba noodles is full of flavor and will be my usual order. You must try the foie gras on top of a scallop sushi! Their salads are vibrant and full of flavor. Almost anything you order here won't fail you. Their service is great and they make sure you truly taken care of.
