Uchi////Enjoyed the Mustang and Spicy Crunchy Tuna rolls, but no wasabi, and they didn't wow me. The Brussel Sprouts were my favorite. The Jar Jar Duck was great, and unique. The Pho deconstruction was very unique, but wasn't high on the flavor scale. The Foie Gras left us wanting more of the accouterments that came with the Foie. Fried milk was delicious.
