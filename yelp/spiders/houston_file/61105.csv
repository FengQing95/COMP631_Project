Baby Barnaby's////So when waiting to be seated and I'm thumbing thru the Yelp photos, and one dish keeps popping up over and over--Green eggs with chicken apple sausage and potatoes.  There are literally hundreds of pics on the Yelp listing for this plate.  So on seated, I'm wanting so desperately to order something different, but then I realized that hundreds of people just can't be wrong.  Or can they?  Guess I was fixin' to find out!
