JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////However, there are some things that I would like to point out: 1) Why charge an additional $0.50 to make the ramen spicy? I think it was just spicy powder. I could've just used the spicy sauce available on the table at no additional cost, 2) The pork meat was overcooked in my Tonkatsu black. I was hoping that it would be more tender, 3) It was quite pricey for ramen in general. I must admit, though, that the quality of the ramen does partly allow for it to be priced higher.
