Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Aside from the amazing chocolate chip cookie, I also really like their Kouign-amann. Crispy, flaky and sweet, with caramelized sugar on top, this is another one of my favorites here. Their almond croissant and chocolate croissants are also good, but I wasn't particularly blown away by them compared to other French bakeries around town. Their macarons are decent too, somewhat larger than normal. I tried the citrus and the salted caramel. Salted caramel was good, but I would skip the citrus next time.
