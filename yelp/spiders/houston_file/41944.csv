Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Slick design and really cool place to be in is my first impression. Drinks were nice imo. However, what scored to me was their cakes and dessert. They are so good that there would be barely anything left when you arrive late (I mean like 2 hours before the closing time)
