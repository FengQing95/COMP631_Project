JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Anyway, this place reached my expectation. It is as good as it gets. The atmosphere kinda reminds me of a lounge. It's kinda dark and "romantic" and classy. Unlike Samurai Noodle (which is bright) this place kinda gives me the feeling that I could drink sake and I wouldn't know time passed.
