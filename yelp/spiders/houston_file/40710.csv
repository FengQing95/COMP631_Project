Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////When we arrived I stepped up to the hostess stand where three employees were standing and talking amongst themselves and there was a very awkward moment where they stopped talking and turned to me silently until one them finally and very flatly asked "can I help you?" I won't take Â time explaining how the exchange went but it wasn't good by any means. But I think the overly loud music and very dim lighting may have contributed to the uneasy exchange, because the entire time we were there the only way to communicate was to low-yell everything you had to say or lean in very close so you can hear. Once seated we were given free water that was SO Houston... very bleachy.
