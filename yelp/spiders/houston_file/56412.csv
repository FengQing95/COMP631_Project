Kata Robata////* Cold soba with shaved truffle and braised Wagyu (8th). Ugh. Such a satisfying main dish on top of all the wonderful things I had eaten previously - this put me over the top, but it was so worth. The truffles provided *just* enough earthy goodness, and the Wagyu...well, you can't really ever go wrong with Wagyu.
