Kata Robata////I really only like sashimi & nigiri sushi, so my review will be on that.  Twice now I have had the Kata Sushi Platter, which to my delight changes every time you go.  The cut of fish is just the right size for nigiri sushi.  It's not too thick or thin.  Their rice is by far the best in town.  Normally I find at other places, the rice either falls apart or the fish is sliced in huge portions.  Sure the platter of 10 pieces is $31, but it's probably the best nigiri you're going to get outside of a Michelin starred restaurant.
