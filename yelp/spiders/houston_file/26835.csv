The Pit Room////Delicious BBQ, definitely one of the best the best in town. The bark on their brisket is thick and the smoke ring is perfect. Everything is made from scratch, daily,  and the flavor proves it. I've gone several times,  and they always have mac and cheese, but the other sides seem to rotate,  which is fine with me,  because you can't go wrong with any of them. Last time I got two tacos,  one a pulled pork with an avocado cilantro cream sauce,  topped with cojita cheese and pickled onions. The other was a brisket taco,  and I wolfed that down before being able to pick out its ingredients. Get some sweet tea! Or some great local beer.
