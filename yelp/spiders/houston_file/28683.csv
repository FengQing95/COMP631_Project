The Pit Room////Great brisket if you know anything about good barbecue you know to look for a good smoke ring. The meat is really, really good here. I had a brisket taco, and the flavor was solid: smoky, meaty, and not over-seasoned. The pulled pork sandwich was good, too. The Brisket was the best bite- Easier to eat than the ribs and given you are elbow to elbow when you sit down, being easy to eat was important. It had a pronounced vinegar base to it reminiscent of North Carolina BBQ, which was a bit of surprise, but it mixed really well with their basic sauce. Very casual spot, with the option of eating outside, and deservedly popular with the locals.
