Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I really love the "light as a feather" portion of their menu as it highlights healthy breakfast and brunch items. And these healthy items are still so innovative and delicious! My favorite dish is the Spring Has Sprung egg white frittata. It's so good that you don't even need to add avocado!
