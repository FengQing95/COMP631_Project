JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Rand - Thanks for the 5-star review! We appreciate your understanding with our crowds during peak hours and glad you're accommodating of our community table (not everybody is a fan of the seating arrangement !). But your last sentence encompasses our one and only goal when it comes to our establishment: We want every customer to walk out of our restaurant happy and satisfied. Full stop. Thank you.
