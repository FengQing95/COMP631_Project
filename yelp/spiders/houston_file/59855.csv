Baby Barnaby's////I love trying new places so I went on Yelp to find one. Baby Barnaby's is freaking awesome!! I had the green eggs (eggs with cheese, spinach, and artichoke hearts) and they were the best eggs I have ever had! My bf had the migas and he loved them. The restaurant is tiny but worth any wait you might have. So delish!!
