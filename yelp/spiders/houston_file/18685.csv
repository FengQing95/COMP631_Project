Uchi////Amazing! The wait was long, but well worth it for the experience. Servers really take their time making the experience special. We had 8 dishes, including the walu walu, and shag roll which were delicious, a roll with a scallop that was like butter, and the fried chicken was an unexpected winner. For dessert we had the fried milk, peanut butter one, and the lemon sorbet- definitely save room for dessert. Fried milk is a must have! Will def be back to try everything else!
