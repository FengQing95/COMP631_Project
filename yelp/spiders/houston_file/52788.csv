Kata Robata////For some ungodly reason, we opted for dessert and chose the coconut creme brûlée. It came with this mango-ginger sorbet that would have been better off omitted - I didn't care for it but my boyfriend didn't mind it. The creme brûlée had a really good flavor but unfortunately, was made improperly. It did not have the right consistency: it was soupy rather than custard-y.
