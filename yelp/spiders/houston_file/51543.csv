Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We came here for breakfast after early church service. I got the pancake flight & my husband got the breakfast burrito. (Too many choices!) Neither of us could finish our meals- the servings were very generous. We had trouble stopping eating even though we were full - the food was so good! Service was quick & efficient. We definitely will be back & we will recommend this to friends & family. One caveat- you may have to park on the street, if their small lot is full, but that wasn't difficult & we parked 1/2 block away,
