Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////3.5 stars. as lovely as i think this place is, you have to keep in mind that it's a trendy & upscale bakery/coffee shop/brunch spot and the prices will reflect that. there is nothing wrong with paying a little extra money for a coffee and nice environment sometimes, but i'm trying to be more mindful about getting sucked into spending ridiculous amounts of money for simple food items that would cost just a few dollars if not less to make at home. if you're looking for somewhere that is "instagrammable" and don't mind shelling out $5-7 for a drink and $15-20 for a brunch meal, you won't be disappointed. but i do think that it's a high price tag for what you get, when you strip away everything else (environment, music, etc.)
