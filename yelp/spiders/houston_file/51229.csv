Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Once in our booth, someone came to get our drink order. After a bit longer, we ordered our food. I opted for the steak and eggs benny, as did my husband. We also ordered a pineapple upside down pancake to share bc who comes here and doesn't order a delicious Snooze pancake? My son got a kids pancake meal which came with a fruit cup and hash browns. He got their pancake of the day. I can't remember what it was called but it had melted white chocolate chips in it amongst other flavors. He ended up enjoying it. I loved my steak and eggs benny. They cook it all just right. The hash browns are delish. The steak was tender. Everything was good! It's always great at Snooze!
