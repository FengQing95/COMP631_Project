Baby Barnaby's////the food was good, but the wait was incredible. this was for breakfast on a Sunday. the staff also wasted our time, and called us to seat then proceed to be like "oh wait you need outside seating?" when we had put specifically that we needed to be seated outside for our dogs. So after they called our names we had to wait an addition 30 minutes. Fantastic.
