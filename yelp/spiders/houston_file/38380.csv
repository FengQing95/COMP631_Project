Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I refuse to eat here. The music level is deafening. I would have loved to see what all the hype is about but my friend and I walked in, looked at each other and walked out. We went right across the driveway to that other restaurant in the parking lot. The music volume is absolutely ridiculous.
