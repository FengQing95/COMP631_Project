Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////It's is great breakfast/brunch restaurant when you have time. They have activities (checkers, bean bag toss, etc) to help the long wait go by faster. The text updates are helpful while you are waiting. Hostess and servers are always nice. Food is good. Pancakes are amazing - the pineapple one is yummmmmm
