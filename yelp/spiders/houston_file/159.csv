JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your review of Jinya Ramen Bar.  I'm sorry to hear you were disappointed by what you ordered.   We offer 12 different kinds of ramen on the menu and each with its unique toppings and flavors.  The Tonkotsu Black you ordered is a pork based broth (which will be a bit cream colored) and it's topped with wood ear mushrooms, green onions, garlic black oil and two pieces of Chashu pork slices.  We don't add chicken to the Tonkotsu Black.  If the egg wasn't to your liking due to being overcooked, then my apologies.  The relentless pursuit to cooking the perfect soft boiled eggs continues.
