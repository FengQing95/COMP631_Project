Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////What a great place for Sunday brunch if you like don't mind loud music. We walked in and was immediately sat by the host. I got the chicken fried steak (8/10) it was enormous! The only thing missing was a side. I wish there was Mac and cheese or mash potatoes to compliment the steak. Our server Terry was hilarious and helped us navigate the menu. He was the best. Music was on point and playing all the right music. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Bosscat and I can see myself come back here often.
