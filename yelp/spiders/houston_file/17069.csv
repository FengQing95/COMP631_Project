JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love Jinya. This location is usually great. Today the spicy chicken ramen tasted like fish my husband said. He didn't like that. My sprouting up ramen with pork broth only and skinny noodles was on point. I love the Brussels sprouts in it. I always eat them first. The chashu here is always too fatty for my taste. I still come often bc I love it.
