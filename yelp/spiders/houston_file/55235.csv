Kata Robata////On the 4th we decided to celebrate our daughter in laws birthday while she and our son were down.  Ahh. The 4th where the traditional meal is good ok ribs or steaks or burgers served from the grill.  So what does our daughter in law choose?   Yup.  Sushi. Hmmm.   Since we love her we took the family to the Kata Robata ( that sounds eerily like a song from Styx). The waiter was very helpful recommending blah blah blah and whatchamacallit.   Our daughter, son and daughter in law seemed to like the choices so we got them.  Pretty good even for an ol boy who prefers fried.  Our birthday girl - loved it.  Which made our son happy. Which made mom happy. Which makes me happy.  So, highly recommend this place!!!
