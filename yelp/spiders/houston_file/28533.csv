The Pit Room////Seriously, everything was delicious. Pork ribs, brisket, coleslaw, potato salad, and Texas toast made up my 2 meat meal. It was a ton of food, perfectly BBQed. Brisket had quite a lot of fat which makes for delicious flavor but meant less meat than the others in my group who had less fatty cuts. Still completely worth it.
