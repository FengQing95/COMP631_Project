Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////- Cajun Brick Chicken: This was the most perfectly cooked, tender, flavorful, nicely seasoned chicken I've ever had the pleasure of eating in a restaurant. The chicken was super moist and my boyfriend rated it as "excellent and damn awesome". Honestly, this is my ideal chicken and rice dish. It is a little spicy, but I like a kick to my food.
