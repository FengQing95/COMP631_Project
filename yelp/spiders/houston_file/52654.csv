Kata Robata////Fish quality = Amazing. My boyfriend got the sashimi plate, which had 12 big slices of fish, including some of the freshest and most tender yellowtail I'd ever had, along with 3 different types of dipping sauce. Considering that single servings of sashimi on the menu were going for $2.75 each, 12 slices of quality sashimi for $18 actually wasn't too bad.
