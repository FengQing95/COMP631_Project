Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We came for dinner and cocktails. The restaurant has a great vibe and the service was good. The drinks were tasty. They served the old fashioned with an ice block, which I love. I ordered the BC Press, which was good, but I swear it tasted like there was mayonnaise on it, although not mentioned in the description. The fries are thick cut and cooked crisp, which were yummy. The mac-n-cheese was fantastic too!
