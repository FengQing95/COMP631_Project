Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The manager did reach out to me to try to make it better but unless they go back to their old techniques... it just won't be the same. I imagine with 4 locations in Houston now, they probably centralize some of their production in order to scale which might be the reason for change in process.
