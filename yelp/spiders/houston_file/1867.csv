JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Ramen F. - Thank you for your review. Unfortunately, due to our size, demand far outweighs our supply of seats, especially during peak hours. The Tonkotsu Assari is still available as an "off-menu" item -- just ask your server. We have not changed serving portions as all sizes and quantities are standardized by our corporate headquarters in Los Angeles. Thank you again for the kind words, and we hope to serve you again soon. And happy birthday to your aunt!
