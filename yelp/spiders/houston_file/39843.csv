Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I went here awhile back but had not taken a moment to write my review. I think this place is a cool place to hang out at and meet a friend for a drink as they have a great cocktail menu (great selection of whiskey for you whiskey lovers). However, I decided to order the famous fruity pebbles French toast and I wasn't head over hills for it. I'm not sure if I had expectations or what but it was average. I think it's beautifully decorated, clean, and plays decent music but the food didn't do anything for me. Enjoy the drinks though!
