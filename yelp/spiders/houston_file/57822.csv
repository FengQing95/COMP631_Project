Kata Robata////One of the best dining experiences I've had in a few years. Don't be fooled by the exterior, very nice inside, should be a stand alone restaurant. The atmosphere was full of refined energy, the service was exceptional and the dishes did not disappoint. The Texas Kobe Beef skewers were heavenly, wonderfully flavorful and melted in your mouth. The Texas Wagyu Katsu Sando was not bad but paled in comparison to the Texas Kobe. The Miso Crusted Bone Marrow was a must try for uniqueness, not bad but different and you need coaching to eat or in terms of the sauce accompaniment. As we ordered family style, I don't remember some of the dishes but took pictures and they were delicious. We are from San Francisco and I would fly back to Houston just to dine at Kata Robata.
