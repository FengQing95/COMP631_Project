JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had the JINYA bun, and their chef ramen special of the day. The JINYA bun was soft and delicious, and the slow-brased pork had a wonderful flavor. The ramen dish itself was very flavorful, vibrant, and fresh. My favorite part was the fact that they have a wide variety of extras you could add to your ramen. I would definitely recommend you try this place out if you have never tried real ramen before!
