Uchi////Still it turned out great. We ordered the 10 course omakase and Uchi did not disappoint. They gave us a choice of vegetarian (if you want that) and the 10 and 8 course omakase. Of course we took the 10 course. We selected a 50-50 split of raw and cooked selections. Since it was our anniversary, they actually slipped in an 11th item - so thanks for that.
