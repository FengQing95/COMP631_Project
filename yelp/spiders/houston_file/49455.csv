Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great place for some breakfast food. They have a little bit of everything so everyone is happy! Great choice of eggs Benedict, pancake flights and Â burritos. They have fresh juices as well. This place gets very very busy so its best to come early, if not be prepared to wait at least an hour..
