Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is a belated review. I ate here several weeks ago and decided I ought to post a review since I have praising Snooze to my friends. I had wanted to try some of the new breakfast places popping up, but I am not a morning person. It never occurred to me that they would be open for lunch. I know, DUH. A friend and I drove by looking for a place to eat for lunch and to my amazement, (DUH), Snooze was open.
