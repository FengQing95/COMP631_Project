Kata Robata////I really wanted to try the lobster mac and cheese but I decided to try my luck on the bone marrow. I have no idea why I chose it, as I don't even eat bone marrow when my parents have it in soups at home. But I figured it was worth a shot....actually I decided to get it based on some reviews! It was.....different, but not bad! The server told me how to eat it and I didn't mind the texture or fatty taste, I even scraped it all off the bone. But I'm pretty sure 3 tablespoons of bone marrow scraped off isn't enough food for anyone, even a tiny girl like me. Shoot, I was even trying to tear the remnants of meat off the bone! I'm not sure if it's supposed to be an appetizer or entree, but it seemed like it was priced as an entree (around $14).
