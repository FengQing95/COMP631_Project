Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Love this place. I try something new (OMG French Toast, Benny Benedict, Chilaquiles Benedict, Cinnamon Swirl Pancakes) every time I go and everything has been out of this world. When you come, be prepared to wait and drink some mimosas while you get seated. I have gone at 7am on a Monday and had a wait time!
