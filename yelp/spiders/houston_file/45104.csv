Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Stopping by for some coffee to digest in between meals, Common Bond has a sleek and comfortable atmosphere with some great pastries and coffee. I also had some of the best espresso ever here which is apparently from a nearby partner roaster. Unfortunately some of the best pastries were sold out since it was already mid afternoon but I'm assuming the almond croissant that's mentioned so much in reviews is stellar as well.
