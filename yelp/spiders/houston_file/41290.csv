Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Well they do not always have them.  My husband drove there on Friday to place a large order of croissants to be picked up on Monday morning to take to Austin.  I get it they need a day off so he drove back from Austin Tuesday night to pick an assortment up Wednesday morning to take back to Austin.  When he arrived Wednesday morning as the first customer he was told that they threw all the chocolate and almond croissants away because they "didn't meet their standards."  REALLY???  All of them??
