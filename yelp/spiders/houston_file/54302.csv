Kata Robata////! Terrible service! Terrible front desk without basic respect to customer! They are even.not.honest and make a lie quickly to fool customer without thinking! The front desk even told the manager the same story she made without facing  the mistakes her  coworker made and fixing the problem. The manager spent 5 mins comunicated with me  and realized their font desk made mistakes. What a terrible experience! IF YOU WANT TO HANG OUT WITH SEVERAL FRIENDS IN THIS RESTAURANT, BE SURE ALL OF YOU CAN SHOW UP TOGETHER OR COME VERY EARLY TO AVOID WATTING!  ORELSE, MAKE RESERVATION. Need basic training.and professional ethics screening before hiring  front desk! Eveybody's time is valuable!
