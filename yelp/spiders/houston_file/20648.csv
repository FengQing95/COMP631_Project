Uchi////Came for their happy hour with a friend of mine and it was surprisingly not busy (our waitress thought it may be bc it was a Sunday and the last weekend of the rodeo?).  Who knows, but got lucky and snagged a table right away.  I told the waitress that I was a vegetarian and could she recommend anything?  She then proceeded to give me a FULL vegetarian regular menu AND a happy hour menu!  Say what?!?!  I think I over ordered because I was so beyond excited by all the options.  I ordered two sushi rolls from the happy hour menu and the brussel sprouts and fried milk from the regular menu.  EVERYTHING was amazing.  I must give a special shout out to the brussel sprouts though.  I mean literally you have not tasted brussel sprouts like this..smothered in some amazing sauce.  After my first bite of food, I knew this place was something special.  The sushi rolls..oh the sushi rolls..this place can truly do vegetarian sushi.  Most places "try" with an avocado roll...Uchi is so much more then that.  I urge you carnivores to give one of their vegetarian rolls a try.  Finally, the fried milk was one of the most unique desserts I've ever had.  It was served with this chocolate mouse type of thing and ice cream.  Delectable...truly delectable.  They also gave us a sample of a new dessert they are trying out.  It was a cream with dippin dots (remember from back in the day??) and strawberries on top.  It was delicious of course.  My friend got two rolls and another appetizer as well.  We weren't in the drinking mood.  Our total bill?  $55 dollars.  Not bad at all!  Happy hour is definitely well worth it.  Wish it wasn't just from 5-6:30 PM.
