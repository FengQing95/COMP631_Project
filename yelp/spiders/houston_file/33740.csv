Local Foods////This place is the bomb! Oh my goodness! Awesome location, Awesome food, Awesome Service! This place definitely impressed me tonight after my run almost killed me. Everything was tasty! I had the Salt-Pepper Roast Beef sandwich. I wasn't too crazy about the bread but the inside of the sandwich was quite a treat! I had Kale, which in my opinion if you can make Kale taste good you have skills in the kitchen (It was recommended, I don't typically get things i don't like...). Lastly, something almost as important as the food, the drinks! I like how they had all Texas Craft Beer, which is great, but on top of that they had Dublin fountain drinks! Not too much of a soda guy anymore but when i see Dublin i can't say no!
