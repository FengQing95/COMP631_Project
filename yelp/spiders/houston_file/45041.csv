Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Howlin Rays in Los Angeles might be leading the Nashville style fried chicken sandwich revival, but if you are stuck in Houston, shhh.... don't tell anyone. Hidden on the menu here at Common Bond Café and Bakery is one kicking fried chicken sandwich. The pastriesWe tried and  everything that I saw coming out of the kitchen looked amazing too!
