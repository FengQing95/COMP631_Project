JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////In terms of our ramen, however, I suppose the essential error on our part is that our server should have been able to notify you that our chefs can custom prepare your noodles how you like them. Though you are correct -- as you definitely seem to know your ramen -- that our "default setting" for our noodles is al dente. Numerous guests request "Hard Noodle" or "Soft Noodle," though in fairness, these tend to be our repeat customers. In addition, we also offer "Less Salt" as an option for the broths, as well.
