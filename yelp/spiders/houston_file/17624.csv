Uchi////The food here is amazing- even better than I've had in manhattan. Each small dish is a masterpiece and well worth the wait to get in. The staff were awesome and are a great resource for navigating the menu. I would return in a heart beat. If you can't get a seat at the table, definitely sit at the sushi bar and make friends with the sushi chef who can custom make rolls based on what you like.
