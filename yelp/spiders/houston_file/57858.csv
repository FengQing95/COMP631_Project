Kata Robata////Spontaneously decided to try this place as we were driving around to find somewhere to eat for dinner. We came on a Monday night around 7 and the wait was only about 15mins which is nice since reservations are highly recommended. The oysters were delicious and left us wanting to order more. The kobe beef skewers were sooooooo soft and flavorful. The hamachi and jalape√±o sashimi was ok. It didn't really stand out compared to other sushi restaurants that serve it for half the price. The ocean roll was veryy good and rolled beautifully. We got the green tea cheesecake and the cheesecake was very soft but not as sweet as I'd like. Buttttt the red bean ice cream that came with it was very sweet and very good. I wish I could've ordered just the ice cream by itself!
