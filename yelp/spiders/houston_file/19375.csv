Uchi////Pitchfork: I don't think it's possible to go wrong with anything with wagyu beef (especially if it is cooked sous vide) and rolled with avocado and topped with fried leeks. The wagyu beef is like butter as it melts in the mouth. The fried leeks (although a little on the oily tasting side) provided a nice crunch.
