Kata Robata////Kata Robata is one of our favorite sushi restaurants in Houston - the quality of the fish is always excellent, there is a large variety on the menu, and the prices are not crazy.  It's a good spot to go with your beloved, or with a group of friends, just make sure you get there early if you are going with a large group (especially on a Friday or Saturday night), because the place gets packed!  There is a small bar at the front of the restaurant, but it gets jam-packed, so getting drinks while waiting may take a bit.
