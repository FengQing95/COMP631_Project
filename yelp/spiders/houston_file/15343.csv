JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place used to be my absolute favourite ramen place in Houston. Recently though, I feel like the quality has gone down? Not sure, but the flavors don't pop out at me like they used to and the broth feels too thick sometimes. Still my go to because it's still the best we've got in Houston, but I think unless they up their game someone else will come along and steal the throne. Oh by the way, I'm Japanese so I guess you could say I have a pretty high standard for ramen.
