The Pit Room////I was hungry and decided to go somewhere I haven't tried, we agreed on the pit room, The food was Luke warm, we ordered we ordered 3 meat and frito pie. The chili has no favor and the chopped beef was Luke warm. There wasn't any place to sit so the say you can go outside under there heating lamps to eat, keep in mind today's weather is 47 degrees, I wasn't please with the food but it's edible and like I started out saying, I was hungry. I ate enough to stop my hunger pains
