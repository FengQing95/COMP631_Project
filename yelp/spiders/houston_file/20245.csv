Uchi////This is the best sushi you will ever eat and I'be tried it many states and Australia. The presentation is like no other. The desserts are to die for every time. The Old Fashioned cocktail is superb and I'm a southern. I never would eat raw fish until I went here. I was playfully tricked into trying it and now I a huge fan. From the valet parking, to the knowledge of the wait staff, to the bartender, to the main chef, this is the most fun you can can have eating and the new one in Dallas is the new hot spot. I've sent many people there and they all agree!
