Local Foods////Finally visited this fine establishment we keep hearing raves about. You order first then find a seat. It wasn't as crowded coming on a friday around 2:30pm. I ordered the duck confit sandwich with quinoa and kale. The duck confit with melted goat cheese and cranberry jam is amazing. I thought the combination of the flavors in this sandwich was a great mix. I savored every taste of the split sandwich. As for the 2 sides, the kale was a tad plain and nothing spectacular. I liked the quinoa as I ate it with my sandwich.
