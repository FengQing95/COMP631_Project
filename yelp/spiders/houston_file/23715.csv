Uchi////I will say that some manager was willing to comp our food for us having to wait so long, which is why I'm giving three stars instead of one. I just don't know if I'll be willing to try it again. There are sushi spots around town with bigger portions and cheaper prices that don't leave me hungry after an almost two hour dinner.
