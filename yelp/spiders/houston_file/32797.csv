Local Foods////The only drawback with this place is the parking ! I've had to leave twice because there was nowhere to park (not even street parking! I was willing to walk 3 blocks but there was nothing!) I know this is out of their control, but it's pretty sad leaving your house thinking you're going to eat something yummy, and coming back to cook something crappy because you couldn't find parking :-(. #houstonproblems
