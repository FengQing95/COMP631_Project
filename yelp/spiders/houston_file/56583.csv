Kata Robata////I was most excited to try the fried Brussels sprouts since I love the one at Uchi, comparison is key. But I was a bit let down when the taste was just okay, maybe I prefer the one more due to the strong but subtle citrus. This one felt lackluster. Since we're talking about things that I wasn't a huge fan of, let's continue. The yuzu salmon carpaccio and Kobe beef tacos were just okay as well - as far as the tacos go, I guess this isn't exactly a place that would excel in that type of fusion.
