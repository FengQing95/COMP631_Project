The Pit Room////I've been to The Pit Room plenty of times and I can't believe I have not reviewed this place. The 5 stars shows already how much I love this place. BBQ is on point and so are the sides, their elote (corn) is one of the best in Houston! I always can't wait to come back here. Also they do have patio so if you like to sit outside.
