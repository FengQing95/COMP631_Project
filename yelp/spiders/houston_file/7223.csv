JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Kristin - Thank you for your kind review. I'm pleased you enjoyed our ramen, though I apologize for what sounds like a misstep with your to-go order. Please message me privately with your personal information so that the next time you come in, we can give you a complimentary Spicy Chicken Ramen. We appreciate your business and understanding and look forward to serving you again soon.
