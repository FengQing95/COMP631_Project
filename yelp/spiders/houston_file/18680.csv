Uchi////back to food - DO NOT COME HERE HUNGRY.   the portions are ridiculously small.  im not asking for a porterhouse steak, but c'mon dont stiff me with 4 oz and tell me to feel like i just ate.  through $68 worth of food, there may have been all of about 500 calories.  i am not making this up, when i got home i had to make something to eat ... and im a small dude!  they say their entrees are about "5 bites", but thats nonsense.  it even looks embarrassing on the plate when they come out with this comically small portion and tell you "dinner is served."  gtfoh
