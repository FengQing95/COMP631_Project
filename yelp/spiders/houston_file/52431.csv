Kata Robata////Kata Robata stands true to its name.. they can serve up fantastic sushi and very fresh sashimi alongside cooked options for those who aren't in the mood to commit to just raw fish for the night. My only critic would be that the sashimi peices were a little on the small side, even though the presentation on each serving was very pretty.
