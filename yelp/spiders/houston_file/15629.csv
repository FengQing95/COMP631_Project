JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Servers suck. Super loud. Takes forever to get your food. Not quite sure what all the fuss is about, we live close by but yet can't seem to bring ourselves to go as much as the flock of zombies that cram themselves in there. Waiting for a table 10-20 people on the street? C'mon. I love ramen, but it's not that good. But hey if they want their ramen, cool. Good for them. Don't get me wrong, food is ok, ramen+broth+chicken. Cool. But we have had consistent BAD service every time we go there. And we have been there, I'd say, 10 times, and take out at least the same amount. You have to beg for someone to be nice to you (bartender is so unpleasant, I cringe when I have to pick up my take out) and take your order. It's loud, like really loud (cool, nbd to some and I'm sure some people like the bustling loud, but after a long day I'm not into shrieking and screaming about my day across the table), and again, service sucks; they are almost always mean to you, it's not that they are just busy, we've gone when it's not busy and they are they same aloof, don't-give-a-f^ck-attitude. I've watched them stand around in the corner and joke around while we sit and wait to even be acknowledged; and hey I get it, have fun, but be nice to me, serve me, we have almost gotten up and left before because no one comes to our table to even give us water. I have stopped a random waiter before to please-take-our-order-because-we-are-starving-to-death-waiting-for-anyone-to-come, lol. I've had to force myself to give 20% tip sometimes but grit my teeth and do it even though they usually don't deserve it. (And I'm always a 20%+ tipper)
