JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////While in Houston I stopped in for dinner due to the great reviews, and this place did not disappoint! I got the chef's special ramen (spicy miso) with a seasoned egg and add on salad and pork dumplings. Food is super, super good! Chalon is a great bartender, she made me a specialty drink that was the perfect compliment. I'll be back!!
