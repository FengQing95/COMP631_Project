The Pit Room////Why is The Pit Room's brisket so much better than other places? It's how they smoke the meat, that's the best explanation I can guess. If you go, be sure to get a moist portion. The hickory flavor is sharp and flavorful (those of you who might not want such a salty spin may find it a bit much, though).
