Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We loved this restaurant! The food and atmosphere were both amazing. Â We had the red velvet churros, smokehouse benedict and short ribs chilaquiles and all three dishes were delicious! We had reservations so were seated immediately right by the whiskey room which was really cool. We will definitely be back and would recommend to others!!
