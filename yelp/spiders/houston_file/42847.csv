Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is my second update--I'm changing my review to 5 stars because I've been finding myself comparing every other pastry I have to Common Bond's.  Even when I was in NYC and went to the famed Dominique Ansel bakery, I thought, "This is really good, but Common Bond is even better."  I'm still not a huge fan of the line, but their pastries are simply the best!
