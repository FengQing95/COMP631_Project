Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Super cute place in montrose, had such a good time there. the service was amazing, & everyone was very welcoming. I told my server it was my first time so he suggested I get the OMG French toast. OMG French toast LITERALLY made me say omg. Definitely worth the long wait time, will be back soon!
