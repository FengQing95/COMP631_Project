Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Pork Belly Poutine- So this was my first poutine experience and considering I had nothing to compare it to it was AMAZING! (Pro-tip: get the fried egg on top...thank me later) between the rich creamy cheese, the savory pork belly, and egg it was a foodgasm going on in my mouth.
