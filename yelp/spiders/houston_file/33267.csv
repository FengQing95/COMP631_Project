Local Foods////I have pretty much had every sandwich here. My favorites are the crunchy chicken and truffled egg. I was disappointed with the duck confit, the duck was dry and cranberry too overpowering and sweet. It is also their most expensive sandwich. Â The market veggie is a great choice if you're a vegetarian. This is probably the only place I actually like to eat cauliflower because I absolutely hate it. You can order 2 sides or a soup with your sandwich. I go for the quinoa and kale salad or a cup of soup. They change things out seasonally.
