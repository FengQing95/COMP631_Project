Kata Robata////LOVED Kata Robata! First time experience there last Saturday night. My boyfriend and I went for a late dinner and had not made a reservation prior. We enjoyed drinks at the bar which delivered fabulous service. Sat down at a table about 45 minutes later to order dinner. For an appetizer, the Hamachi and Jalapeno Sashimi was recommended by our waiter and was PERFECT. We had the Texas Hamachi roll and a Sashimi dish for entrees. You cannot go wrong ordering from here, it was a perfect night out and will definitely be returning :)
