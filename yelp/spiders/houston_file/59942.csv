Baby Barnaby's////My dining companion also orders the pumpkin pancake.  It isn't on the menu year round, but damn it is good and the cooks will make it for you anyway if you request it!  Yes, I said pancake, as in a singular pancake.  This baby is huge, enough for a meal really, and bigger than your face!  It is delicious as well as fluffy!
