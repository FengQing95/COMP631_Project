Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I got a mimosa, the mushroom chilaquiles, and of course, the infamous fruity pebbles French toast to split with my boyfriend. Mimosa was good, when is not good? Haha the chilaquiles was good, but not something I would come back for again and again. The showstopper was definitely the French toast. We were able to get the bacon on the side since I'm a vegetarian, but damn, it was so good. Definitely recommend the ice cream on top if you get it! I would definitely come back for that yummyness.
