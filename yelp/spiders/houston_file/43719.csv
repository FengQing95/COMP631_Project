Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've wanted to go here for a good two years now, and I just got around to doing so! I was NOT DISAPPOINTED! The cafe is super cute and parking is very easy to find (it's in Montrose, everyone knows how difficult parking is in that area). I went for a late lunch with my friend, and it was pretty packed! I got the common bond burger, and she got the beef borguignon (I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS, IT'S SO GOOD). After we ate, we got some pastries to take home, and o.m.g, the pistachio croissant has to be, hands down, the best croissant I've ever had. I am definitely coming back, very soon, for round two.
