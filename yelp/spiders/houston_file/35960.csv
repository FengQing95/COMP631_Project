Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////For dessert we order Chocolate Bourbon Pot de Creme: I love desserts, and of course I want chocolate. By the time I got dessert, I was so full I didn't know why I ordered this. It is chocolate pudding in a milk jug. The flavor is ok, nothing special. It's not something I would get again.
