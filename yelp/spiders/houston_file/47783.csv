Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I went with my husband and daughter for late brunch on a Wednesday.  No wait.  Greeted nicely by hostess.  Sat in back with server Zach.  Ordered coffee.   Hot espresso machine not working.  Coffee was brought.  No water.  Asked for water- still no water.  Ordered food. Zach did not seem happy to be helping us.  Food came- still no water or refill on coffee.  When food came- it was delivered by a runner.  Asked again for water.  Zach did not come back to table until it was time for us to pay.  Food was good- hot.  Pancake was a bit over top (Peanut butter sauce drenched the cake)- happy that it was gluten free mix.  Not sure about cross contamination though.  Hash brown had a bland taste. Too much hype for the food for me. Service was less than expected.
