Uchi////Our waiter, a long haired guy named Matt, greeted us with warm towels for our hands and their water which he mentioned the purify using reverse osmosis in-house, which was a fun fact. We ordered some drinks and looked around the menu. After reading a lot of reviews I decided to let Matt decide what we should eat for the evening...and we made a great decision by doing that. Overall we had about 12-13 courses ranging from "good" to "oh my god". Nothing we had disappointed. My girlfriend wasn't a fan of one of the dishes, but that was just because she doesn't really like overly citrusy flavors. I on the other hand loved everything. Some highlights were the Avocado Nigiri, Thai soup with some kind of white fish, and the toro....oh god, the toro. Also I cannot recommend the fried milk dessert enough. Easily one of the top 2 desserts I've ever had.
