Uchi////-The Pitchfork: One of my favorite rolls on the menu (though I highly recommend the Biendo as well as the Ham and Eggs roll) the Pitchfork consists of the tastiest, most flavorful wagyu beef I have ever tried, topped with crispy, salty leek confetti shavings for a sharp green flavor, and melded together with creamy avocado... Oh, My!
