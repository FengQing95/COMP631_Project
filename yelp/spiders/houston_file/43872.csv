Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Tried a few pastries from Common Bond today.  Considering all the hype that has been around this bakery, I was a bit underwhelmed with the pastries that I tried.  Although I found some to be quite good, others were lacking.  Went at around 12:30 pm, and there was about a 5-10 minute wait to order and 5-10 more minutes to receive my order.
