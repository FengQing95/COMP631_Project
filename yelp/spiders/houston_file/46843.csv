Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I have to agree with all the glowing reviews.  Phenomenal breakfast.  Houston was needing this!!! The breakfast pot pie had the most beautiful sunny side egg and was so tasty.  Trio of pancakes was great too.  I can't wait to try all their offerings.  Only downside is that this place is going to be packed for a long time.
