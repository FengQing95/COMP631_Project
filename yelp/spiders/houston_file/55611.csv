Kata Robata////The true winner here is, surprisingly enough, the lobster mac and cheese.  Yeah, I know it's a Japanese restaurant and this dish is anything but.  However, I'm a connoisseur of "gourmet" mac and cheese and this was definitely one of the best I've ever had.  The serving is large enough for an entree but is very rich so you might want to share it and then eat some other less rich food with it.  It is creamy, perfect level of sharpness, the lobster in it is perfectly cooked, and it's adorably plated with the lobster shells.
