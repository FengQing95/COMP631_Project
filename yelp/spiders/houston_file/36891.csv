Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food is definitely on point. I accidentally ordered the brussels sprouts and surprisingly really enjoyed them - I thought I always hated them, but I guess I have just been eating them the wrong way. The food simply tastes "fresh" and has a unique pairing of flavors. While the drinks seemed to be on the higher priced side, the presentation had thought to it. There is definitely a lot of alcohol in the mixed drinks - I felt like I was wafting pure alcohol as I drew the drink to my nose - but the actual body of the drink had a complex flavor.
