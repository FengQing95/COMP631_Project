Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Expect to wait at least 45 minutes if coming on a weekend (especially a holiday weekend! :)) but the complimentary coffee and water is nice to have while waiting. Service isn't extremely attentive but it was packed so it's understandable. But the food was AMAZING! trying the pancakes and hash-browns is a must. 10/10
