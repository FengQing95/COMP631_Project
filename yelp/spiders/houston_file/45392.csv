Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Similar to the croissant, but this time with two sticks of dark chocolate in the croissant. If you thought the croissant is large and fluffy, this one and the Almond croissant, grab two and it's the size of my head. The chocolate was right. Not too sweet. I'm sure they used Valrhona chocolate as they had it for their mochas and hot chocolate. Though I feel the proportion feels off. Part of me wants to crumple that croissant so that it would be denser, but maybe that's just me.
