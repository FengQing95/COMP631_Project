Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Had a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. It was ok but not worth the $3. I also had the soft scrambled eggs. Very disappointed. Mixed with grits but the texture was soooo soft it was like loose grits. I love soft scrambled eggs so this was not even close. The baguette with it was tough.
