Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The way the ordering system is set up makes it seem as if there's unnecessary wait time added to the time you wait to get your fresh goodies (well worth it). If they get their ordering thing sorted out or adjusted to be more efficient I would be here every day.
