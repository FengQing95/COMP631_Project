Uchi////My favorite was the sake namida (which unfortunately I wasn't able to get a picture of - as we devoured it immediately). I ordered the hot rock and the sake salmon sashimi which was phenomenal. The only thing I could possibly say that wasn't all that wonderful, was probably that the hot rock wasn't hot enough to cook my meat, but as soon there was mention of it, it was immediately replaced. So all is well.
