Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Although it was tight quarters, I have to say that this place was fairly organized.  You have to come earlier than 8:30, otherwise you will wait for more than 2 hours.  We only waited 50 minutes and thank God there are things to do outside and the atmosphere is comfy.  Parking was simple and with it being in the Montrose area, you would think the opposite.  I love the alert system, very up to snuff.  You can pretty much go anywhere within walking distance to pass the time and then you'll get a text.  Better than the buzzers that only have a certain range!!
