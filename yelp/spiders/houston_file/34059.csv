Local Foods////The falafel was meh. A little spicy, which was cute, but I'd say definitely not the star player here at Local Foods. Chicken posole was good though -- warm and peppery. The salmon was good, but didn't particularly stand out from other smoked salmon sandwiches I've had (as in I could probably make it myself.)
