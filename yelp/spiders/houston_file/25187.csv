Uchi////My husband and I traditionally have a knock-down-drag-out-year-end-date-night, which is how we ended up here last night. In classic 2020-COVID fashion, we arrived to this meal mentally and physically exhausted from the week and had zero desire to make any decisions. Thankfully, we had the good fortune of Aziz being our server and he took care of everything. We sat back and he had plate after delicious plate sent out to our table with perfect timing. We had flounder. We had 72 hour short ribs (twice, actually). We had Walu Walu. I don't even know what Walu Walu is, but holy mackerel it was amazing. Even Uchi's basic sushi rolls are unbelievably good. Each delivery to our table had a simple, comprehensive explanation for how to eat each dish to maximize the flavor. "Pinch this with two fingers and eat with the protein facing your tongue." "Be sure to get a slice of orange with each slice of Ahi." "The foie gras is on the rich side, so we'll send this one out close to dessert." I've eaten some good food in my life, but never have I watched a restaurant staff work in such perfect harmony to ensure my entire dining experience was as pleasant and enjoyable as possible. It was truly something special to witness and to experience.
