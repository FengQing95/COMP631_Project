Uchi////I tried the 10-course chef menu, and most of it tasted amazing. I'm not sure if I would recommend doing the chef menu or just ordering off the menu. On the plus side, there were a few dishes I loved that I never would have tried. The hama chili, chicken karaage and wagyu beef were awesome. The sushi and sashimi were good, but not worth all the hype this place gets.
