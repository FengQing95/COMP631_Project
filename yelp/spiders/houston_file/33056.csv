Local Foods////I found this place on yelp. Was sold when I saw Kale Salad. I ordered a double order of kale salad and the chicken poblano soup. Simple fresh and wonderful. And the guy that took my order was so nice to me. (I was having a bad day; he was having a bad week. We bonded.) He gave me a free orange mint juice that hit the spot. Â I even found parking. Maybe my day is looking up.
