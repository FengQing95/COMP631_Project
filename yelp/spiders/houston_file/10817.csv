JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Dr. Liz P. - Thank you for your review. We appreciate your kind words, and I am not sure what may have caused the smell you mentioned, but we have asked our resident plumber and maintenance crew to look into it. There has been severe, ongoing construction all along Elgin, Louisiana and Milam, and just yesterday I saw that the construction had broken a water pipe. So who knows what exactly is going on with our surrounding streets!
