Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////You would think this is something you could pass up and well I thought so too until I unexpectedly had one in my box. Like all the croissants (with the exception of the fruit croissant), it's the flakiest, fluffiest, butteriest croissant you'll ever have and you won't be able to stop. The layers are so thin and it's like eating a buttery cloud. I keep saying buttery because you'll 1) taste it and 2) feel it all over your lips during and after. You won't need chapstick for the rest of the day.
