Uchi////Not that impressed by the sushi here. There's def better options for sushi in Houston. I got the shag roll and it was pretty small, not that flavorful either. Our table ordered the shishito pepper and our mouth was on fire!!! They told us it's the season-- they're a bit spicier than usual, but wow...we wanted to ask for glasses of milk. The ambiance was really nice though, loved the vibe. They gave us free dessert and it was decadent (not sure what it's called though).
