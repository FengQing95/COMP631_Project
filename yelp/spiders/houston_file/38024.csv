Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////OMG!!! I love this place! The vibes are amazing! Really nice decor and friendly staff. I went on Sunday Funday and they had great music and the atmosphere had the best energy. The pitchers of mimosas where great. The food was just ok not great but good. But I would say all things considered amazing experience! Be prepared though it's a little pricey be ready to pay for that experience!
