Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I came because if the reviews but the short rib had a bit too much nutmeg spice from the potatoes in the dish and just way too much sauce. The kimchi which im use to, just had a spoiled smell to it. I don't remember kimchi smelling like that. I dunno maybe I just tried dishes that weren't for me. The pasta dish didn't have much to it. The service was very good though.
