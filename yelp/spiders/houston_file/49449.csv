Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place gave me all kinds of life!!! Yes the wait made me want to get back in the truck to leave...but glad we stuck around. Yes...do go with the pancake flight, for many reasons. These are not your ordinary pancakes. We tried the pineapple upside down (OMG...food-gasm stuff), flavor of the day (peach, white chocolate, and berries, mascarpone), and the sweet potato pancakes. The sweet potato pancakes have this nice fresh ginger taste (i.e., think hard core root grinded; as does the cream on top I wanted to lick) and then get this...thick pieces of sweet potato. Never seen that...brilliant! Normally it's blended fully. The pineapple upside down was our favorite. Imagine fresh pineapple with crisp brown sugar throughout with a cinnamon cream on top. My view of pancakes will never be the same. We also got the OMG French Toast...was tasty (but still recommend the pancake flight over it). In addition, we had a side of scrambled eggs (solid) and chicken sausage (super tasty). WE. WILL. RETURN.
