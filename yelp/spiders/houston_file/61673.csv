Baby Barnaby's////The staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. They were precise, clean and cautious. We sat outside, with enough space between us and the surrounding tables. The food arrived so quickly. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. One of the best decisions of our trip... quick and clean service, fresh and delicious food at an amazing price. Thank you!!! Will definitely return in the future.
