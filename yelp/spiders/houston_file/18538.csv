Uchi////Visiting from Orlando, FL. The is not your normal average sushi restaurant and can get very pricey serving very small dishes. The service at this place is impeccable! From being greeted at the front door, to being seated, the staff was all very attentive. Water cups were constantly being refilled by any worker walking by and saw that you water level was low. If you got up to use the restroom and left your cloth napkin on the table, any waiter/ food runner/ any employee walking by would neatly fold it on the table for you. The menu is updated frequently by the chef to offer the most fresh fish they have for the day. Between two people, we ordered about 13 small dishes/ sashimi to try, one glass of wine and one beer. Our bill came out to be $250. Needless to say, the food was fresh and the fish melted in our mouth. The food came out one plate at a time but very quickly. I had the Fried Milk for dessert and it was delicious! Chocolate mousse with ice cream, cookies and cream flavored chocolate. Mmmm definitely will come back!
