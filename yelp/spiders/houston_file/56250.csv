Kata Robata////One of the couples ordered the pork belly and papaya salad for the table to share as a starter. It was super delicious and an awesome way to start the meal. My fiance and I each got salmon, yellowtail, and eel sushi and decided to Texas Hamachi and the Tropical Spicy Tuna rolls. The sushi was very fresh, and I really loved the eel. The rolls were a little disappointing. I guess they are trying to showcase the freshness of the fish, but both were underwhelming on flavor. We finished the meal with the green tea souffle cheesecake. It was also nothing to write home about. Overall, I was really impressed by the fresh sushi at Kata, but wanted a little more flavor and wow factor.
