The Pit Room////Excellent smokehouse bab-b-que.  Not a midwest or southeast style, more of a tex-mex atyle based on the sides offered.  Fresh ingredients prepared well.  All of out meals were extremely tasty.  One suggestion would be to offer a selection of sauce.  The sauce is well balanced and a good addition to the meats, but not to everyone's first choice fir flavor.
