Uchi////So many restaurants have unfortunately gone downhill during the pandemic...not Uchi. We celebrated another anniversary here, our first in-person dining experience during the pandemic. All of the food was outstanding (just like it was before). The servers took great care of us and made our special day feel magical. I'm so appreciate of this place. It's my favorite restaurant in the entire city.
