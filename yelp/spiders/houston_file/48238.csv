Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Can't find friendlier servers anywhere. I came 8AM Saturday morning before a long day of hiking Rocky Mountain National Park and after waiting a half an hour after ordering food I was going to miss my transportation to the park. I told my server and he was apologetic and gave didn't charge me for my drinks. I was determined to try Snooze so I went again Sunday morning (even earlier) to grab a seat at the bar and try it again. This time, my meal came out in 15 minutes and was delicious. Their menus is extensive so can be overwhelming and I was I had the opportunity to go back and try some more options. I had the chicken sausage and egg and paired Â it with some hash browns. My server kindly recommend a delicious green habanero hot sauce which add the right amount of punch to the meal.
