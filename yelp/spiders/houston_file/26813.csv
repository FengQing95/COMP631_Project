The Pit Room////Why hasn't anyone told me about this place!?!? A small BBQ joint in Montrose and it's some of the best BBQ I've ever had, c'mon, who'd keep this spot a secret!? Honestly, the best time to get here is right at opening, and even then there are people waiting for those doors to swing open! It's understood once you get in, the flavors, the smell, and the atmosphere is perfect! Order it all! Haha but really, I don't think anyone is ever disappointed here! Service is pretty quick even though there's always a line, seats are plentiful and I love the outdoor seating area on the high stools! I think you can even sit next door at the watering hole (the name escapes me) Good authentic Texan BBQ... getchu some!!!!!
