Kata Robata////We were a party of 3 with reservations during a Tuesday noon lunch. The reservation honestly didn't seem to make much a difference. Why there was only one slow airhead chick working as hostess during lunch rush is beyond me. Clearly she needed help but none came to assist even when the line was out the door.
