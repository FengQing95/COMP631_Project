Uchi////I have heard people rave on and on about this place for months.  I was super excited to come here.  I had an amazing time tasting a little bit of everything here on my visit.  I came here on a Sunday evening and to my surprise there was no line and no wait.  The place however inside was completely packed.  We got lucky and got a table upon our arrival.
