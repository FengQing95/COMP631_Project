Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place is AH-mazing!!!  Not only is the atmosphere so fun with cheery, high-energy employees, but the food is outstanding.  I attended the soft opening benefiting Heroes for Children this morning with five co-workers and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience.  We ordered and shared several entrees including the Breakfast Pot Pie (all I can say is wow!), the Snooze Classic (think traditional breakfast), the Chile Verde Benny and a flight of pancakes (ingenious idea bcuz with so many pancake varieties offered, you can't pick just one!)...worth every bite.  We tried the chocolate chip, blueberry and traditional pancakes.  Could have possibly been the best pancakes we've ever eaten...just wow.
