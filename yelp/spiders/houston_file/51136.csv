Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The pancakes are a must. Get the flight and try three different flavors.  Trust me.  The pancake's are like fluffly white clouds, almost cake-like.  And some of the pancakes (peach and blueberry) had crumble over it which was like sweet angel dust.  Sweet sweet angel dust on fluffy clouds of heaven.  I was full, but I kept eating. and eating. and eating. Typing this is actually making me crave more pancakes.
