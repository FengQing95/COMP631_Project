Uchi////Although the sushi was exquisite, I wouldn't come here unless it were a very special occasion. Even sake social (happy hour) will leave a huge hole in your wallet, and you'll have to order a lot of items off the menu to satisfy your appetite if you come hungry because the sushi typically comes with only 3-4 per dish. We probably ordered the entire menu on accident lol. I did looove the ambience inside though.
