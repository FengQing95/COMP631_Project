Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I went on a weekday and we got seated immediately. I ordered the Snooze Classic breakfast vegan-ized. Sub tofu scramble for egg, choose soyrizo and ask to omit butter. Make sure to mention you want to vegan-ize, the waitstaff are knowledgable and will make sure it's right! This breakfast was awesome, and deliciously rich...a little on the oily side, but 10/10 would get again. Great condiment selection, including Yellowbird hot sauce and Sir Kensington ketchup.
