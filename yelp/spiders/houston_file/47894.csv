Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I have been to many Snooze locations in CO, CA, and TX and sadly this location has been the only disappointment to date. I am clear my order is a bit complicated and even communicated this to the waitress as I have had issues in the past. I asked her to write it down and let her know the way it prints out on the ticket in the kitchen is odd - so I asked her to speak with kitchen about the order. With all of this prep to try and avoid an incorrect order - it was still messed up. Then I was charged full price for my meal and got a simple sorry bout it from the waitress. I really hope that the franchise doesn't lose its customer service and "snooze" vibe as the company expands into more markets. The food is great. I would definitely recommend checking it out. Hopefully your experience will be better than mine.
