Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The menu here is so extensive that I knew upon laying my eyes on it that I would come back for more breakfast galore!- gosh, who came up with all the cute dish names? Love the fact that you can order two types of Benedict or 3 types of pancakes. The smoked salmon and Belle Bella are great. The much touted OMG! French toast was underwhelming though, not thick, rich, or sweet enough thus a 4 star instead of 5. Can't wait to try their Breakfast Pot Pie and Pancake Flight the next time.
