Kata Robata////If you want to save money at lunch, get something off the lunch menu. My last lunch visit, for the two of us, it came out to be $100 (no alcohol). We were quite full (as much as you can be full off of sushi) with one lunch combo, 3 appetizers, and 3-4 rolls. MMM DELISH. You'll be fine ordering only off of the lunch menu and drinking water. ;)
