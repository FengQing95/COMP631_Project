JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Iliana - Thank you for your review. We appreciate your taking the time to give us a review. To address your main point, our ramen dishes are designed in a methodical and deliberate manner that takes into account taste, overall appearance and restaurant economics. Some of our bowls come with seasoned eggs and some do not. We don't offer eggs by default. That said, I believe we offer additional toppings at a reasonable and competitive price. We appreciate your visit, and we wish you the best.
