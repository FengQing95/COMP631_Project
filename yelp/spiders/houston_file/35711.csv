Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Terry aka Chocolatte is absolutely amazing!!!! The service is impeccable, and the food was amazing! The fries were to die for, and I loved the shaven pork chop sandwich! Terry took fantastic care of us. He surprised me with the Kentucky Orange Blossom, and I absolutely loved it! I'd definitely recommend Bosscat and will be back! Thanks Terry!!!
