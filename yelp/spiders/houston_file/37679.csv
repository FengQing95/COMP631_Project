Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First time visiting Bosscat. The food and service were amazing. The Bartender Dan was very I knowledgeable about the menu and the drinks that were being served. The atmosphere and decor are a cool combination of rustic and modern tastes. I would definitely vist Bosscat again, solely based on Dan, the bartender's service.
