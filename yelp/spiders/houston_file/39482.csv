Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The manager comes over with a look of shame in his face and proceeds to apologize to us and says I just don't know what to say all I can do is apologize this is very embarrassing. He doesn't even offer us anything for our troubles or offered to have us come back again or anything (Not that we would but it's the gesture that matters) At that point we were just extremely frustrated and decided to leave obviously we did not pay.
