JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The Brussel Sprouts appetizer was a bit disappointing. You mostly just taste the batter and that didn't have much in the way of flavor. As someone else mentioned, it was small cuts of the vegetable which seem to get lost in the batter. You really have to douse them in spice/sauce to enjoy. I'd like to go back and try the other appetizers though.
