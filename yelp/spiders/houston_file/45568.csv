Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Spent the weekend in Houston and had my favorite meal of the entire trip here. I had the crunchy salmon entree and my aunt ordered the beet salad both were delicious and portions were generous. The space is open and inviting and on a sunny day the patio is an especially nice place to sit and enjoy your meal. Will definitely visit again the next time I'm in town, especially since I didn't get to try the gorgeous looking desserts!
