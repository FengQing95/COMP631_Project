The Pit Room////They had a sign at the front of the line saying the special of the day was Wagyu tri-tip ($10 for 4 oz) which sounded too good to pass up so we ordered it. It appeared to be cooked perfectly, rosy red center and juicy. We couldn't wait to try it. But, no lie, it was the absolute chewiest piece of meat we had ever put in our mouths. We literally had to spit it out because we couldn't chew it and to top it off it had zero flavor. So that was a huge fail.
