Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Literally love coming here for brunch! Today I had the Bella Bella Benny-- probably my favorite Benedict from snooze ! Today the bread under the eggs was a little smaller than usual which was unfortunate. The eggs were great though. Tried the vanilla almond matcha latte and it was delicious ! I love the alternative milk options snooze has!
