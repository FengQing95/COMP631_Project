Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food is good, but not worth the 2+ hour wait to get a table. Be open longer or at least offer a waiting app like most new places do. I used to order take out as well which was great when it took 10 minutes, but the last time they said 20 minutes which actually took 40 minutes. I wouldn't have minded the extra wait time if the people weren't so rude. I arrived after 20 minutes after stopping at Starbucks only to be reprimanded by the hostess that I'm not allowed to bring my Starbucks cup inside the door while I wait for my food. Which was ridiculous. If the food was ready after 29 minutes like they said I wouldn't have had to "inconvenience" them with my Starbucks cup. Insanely stupid.
