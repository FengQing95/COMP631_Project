JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First of all, don't expect that many options from the menu. The number 2 item was the one I got and it was delicious (I forgot the name, it was kinda weird lol). The soup from the ramen was a bit to salty but the quality of the ramen is awesome. Their service is great too, the waiter refilled my water a few times. We came at 8:30 on a Friday night but the wait surprisingly wasn't even that long. I will come back again.
