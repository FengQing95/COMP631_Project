Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I gave 3 stars b/c the food I ordered was good, and I might go back in a few months after the "new" has worn off. I will say I was pleasantly surprised by the reasonable prices. BUT this place pretty much hit all my pet peeves about restaurants - 1. Very loud music making it nearly impossible to carry on a conversation or hear the server 2. Inadequate waiting area inside (esp since it started pouring down rain 10 mins after we arrived) 3. inadequate parking 4. atmosphere of barely controlled chaos among the staff.
