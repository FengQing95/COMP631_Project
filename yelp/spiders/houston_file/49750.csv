Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place is good, but I don't really get all of the hype. It's a pretty traditional breakfast/brunch restaurant, that for some reason always has a 45min-1hr wait. All of the food I've had was consistently good, but there isn't anything that really sticks out in my mind as being phenomenal.
