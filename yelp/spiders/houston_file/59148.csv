Baby Barnaby's////Service was really hurried; we didn't have enough silverware most of our meal; I never got to order a fresh squeezed orange juice after the waiter missed me the first time. Later on, as I watched my friend trying to fish no fewer than a dozen seeds out of his orange juice, I kinda decided it was a good idea that I didn't get to order it.
