JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Sydney - Thank you for the excellent review. We are so glad you enjoyed your stay with us and that you are one of our "JINYA Regulars." We also appreciate your feedback regarding our wait times and seating arrangements. There's an old adage in our industry that "No restaurant is perfect," and we would never claim to be as such. But we do our best to accommodate our guests to the best of our ability. For what it's worth, we have five more locations in the greater Houston area with many more on the way.
