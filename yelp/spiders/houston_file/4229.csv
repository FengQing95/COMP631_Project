JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This was my second time at Jinya Ramen,and I gotta say it was even better than the first time. I ordered a Jinya Tonkotsu Black with extra bamboo and fresh garlic. It was absolutely delicious!!! The consistency of the noodle was just right, not too hard nor too soft. The broth was so creamy & flavorful. The only thing I didn't like about this place was how the egg came as a whole, I wish they would cut it in half for me. Â
