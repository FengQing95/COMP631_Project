Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I have nothing but great things to say about his place. The decor was beautiful, the staff was friendly, and the food was amazing. I will say the food style was a little off putting. I wasn't sure if it was southern inspired because there were also some Asian inspired dishes. However they were good. Sonya was my server and she was awesome.
