JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We were fortunately seated quickly so we could leave the bar. Management apologetic for her attitude. Ramen was AMAZING. The other staff were brilliant, I left with mixed feelings about the restaurant and based on the bar tenders service, this review is fair, I won't return.
