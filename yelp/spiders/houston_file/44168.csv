Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Now, I must mention about their interior because it's absolutely beautiful. It's got big windows which allows a lot of natural light! Remember that they're closed on Mondays..I always forget that and somehow end up dropping by only on Mondays(oops..) This place definitely lives up to the hype and I highly recommend!
