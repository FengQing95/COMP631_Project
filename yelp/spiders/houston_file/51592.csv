Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////A tip my waitress left me that might be helpful to other vegans is that if the hash browns are rounded in appearance, like they have been cooked in a cookie cutter, that means they have butter in them. If the hash browns are flat (see pictures), that means there's NO butter in them and they are vegan-friendly.
