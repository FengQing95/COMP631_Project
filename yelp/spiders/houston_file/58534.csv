Baby Barnaby's////The absolute worst part is the bathroom. There is one toilet in the women's bathroom in the back corner. I don't advise waiting outside the door because you'll most likely get hit by the men's door. It is by far the weirdest bathroom I have ever been in and seems as though it was an afterthought for whoever constructed the place. It's in a 6 x 6 room with about 6 inches to spare (if that) between the wall and the edge of the toilet. It's very hard to maneuver so I'd recommend waiting to go to the bathroom if you decide to get Barnaby's Baby Caf√© a try.
