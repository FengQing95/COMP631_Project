Uchi////Hama Chili, Maguro Sashimi and Goat Cheese, Uchiviche, Machi Cure, Jar Jar Duck, Hamachi Nabe, Walu Walu, Jar Jar Duck, Bacon Tataki are all unbelievable.  (There are others that I haven't listed because I haven't tried them and they are probably just as perfect.)  These dishes all have a combination of flavors that you can't experience anywhere else in Houston.
