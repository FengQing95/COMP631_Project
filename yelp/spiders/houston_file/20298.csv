Uchi////After eating at Uchiko twice in Austin, the Houston Uchi location left me disappointed. The quality of the food was just not there. Flavorless, uninspired tiny portions of nothing. I've never seen smaller nigiri portions in my life. We gave up and left hungry after spending $120. That's just not acceptable. Won't be back to this location. Spend your money elsewhere.
