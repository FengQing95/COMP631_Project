Kata Robata////I had my first omakase experience here back in June. It was a wonderful experience, they serve 8 courses, with a good mix of hot and cold items. A standout is the wagyu beef with the egg on it. Amongst the negiri and sashimi I enjoyed the salmon and the Sebring the most. I didn't like the uni or unagi (eel) too much, but everything else was excellent. Some of the more exotic stuff like pufferfish is seasonal so they might not have every single fish.
