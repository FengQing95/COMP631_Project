Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I was really excited to come back here... I came for lunch once and the food and atmosphere was fantastic, we were shown the little whiskey room and it was so much fun. It's my best friend's birthday and we decided to come since the brunch menu sounded amazing. However, oh my god, the music should not be this sound on an early Sunday morning! We asked to be moved and its loud no matter where you are in the restaurant. We then asked if the volume could be lowered, but the waitress told us the DJ didn't. As it turns out, they have a DJ playing every weekend morning, and the owner demands that the music is loud... That's just outrageous. It's lunch, not time to party. It's too early for this. Everyone is shouting to each other, adding to the noise.
