Local Foods////Get your lunch here every day. The garden sammie and the egg salad sandwiches are my favorite-- I can't speak about the meat sandwiches because I'm a vegetarian but I've heard good things. The seating is comfortable, you're never sitting in the lap of the couple next to you. The genuine regard that the management and staff show towards customers is astounding. Just once, a mistake to my order was made (it happens to even the best when busy) and they corrected it without any resistance, hesitation, or frustration-- something I can assure you is not common among restaurants these days.
