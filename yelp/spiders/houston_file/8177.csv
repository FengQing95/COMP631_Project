JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////UPDATE: You are very awesome for bringing your grandma to dine with us. She seems like an awesome person, and I'm willing to bet she's supremely funny, too -- what a smile! As hard as we try every day, we don't always hit the mark with everyone who comes through our doors, but every now and again we get feedback like yours that makes everything worthwhile. You're the best.
