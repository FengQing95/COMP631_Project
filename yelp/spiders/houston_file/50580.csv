Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////They really know how to prepare a good looking plate of food. I ordered steak and egg benedict and my girlfriend got the breakfast pot pie. Both were well decorated. My steak was grade A quality. The food is well seasoned but it gets a little over the top. It's a well balanced dish after all. It comes with asparagus and baby tomatoes. We also got the yummy Blueberry Danish Pancake. Which is quite delicious. It comes with blueberry and cream sauce. Doesn't taste too sweet.
