Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////OMG Snooze! I love you. Doing the pancake flight or the benny duo lets you try all the things. I went on a whim and tried the rosemary blue corn pancakes - delicious! If you don't have a sweet tooth, however, I'd avoid the peanut butter or key lime pancakes. I also got a dirty chai (or something that was an alcoholic chai) that was a little too sweet for my liking.
