Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This is a $$ restaurant with a $$$$ staff and concept, without the white tablecloths. Value far exceeds its price point. I was blown away by how inexpensive the tab ended up. If you are a foodie in Houston, and enjoy the complete dining experience, do not skip this establishment. They get my highest recommendation. If I could add a couple stars, I would. I have never felt more welcome in a place I haven't been before (and few I frequent). I don't want to downplay the food. Excellent! We will definitely be back.
