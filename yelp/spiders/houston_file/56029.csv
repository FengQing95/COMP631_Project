Kata Robata////I use to eat here quite often as a date night spot when we lived in town, but now that I'm not living in Houston anymore, it's definitely a go-to spot when I am in visiting! I LOVE their entire menu!! Drinks and food. Everything is delicious!! I've honestly probably tried 80% of their menu already. My favorite sushi spot so far.
