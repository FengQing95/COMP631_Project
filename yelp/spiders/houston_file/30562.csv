The Pit Room////I was excited to try some Texas bbq and this place was a lackluster. The line was out of the door. I don't know why. Everything I ordered was just okay. I ordered ribs, brisket, puked pork. First of all you order your food cafeteria style, the guy takes his hand and grabs a handful of pulled pork out of the pot with his gloved hand, he put one pork rib on the tray like seriously one damn rib?! Then we ordered the macaroni and cheese, beans, and potato salad as the sides. The rib was not tender at all The brisket and pulled pork was okay. The sides were bland. I really didn't understand the hype with ppl standing outside in the rain for it. It's small on the inside too so it's best to take your food to go if it's busy. I felt rushed while eating, the cleaners kept asking if we were done eating as if they needed us to go so someone else can sit down. Wasn't for me but may be for you.
