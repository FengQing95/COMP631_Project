Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went to this place for lunch with a co-worker and we opted for the restaurants weeks menu (which you probably should do to so you contribute to the Houston Food Bank). We both had the crab cake as first course, this was a winner, excellent dish. Second dish was the ribeye steak, dissapointing, underwhelming, we both ordered medium rare, we both got well cooked, both of us, so this is a systematic problem (the ladies in the next table did too). Service and atmosphere were good so I may go back for drinks when I don't have to go back to work, maybe drinks and crab cakes !
