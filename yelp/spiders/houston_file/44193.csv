Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Food - We came to pick up some macaroons for our friend, and ended up walking out with a couple of huge chocolate cookies, some almond and regular croissants, some chocolate crème cupcakes, a sugar-dusted roll (forgot the name), and of course a dozen macaroons.  We would have ordered more items but they were out of some things.  Ok, now I know why the line went out the door & the wait was so long.  Everything we ordered turned out to be amazing.  I'll start with the cookies.  They were over an inch thick in the center, the size of a coaster, and packed with chocolate & walnuts.  Ten seconds in the microwave and it instantly becomes freshly baked.  I added a glass of cold milk and lots of guilt.  Much better than the big cookies I had at the Levain Bakery in NYC.  The croissants were also large, but also buttery and flakey.  And that sugar roll?  I dunked it into my morning coffee the next morning and immediately realized I should have ordered enough for the week.  Yeah, those macaroons were pretty good too.  2 Stars.
