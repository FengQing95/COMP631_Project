Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food was probably really good but it was too rich for my taste. Very heavy meat and potatoes style. Everything we tried was bursting with flavor. Unfortunately, the pork chop was very dry. If you decide to eat here you better be very hungry. 12 Hour Beef Short Rib, Red Velvet Churros, Fried Apple Pie! Â
