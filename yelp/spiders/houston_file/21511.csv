Uchi////This may be, by far, my favorite restaurant in Houston.  The only drawback is that it is difficult to get a reservation.  If you're lucky enough to score a few seats at the small bar, sit there for dinner.  The bartenders are awesome and they'll definitely lead you in the right direction for food.   If you have the time and budget is not an issue, sit down at the bar and let them order for you until you're full.  They'll also offer suggestions on wine and sake pairings with your food.
