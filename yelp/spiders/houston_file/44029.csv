Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This has long been one of my favorite places in Houston. I consider myself a bit of a chocolate chip cookie connoisseur (all-time favorite being Levain Bakery in NYC in case you were wondering) but Common Bond definitely has my favorite cookies in town (Tiny's Milk and Cookies is also great). The walnut chocolate chip and the triple chocolate are both phenomenal. Also tried their biscuits for breakfast recently and they were fluffy, light and delicious. Their pastries not only look gorgeous but taste delicious as well. I've had the Quiche Lorraine multiple times which I love. I'm sure some Texans are unhappy with the portions which are rather small, but I think it's a very reasonable amount of food and it allows you to leave room for an extra pastry or cookie. The cafe itself is modern with lots of windows and great natural light and the service is always good.
