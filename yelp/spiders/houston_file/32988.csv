Layers of chicken mixed with cheese, vegetables, and a ranch sauce help to create the perfect balance of flavor. Top all that with a perfectly toasted pretzel bun and you've got a winner. I have yet to meet someone who is not a fan of the crunchy chicken sandwich...but for those craving something without meat, another one of my favorites is the truffled egg sandwich. It's provides a nice change of pace from the sandwiches with meat without sacrificing any flavor or taste.
