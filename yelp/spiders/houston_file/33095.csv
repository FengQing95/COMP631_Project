Local Foods////I didn't eat in the restaurant, but it's very open and spread-out, very casual and relaxed. Looks like a fun place for groups. About $10 for a filling meal is always something to celebrate, so that was great. I'd love to come back and try a few more items. Great menu and awesome idea...nice to see a place reminiscent of Cali in good old Texas!
