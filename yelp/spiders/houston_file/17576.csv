Uchi////I've been to the Uchi in Austin before, so knew I wanted the hama chili (yellowtail with citrus and thai chili) and the walu walu (grilled escolar) as those were my favorites from my previous Uchi Austin visit. The hama chili was delicious and perfect. The yellowtail and citrus fruit pair together so well, and the thai chili adds just a tiny bit of spice. Â The walu walu had great flavor, but was unfortunately overcooked. Too expensive of a place to do that!
