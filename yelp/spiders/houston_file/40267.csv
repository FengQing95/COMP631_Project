Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Pork Belly Poutine (2/5) - I really wanted to like this one, but the main turnoff were the incinerated thick-cut fries. Picking out the luscious, fatty pork belly chunks was like excavating for jewels in dirt. More gravy and cheese curds would have helped, and I think that I should've asked for more on the side to offset the dryness/starchiness of the lackluster fries.
