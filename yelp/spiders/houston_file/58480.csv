Baby Barnaby's////We hit Baby Barnaby's for Easter breakfast for the second year in a tow.  You do have to write your name down on the list but our wait time each experience has been less than 10 minutes and you can sip some coffee while you wait.  Our service was top notch and delightful.  Everyone enjoyed their meals - my sister recommended the chicken apple sausage and it is definitely good.  Mom had the breakfast burrito and she said it was excellent.  Overall, a wonderful place to visit while in town!
