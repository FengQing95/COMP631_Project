Kata Robata////The only reasons I've docked a star was because the noise level was so loud. We had to yell so that the other person or waiter could hear us. Parking wasn't so smooth if you didn't want to valet. Not bad, just limited. Overall, I'd say this place would have been a 4.5 but since I didn't think it deserved 5 stars, I rounded down instead of up.
