JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The Tonkotsu Spicy is my favorite. You get to choose your level of spiciness, with options of mild, spicy, and hot. Because I wasn't willing to be too much of a daredevil, I chose spicy. Spicy gives you a good amount of kick and allows you to be able to sip on the broth without dying of heat. I love garlic so getting the FREE fresh garlic is an automatic plus for me. We also got the Spicy Chicken Ramen. It was definitely good, but the Tonkotsu Spicy was definitely the better one out of the two.
