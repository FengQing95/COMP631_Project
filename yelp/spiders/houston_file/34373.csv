Local Foods////I don't know why I waited so long to try this place out.  It was simply delicious.  I ordered the veggie sandwich as a salad (you can convert all sandwiches to salads) and added chicken.  It has yummy roasted brussel sprouts, curried cauliflower, pickled radishes, and other tasty ingredients.  It paired well with the chicken pisole soup.
