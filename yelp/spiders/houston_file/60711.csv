Baby Barnaby's////The food was excellent!! I had Hawaiian Pork Chops and I was very pleased to find out the owner Jeff added to the plate and now serves the dish with three pork chops. Thank you Jeff I can now enjoy Hawaiian Pork Chops again. They are very tender and seasoned just right. My waiter Matt and Anna make the meal always a pleasure. Stop by and see them and relax and enjoy a great meal. Be sure to tip them well they deserve it!!!
