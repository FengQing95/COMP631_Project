JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm so sorry to give this review, but the whole experience was really disappointing. We had friends in from another country...the soda was warm (hot day) the mall was packed, the waitress was wearing many hats including bouncer? The food was just okay but the Brussels sprout appetizer was so unappealing, scorched for real...brought to the table in tyvek nuclear suit (kidding) that plate of burnt unfriendly brussel sprouts seemed to be scolding us, stealing our joy and daring us to try to eat it. It sat there untouched the entire meal...had I been the waitress it would have been comped, but whatever,some are empowered and take notice and some not so much! Sorry guys but...no...thank...you!!!
