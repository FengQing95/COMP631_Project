Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Give me a salted Carmel macaroon and a vanilla latte and I am in heaven.  This is my mom and I's new place to go and catch up and have a bite.  It's perfect!  I only wish the outside patio was bigger and the chairs weren't so hard to move.  But now I'm just being picky.... Go!!!
