Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////When arriving at Bosscat kitchen we had called to see if there was any openings available and they said that it wasn't we still went and as lucky as we found there was more than enough tables open for now the service was tremendous he did everything that he could for us and that was great the food it was delicious that burrito I would highly recommend it. Now when we received all my mimosas we have blue specs in it and they was happily to refresh our drinks and make us a new one. Well I was thinking we was gonna be compensated for having mimosas with blue specs in it and we had already drunk on it that could've got us sick but no it was not taken off Our checks. Â But other than that the place was nice the food was delicious I was just hoping for a better service.
