Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food here is amazing and so is the coffee and latte's. My only recommendation to patrons is to arrive early because it gets busy very quickly! We usually go Saturday mornings and if we get there past 8am there is usually a wait. Although the food is well worth it if you can wait!
