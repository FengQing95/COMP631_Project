Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The herbal tea I ordered was about $3 and was kind of disappointing.  It came in a really small mug and tasted only "okay."  After my brunch here I went to another coffee shop and got an herbal tea for $3 that was 4 times the size and much more flavorful (and they added honey).
