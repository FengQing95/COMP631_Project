Local Foods////Okay...WOW! We are here for personal business and wanted to eat lunch somewhere with good, clean food. So many "healthy" places to eat provide adequate foods but inadequate portions and flavor. This place...well let me tell you, it goes way beyond expectation!!! The food is delicious...every dish we each ordered. The portions? You better come hungry or prepared to share!!! Their drinks are very tasty and unique.
