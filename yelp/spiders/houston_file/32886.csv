Local Foods////Came back and got the Arugula Salad which has shrimp, pecorino, Texas honey pecans, cranberries, and a lemon-thyme vinaigrette.  One of the things I love about Local Foods is that they don't skimp on their dishes at all. The salad came with a hearty amount of shrimp, pecans and cranberries, and a good amount of pecorino shavings.  The shrimp was seasoned nicely with some cajun spices.  The pecans were delicious and you could tell they were freshly coated with honey (not like the kind you buy from the store).  Their lemon-thyme vinaigrette tasted nice and light, although I didn't use it on my salad - I usually opt out of dressings, especially if the salad has dried fruit in it.  The greens were nice and fresh like always. My friend got the duck confit sandwich, which looked amazing.  It had arugula, cranberry preserve, aioli and melted brie on wheat bread.
