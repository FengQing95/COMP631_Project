Kata Robata////I really could do without the uppity attitudes of the servers, however. One was very good at describing the dishes but went on forever. Another mumbled all the ingredients under her breath and left us confused. Atmosphere, other than that, is great. Patio seating is gorgeous and inside, dimmed lighting is romantic/relaxed.
