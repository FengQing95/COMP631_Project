Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose//// will replace Starbucks and give Houston the best upscale bakery and eatery it's ever had! Houston is lucky he ventured into the bakery biz so now please feed the masses Johnny! You will not find a better croissant in this city. My favorite go to food are the mile high Texas Club sandwiches. The best I've ever eaten piled high Turkey, cheese, tomato with Â a delicious avacado sauce. Park on the street it's easier. This place needs to be huge.
