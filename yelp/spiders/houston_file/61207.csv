Baby Barnaby's////My wife found this place on Yelp and after seeing the reviews, we decided to drop by for a late breakfast.  It is absolutely wonderful!! The food is delicious, especially the apple pecan pancake!  Go on an empty stomach there was tons of food.  We left miserable due to stuffing ourselves.  It is a little confusing, we didn't know whether to sit ourselves or wait. Also, we had to wait for a long time to receive our ticket. My wife actually asked for it on her way to the restroom.  They were packed and only had two people working the front.  Maybe one more staff person would help out tremendously.  I realize the wait for our ticket was due to their being extremely busy.  I would most definitely return if ever in the area again.
