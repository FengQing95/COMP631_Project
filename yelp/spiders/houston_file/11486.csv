JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen is top notch in comparison to other ramen joints I've tried in Houston.  My boyfriend prefers the tonkotsu black spicy.  The broth is very good and flavorful.  I had the cha cha cha spicy ($13.95) and I VERY MUCH enjoyed it.  The broth was amazing in flavor and didn't come off as too salty like most ramen places in the area do.  The thick noodles were a little on the harder side but that is how I usually prefer it.  The egg is whole and soft boiled.  Personally, I prefer it when the egg is cut in half to make it easier to eat.  The pork isn't cooked into the broth or grilled or anything but it's still good.  Also, if you want it spicy it's an additional $0.50 charge.  We also had the salmon cilantro (~$8) as an appetizer and it was not good.  The fish was not fresh at all and it was basically just very thin slices of salmon soaked in soy sauce and topped with cilantro.  Definitely pass on this one.
