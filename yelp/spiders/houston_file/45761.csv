Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////In the past, I've come for their chocolate chips cookies and macaroons, but once I tried their pistachio croissant, I never went back. This croissant is large and fluffy, with a sweet and delicious paste lining the inside. The green color gives the croissant an especially pretty look. For drinks, their iced mocha is rich and heavy, yet refreshing. Whether spending time eating at this cafe or taking your food to go, Common Bond is a wonderful place to get a bite.
