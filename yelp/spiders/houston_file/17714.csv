Uchi////My boyfriend and I went to Uchi HH on Sunday. We had a great meal and then two friends joined us. We spent over $200 in that time. We were there for two hours, then the waiter comes by and asks us to leave b/c they need the table. Incredibly rude. I loved Uchi and have been going for years but after being completely disrespected, we will NEVER go back and give them business. .
