Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Very very mediocre  experience!! So Beyonce weekend me and bestie i town, our Lyft driver suggest this place. We look on yelp, food looks good. We are like ok. Let's try. So we get here, and are told we have about 60-90 min wait. We are like ok fine. We get to the bar, and wait for a drink. It was a jalapeño margarita. Not the best! Ok. So let me try to break down my problems with this establishment.
