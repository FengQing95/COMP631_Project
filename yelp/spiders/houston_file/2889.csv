JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This was my first time at a ramen noodle restaurant, so I don't have another great noodle place to compare it with. But I'll have to admit the setting of this restaurant was posh. We were greeted and seated immediately, service was excellent! I order the spicy chicken ramen (chicken broth: chicken chashu, spinach, spicy bean sprouts, tokyo negi, green onions served with THIN noodles) Â for 10.95 . Loved the atmosphere, food and workers will be going back soon!
