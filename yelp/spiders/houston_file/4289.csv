JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi David - Thanks for the great review. I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen, and thank you for mentioning the fact that you can ask your server for "Less Salt" or "Less Oil" when preparing your ramen. And we also appreciate your understanding our extended wait times during peak hours. Thanks again, and we hope to serve you again soon.
