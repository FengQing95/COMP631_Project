Kata Robata////This place has been around a while and is consistently crowded. I always think it's just hype or trendy but actually it's not. It's good and has been so consistent it's managed to stay busy for years. Every time I come I have mid level expectations and walk oiut very satisfied. It's one of those places that I leave and think I should visit more often.
