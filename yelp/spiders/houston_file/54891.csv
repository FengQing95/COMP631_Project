Kata Robata////Best high quality sushi and sashimi in town. Highly recommend for a special occasion or fancy date night. I wish they could accommodate separate checks for large parties. I understand splitting the bill in the end is difficult for the server/establishment but wish they could open separate checks for each party in the group in the beginning of the meal so there's no confusion either way. Regardless, I had a great experience and will definitely be back and recommend this place to everyone!
