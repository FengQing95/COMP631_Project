Kata Robata////My friends and I decided to treat ourselves to sushi here a month in advance. We planned our night and were really looking forward to it! And I can say from the get go- it did not disappoint. The service was exquisite- we started our meal with warm towels to clean our hands. The waiter catered to our interests perfectly. We started with the Hamachi & Jalape√±o Sashimi, and it was hands down the best thing I've ever had in my life. I dream about this food item. If I could give the restaurant 20 stars just for this item; I would!! Next we had the Rising Sun roll, and it was quite delicious. We also tried an assortment of nigiri pieces selected by our waiter, and he made some great suggestions! We finished off with a King Crab roll. This meal was an infusion of fresh flavors and definitely did not disappoint. I cannot wait to go back again!
