Kata Robata////What an amazing restaurant.  Although I read the Yelp reviews and saw how well reviewed it was, I was a little nervous to see the restaurant basically located in a strip mall ... granted, a strip mall in River Oaks, but still a strip mall.  Looks can be deceiving.  The service was excellent and our server did an excellent job explaining the menu and making suggestions for our table.  We tried several items that included the Seafood sashimi, the miso crusted bone marrow (which everyone at my my table loved), the pork belly roll (which was fantastic!), the Caribbean and the Texas Hamachi (another standout) rolls.  We tried a few other things, but those were the standouts.  Dessert was also good.  I had the strawberry shortcake, which was a work of art.  The pastry chef did an amazing job with it and I would highly recommend it.  It had different textures and flavors that were not overpowering and worked together to create a great flavor.  My friends, who have tried sushi all of the US, said it was one of the best sushi restaurants they have ever been to.
