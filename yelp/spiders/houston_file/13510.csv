JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The environment is very fun, loud and communal and yet feels very private at your own table somehow, I love it. The gyoza are to die for. Hot, crispy outside, delicious and juicy inside. Perfectly flavored. The dipping sauce is the perfect compliment. We get them every time.
