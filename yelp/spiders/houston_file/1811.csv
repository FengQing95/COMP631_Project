JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is another gold mine that I found on Yelp. I came in at around 10 pm on a Tuesday and it was slightly busy. However, I was making a to-go order so I was able to sit at the bar and look over the menu. I decided on the JINYA BLACK for myself and the JINYA CHICKEN RAMEN for my mom; also the Pork Chanshu Bowl. First thing I tried was the bowl which was delicious. Rice and meat were cooked greatly and the egg added a different (not bad) texture and an overall pleasing flavor. My mom said that her chicken ramen was the best she'd ever had. My noodles were also great. Broth wasn't too heavy or too thick and had a great flavor complex. The reason for the lost star was that I order ground spicy pork however it wasn't in my noodles, and the fact that there was a huge boiled egg in the noodles which just didn't really go with everything else. Other than that I will definitely be back.
