Uchi////I have been coming to Uchi for 8 years now- first in Austin and then Houston. It has always been one of the most delightful dining experience. Although food is mot a motivator for me to feel happy, Uchi makes me smile as I am walking out the door. There is a wide range of selection of not just Sushi but Sake as well. The service is amazing and the overall vibe is lively. This is a place where I could come back each week. It's worth the price!
