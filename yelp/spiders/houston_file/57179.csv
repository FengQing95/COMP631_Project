Kata Robata////Delicious. The banana flavor is very gentle and not over powering at all. The blueberries, strawberries, and the nutella creme compliments it very well while the fresh bananas enhance the flavor. Its not too sweet at all. If I could I would have definitely wanted to lick the dish clean.
