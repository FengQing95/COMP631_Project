JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////A-ok. I don't get the rave reviews after I had to try this place. In my own opinion, the broth was blan and it just was't what I expected and quite expensive for ramen, I paid over 30$ for two bowls of ramen and some "toppings." I overheard some people at the table next to me say where they had better also. I wanted to like this place but a-ok only to me.
