The Pit Room////I ordered the 1lb beef rib which tasted WONDERFUL!!! Total for just the rib was: $28 with tax it is weighed in front of you when they cut it and you see the price when weighed. Sides:Elote made perfectly and Mac & Cheese was creamy and delicious!!! The pickled veggies options were new to me and I really enjoyed having it along with my meal!
