The Pit Room////Yummm!!!!! First bbq place that makes yummy bbq sauce; it isn't super tangy and had just the right smokiness to it! Can't go wrong with anything that you order here. We got 1lb of ribs (one large rib with a lot of meat on it), half a pound of brisket, two brisket tacos (they sell by singles so you get however many you like), and a side of Mac n cheese (one of the best Mac n cheeses I've had everrrrr). We also got the Czech style sausage. It was a little dry but the flavor was good. Definitely recommend bbq lovers to come and try this spot! Parking can be a little difficult to find if you come during peak dinner hours though.
