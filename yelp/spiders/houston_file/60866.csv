Baby Barnaby's//// Anyways,  we sat down in a cozy little booth.  Our server was fast.  I ordered some fresh orange juice and boy I almost swallowed the glass whole. It was that scrumptious. My breakfast partner ordered the corned beef and hash and I ordered the waffle and some fresh fruit on top.  Our meal was quite delicious. I mean it was very good. The food was fresh as it gets.  I mean there was an orange juice machine where they were dropping the oranges and all the insides were being squeezed out in front of my very own eyes.
