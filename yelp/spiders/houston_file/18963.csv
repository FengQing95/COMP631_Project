Uchi////Overall, aishiteru Uchi - I do, I do, I dooo! I know it's only their soft opening, but if they just keep everything as I experienced it last night, they will be golden. I am soooo excited to come back. I'm already calling in my RVSP for my birthday in March! And I swear, I will be dreaming of their foie nigiri & bacon tataki everyday until then!
