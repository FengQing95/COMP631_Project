Kata Robata////Have tried the Foie gras and duck chawanmushi appetizer .. It was an interesting twist on foie and quite good. The Kobe beef skewer is so delicious and a must try! Melt in your mouth tender with great flavor! The foie gras and duck cold soba was okay .. I cleaned the foie off the plate but left most of the noodles. Lobster macaroni and cheese is delicious!! The spicy soy ramen also has great flavor and the broth is awesome.
