Local Foods////I had the egg salad which was very good. But what did it for me was the pretzel bun. OMG that was good. I chose coleslaw and quinoa as my sides and both were very good. The limeade was a little different than what I was expecting, probably won't get it again. Oh and the homemade chips were good too.
