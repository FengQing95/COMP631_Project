Uchi////Nasu Nigiri ($3): 3.5/5 Ah yes, Asian style roasted eggplants, except you only get 2 pieces, and it's served on a piece of rice that falls apart if you try to pick it up. I recommend going to any Chinese restaurant, ordering the eggplant, and eating it with rice. Probably would leave you more satisfied than this.
