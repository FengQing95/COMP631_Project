JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////There was line to be seated, long enough to reach outside of the restaurant. They told us it would be a 30 minute wait for 2 people but we were seated in half the time. We ordered the Tonkutso spicy ramen and the Chicken ramen. The pork broth was savory and quickly devoured. I prefer my soups hot in temperature and the only con I'd have to report was that my ramen was lukewarm, this was not a deal breaker and will still be a returning customer.
