JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First and foremost, I wanted to thank you for being a regular customer but regret that you were very disappointed with your to-go order. The ramen chef apparently made the mistake of forgetting to add a seasoned egg, which is regrettable, but happens from time to time. We try our best to avoid mistakes such as this. But from what I can tell from your photo, the noodle-toppings container does appear to have a double order of thin noodles. I asked my general manager Keith to take a look (he most likely was the employee who packed your order), and he said the level of the items in the container appear to match the order (with the exception of the egg).
