JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi I F - Thanks for your review. I really appreciate your thoroughness! I agree there is some hype surrounding our restaurant -- which has never been our intention -- but it's also important to note that JINYA is a franchise concept that originated in Los Angeles, with a long history of Japanese ramen culture. From what I understand, Japanese ramen as a regular dining option has existed for many years on both the east and west coasts, but only more recently has it popped up in places like Houston, Dallas and Austin. To that end, my goal with JINYA was simply to bring something new and enjoyable to Houston since, just a year ago, there weren't that many dedicated ramen shops in our fair city. So thank you for for keeping an open mind and giving us a try -- we've seen many new customers such as yourself come through our doors, and we are always grateful for your patronage. And lastly, I apologize that you may not have received the appropriate style egg. Our seasoned eggs should have a soft, custard-style yolk, not hard boiled. We serve upwards of 800 seasoned eggs on any given day, so there's always the possibility some don't come out exactly as they should.
