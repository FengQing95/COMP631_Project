Uchi////But then we got to ordering more, the zen roll, (omg yum, i didn't even need soy sauce or ponzu sauce to dip my sushi roll in bc I'm an avid ponzu sushi dipper) ham and eggs roll (basically a pork belly (very fatty) roll dipped in some sauces with one containing egg yolk. It was different, bc i'm use to sushi being either cold, fresh, but basically biting into the ham and egg roll made me feel like i was eating pork and rice in from a bowl. But it was def worth trying. The waiter, also came by and gave us an "on the house" roll, just because it was our first time. I don't know what it was but it was from their daily specials list. It was amazing!!!! Again, no typical dipping sauce was needed. Also tried the salmon toro (just okay) as well as the Nigiri Foie, basically Foie gras as sushi. We ordered only one bc we intended on sharing. The waiter came back with 2 saying he gave us an extra one because sharing this? yeah right! It's worth trying out. & Man he was so right! I swear i hated myself after since Foie Gras is basically fat, but it was so yummy. I swear, right when you bite into it it just bursts into just the right flavors to satisfy your taste buds!
