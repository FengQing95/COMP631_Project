Kata Robata////Sometimes you're in the mood for sushi, but not the typical sushi. If that's the case I'd say this the place for you. It's sort of the happy middle between uchi and sushi wabi. The prices are a little up there, but the dishes are more exciting and unique than your standard sushi restaurant.
