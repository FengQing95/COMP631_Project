JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston//// Anywho, the menu is easy to follow. You have your a la carte options, entrees, and combos. I started off with the fried brussel sprouts. These things are pretty good and come with a cute box (I'm easy to impress sometimes). At the table there are three types of condiments, gyoza sauce, soy sauce, and sriracha. I'm a big fan of the dumpling sauce so I basically put that sh*t on everything. The person with me gave me one of his dumplings. It was good but really small. It came with the soup, salad, dumpling combo.
