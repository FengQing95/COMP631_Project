Kata Robata////The food, however, is very strong. Two ramen dishes at the table - spicy soy and oxtail - were hits, as were the kobe skewers. The rolls are standard and delicious, and there is a wide array of expected sushi/sashimi offerings. Prices are also fair for the food. Prices and variety of wine, though, leave something to be desired.
