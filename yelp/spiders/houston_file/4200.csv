JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Packed on a Monday at 8:30 pm.   Need I say more.   We started with the cauliflower appetizer which is one of their small plates.   Tasty with a lemon zing.  Moved on to s salmon poke: avocado dish which was served in a leave and awesome.  Next was a curry dish with rice which hit the spot.   I had the black pork ramen.  Flavor was perfect.   I loved the egg which was swimming in the broth.  Service was attentive.
