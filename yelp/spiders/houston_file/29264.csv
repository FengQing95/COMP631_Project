The Pit Room////First off, the brisket was juicy and tender. No need for the sauce to add flavor. The chicken, although it was moist, did not grab my attention and was not special to me. The seasoning on it was bit lacking and not that great. The beef ribs though had a nice fire ring to them, and the smoky flavor was apparent. A winner for sure.
