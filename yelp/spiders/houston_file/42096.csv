Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is fantastic! The atmosphere is great, the food menu is inventive and tasty and the pastries are wonderful! The way the food is presented is also well thought out and artful. Â Actually, the pastries can best be described as delicious little works of art. ;) If you appreciate quality food and attention to detail, you'll like CB.
