Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The only negative is that went our group arrived (6 people) we were told by a hostess that we needed to be gone by a certain time to free up the table. The time wasn't unreasonably soon, but it was kinda rude. No restaurant has ever told me that before. And people usually don't go to brunch to feel rushed through it...but I digress.
