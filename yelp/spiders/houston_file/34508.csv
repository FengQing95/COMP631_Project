Local Foods////OMG this is GREAT FOOD!  High quality, creative dishes.  Absolutely delicious!  I had the Garden Sammie made as a salad with tofu added.  Greens, roasted Brussel sprouts, tomatoes, curry cauliflower, pickled onions, avocado, hummus with a fresh lemon vinaigrette.  My husband had a roasted portabella mushroom sandwich and a bowl of vegan tortilla soup.  Everything we had was outstanding.  huge portions.  We will come back for certain every time we visit the area.  Delightful employees too.  Everything about the experience was excellent!
