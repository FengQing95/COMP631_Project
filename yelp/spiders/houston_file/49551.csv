Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////All the pancakes were sweet and light, no need for syrup and butter really and the hashbrowns were a nice savory side. I tried some of the grits from my bf's Shrimp and Grits and they were very good as well, even though usually I'm not a grits fan. Parking is usually a bit of a hassle though so you will probably have to park on the street. Make sure to get there early too!
