Kata Robata////The sashimi bowl had a fantastic assortment, and every cut of fish was so fresh and was everything I expected from a high end place, for a surprisingly affordable price! The dessert of red bean ice cream and green tea souffle cheesecake was so creamy, and the hot with the cold was a party for the taste buds.
