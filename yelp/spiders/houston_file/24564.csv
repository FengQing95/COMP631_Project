Uchi////If you have never been before, I would really recommend coming during "Social Hour" (5-6:30pm) to avoid the sticker shock.  Uchi is great, but you definitely pay for the quality.  The social hour is a great time to try out a few dishes before committing to paying full price.  Pro tip for happy hour: order the hot sake instead of the cold sake - you get ~5 times the amount of sake for the same price.
