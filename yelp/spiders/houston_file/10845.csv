JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Line to get in was a little long...we waited maybe 20-25 minutes. It's a ramen bar, so the tables are little, your crowded together with strangers.... you can't be anal about your personal bubble space at this place. (When i was getting up to leave I knocked my chopsticks off the table in an effort to avoid hitting their table with my butt. Have to say I made the right choice there lol)
