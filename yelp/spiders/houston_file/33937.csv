Local Foods////ONE OF THE BEST sandwiches I've ever had. Crunchy Chicken. I asked the man at the cashier (wish I got his name) to make me a 2nd sandwich so I could take it home to San Francisco, so my girlfriend could try it. He tells me that he will deconstruct it. He then tells me that he separated all eleven ingredients and placed them in a to go container so I can construct this sandwich after I fly home to San Francisco. After, he gives me a receipt with the ingredients listed and hand drawn pictures of each ingredient! Talk about customer service! This man deserves a raise!!
