The Pit Room////This is the best BBQ in Houston that I've had! I found this of course via yelp. - thanks my fellow yelpers!! I would also say that this made it to my top 5 all time. Not as great as Terry Black's or John Mueller's in Austin but so much better than Goode's (which I really don't get the hype). What sets The Pit Room apart from most is their Venison Sausage and Elote. Most places don't have this. Their sausage is both flavorful and spicy. The elote comes off the cob, but has that magical flavor as they top it with crema, chili powder and queso fresca. The brisket was delicious, moist and you could taste the smoke all the way through. The service was amazing as their food! When in Houston, I will definitely come here every time!!!
