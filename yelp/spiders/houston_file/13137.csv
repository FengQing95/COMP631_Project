JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I try to avoid lunch hours or weekend dinners because Jinya is really popular and it takes a while to get a seat. The restaurant has a cool vibe to it and all the tables are in one big room. There's a few private tables, but the last few times I've been seated at one of two community tables with seating next to strangers. This isn't too bad but it's awkward when you are trying to have a conversation with 2+ of your friends.
