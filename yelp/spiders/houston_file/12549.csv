JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The bowls taste great! My wife and are fed up with the nickel and diming from the wait staff...every little thjng isnan extra .99 or 2.00 or 3.00...and it changes from waiter to waiter....Serving size with broth is up and down...very inconsistent... I am starting to hate coming...
