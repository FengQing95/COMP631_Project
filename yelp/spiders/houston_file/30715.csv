The Pit Room////It's hard to describe this inner Houston BBQ joint other than amazing! With all the craze of Texas BBQ this spot has it all. Great staples like the sliced brisket both lean and moist, the burnt ends and chopped as well.  Go big with a beef rib or run on the lighter side with pulled pork or venison link sausage.  The sides could easily make this place by themselves. Enjoy!
