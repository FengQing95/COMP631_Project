Uchi////I usually don't do Asian Fusion of any kind, because I'm Asian and it usually never lives up to my expectations, but O.M.G. It was the BEST omakase experience I've ever had.  We missed our reservation for a table, but got a seat at the sushi bar after our champagne in the patio and that was a blessing in disguise.  We trusted Paolo and he delivered on every single dish, blowing our tastebuds away with the sophisticated flavors and contrasting textures in each bit.  The gyutoro and foie gras were my favorite and the soulful bites will be memorable!  Service was impeccable with a crew of members quietly and efficiently removing dishes and folding our napkins.  I will need to try their original location in Austin next!  Ask for Paolo at this location.  Thank you!
