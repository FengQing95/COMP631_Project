JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////After several trips to Houston, it took me up until the 3rd visit to finally come to Jinya. This place was hyped up by all of my friends with good reason. First off, the service was exceptional and efficient. Our server took good care of us especially as first timers. What impressed me the most was how fast our food came out. I had placed an order for the brussel sprouts as an appetizer and didn't even finish half of it before our ramen came out.
