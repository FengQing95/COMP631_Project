JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been here about three times already made and I always get the Tonkotsu Ramen. The Tonkotsu Black ramen and it was so dense with flavor and the pork absorbed the richness of the creamy broth and basically rendered it not only delicious but soft as well. The noodles were good but most of my attention was on the meat and the soup, not to mention their seasoned egg has very soft, almost runny yolk when you bite into it. It was about $13 for the whole thing but I could barely finish it all! Definitely give this place a shot.
