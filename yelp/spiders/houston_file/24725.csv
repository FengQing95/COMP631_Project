Uchi////With that said, this is still a fantastic restaurant with stand-out dishes. The avo maki, spicy crunchy tuna, short rib, nasu, and foie nigiri are all still mindblowing. If you don't know the old Uchi, you will likely be quite pleased with this menu. Do plan on dropping some serious cash though as portions are small so it takes many dishes to fill up!
