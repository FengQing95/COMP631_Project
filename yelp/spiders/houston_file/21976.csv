Uchi////This was our first time coming to Uchi in Houston. The food was good, however the service was not. Our water pitcher sat empty, we were overcharged for some items and they didn't apologize when the mistake was pointed out. Lastly, given that we were celebrating a birthday we expected some acknowledgement other than a "happy birthday" from the host. Not the spectacular experience expected for the high price of dining there.
