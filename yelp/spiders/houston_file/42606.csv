Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The coffee is made from high quality beans and you can actually taste the difference.  We got the latte and the Valrhona Mocha and they were both excellent.  Some of the best coffees I've had. They actually use Valrhona tasting chocolates for their mocha instead of baking bars like other places.
