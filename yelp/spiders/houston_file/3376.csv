JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////One of my favorite spots downtown.  I always get something different and it never let's me down.  The spicy chicken is my favorite though.  I've only had bad service once and I think the guy was new when it happened.  It's always busy so expect to wait a while unless you're going during a seriously off peak time.  Free parking in the garage behind it is a bonus.  If you're lazy they have valet but I personally don't mind walking or taking the stairs.
