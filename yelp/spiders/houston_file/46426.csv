Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The food itself could use some work. I had a blueberry muffin which was dense and cake-like, a scone that was borderline bread, and biscuits & gravy that were bland and disappointing. The walnut chocolate chip cookie had a good texture, but it wasn't anything to write home about. A perfectly decent cookie.
