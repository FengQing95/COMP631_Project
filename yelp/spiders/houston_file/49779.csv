Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Brunch here was delicious  I had the eggs Benedict with a side of bacon  & tomato  it was so delicious my hubby wasn't too hungry so we shared the plate it was big enough for us two! I also had a cappuccino it was okay. The wait was about 15min and it was around 1pm on a Friday. Would definitely come back!
