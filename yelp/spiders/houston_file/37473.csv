Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bartenders were very attentive and always made sure we had a glass full of water. The cocktails had a smooth and unique taste as this is primarily a whiskey bar, pretty much all of their cocktails were whiskey based but very tasteful! Every staff member was always busy accommodating every customer, hard working staff in a fun environment!
