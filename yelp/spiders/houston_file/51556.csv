Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We still had a few minutes to kill when we got back from our trip, so we decided to order from the bar.  The pineapple mimosa I ordered was quite delicious and a good size too.  Unfortunately the line for the bar wasn't quite clear, as there were several people waiting, but we made it through.
