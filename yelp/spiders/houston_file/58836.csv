Baby Barnaby's////I really liked Barnaby's when I went there for dinner, so I had been meaning to try Baby Barnaby's and see how they serve up my favorite meal.  I went on a Sunday morning around 10 and even though there was a wait, it wasn't bad.  I wrote my name on a clipboard and grabbed a cup of coffee- no big deal.  If it hadn't been chilly outside, the patio would have been ideal for eating outside.
