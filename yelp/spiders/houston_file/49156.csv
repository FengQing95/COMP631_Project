Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze spuds deluxe ! Amazing! We first tried this place in Colorado. We were looking on yelp for good restaurants in Houston and Snooze happened to pop up. Parking is pretty minimal and off busy street. Luckily we found good parking and only waited 10 min to be seated. Everyone is so friendly and very happy to explain the menu to you. OJ was sooo good. None of that simply made or whatever. All natural stuff. Cage free eggs. Would def go there again when I the area for a hearty breakfast!
