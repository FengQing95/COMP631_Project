Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////First few times here were delicious, but always a ridiculous wait... we always thought it was worth it because the service was great and the food was amazing. Our most recent visit was not anywhere near past experiences and I'm kinda tired of the hour+ wait every time you want to eat here... service was slow, drinks were weak as hell, I don't know how you can pay 10$ for a drink that tastes like water with some habanero sauce sprinkled in. I'm over this place. I hope they can turn things back around... spoke to manager and she comped everything. Completely redeemed everything. Thanks for being managed well.
