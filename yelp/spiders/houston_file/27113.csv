The Pit Room////The brisket is badass, not "I'm willing to commit crimes against humanity to get another forkful" good like the aforementioned pornographic mac n cheese, but otherwise flawless.  The flavor on the bark is punchy like the sound of Les Claypool's bass in Tommy the Cat.  Not overwhelmingly smoky so you can still taste the meat but slamming with tasty.  Both the flat and point were perfect.
