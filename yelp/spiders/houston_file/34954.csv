Local Foods////The sandwiches are big. Two people can split them. They come with 2 sides and are served on slow dough bread baked on site.  I had the Garden Sammie which had Brussels sprouts, avocado, hummus, sprouts, pickled onions etc with chicken. Sooo good!  They even have a quinoa burger. I'm going to have to try that next time.
