JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Rebecca - Thank you for your great review. We are always happy to hear when guests, who are native Japanese, enjoy our ramen. Also, the Karaage Chicken Ramen is still available as an off-menu item, just like the original Tan Tan Men. Just ask your server the next time you visit. Thank you again, and we look forward to serving you again soon.
