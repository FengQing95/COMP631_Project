The Pit Room////I had the pork ribs and was able to swap the two sides for an order of chips and queso. The queso was addictive, just the right amount of spice. The chips were fresh made and went great with the salsa.  The rib portion was huge!  There is a nice serving bar with pickles and all sorts of hot sauces to try, many with stern warnings on them. The bread was quite stale, which was the only sad part of the meal. Happy to have good bbq in town.
