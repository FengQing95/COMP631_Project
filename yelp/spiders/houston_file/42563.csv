Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It's not clear where to sit. The way out from the line is a bit awkward. There is seating around the front facing Westheimer, counter seating on backless stools (uncomfortable), low counter seating on mismatched chairs (in the way), a large communal table, outside seating (but no umbrellas)-- a bit of a mish-mash. Service is on real plates and cups (yay) with real silverware (yay again) and cloth napkins that look like small dishtowels (a bit pretentious?). No ambient music (probably just as well). No expense is spared as to the packaging for even one pastry to go.
