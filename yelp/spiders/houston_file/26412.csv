The Pit Room////Anyways right off the bat when we walked  to order the food I noticed the meats under a heat lamp... i dont know if that's typical, but doesn't that dry out the meat??? Anyways the ribs looked dry.... I love BBQ so I didn't say anything to my fiancé. Like everything looked good. So I didn't say anything. Anyways we sat down. My pulled pork taco was amazing and the mac and cheese was fantastic. So that was good but I tried some of my fiancés food. Basically the ribs were dry. The brisket was greasy and had a lot of fat. and the sausage was dry as well. All the sides were good all though expensive... each is 3.50
