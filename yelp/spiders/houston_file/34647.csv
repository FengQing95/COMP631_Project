Local Foods////Let's begin with what Local Foods is not: it is NOT a crazy-healthy vegan hub, a hipster haven, or even the best place to sustain your New Years resolution. They buy local and organic, which means that your money is going to supporting good practices and small business owners; not waistline insurance. Still not sure why people always confuse these two things. Nevertheless, the food is DIVINE. Any sandwich on a fresh pretzel bun will make my day, and their Parmesan kale salad with golden raisins is the perfect supplement to a filling meal.
