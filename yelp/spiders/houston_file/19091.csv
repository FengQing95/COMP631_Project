Uchi////Everyone I knew that had been here told me that it was an amazing place with amazing food that would blow me away. To start off with we ordered the roasted brussel sprouts which were so delicious! I had never tasted brussel sprouts before and am now spoiled for eternity with these! My date and I then decided on the signature tasting which was a six-course tasting menu of Uchi's signature dishes. They were all fantastic to say the least. The way that Uchi pairs flavors is out of this world. Next was dessert which was DEVINE! I ordered the lemon gelato while my date had the peanut butter semifreddo. At first glance, I was turned off by the appearance of the desserts and was terrified that I would be eating a piece of tofu ice cream, but I thankfully I took a first bite and the rest was history! The lemon gelato was so delicious and refreshing- the pistachios were the perfect touch to the tart lemon flavor.
