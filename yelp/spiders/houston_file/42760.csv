Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I absolutely love common bond. I have dreams of owning my own bakery shop one day and Common Bond is everything I've imagine I would want. Everytime I go there (which is pretty often) is like walking into a dream. Colorful bakery boxes line the shelving as you walk in, and there are options and options of delicious baked goods to your right. So many choices, where do you start?! Do start by showing up before noon. Each time I've made this mistake of coming after, things start running out.
