Local Foods////Must try the crunch chicken sandwich! I haven't been able to try any other sandwiches on the menu because I keep ordering this one. The sandwich comes on a pretzel bun, the chicken is not coated but there are pretzel bits. Good amount of flavor. The sandwiches all come with your choice of two sides.
