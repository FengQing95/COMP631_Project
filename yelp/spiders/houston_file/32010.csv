Local Foods////I had the crunchy chicken on a pretzel bun.  Pretzel bun was delicious.  Crunchy on the outside and soft in the center.  Chicken was not dry....it was amazing.  Bf had the truffled egg salad also on a pretzel bun and it was also delicious.  Truffle flavor was not overwhelming which is good.
