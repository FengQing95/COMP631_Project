Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////If you can't find Bosscat Kitchen, you can definitely hear it. Ambiance: Sunday Funday brunch had a DJ in the front of the restaurant blasting music throughout the place. This seemed to pair well their bottomless bloody mary/mimosa offer for one last weekend celebration before Monday comes around. If you're going to have an intimate conversation, you might want to save this place for another brunch. The DJ in the background makes it difficult to hear each other without the need to shout to hear the person sitting in front of you. Hipster decor. Open space design with a centered bar. Food: the "king" pancakes, chorizo+potato benedict, and chicken fried steak. Pancakes- Not overly sweet as I was expecting it to be. The peanut butter on top provided most flavor. (delicious) Very fluffy pancake base. The banana creme in between the layers caught me by surprise. Not impressed upon first bite but it grew on me. I can imagine craving these whenever I'm in the mood for pancakes-probably enough to make the trip out here. Chorizo+potato benedict- just average. Benedict itself didn't have much flavor. The milk biscuit turned out to be a fried dough ball that had no flavor whatsoever. The savior of the dish was the perfectly cooked and crisp bits of potato. Chicken steak-didn't taste it but was described as a decent size with a lackluster gravy. Service: As fellow yelpers claim, the attentive and friendly severs saved this review from a three star rating. The waiter gave us the background story of the "king" pancakes that I won't spoil here. Multiple servers came by to check on us and kept our beverages filled at all times. This place seems promising. Will be back if ever in the area again to try their regular menu. Nice addition to Houston's food scene. Hope they continue to develop and change up the menu to include more unique items like the "king" pancakes.
