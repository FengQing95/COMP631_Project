The Pit Room////Soooo to let you know, over seasoning is a real thing , and maybe I just happen to have caught y'all slipping on that day but the brisket was way too salty, mainly on the end of the brisket. The bark was perfectly burnt and the fat was melt in your mouth good. I enjoy a nice piece of brisket, maybe I was paying too much attention to the pork ribs that I the brisket got all jealous but I'll just assume y'all slipped up on the seasoning
