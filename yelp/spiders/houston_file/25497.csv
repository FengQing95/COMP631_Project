Uchi////Wow! My group of 8 made reservations on a Saturday night and our table was immediately ready. Enjoyed the atmosphere, the wait staff, and the food was SO GOOD. We sampled a lot of dishes. My favorite was the Nigiri sushi that night. It was so fresh it tasted like butter. I also really enjoyed the foie gras sushi - 2 of my favorite things in one! I never had anything like that before and it was delicious!
