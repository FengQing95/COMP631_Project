Kata Robata////It's been a while but the food was just as good if not better than we remembered. It felt like coming home to an beloved, old friend. We picked an assortment of pieces to get a little bit of everything. The sushi pieces were definitely the best ones that we've had in the past few years. It's so hard to find uni where we live now so we had to order this.
