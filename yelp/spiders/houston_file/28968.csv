The Pit Room////My husband and I really enjoyed the bbq here. We went on a Thursday around 1:30 and there was no line but the restaurant was busy. We got the beef rib, brisket, venison sausage, pork ribs, elote and Mac and cheese. We really enjoyed all the dishes. The venison sausage was a bit too dry but it was something worth trying since other places we've been to didn't offer it. Â The bbq sauce was good here. It had a good sweet and tangy taste that went well with the bbq. I also really liked that the pickled veggie bar was free refill. The pickled veggies def help cut down the fatty/ meaty meal and made it more easier to eat and enjoy.
