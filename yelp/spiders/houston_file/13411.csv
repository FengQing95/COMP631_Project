JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Asabe - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry you did not enjoy your ramen. In the interest of improving our restaurant, can you expound on why you did not enjoy your JINYA Chicken Ramen? We work hard to provide a quality product, and the bulk of our reviews praise us for such. But it is the lower ratings that help us improve, so we're always keen to take constructive feedback whenever possible. You mentioned the possibility of a return visit, and we hope that you do come back. Our menu features more than a dozen different ramen varieties, each with a different flavor profile. We hope there is a ramen that is more suited to your palate. If you do return, please ask for recommendations from your server. He or she will be well-versed in what each ramen bowl has to offer. Thank you again, and we appreciate your time and consideration.
