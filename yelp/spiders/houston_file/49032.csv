Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was sat immediately though by a friendly and cheerful hostess. As I walked to my seat though - I noticed that the floors felt odd beneath my feet. They were slightly slippery, not enough so that I was in danger of falling, but enough that I felt like I could skate across them if I tried. They were also kinda bouncy or soft.
