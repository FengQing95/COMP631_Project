Uchi////Finally, the restaurant is kept very clean. I am extremely surprised just how clean they keep it for all the foot traffic that piles into the restaurant on the weekends. The bathrooms are also kept squeaky clean, which means they are paying attention to the details. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an upscale place to have an experience revolving around fresh fish and other fusion style cuisine.
