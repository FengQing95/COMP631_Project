Baby Barnaby's////I understand brunch in Houston on a Saturday is going to be crowded and you're going to have to wait, but I'd rather wait somewhere else. Â Best thing about Barnaby's is that the prices are definitely affordable and the decor is extremely cute and cheery. I'd go back......if I woke up early enough to avoid the wait.
