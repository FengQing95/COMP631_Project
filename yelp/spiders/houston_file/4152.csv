JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Well, I love a good soup of ramen noodle. However, I found the pork ramen to be a little greasy for my taste. Also, I thought I was getting a seasoned egg, but the egg was a whole boiled egg with no seasoning. I'll give it another try because I want to love it. I really do! :)
