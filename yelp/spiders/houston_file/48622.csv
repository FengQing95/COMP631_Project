Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Now, looking at the menu I was shocked. Because I thought since this place was buzzing I would be getting some quality stuff. It's just plain American breakfast foods: pancakes, hash, and a few different Benedict's. Â Now I've had amazing meals from different places of each of those. This wasn't one of those places. Not will I ever wait in line again for them. It's not special. To be fair it's not bad either. If that's your thing. You can get most of those things, better, at several places around town. So I'm not buying the craze.
