Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////People *actually* wake up early to get here before it gets too crazy, and the wait times they quote are true. Roughly an hour for a table on a Sunday morning, but they'll text you when your table is ready, so feel free to wander Montrose a bit (my friends and I went to Half Price Books just across the street).
