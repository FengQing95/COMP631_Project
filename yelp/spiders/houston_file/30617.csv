The Pit Room////The Ribs however were dry and I almost found myself eating them because they were there but being disappointed especially since this was my first dinner in Texas. The smaller pieces of Brisket just tasted like smoke, almost like if there was a chewing gum that was "smoke flavored" the taste of the longer pieces was a bit better but lacking any flavor except "smoke"
