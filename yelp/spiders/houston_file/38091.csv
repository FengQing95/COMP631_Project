Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place was excellent! Monday night is steak night which was comprised of a large piece of meat along with delicious green beans. Our server, Christina was so wonderful and friendly. She made one of our birthdays a little extra special. Will definitely be back next time in Houston!
