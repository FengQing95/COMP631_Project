JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Been to this location multiple times and each time pretty constant with good customer serve and food quality even in high traffic times. Me and a friend drive 45 mins for what i can say is an all in all great experience. We usually order the JINYA bun which I highly recommend if you like pork. I have also gotten the pot stickers, fried creamy spicy shrimp as well as the the spicy tonkotsu ramen which are all delicious and always fresh. If you are in the mood for a cocktail that is light, smooth & sweet get the cherry blossom- you will not be disappointed. Highly recommend
