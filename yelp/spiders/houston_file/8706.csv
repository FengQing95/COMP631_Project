JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Spicy chicken Ramen is hands down the best. Picture does no justice for the taste. Can flavor the heat to your liking and adjust your noodle thickness. Don't forget to add a delicious egg! ;) Also highly recommend their shrimp tempura appetizer. Great low key environment for a dinner or a date.
