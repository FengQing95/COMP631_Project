Kata Robata////   He sold us on one of their limited items, which was just awesome.  Then he talked us into just about all the usual favorites of Nigiri sushi.  My friend, who loves spicy foods, was enticed by the waiter's explanation of their spiciest roll.  Everything that came out on a plate, we ate and enjoyed.  I felt as though the waiter was a manager or the owner even, because his knowledge of the food ...and sake was impeccable.  I hope he doesn't go anywhere, because part of the reason I'm coming back is his service.  Put it to you this way, he was so interesting when he described the food that the chef would stand there smiling and listening along with us.  Maybe he was the owner, I don't know...I just know he added to our dining experience.
