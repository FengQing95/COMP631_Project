JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My experience was great. I am not one to just give out 5 stars. I have walked out of restaurants for a number of reasons. If a restaurant's restroom is filthy then I feel that the staff cannot have clean hands. This was not the case at Jinya. The restroom was soooooooooo clean. We had to wait about 30 minutes before getting seating but that to be expected with such a popular restaurant. The food was fabulous and well seasoned. Before going I read a number of reviews that helped. You can park in the nearby 24 hour fitness parking lot. I read a few reviews that said that the tempura fried Brussel sprouts were too oily. I ordered them anyways and asked them to not drizzle the truffle oil on them. The Brussel sprouts were so heavenly. The staff was great, the food was great, it was clean. I wouldn't recommend taking an older person that has hearing problems. It is very loud there but loudness just added to the awesomeness. My one suggestion would be to add two benches outside for the people are waiting to be seated.
