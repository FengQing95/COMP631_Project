Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My personal experience of Common Bond has been terrible. My experience culminates in taking 20 minutes to park and waiting in a 10 minute line only to be told that they were sold out of EVERYTHING on the menu. I had a coffee. It was fine. Otherwise I'm not sure if its laughable, or pretentious, but I likely won't be back.
