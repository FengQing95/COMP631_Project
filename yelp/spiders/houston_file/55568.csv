Kata Robata////If I were to rate them solely on food & drinks, I would no doubt give Kata Robata 5 stars. They certainly deserve to be rated in the Houston Chronicle's Top 100 Restaurants in Houston (they were rated #11). All of the sushi and sashimi that I've had there has been tasty, but it really is their epic Green Tea Cheesecake that makes me choose Kata Robata over any other sushi restaurant. I rarely order desserts at restaurants, especially at lunch, however I cannot go to Kata Robata without ordering the Green Tea Cheesecake, it is SO good. Just try it...
