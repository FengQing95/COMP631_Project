Baby Barnaby's////On to the food - this place is AMAZING. Both times I have gone I got the Migas with Chorizo - so delicioso. My husband got a waffle, the basic breakfast, and the Green Eggs plate with the Chicken Apple Sausage. Everything tastes soooooo good and fresh. We also love to watch the spiffy machine make fresh squeeze OJ.
