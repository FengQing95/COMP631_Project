Uchi////Every detail is thought of when they put your name on the wait list they don;t have an annoying PA system to call your name or come outside screaming they actually make notes of what you look like and come find you.  The hostesses also can get you drinks on the patio and you do not have to worry about paying they just add it to your bill once you sit down.
