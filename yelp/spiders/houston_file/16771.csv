JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Vegan Bun was ok, I'm not a fan of impossible meat but it comes with guac. Hence I ordered it and would rate it 3/5. I think impossible meat is quite dry from inside and hence the dry and chewing texture. On the other hand, the ramen was quite nice. I added a shot of hot sauce in it and it just exponentially enhanced the flavors. Try their hot sake ok the side and that will be the perfect dinner on a cold night. They had 3 vegetarian (2 vegan) ramen options, so I'm sure everyone can find a thing to eat.
