Uchi////We had the 10 course tasting meal plus a bit more, and everything was awesome.  The only dish I did not eat was the bonito sushi.  It looked like a fatty fish which I knew would be very strong (i.e., fishy) tasting.  My boyfriend confirmed it was, although he said the other ingredients really countered the strong taste.  I passed.
