JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We ordered the caramelized cauliflower, veggie ramen and the California poke bowl.  None of i was good.  The caramelized cauliflower was dreadful, tasted like steamed cauliflower with a ton of lemon juice it had a sour taste.  I was expecting caramelized with flavor, i got soggy lemon cauliflower.  My husband had the veggie ramen, it was also mediocre at best.  Everything inside the bowl lacked flavor.  Everything tasted like the steam in bag veggies that you find at the grocery store.  The poke bowl was also sub-par... I've seen better poke bowls at HEB.
