Local Foods////Love this place! There are not enough of healthy locally sourced food restaurants in Houston. After living in Austin for six years I got spoiled with a plethora of healthy options. Local foods makes eating healthy fun and easy! The decor is also very modern and loft like. Definitely one of my go to lunch spots!
