Kata Robata////I never really cared for this place until I tried the ramen. It's definitely a nice place to have a date or spend a special occasion at, but I wouldn't come here regularly. Personally, I only really eat sashimi and that gets pretty pricey, especially at a more classy place like Kata. It's not my cup of tea to go to a fancy sushi restaurant when I know there's a place right down the street where I can get almost as fresh pieces for a much more affordable price. I've also tried their lobster macaroni, which seems to be a popular item on the menu. It was okay, good to see what the hype is all about, but wouldn't order it again. Â
