Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Everyone raved about their food and all of our plates were empty. We came in on a Tuesday around 7:30 and were able to get a parking spot and a table. The restaurant itself isn't very big so I can see the issue of a long wait on the weekends. There have to be only 15 tables in the whole place so I would recommend going on a random weekday.
