JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've eaten here a couple of times over the past two months. I've only sat at the bar once when it was very busy in the rest of the dining room, and it was an okay experience, but I'll probably stick at sitting at a regular table from now on. Andrew has been my server every time I've been and he's excellent. Very friendly and knowledgeable on the menu. The shrimp tempura is awesome. My favorite entree is the Sprouting Ramen - the brussel sprouts are just to die for! My boyfriend's favorite is the Slurp Up Cilantro - the cilantro adds a distinct taste to the other soups, and I think it has shrimp in it where a lot of the other ones have pork. I haven't had a chance to try any of their other entree options besides ramen, but I might give the poke a try next time.... Can't wait!!!
