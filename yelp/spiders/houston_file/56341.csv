Kata Robata////- The Chef's Sashimi blew our minds. It was totally worth the $51 and we split it between 3 people but still had at least 2 pieces per person. Tons of fresh fish, well cut and laid on a bed of daikon in a giant sushi bucket boat, so you can feel like a boss while you eat. The tuna was firm and not fishy, the salmon was fatty, the toro was even more fatty...yes, please.
