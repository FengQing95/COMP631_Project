Uchi////Since all of the other yelpers who have given this place 5 stars have written a ton of useful information I'll keep it short. I came here for the soft opening, the media night, and after it officially opened. I had heard rave reviews about the Austin location from my bf so when it opened in Houston I was super excited!
