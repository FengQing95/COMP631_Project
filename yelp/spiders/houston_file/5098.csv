JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Amy - Thank you for your review. I truly wish that during any of these visits you had asked to speak to a manager to discuss these issues. I am conducting a review with my back of house to determine what went wrong with these particular dishes. It is unacceptable, and I truly regret that you left our establishment with such disappointment. As you can imagine, this is not how I run my business.
