The Pit Room////BBQ is definitely on point. tender meat that just falls off the bone and/or almost melts in your mouth. I would have given it five stars, however I feel that the prices are quite high compared to competitive restaurants with similar business models. Also, I feel like the customer service was just mediocre, nothing special.
