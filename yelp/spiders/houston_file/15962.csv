JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love this place. Usually get the spicy chicken but tried the fried chicken ramen special. It was also very good. My friend got the wanton Raman and they also liked there meal. I highly recommend starting with the tempura Brussels sprouts. The only negative is it's a little salty, but that's to be expected for this type of food.
