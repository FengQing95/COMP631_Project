Kata Robata////I was just at Kata on Thursday and they had an oxtail ramen on their specials menu. I have to say that it was the best ramen I have had so far in Houston. I've tried the kata ramen, which is the ramen that is on their regular menu, and I thought that it was mediocre. However the oxtail ramen was amazing. They cooked the meat for over 18 hours so it melted in your mouth and the flavor really came out in the broth. I don't know how often they change the specials menu but you have to try this if you see it! You won't be disappointed.
