Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great energy, food and drinks. Service staff led by Susie very attentive and helping each other out. Cornmeal catfish and 12 hour rib fantastic along with the grilled cheese from the HH menu. Pork chop was good but was missing something for me. Kentucky Orange Blossom best of the drinks I tried. Chef Rick and Ty let me crash their meeting and talk about whiskey. Also brought us a sample of one of their barrel picks. Good times and would definitely return.
