Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I went to Common Bond solely for the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich && it turned out to be just as good as I had imagined!! I had to go all in with the Parmesan fries as well, I ended up stuffed but it was definitely worth it. We order two hibiscus mimosas, the server accidentally brought out mango. She graciously comped the mango && brought out the mimosas we had ordered. We had to take some goodies to go since we were already there. The Turtle Brownie && Mocha Mascarpone Tart were both cute and delicious.
