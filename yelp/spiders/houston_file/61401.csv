Baby Barnaby's////Not to bad and usually a safe bet, any Barnaby's is sure to offer something for everyone. But Baby Barnaby's is just that, a truly small cozy neighborhood kitchen that literally packs em in. With a limited menu and great service, this place is a great stop for a quick safe bite to eat. Try the green eggs!
