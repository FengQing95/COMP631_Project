The Pit Room////Amazing rub, tough meat. Â The high reviews of this place are clearly the number of tourists who don't know better - this is in the museum district and was packed with tourists when I was there. The place has a great atmosphere and the sides are delicious. The meat is good, maybe it was because I went on a Monday and I got reheated goods from the weekend but I was disappointed with the tenderness of the meat. The pork ribs were chewy and hard. The brisket was crumbly. Loved the flavor but was hoping they'd have pulled it off the grill considerably earlier.
