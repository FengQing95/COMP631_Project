JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Sunny - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry you felt our food was overpriced. Over the years I have visited dozens of ramen shops worldwide, and I've spent as little as $8 for a bowl of ramen and as much as $20. What I have learned is that each ramen shop is unique in its own way -- from the noodles and broth they use, to the side dishes they serve, to the price points they target. Here in Midtown, a quick Google search will reveal an average apartment rents and home-sale prices that surpass most of the greater Houston area. In other words, goods and services in Midtown tend to be on the pricier side.
