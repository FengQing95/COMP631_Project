Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The interior is beautiful and bright. I love the open windows and all the natural light that shines in and glistens off the white table/counter tops. The pastries are good and you can really taste the freshness of the ingredients. The service isn't the friendliest, but it isn't too bad either. I must make a note to stop in earlier because the pastries are always running out when I arrive.
