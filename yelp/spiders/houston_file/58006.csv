Kata Robata////Before walking to Dessert Gallery for a nighttime sweet trip in this section, I went to dinner here for the first time ever tonight. I ordered their Rising Sun Roll, which was fantastic in all ways. No wonder it's a very popular sushi order here. It was very delicious with a very fresh, high quality and somewhat peppery taste to its overall flavor. I could really taste the fresh n high quality tuna and the touch of avocado in the roll. There were other flavors I couldn't put my finger on that made it unique and allowed the fish to stand out nicely with balance. Since I can't stand the really bitter n sour taste of wasabi, I asked for a double side of ginger which added that extra juiciness n slight tartness to the meal. Â I was also impressed by the good amount they put for even just one serving of ginger. They don't skimp. The service was great and friendly on this visit as well. On a side note, I plan to try their Crab n Lobster Ramen order on another visit in the future.
