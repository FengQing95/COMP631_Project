Uchi////This place is awesome and I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone! They have a wonderful selection for happy hour, I think anyone looking to go here for the first time go to happy hour first. Everyone that worked there was very educated about what was on the menu and could explain each and every dish that came to our table. Wonderful place to eat, I can't wait to come back!
