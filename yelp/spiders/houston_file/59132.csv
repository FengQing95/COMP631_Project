Baby Barnaby's////First time dining here and I was impressed at the door with the warm reception and homely feel. The service was excellent and the prices were decent. The ham steak and eggs with cheese was delicious! I had to try the green eggs and it was pretty tasty. If you like spinach artichoke dip you will love these eggs. The only drawback is that it sort of overtakes the eggs. I'm definitely coming back..maybe try the lunch next!
