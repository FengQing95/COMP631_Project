Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////In a word -- yummy.  The only downside would be that it is often packed because everyone ELSE thinks it is yummy, too.  My chocolate croissant was divine, my coffee was dee-lish, and luckily we had a table inside because our friends got there before we did.  I have not tried their cafe items; however, I hear only positive things.  If you can walk there, do it.  If you drive and see an open spot, take it.  This place is a little pricey, but definitely worth the stop!
