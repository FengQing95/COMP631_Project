JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I only want to assure you that what we do at JINYA has nothing to do with "instant ramen packets" and "squirted sriracha." We are a team of 75 individuals who work very hard to serve upwards of 1,300 people for 12 to 14 hours everyday. And at the end of the day, our reputation -- online or otherwise -- is all that we have to help us support ourselves and our families.
