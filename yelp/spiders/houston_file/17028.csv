JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////i do prefer jinya's appetizers to their ramen, especially their jinya buns. the pork belly on these buns literally melt in your mouth, and the bun itself is so yummy and fluffy. their happy hour is the best time to try their appetizers, if you're interested! online it says their happy hour times are from 3-5, but there's a physical sign in front of jinya saying that happy hour is from 3-6.
