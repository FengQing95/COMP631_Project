Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Used to be a daily habit but when new owner took it's taken a nose dive. bakery still good as it was but not great as it used to be. Dirty bathroom. Floors not swept sometimes. Expensive for some creative...I mean unusual food choices. Quality of table napkins has lessened. Service of floor workers not as it used to be when it opened. When it opened it was the rage....now just a nice other place.
