Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The parking wasn't bad and I found a spot as soon as I pulled up without having to valet. The scenery was nice, the bar tenders were personable and really nice. He came up with some good mock-tails. There was a little hick up with the wait because they host took down the wrong number so we had to wait an extra 10 minutes before finding out why I never received a text for the table. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because every thing on the menu I wanted they were out of. I got the drunken pasta and it was pretty bland. Salt and pepper fixed it. The chicken I added was very flavorful. My friend had the French onion mac with chicken and it tasted much better. The DJ or music they played was on point. I could dance while I eat so overall it was good.
