JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm really picky when it comes to ramen, but Jinya does it right. I LOVE this restaurant--the food is absolutely delicious. My favorite is the Black Tonkatsu Ramen. The broth is AMAZING. The lines here can get pretty long on the weekends, so my friends and I always try to come earlier than the standard meal times. It takes a bit longer for the food to come, but the wait is definitely worth it!
