Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Had a horrible experience at a new pizza place a few nights ago. The staff was disorganized, no team work, and poor attitudes. Bosscat is and was a refreshing change! The entire staff had smiles on their faces, efficient service, and overall just had a great vibe! I mentioned to one of the bartenders that they must have a great owner/Manager which the other place obviously didn't. Strong leadership reflects on your staff. I will definitely be back, and Tim makes a great mezcal Margarita that was not on the menu!
