JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Fast forward to NYE 2017. I decided to spend the entire day eating all my "last meals" before starting the Whole 30. We started off with the tempura Brussels sprouts, then split the veggie soup with spicy broth (extra noodles & broth). After one bite, I knew I had been wrong about ramen for all these years. In retrospect, I realize I'm not fond of seaweed and bamboo...but I reeeeeally like gourmet ramen.
