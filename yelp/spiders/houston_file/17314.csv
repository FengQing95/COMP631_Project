Uchi////Completely overrated.  Populated by wannabes who'd like to think they appreciate sushi and completely fooled by the wait staff with below average knowledge of Japanese cuisine.  Service was slow and did not get sake refills in time to enjoy with the meal.  Too bad we got our hopes for this one.
