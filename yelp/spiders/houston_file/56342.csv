Kata Robata////- The Lobster Mac n Cheese: if you want to order this, make sure to ask for it last, because it's a finisher to your meal. It had three kinds of cheese, giant chunks of whole lobster meat, and probably flakes of gold. This is a dish to share...If you manage to put this away on your own you should make sure you have the metabolism of a hummingbird because this dish will give you serious food coma.
