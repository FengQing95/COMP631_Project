Local Foods////Arugula shrimp, cranberries, Texas honey pecans, pecorino, lemon-thyme vinaigrette:  5/5 -  DELICIOUS.  Plentiful of shrimp.  I love the peppery flavor of arugula and it complimented the lemon-thyme vinaigrette nicely.  The dressing was so perfect.  It's whipped, so thicker than just olive oil dressings and not too acidic in flavor.  I don't usually order salads when I dine, but this is an exception.
