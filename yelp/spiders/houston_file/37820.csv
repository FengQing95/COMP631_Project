Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Here is were you absolutely failed. Meatloaf cubes... concept= great, execution would get you chopped. Crispy mush... either you're using too high a fat count beef (I don't think so), too many breadcrumbs, to much moisture. Remember, when you deep fry something, it retains over 90% of its moisture. Your meatloaf cubes are mush when they come out. Â It's like eating a crispy coated soggy bread cube.
