Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The best bakery in all of Houston!! Must try their Kough Ammon. I might have spelled it wrong. But there is nothing wrong about it! It's so tasty!! It has the lightness of a fresh croissant and this sticky topside. Do not make the mistake of flipping it over because it will stick to the plate! I also enjoy the chocolate croissant for myself and the kids. Very good breakfast menu. Cool hip vibe! Try anything and it won't disappoint!
