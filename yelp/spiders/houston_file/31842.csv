Local Foods////Have come here a couple of times and both times have been very impressed.  Each time I got the truffled egg sandwich on the pretzel roll, because it's oh so good!  Sandwiches each come with two sides.  I tried different sides each time I went and all of them have been amazing.  The kale and chips are especially good.  Super flavorful and you can tell that everything that make is organic and fresh.  The second time I went I got the mintade, which is amazing.  Super flavorful and quenches your thirst.  Will definitely come here again after a day of shopping in Rice Village or a run around the Rice track.  Desserts all look very good, but did not get the opportunity to try them.
