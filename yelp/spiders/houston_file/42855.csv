Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Wowza, my new favorite place! I had the chicken torta which was amazing and my husband had the biscuits and gravy which was good. I had a delicious pastry, I forgot the name of it. It had cream and apples in it, it was to die for. My husband had the most awesome chocolate chip cookie with nuts in it which was delightful. Our cappuccinos were great and went well with the desserts. This place stays busy and packed, the wait is so worth it. They also have a nice patio to sit out on which is nice when the weather is beautiful. Yes, we will definitely be back! The food, ambiance and service is wonderful!!!!!!
