JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////While the food here was great I only gave 2 stars because there was no limited capacity during the pandemic. Â No empty table between seated tables to create that "buffer". It was almost shoulder to shoulder. The close proximity in which guests were seated made it feel as if there was no pandemic!
