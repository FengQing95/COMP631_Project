Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First time here. Great atmosphere. Ordered appetizers to get a wide variety of dishes. Was dissatisfied in the Bourbon Chicken flatbread and Parmesean Crusted Meatloaf. The bar staff, Christia (sp?) and Tim, asked how it was and when I expressed I was unhappy, they didn't hesitate to take it off the bill and replace with alternatives. My husband raved about the Pig Candy, a heavier cooked pork belly reminiscent of carnitas. We both liked the Nashville Hot Frog Legs...a lot. 4 stars is for great service. Everyone is very friendly! We will be back based on the service!
