Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is definitely my favorite place for pastries. They have the best in Houston by far, almost as good as New York but not approaching France. The almond croissants are the best followed by the custom desserts. The stuff on the menu is pretty good but for top shelf prices you can get better. Still, it's a good place to eat while you are getting the pastries.
