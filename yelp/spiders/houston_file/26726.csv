The Pit Room////I was excited to try this restaurant as it came highly rated to me from friends. There was a line outside the door which made me even more excited because you could tell it was a popular place. The line moved super quick and there was plenty of seating to find a spot to sit after we ordered. My boyfriend and I ordered the brisket, ribs, and pork jalape√±o cheddar sausage. For sides we chose the Mac n cheese and chips. The sausage was by far my favorite on the menu. As for the brisket and ribs - they were WAY too fatty for my liking. It was towards the end of the day on a holiday but it seemed like we got the fattiest cut of meats when we ordered therefore the taste probably wasn't as good as it could have been. They had people coming around cleaning the tables off and taking your trays when you were done which I loved because it helped with the overall cleanliness of the restaurant. Overall I would give it a 3.5!
