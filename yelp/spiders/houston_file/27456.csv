The Pit Room////In the end we spent about $60 for the majority of the meat to be dry and chewy. I didn't know if I should have just watched which pieces they gave us to tell them "not those," but I guess I put faith in the guys cutting our meat and assumed they'd give us the good stuff. Pretty disappointing, and probably wouldn't go back.
