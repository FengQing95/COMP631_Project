Uchi////Not going to lie, my boyfriend and I always made fun of restaurants where the servings were super small and expensive. But all of that changed when we experienced the Omakase in this restaurant. It all just made sense and my previous thoughts on small gourmet meals have changed and now I respect the art of it. Dining here was an experience within itself and I highly recommend it. But if you are thinking about eating here, it's best to "go big or go home".
