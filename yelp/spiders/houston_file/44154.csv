Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////For pastries, I love the almond croissant (surprise, surprise) and Kouign Amann. If you come in the afternoon though, there's a high chance they're sold out of both of them. I tried Kouign Amanns (pronounced queen ah-man) for the first time in SF, fell in love, but never thought I'd ever see one of these fine pastries ever in Texas. In swooped Common Bond to save the day! Flaky, buttery goodness. Just try it for yourself. I don't think you can really go wrong with any of the pastries. Oh, and even the baguettes are good. For drinks, I really like the lavender latte, but their drip coffee is amazing too!
