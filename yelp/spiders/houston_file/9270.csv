JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello An - Thank you for your review. We appreciate your kind words. Our tonkotsu broth is made from an 18-hour pork-bone reduction; therefore, these particular bowls will almost always have that thin layer of fat on the surface of the broth, as this is one of the key markers of an authentic Japanese tonkotsu ramen.
