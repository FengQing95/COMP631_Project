JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////A ramen place that opens so late! We came rolling in past 1 AM and this place was still busy with other hungry folks. The restaurant is clean and upscale-looking plus I thought the atmosphere was relaxing. They have quite a variety of ramen to choose from so pick according to your tastebuds. I chose the spicy umami miso ramen which was so good, spicy (for once), and made me super full. I couldn't finish the bowl 'cause it was tons of goodness in that bowl. I sampled off the tonkatsu bowls (spicy and black) and they were also great! I might choose the spicy one for a flavour change.
