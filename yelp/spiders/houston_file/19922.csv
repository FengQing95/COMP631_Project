Uchi////I definitely recommend getting a rice dish just because you can blow through a few hundred bucks on sashimi and sake and still be hungry. And the rice dish we had was in a clay pot with egg and it was also very amazing. The sashimi and raw fish dishes were all amazing. The sake and even their dry rose wine was great. If ever I want to spoil myself or have a reason to celebrate, this is my spot for sure.
