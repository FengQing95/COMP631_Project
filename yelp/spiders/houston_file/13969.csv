JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So my favorite ramen joint up to this point has been Soma.  Jinya has been the only contender for the title to this point.  I've gone thrice, and have never left disappointed. The place itself is a cozy modern design.  The staff is welcoming and ridiculously attentive.  They've always been helpful in menu options and fantastic service!  The food is delicious. The eggs haven't always been as gooey as I prefer, but they come whole, not in halves.   Tis a bit different and they continue to cook is you don't eat them first.  I tend to finish them last.  The tonkotsu black is my favorite.  The broth isn't too salty, and they give you good portions of the mix ins.  The Cha Cha  Cha is a good one, but not as flavorful as I'd like.  Still tastey, just a tad salty for my preference.  The pork falls to pieces and is delicious.
