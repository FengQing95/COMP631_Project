Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If you love sweets, this is a dream come true. The display is beautiful and the flavors here are amazing! The only reason they got 4 stars was because the latte was average. I picked the sticky bun and the dulce de leche tart and I wanted to eat all of it by myself. Fortunately my husband was there to share and save me from a sugar rush.
