JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Alexus - Thanks for your review. I regret that your server failed to refill your water glass -- that is unacceptable and not the level of service we expect from our staff. I will definitely have a word with everyone about it. We hope you are able to visit us again, perhaps during off-peak hours when the wait times are shorter. Regardless, we appreciate your business and hope to serve you again soon.
