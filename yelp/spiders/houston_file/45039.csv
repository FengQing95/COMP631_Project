Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Four star aspects: The coffee. Great quality beans and house-made syrups, but the espresso drinks are always too cold and the mocha flavor not strong enough. And no matter how hard I try, everything I eat here is super messy. The pastries crumble everywhere, my beloved almond croissant leaves powdered sugar on my face for days, the delicious sandwiches ooze out when you attempt to take a bite, and they're barely small enough to fit in your mouth. And this is just a matter of personal preference, but the flavor profiles are aimed at an ideal that I disagree with. Again, a very high-brow point of contention, but when I come here and spend $12 for simple eggs and coffee, I want everything to be perfect.
