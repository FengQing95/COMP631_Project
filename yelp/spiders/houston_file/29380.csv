The Pit Room////I ordered a 3 meat plate for 18.98 and added a sausage link for another 4.50.  I went with brisket, pulled pork, and turkey.  The brisket was very moist and the bark was smokey and had that pop of flavor you are looking for.  The fat from the point was perfectly rendered and had the buttery smooth texture BBQ addicts crave.  The turkey and pulled pork were also moist and tasted even better slathered with some of their house made BBQ sauce.  It has a bit of a heat kick to it which I really enjoyed.
