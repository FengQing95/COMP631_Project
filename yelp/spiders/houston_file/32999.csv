Local Foods////That's not to say all's bad. The prices are reasonable for the large portions, ambiance, and quality of the ingredients, if not the taste. 10-12 bucks gets you a nice sized sandwich and two fist-sized sides. If you want to see and be seen, this is the place for you since the atmosphere is trendy and the place is bustling. Plus, it's a local business, so anything that takes some business away from Jason's Deli, Subway, and the rest of those joints is a good thing in my mind.
