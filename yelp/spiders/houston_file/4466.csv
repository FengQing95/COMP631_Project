JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've tried the ramen of the month (spicy miso pork I believe), spicy chicken, tonkotsu spicy, and the wonton ramen. My partner is really into the tonkotsu black ramen. The broth of that ramen is truly phenomenal; it is so savory like it absorbed the flavors of the meats, it tastes a meal of its own. You ought to slurp the broth out of respect for how good it is. The spicy levels of the ramen can be adjusted and the spicy level is always just right to pick up your appetite but not overwhelming. The proportion of food to noodles is good, every bite of ramen and every spoonful have plenty of vegetables and meat mixed in. The wonton ramen was interesting since that's not a traditional ramen dish. The wonton were just squares with wonton meat inside and then folded over into a triangle. Can't tell if that's creative or lazy on their part, but the wontons tasted good anyway :)
