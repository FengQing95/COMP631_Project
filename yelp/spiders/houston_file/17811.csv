Uchi////Unique, delicious Japanese food with AMAZING service!  Not as pricey as others made it out to be....for 5 courses and 2 drinks, we spent about $120 before tip.  Granted portions are small but it lets you try multiple items rather than just one dish.  Our favorites were the Hama chili, roasted brussel sprouts, & the fried milk!
