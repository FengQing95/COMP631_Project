Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My friend and I was looking for a spot to grab a bite to eat before heading home.. she knows that I am the Yelp queen! Luckily this place came up and we decided to give it a try and boy we are happy that we did! I love quaint hidden gems with quality food and drinks . This place is it.. and the Monday night steak special is to die for... seasoned to perfection and nice and hot (fresh)! I order the BC tea which was different than what J expected but not bad... I will definitely be returning!
