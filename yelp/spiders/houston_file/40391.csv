Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I ordered the 2x2 burger off of the brunch menu. The onion jam was sweet and added a great touch to the savory parts of the burger. The boss fries were huge, I personally did not like chewing them - I'm a person who likes wiggly/mushy fries so this is more preference based.
