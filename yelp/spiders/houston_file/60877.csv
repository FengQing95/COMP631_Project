Baby Barnaby's////My two favorite dishes are the pink and white scramble as well as the green eggs. They're both delicious, are generous with the house potatoes, and are easy to substitute in gluten-free options. Off-site and street parking is available, and please tip the waitstaff a lot. They hustle and are always pleasant and positive!
