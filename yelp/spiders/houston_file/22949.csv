Uchi////Fresh, innovative sushi restaurant.  The selection is huge.  Almost overwhelming.  They have a nice happy hour with a rotating menu.  They also have a nice vegetarian menu with tasty selections.  They don't offer standard rolls (think California roll).  They offer a lot of fresh sashimi selections and traditional Japanese fare.  I wish they had udon, ramen or tonaktsu options.  Pricey, but worth It.
