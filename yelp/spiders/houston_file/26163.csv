The Pit Room////Having recently moved from Houston to Austin, I have been eating a lot more BBQ. Coming home for the holidays to see that this place opened was an amazing surprise. Arguably the best BBQ myself, my girlfriend, and my family has had in town. Absolutely superb. So excited the Pit Room is around and making such quality food, representing the htown BBQ scene.
