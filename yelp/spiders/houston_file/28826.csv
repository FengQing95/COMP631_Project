The Pit Room////The brisket was perfectly tender, and everyone I picked it up for liked it. We got three orders to go, and it was pretty easy to snag. The only bad part was that they must get a lot of call-in orders, because I had to wait about 5 minutes as they packed up other orders in front of me before I could even place my order.
