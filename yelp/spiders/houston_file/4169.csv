JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Shanique - Thank you for your great review. I agree that our communal seating might not be for everyone, but the design is essentially Japanese in terms of architecture and ergonomics. And in our defense, for every awkward response by customers, there are instances where new friends are made and spontaneous conversations are struck. I have even seen complete strangers offer food to one another other simply because someone said the dish they received looked appealing.
