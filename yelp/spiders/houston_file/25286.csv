Uchi////I don't know why it took me so long to try this place but I'm glad I finally had the opportunity! First and foremost the staff were very professional in welcoming us, and our server Hudson was so helpful! He asked if it was our first time at Uchi (which it was) and went through the whole menu with us with such ease. If he didn't do that, I don't think I'd know what I'd be ordering lol.
