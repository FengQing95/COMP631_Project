Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Definitely worth the hype! We got the corned beef hash, breakfast pot pie and pancake flight ( cinnamon roll, blueberry danish, pineapple upside down) our favorite was blueberry bc it was well balanced between cream cheese, tart, and not too sweet. The cinnamon roll was a little too sweet.
