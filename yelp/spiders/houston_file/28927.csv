The Pit Room////The BBQ here is really good and has a nice smokey, delicious flavor, but the inside of the restaurant was a bit gross. There were a bunch of flies swarming the trash can and the toppings area (area with the pickles, onions etc). It really makes me question their sanitation practices in the back.
