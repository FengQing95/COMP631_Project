JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Service: The host was warm, and one of the servers was at the front with her when we walked in, and she was nice, too. But our waiter.. I don't really know how to describe him. I guess I would say he was polite, and courteous. In the beginning I thought he was nice, but, I started to feel something was off. The kindness felt fake. He didn't come off as genuinely caring for our experience. Maybe he was having a bad morning and had to put on the 'fake it till you make it' facade, which, not gonna lie, I've had to do on more than one occasion throughout my years in the restaurant industry. But, adding that to my distasteful food.. eh.
