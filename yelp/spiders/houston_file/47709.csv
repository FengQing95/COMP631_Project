Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////They were already over half full but I was seated immediately, waiter was there within 30 seconds and brought coffee quickly. I looked over the menu and there are a lot of choices. I went with two small "Benedict's" one with lox and the other with ham. I was surprised to wait over 35 minutes for the food, but it looked quite appealing. I cut into the first and took a bite... It was literally cold. I thought at first maybe it was the lox, but egg was truly cold and hollandaise was at best room temp. So, I tried the other and iced cold. The hash browns were hot, but that was the only thing on the plate that was close to correct temperature for food.
