Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Excellent burger! Went on a Saturday before the rodeo.  They only had their brunch menu which was disappointing.  I had researched a cool restaurant for days and had wanted some of their menu items.  But the burger was amazing! Would definitely recommend but would ask that they at least put out a lunch menu on the weekends.
