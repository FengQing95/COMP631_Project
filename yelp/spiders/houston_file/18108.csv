Uchi////I loved the sushi bar area. During one of my several visits, I got to sit in front of a Japanese chef who had an American dude nickname. He seemed to be trying to hide from me the fact that he was actually from Japan.. Maybe he felt shy. He was SUPER good. I do recommend sitting at the sushi counter if at all possible..
