JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////was working in the area and decided to stop here for lunch. for $20 and no drink, i expected something a little more.. filling.. great flavor. Presentation was gorgeous. I told the waitress i wanted something spicy. She recommended the tonkotsu black. And added spice. Didnt know i was gonna get charged extra for a line of spice.. and it wasnt spicy at all... i may try this place a few more times before considering it a "no"
