Kata Robata////For my entree, I ordered the chirashi. Their offering was a very good variety of different fish, and the sushi rice was vinegary perfection. Unfortunately, the salmon was pretty fishy tasting, and a few other pieces were also not so fresh. Would consider going back, but definitely think this place is better suited for groups who can order plates to share.
