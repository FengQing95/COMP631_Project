The Pit Room////The meat was solidly good, but the standout was definitely the beef rib!! Brisket was solid, jalape√±o sausage was fine but I've had better. I loved the pickle bar. BUT the barbecue sauce was vvvv weird - it tasted like tomato sauce mixed with bbq sauce. We actually took our food home to eat with a different sauce. Would order the beef rib and bring my own bbq sauce next time, but honestly will probably go to Pinkerton's instead
