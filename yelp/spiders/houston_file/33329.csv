Local Foods////I really love this place! It's very cute and very Rice Village (nice atmosphere, slightly hipster-y). We sat outside on the patio with the lights and it was super nice. I got the banh mi sandwich, which was good but not spectacular. However the quinoa side I got was sooo gooood, and the slaw wasn't bad either. I got the lemontade (can't remember exactly what it was called....lemonade, lime, mint, and orange juice) which was really good and super refreshing. From what my friends were telling me you really couldn't go wrong with any of the sandwiches - the asian salad was huuuuge!!
