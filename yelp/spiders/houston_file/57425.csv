Kata Robata////This roll was okay. There was something about the aftertaste of the short ribs that didn't sit well with me. It was a strange meaty flavor that lasted for quite some time after biting into it. I liked the citrus flavor from the ponzu oil and the nice herb-y tomato powder with the light and fatty toro, but other then that I wouldn't order this roll again.
