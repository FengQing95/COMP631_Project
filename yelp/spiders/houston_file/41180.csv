Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The place is soooooo good. I plan on going back repeatedly to try all the delicious things that called to me from behind the glass! We did make the mistake of going on Sunday afternoon, and it was CRAZY busy. I would probably go a lot earlier or just get my order to go next time because it was hell trying to get a table in that mess.
