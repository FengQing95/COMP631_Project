Kata Robata////I've been to Kata Robata twice so far and I have to say it's one of my favorite places to get sushi in Houston. It's a little pricey but there are some dishes that are worth it. The otoro was very good. The price is only for one piece of sushi though. The ramen had a flavorful miso broth. The egg was nicely soft boiled and the noodles had a nice bite to them. They were the thicker kind of wavy ramen noodles. Another shareable dish I got was the grilled sushi rice and eggplant miso. I love the char on the sushi rice and the eggplant was soft and well cooked. The miso was a strong flavor but I absolutely love miso. The vegetable sushi platter was interesting. Not traditional but a good option for vegetarians who are eating at the restaurant.
