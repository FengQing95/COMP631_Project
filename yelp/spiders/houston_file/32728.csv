Local Foods////I've only had their Falafel Sandwich and honestly, I probably wouldn't order anything else because this sandwich is just THAT GOOD!  It comes with your choice of soup or two side items.  I always go for the sides because they have a good selection to pick from.  I've tried their quinoa salad (which is amazing!), their beets salad (it was decent) and their homemade chips (very good).  I have to say the quinoa salad and that falafel sandwich makes me keep going back for more.
