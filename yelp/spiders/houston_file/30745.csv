The Pit Room////For main, we ordered a couple of the Meat Dinners (3 & 2).   Brisket (of course), Chicken and Sausage.  Got the Czech style and Jalapeño Cheddar sausages and both were seasoned perfectly and tasty.  As mentioned the Brisket never disappoints and chicken was very good.  We also got the Mac & Cheese and Elote for sides which matched the excellence of the meats.
