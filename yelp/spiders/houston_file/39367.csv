Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The front of the house needs training & improvement. Those girls shoved us and other customers to the back of the restaurant and seating by the bathroom. We moved elsewhere since it was pretty empty and others did too!  The hostess who showed me to the table insisted she needed the table back by 1:15.  Really it was 11:00 - how rude!
