Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Yesssss... I live walking distance away.  Have been to snooze in denver and was a fan way back then.  This place has a private parking lot with valet, i usually just walk there though, not sure of street parking situation.  Atmosphere and decor similar to colorado restaurants, and almost has an austin vibe.  Laid-back casual with funky colors all over the place.  In terms of the food they pride themselves in brunch and their huge pancakes.  I personally cant eat a whole order of pancakes myself but will usually order a full order for the table to share. or a side pancake with my entree.  Everything Ive had there is pretty good, so go there and try everything.  Seriously who doesnt like breakfast/brunch food..
