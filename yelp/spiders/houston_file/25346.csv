Uchi////We've been to Uchi 10+ times and we've had a fabulous experience every time! Be sure to make a reservation. I love the ambiance inside and it's a perfect date night spot. Their menu is fantastic and they also offer a happy hour from 4-6:30. Â All of the fish is very high quality and tastes amazing. I love the creativity behind their dishes. Also, their wine list in amazing! As a wine nerd, I really appreciate the selections. They also have sake and beer and sake cocktails. It's an incredible place all around. We always have great service!
