Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Love this place! You can come to study, meet up with a friend, or just to enjoy some amazing pastries & coffee!! Service is always great, sometimes it can get really busy but they are always nice. The Chicken torta is my favorite!!! But everything is pretty fantastic
