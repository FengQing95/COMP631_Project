Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////When I arrived I starting looking at the desserts they all seemed to look dry and old looking but had a nice presentation I ordered a coffee cake $6 and when I used my plastic fork to take a piece the fork broke in half and took a piece of the cake and almost choked it was that dry. WARNING DONT COME HERE THE DESSERTS ARE ONLY PRESENTATION NO FLAVOR AT ALL!!!!
