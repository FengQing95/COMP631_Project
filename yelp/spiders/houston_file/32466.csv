Local Foods////One of my favorite places in the Village! Good vibes and great food. Everything I have tried has been consistently fresh and delicious. My favorites so far are the smoked salmon on bagel and the duck confit, but I hear nothing but praise for the crunchy chicken sandwich on the pretzel bun. They have a good assortment of healthy sides like barley or kale, but most of the time I can't resist their homemade potato chips, oops.
