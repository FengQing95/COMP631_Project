Uchi////4.) Great service and meal flow - It can be tough to predict how a Japanese restaurant will serve you.  Is everything going to come out at once?  Will it be half-now and half-later?  Are they going to forget one of my rolls?  Inconsistent meal flow at a Japanese restaurant can have a serious impact on the experience, and at Uchi they make you feel like you're the only guest at the restaurant!  A team of servers consistently provide you with your next dish one-after-the-other, without any rushed portions or lags between servings.  Their explanations of each dish are also extremely helpful, particularly when you're trying to remember each of the 10 things you ordered :)
