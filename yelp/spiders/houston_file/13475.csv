JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Atmosphere: Visually the place looks rather interesting, the interior is lit by soft lantern-like jars that pair pretty well with their modern Ramen Bar theme. For seating they have 5 Booths for 2, 6 Table/Booths for 4, 2 Long Tables for up to 12 (Can Seat Separate Groups), and a Bar Area with a few seats for individuals. You can make a reservation incase they're busy.
