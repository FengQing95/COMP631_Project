Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Absolutely beautiful place with a well oiled team of employees. Huge pastries, croissants and other goodies out available to drool over. My personal favorite is the chocolate croissant that they have. Sometimes they do sell out if you get there late enough in the afternoon
