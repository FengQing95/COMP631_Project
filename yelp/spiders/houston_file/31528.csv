Local Foods////For my two sides, I chose "wild rice" and "house potato chips." For some reason I expected the wild rice to be at least luke warm. It came out ice cold and you can tell it was meant to be served that way. The rice was a bit too al dente for me, didn't care for it at all. The house potato chips were underwhelmingly presented and a tad bit on the oily side. Most of the chips in my basket looked like someone took their first to it. But from the handful of chips that didn't require me to scoop up with a spoon (figure of speech, I didn't literally spoon it lol) they were crunchy and salted perfectly.
