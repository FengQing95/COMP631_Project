Local Foods////I really like their sandwiches. They're not stingy on portion size. My favorite sandwich is the crunchy chicken. That buttermilk ranch is just delicious! The pretzel bun is always baked so perfectly. I also love the duck confit sandwich. The duck is cooked just right. Roast beef is so good too! The smoked salmon sandwich is a little weird to me, but I still like it.
