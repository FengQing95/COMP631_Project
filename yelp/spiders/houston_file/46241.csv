Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Been here a couple times (once when visiting Houston and once after moving here) and loved it! Staff is always friendly and willing to help. I've tried their strawberry macaron, almond croissant, and chocolate walnut cookie. All super delicious and perfect for snacks or dessert. Most people come here and order their pastries to-go as the tables are for dine-in only. Will definitely be going back to try their pistachio croissant.
