JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Are you hip? Do you zig when others zag? Do you pronounce t swift t swizzle. Have you been called a hipster..self proclaimed isn't the same. When you see the sign from the street it looks low key. You even walk in and see the "please wait to be seated sign" and you remain oblivious to what you're about to experience. I felt like I walked into a modern day speakeasy, when I crossed the threshold of bar to restaurant. While there isn't anything illegal about selling ramen, the vibe is a throwback to a more intimate setting with 2 huge large open tables filling the space. Scattered around you can find more traditional seating.
