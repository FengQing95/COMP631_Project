Local Foods////My bf and I stopped by during our weekend trip to Houston. After taking two bites of his duck confit sammie, he mumbled, "Good choice babe." Never thought that brie would taste good with duck, nor that egg salad would be so great with truffle oil (and with that pretzel bun)! Major noms. I love how they have healthy sides like kale and beets. Everything tasted so fresh. We were both thoroughly full after consuming our meal. The only thing that was a little off was the mintade--it was a little too sour.
