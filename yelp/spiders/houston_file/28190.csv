The Pit Room////I ordered the brikset, beef ribs, and the venison sausage. Sadly they were out of the pork ribs but i'll have to try that next time when I'm in houston. The brikset melted in my mouth but the bark still remained which gave a mixture of the nice seasoned crunch and the moist juice of the beef. The pepper is a bit strong but I personally love pepper so its okay with me. The ribs were really nice and soft as well.
