Kata Robata////I am so impressed by the professionalism of the owner of this place. My last review was rather cranky. I mean, I think it's really important for restaurants to move towards foregrounding excellent non-meat dishes, even if that's not their primary "thing", but I have to admit that sometimes the frustration does sort of all come out at once. Anyway, Ryan wrote to me and offered to make my last meal up to me by showing me how well Kata can do veg. food. I don't know how he manages to deal with criticism in such a generous and zen way, but I'm a fan of his now!
