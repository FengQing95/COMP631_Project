Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I had high hopes for this place and I've seen many of my friends posts.  Decided to treat a friend for her birthday and try out this place.  Atmosphere is nice, place is pretty large with a bar in the front. Place is also not built for noise reduction, it is very loud and noisy in here so if you're looking for a quiet romantic place,  this is probably not the best place.  Staff was friendly,  food was decent,  but of 3 dishes,  only 1 was unexpectedly what I wanted to finish. The pork belly poutine fries were so delish.  The macaroni had cinnamon in it which was more strange than yum, the pork hush puppies had no flavor other than the sauce that comes with it,  so if you don't like the sauce then you're outta luck. The pork in the poutine at least held it's own flavor,  the pork in the hush puppies lacked any flavor and the cornbread encasing was not sweet at all so it didn't offer much taste as well.  Place seems good  for accommodating large groups. Would try this place again but other items on the menu, and maybe the poutine again
