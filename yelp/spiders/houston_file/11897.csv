JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First to come out were the 4 shrimp balls for $6.50. Seriously, I could have just eaten those and left very happy. They were excellent (5). Crispy on the outside and so yummy on the inside with sour cream and shrimp they were divine! I highly recommend these to you. You will not be disappointed. The salad and pork gyoza showed up next. I thought the salad was good (3.5) and the pork gyoza (like dumplings) were a 3. The big bowl of chicken ramen arrived and it was so chicken noodly good (3.5). I liked it and you will too. If I had to do it all over again, I would have ordered the shrimp balls and ramen again and skipped the gyoza and salad because I didn't need that much food.
