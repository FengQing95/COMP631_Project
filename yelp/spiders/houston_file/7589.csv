JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////In a quick and dirty comparison, Jinya is much nicer on the inside than Tatsuya although the quality doesn't quite match. The location is a bit annoying for parking as the garage always seems full. But it's in a happening area of Midtown and the ambiance inside is great.
