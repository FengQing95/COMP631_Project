Kata Robata////What we ordered... Salmon carpaccio, Kobe beef taco, yellowtail sashimi with jalape√±o and sauce, Agadashi tofu, chicken yakitori, soft shell crab roll with unagi. The Kobe beef taco was good, but I'm not too sure if it's actually Kobe beef because it didn't melt in my mouth. Agadashi tofu was made perfectly. My favorite was the yellowtail fish and the salmon carpaccio.
