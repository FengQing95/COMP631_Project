JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have been here twice so far, and it has been a joy. I'm now hooked on ramen, and I'm recommending this place to more people. I see some have complained about the parking situation, but come on....it's Midtown. What do you expect? Â If you want big concrete parking lots, go to Katy or Sugarland.
