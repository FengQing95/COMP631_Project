Baby Barnaby's////There was a line when I got there but it only took like 10 minutes to get seated. Once we were seated we got great service. I ordered orange juice & which is freshly squeezed there. Tasted like REAL orange juice. I later got green eggs & I got biscuits instead of wheat toast. Very tasty, my green eggs tasted delicious & the potatoes were delicious! The sausage wasn't my favorite but it was still good. I also go banana walnut pancakes & WOW. They had banana & walnuts on the inside. They were cooked just right & the thought of them are currently making my mouth water. Perfect place for a cozy morning breakfast.. 9/10.
