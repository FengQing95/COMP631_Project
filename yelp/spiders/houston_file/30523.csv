The Pit Room////The brisket was really good but it wasn't as tender compared to other BBQ places that I've tried, such as Killen's (in Pearland) and Franklin's (in ATX). I wasn't a super huge fan of the pork ribs. The meat portion was a little hard to bite off of the rib itself and didn't come off as easily as I had hoped it would. It was also very chewy, which I usually prefer my BBQ meat to be more tender. The cole slaw was decent, but I felt like it needed a little more seasoning or dressing on it. The mac n cheese was excellent!
