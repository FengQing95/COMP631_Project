Uchi////We were a table of 4 and opted for the chef's tasting menu.. First off the waiter explained the menu and actually tried to say he wouldn't recommend the chef's tasting on the first visit to Uchi -- not really sure why he did that, isn't the chef's tasting suppose to be the best and freshest?  So I also didn't get it because each tasting is a shared tasting for two, so there were several dishes where my husband and I had to eat off 1 plate.  I don't get it!  Just portion it out or charge per person.  Just an odd thought and have never had a tasting menu this way.
