Kata Robata////I really liked the citrus flavors with the amberjack. It was very light and the fish was so fresh. I didn't like the foie gras as much as I would've hoped. I was expecting it to be more buttery, but it was more of a mushy/really creamy texture. The flavor of that just didn't work well with me.
