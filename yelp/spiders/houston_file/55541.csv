Kata Robata////I think the waiter noticed our surprised faces and came back in a moment with their Happy Hour Menu which was a lot more reasonably priced and available until 7 pm. It was 6:30pm at the time so we ordered California Rolls ($4 each) and their house wine ($5 a glass). From the dinner menu, we ordered the Tuna "Tar Tar" (tartare) which was an artfully presented mound of chopped raw tuna bound with sliced cherry tomatoes, onion and sesame oil served with paper thin slices of fried "Renkon" (Japanese white radish). We also got a deep fried avocado stuffed with crab which was excellent and had a decadently unctuous mouthfeel.
