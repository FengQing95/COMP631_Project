Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Fantastic breakfast option in the 024, new location at Beltway 8 and Memorial.  Our server the last 2 trips has been fantastic, upbeat, positive, friendly and most of all loves what he does and the product he serves.  We always get a pancake for the table to share, ooh and ahh over, we tried the sweet potato (5/5) and cinnamon roll (4/5) pancakes.  Legend goes the syrup is $100/bottle, the good stuff, sure tastes like it!  I always get the puff pastry with gravy and egg, super filling, nice hint of rosemary 4.5/5.  It's a cool place, and great alternative to the usual boring breakfast places.  Pro tip: arrive before 9am to avoid a wait.
