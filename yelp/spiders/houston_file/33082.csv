Local Foods////Now, on to the food. I ordered the crunchy chicken sandwich with quinoa and the chips. Not long after sitting our meals were brought out to us and I just became excited. It smelled delicious, looked delicious and WAS delicious. The foods were all so vibrant and beautiful that I almost didn't want to eat it, but that pretzel bun was calling my name. It was love at first bite. The chicken was moist and everything about it was just right. Not salty, not overwhelming in weird flavors, but just perfect. I tried the banh mi as well, and as a vietnamese girl who grew up around banh mi, I was hesitant. What could this place know about banh mi? My skepticism was quieted immediately after taking a bite out of that sandwich. The meat was tender, juicy and so SO SO flavorful, and the accompanying veggies were just perfect. Had a nibble of the truffled egg sandwich as well, perfect amount of truffle oil, not too much where it overpowered the sandwich. The chips were crisp and seasoned well, the quinoa was ehhh, not a huge fan of quinoa to begin with but I figured I'd try it.
