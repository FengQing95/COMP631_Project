Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went here today for brunch, and it was a little difficult to get to today because of a little construction. From what I could see there was plenty of parking, but I was running late so I did valet. Our server was good, very patient with us because we kept changing our order. We all shared a mimosa carafe, which honestly they weren't that strong. Ordered an order of totchos and Bosscat fries which were pretty delicious. For my entree I ordered the Fruity Pebbles French Toast but couldn't only eat half, because it was way too sweet. I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant, but probably wouldn't come back for brunch.
