JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Unfortunately that's similar to my story with Jinya. I was sooooo OBSESSED with this place (keyword WAS) and use to hype it up to everyone. I even got a few of my coworkers addicted! My usual order was the Spicy Chicken Ramen (added side of corn) and the shrimp tempura appetizer. HOWEVER, the last time I had this I ended up throwing up all over my friends brand new car (Parth, if u reading this..my bad fam). I had previously heard from a few people before that they had a similar experience, but I was so blind sided by my love for Jinya that I chose to ignore all the warning signs. I'm so scarred by my last experience that I will not be returning here anytime soon.
