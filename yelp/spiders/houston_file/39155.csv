Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I came here for brunch one Sunday and was seated fairly quickly. I had the meatloaf and that was really good. I'm not the type to ever order meatloaf when dining but I decided to give it a try and boy was it good. I will return. I had to park in the garage which was a quick walk to the restaurant. The staff were friendly. We came here because an article we read said that they had unlimited mimosas but that turned out to be untrue.
