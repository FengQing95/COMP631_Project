Baby Barnaby's////The bf and I split the green eggs dish and the chicken fried steak. The chicken fried steak was chewy and not that appealing. I wouldn't recommend it at all even though the hostess did. Can't imagine why it's she would say it's one of their most ordered items. However, the green eggs were delicious! Creamy, delicious goodness scrambled with spinach and artichokes. The sausage was also good, but I really enjoyed the seasoned potatoes. The potatoes reminded me of jack in the box curly fries, but cut into squares! Delicious!
