JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Sarah - Thank you very much for the excellent review. I'm glad you didn't have to wait too long for a table. Saturday lunches can be hit or miss when it comes to seating times, depending on how many folks try to get an early jump on the day. But I'm glad you enjoyed our fare, and we hope you'll visit us again soon.
