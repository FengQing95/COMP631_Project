Kata Robata////Wow! My best friend was visiting Houston and craved sushi, so you know the drill... I was slightly hesitant due to the $$$ rating, but it's worth it. We came on a Friday evening and it was packed like a can of sardines. Luckily, we were able to get a table but I would highly recommend making a reservation beforehand if you plan on dining here.
