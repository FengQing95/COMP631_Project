Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Pretty F-ing good ya'll. I had a few bites off my friends plate and had a coffee of my own. The service was really fast. Weird paying system though, you guys. It was EXTREMELY complicated to pay because they set us all up on one check. We did not look like a family, just a bunch of rag-tag adults up to no good. They would not give us a way to pay except through an electronic system, which made us wait for a good long while when trying to leave. I enjoyed the patio. I enjoyed the wait staff. My friends were a little picky and our associate did not wig out. They handled us well. :) I might not have. ;)
