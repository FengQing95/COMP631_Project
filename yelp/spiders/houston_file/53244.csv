Kata Robata////   I asked the waiter what he thought was good, expecting him to give me some lame answer that I usually get from waitstaff "oh it's all pretty good"....nope!  This man, took a breath and began explaining that menu as if he had just graduated from the school of Kata Robata.  I hadn't even eaten yet and I was getting full off his descriptions.
