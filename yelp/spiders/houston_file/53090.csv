Kata Robata////After this visit we came back 2 times the same month and brought some friends along. The highlights of the next visits have to the be the duck salad, the lobster macaroni, and the tropical roll. The duck salad was perfectly balance. The lobster macaroni is truly the best in Houston (the servers are not exaggerating to you). I don't like sushi rolls, but this one was an exception - I barely noticed the rice and the sweetness balanced with the fresh fish and overall it was such a clean taste.
