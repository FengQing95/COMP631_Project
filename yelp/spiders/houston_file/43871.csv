Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Very friendly and helpful service. The cake was pretty fresh and nice, however I was disappointed when I got the Black and White cake which the description is 2 layers of chocolate cake and one layer of white cake but what I received is two layers of white cake with one layer of chocolate. That does make a difference to me and it was off-putting to not get what was described.
