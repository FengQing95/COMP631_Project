The Pit Room////4.5 stars?? Out of 5?? Seriously Houston? The brisket and ribs were dry and room temperature, mac n cheese bland and watery...the only decent thing was the green beans. And this was on a weekend evening with a good number of patrons there. Very, very disappointed and will not be back. Yuck.
