JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was eating at the bar at Jinya, when a homeless person came in and sat next to my girlfriend and I. None of the employees did anything and just kept watching him. According to the workers, he comes in a lot and starts causing problems. The group two seats away from us gave the homeless man food. The stench of the homeless man was awful and completely ruined our appetite and he would also ask us for money as we were eating. Â
