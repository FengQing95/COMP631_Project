Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My first time here, the wait was an hour long. I suppose because they "close" at 2:30, it's prime time at every time - at least on weekends. But luckily, there are coffee shops - Southside Espresso, Starbucks, Einstein's - in the area to wait at until you get that magical text - "your table is ready!"
