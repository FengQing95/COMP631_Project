Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////the whole environment of this place is lively and perfect for a hangout with friends. not one worker gave me a bad impression or negative taste, which i take into account very much. when i was waiting outside for a table with my friend, the person in charge of the line was constantly checking up on the line and was overall incredibly friendly. (one of the workers who came out even complimented my outfit which literally made my day, but that's beside the whole point)
