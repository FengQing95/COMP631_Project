JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Anyways, the ramen itself was not bad by any means. But it didn't amaze me. The broth was super rich and fatty, definitely how I liked it, but it was on the cusp of being too salty with a strong and distinct seaweed hint. The charsu was nice and flavorful with a nice tenderness to it. The noodle quality is where I knew I was eating Ramen in America vs Japan. Most higher quality noodles sort of suck up/cling the broth enhancing the flavor while not being overly mushy. Yet in fair honestly, if I hadn't tried such good ramen in Japan, I would not be opposed to saying how great this place is.
