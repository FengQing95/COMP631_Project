Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond should be what every bakery/cafe strives to be. They have set the bar! From the excellent and super friendly staff to the flow of ordering & seating, and of course the delicious food they nailed it. The best part is you can go have a gourmet meal for under $ 15.00!! We have gone every weekend since they opened and have tried everything on the menu and of course always take one of each desert to go. It is impossible to get bored because they change their menu and desert items weekly. Never disappointed. They are absolute geniuses and we are so proud to have an establishment of Common Bonds caliber in Houston!
