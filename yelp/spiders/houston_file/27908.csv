The Pit Room////Walk in to a long line inside the dinning room. I get closer to the ordering counter only to see a piece of paper saying "no ribs and no sausage". My heart sinks...but I muster the energy to push on. I arrive at the counter and what do I see behind the glass...two beef ribs. I ask the guy are those beef ribs, and he's like yeah. I light up like a kid who just chased down the ice cream truck down the block. I say I want one! Then the guy is like "you know it's $22 per pound". I'm like dude I could care less, give me a rib! He then comes back a second time in some vain effort to talk me out of it and says "well it's easily 1.5lbs or bigger for one". I was like dude please just put it on the plate?! Finally the moment has come, but it not before I selected two sides. The potato salad and okra.
