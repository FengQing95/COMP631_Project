JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of their take out practices.  While I definitely enjoy dining in the restaurant, sometimes you're not feeling like going out, and you really want to pick up some ramen from your favorite ramen place and eat it at home on your couch in front of netflix.  I tried this one night, and when I got home and opened my container of Spicy Chicken Ramen (my favorite), I found that it not only contained much less broth/noodles than a bowl served in the restaurant typically would, but that the entire order had one small piece of chicken in it.   While I'm sure this was an unfortunate oversight, I wish their take out game was on the same par as their table service.  Otherwise, a great spot.
