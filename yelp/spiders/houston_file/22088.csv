Uchi////It took me while to write this review because honestly I didn't know if  I wanted to write about the food or my new found love affair with this place. OMG BEYOND AMAZING!! I mean where do I start I could tell you about the awesome service the moment we walked into the restaurant.  I could tell you about how knowledgable  the waiter was and how everything he suggested was superior. I could tell you how hip and modern this place is. I could tell you how fabulous the drinks are. I could sing to you about the food! I just don't know where to start lol!!!
