Baby Barnaby's////Good place. Very nice staff. Our waiter seemed kinda nervous to serve us. I think he was gay and my husband was growing out his very middle eastern beard, lol. Don't Â worry buddy...love of food is universal! The food was delicious. The oj fresh. I kinda prefer this place to the Breakfast club. I have never had a bad experience at any of the Barnaby places.
