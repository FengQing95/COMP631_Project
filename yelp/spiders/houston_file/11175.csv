JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Lets get on with the food. We ordered the Fried Shrimp balls and the octapus for appetizers. There were good but I prefered the shrimp balls more since the octapus lack seasoning. As for the main course I got the Tonkotsu Black and the brother got the Spicy Tonkotsu. Both dishes were presented beautifully and the broths were really delicious. Not too salty or creamy. The balance was just right. Personally I would prefer more meat but I was really full afterwards.
