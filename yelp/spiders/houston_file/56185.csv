Kata Robata////My friend got the ox tail ramen, which when looking back is a mistake. It is filling, but 19 dollars for ramen? When we got the bowl, the first thing we thought was, "Where is the ox tail?". Sure enough, the ox tail was all shredded up and just put in the bowl. I believe that serving ox-tail off the bone is just a sin. You lose the experience of tasting the ligaments and the texture is just gone. The broth.... did taste good, but you could seriously taste the hondashi (AKA Japanese MSG). Noodles were great as well, had a good bite without being mushy.
