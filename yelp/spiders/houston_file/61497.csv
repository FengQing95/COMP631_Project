Baby Barnaby's////So affordable, so yummy. My fianc√© and I were in Houston Montrose area for a weekend trip, and ate Saturday breakfast here at 12 noon, they close weekends at 2 pm. I got the chicken fried steak with 2 sunny side up eggs and hash browns and orange juice. Most menus items 10 bucks or less. Delicious. Pleasantly filled me up for the entire day. LGBT cool area. Excellent waitstaff service.
