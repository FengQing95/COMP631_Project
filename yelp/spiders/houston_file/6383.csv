JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya was one of the first Ramen places that I went to in Houston. It opened my eyes to what gourmet ramen was supposed to taste like. I really enjoy the spicy chicken ramen. I never need to add anything extra to it, and that says a lot. Other notable dishes would have to be the gyoza and brussels sprouts tempura. I love tempura so I was super excited to try it. It was crispy and the sauce was sweet, perfect combination. I didn't really like the takoyaki though, I though the dough was heavy and flavor wasn't quite there. I lived in japan and have eaten my fair share so I know a thing or two about it.
