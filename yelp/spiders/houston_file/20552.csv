Uchi////First, this service here is amazing.  Seriously, it came close to the service I received at Jean Georges in NY.  As each dish is brought out, the servers explained what the dish is called and what they are made up of... no stuttering and no ums... swag.  We sat at the bar and after every other dish our plates were replaced with new ones, water and wine was topped off, I never had to look for my server.  The servers here are a well-oiled machine, Voltron.  Our chef, Haroldsan, was a badass ninja warrior.  He executed this meal and paced it correctly.
