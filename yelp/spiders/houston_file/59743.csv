Baby Barnaby's////I had high hopes that the chicken-fried steak & eggs combination, and the green eggs plate (served with fried potatoes and chicken sausage) would mitigate the exasperating service, but the food was nothing spectacular and it did not live up to all the hype. The highly acclaimed food did not make up for the overall experience as I had hoped. Just ordinary breakfast food.
