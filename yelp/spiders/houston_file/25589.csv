Uchi////12. Veggie nabe - This is a unique dish. They bring out a rice dish with seasonal vegetables inside, break an egg over it, and mix it together in front of you. This causes the rice to crisp. I liked the unique flavor to it. At this point, we were full and couldn't finish this one. We took this one to go for lunch the next day.
