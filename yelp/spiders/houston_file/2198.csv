JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We will take, and have taken, our lumps if and when they were deserved, and more importantly, we do everything we can to resolve said lumps if and when they happen. And while every customer is entitled to his or her opinion, before, during and after they are in our restaurant, I will always take umbrage when an opinion manages to obfuscate fact. This is our business, which feeds our community our families -- we will defend it.
