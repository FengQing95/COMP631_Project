Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Tried this restaurant during my birthday trip. Disappointed!! The drinks were not good. The menu does not have a lot of options. Ordered a chicken flatbread, it came with cold tomatoes on top. The bread was more doughy than crispy. Â I ordered fried fish for my entree and it left a lot to be desired. The waitress saw that we barely touched or food but didn't even ask if everything was okay.
