JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Anyways, we got seated right away, but the place was packed.  I got the tonkotsu spicy (but that was seriously the same spice as the tonkotsu hot) and put in tons of garlic, too, hehe.  I like how you can crush your own garlic!  The broth was great, and the noodles were delicious.  It was overall super filling and I could not stop slurping up the bowl!
