Local Foods////They have really good sandwiches. I ordered the crispy chicken and the one with shrimp and crab, it was really good. The come with two sides OR soup. We got butternut squash soup and squash salad and homemade chips. The food come really fast and they are really delicious. It can get really crowded during lunch time. The place is good and cute, very instagrammable. I spent $14 here. The desserts look good, I really want to try them but I was so full from the main course.
