Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came here for breakfast, after leaving 2 other times because the wait was over 2 hours! Today, I committed to the hour long wait and I must say it was definitely worth it! They even gave me the Apple Crumb pancake of the day for free, before my food came out! It was literally the best trio of pancakes that I have ever had in my life...and this says a lot because I'm a bit of a pancake snob! The service was excellent and the food was amazing. Also try the pear spritzer (I think that's the name), it was really good and refreshing. I will definitely be back, hopefully with a shorter wait time.
