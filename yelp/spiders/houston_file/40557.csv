Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We started with a strong cup of coffee which I loved! I ordered the breakfast burrito and my boyfriend got the Smokehouse Benedict which were both amazing! The breakfast burrito had a nice crisp on the outside and a great combination of egg, cheese, and sausage inside! The spicy chicken sauce on the side was a great bonus and added the perfect amount of flavor to your burrito. The Benedict was also very tasty and came with a hearty serving of potatoes which were perfectly cooked and crispy!
