Local Foods////We live close by in West U, and my family and I have been here maybe 100 times in the past year. They have very good quality food, NOT greasy in the least bit, everything is healthy here and very well priced. Staff are nice and responsive, restaurant is kept very clean and tidy. Highly Recommend them... Especially the Crunchy Chicken Sandwich!!
