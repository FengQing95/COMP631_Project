Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Love this cute little place!  Whenever my hubs and I come, we always get a latte with some pastries.  Everything is always great and they have a wide variety of different pasties to try.  I wanted to swing by today, but didn't want to deal with the challenge of getting a parking spot.  That is itself can take 15+ minutes.  But that is a great thing for them, they stay busy.
