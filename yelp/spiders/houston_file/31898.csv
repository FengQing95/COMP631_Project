Local Foods////Consistently amazing. I have tried most of the items on the menu and they are all fresh and flavorful. Everything is really filling and good for the price imo. I have no idea how they make boring veggies so flavorful but they do it. Eat here and leave feeling like you stuffed your body with some good nutrients and actually enjoyed the process (I'm looking at you, wheatgrass shots).
