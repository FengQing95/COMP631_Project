Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So i posted a review on snooze and received contact from their management. I was advised their prices are a bit higher because they responsibly source their ingredients and this was never an issue for me. The food was actually good but the service this day was not that great. The managing rep asked for my address to send me a gift card but that was weeks ago, i never received any more follow up or a gc, so I probably will not be going back or recommending this place. Good quality food with subpar service and a hassle to get in and out of the restaurant, no thanks. I didn't post a review to receive anything but wanted to share my experience, to be offered to give it another try and still nothing, welp... I'm done.
