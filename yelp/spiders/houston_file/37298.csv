Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The atmosphere of Bosscat sitting inside or outside is great! I love the way the restaurant looks and feels. So cute. My only thing is that the food is completely overpriced. It's only overpriced cause it's "unconventional". Fruity pebble French toast. Donut burger...it's kind of a rip off. The drinks are pretty expensive too. I was going to get the breakfast drink. I believe it's maple whiskey and some OJ. I decided not to. Thank God I didn't. The table next to me ordered it and was like wtf is this? They got a shot glass of the whiskey and a shot of orange juice...for $13?? Come on now? The donut burger is about $13 bucks and doesn't even come with a side. It's things like that that make you weigh going back cause for what??... Overall it's a cool place. Could be greater if they did something with their menu. I enjoyed my visit and MIGHT come back. ALSO, shout out to the DJ, he's amazing. Honestly the vibe of the place with the DJ is probably all the stars that i gave.
