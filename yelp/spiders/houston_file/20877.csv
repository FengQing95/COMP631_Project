Uchi//// Â Let me start by saying the experience was amazing . I work at a local sushi restaurant and I was blown away.Food was on point . From the moment I walked in all the way til I got into my car . Staff was attentive and great at giving me and my girlfriend the upmost service . Edamame was even amazing ! I never had grilled edamame and I'll tell you it was the best edamame I ever ate ! Our server Matt I believe was great at spacing our dishes apart and giving them in a certain order to work with our palate . We progress from light dishes into the more heavier ones . The Akami-Te hit me in my feels . It had a southeast Asian twist to it and it made me think of home . (I'm Cambodian ) . It was also my birthday and gave us a few on the house dishes . That was so awesome of the staff . After all the great dishes , ended with the notorious fried milk . They added captain crunch. Who doesn't like captain crunch?? Overall it was a great first time experience . If you're looking for a sushi restaurant that bends the traditional rules without breaking them . A place with a modern twist on food , Uchi my friends is the place to go . I'll be back for sure .
