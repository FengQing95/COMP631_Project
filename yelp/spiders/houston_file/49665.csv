Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The service was great. Our waiter was really attentive even with the other tables. They have good coffee, large tables and good food. It was surprisingly filling for the small plate that I had I couldn't finish it. It is a great brunch spot definitely bring your friends. They are kid friendly ready with Crayolas and paper to keep the munchkin busy. All in all it was a pleasant experience or definitely go back
