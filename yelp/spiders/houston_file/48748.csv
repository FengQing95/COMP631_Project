Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I love this place. I do not love the wait. My husband, who hates crowds and waits, loved the food here despite the wait. And they introduced him to his new favorite hot sauce (they will bring out four or five different bottles for you to try if you ask), so he has a soft spot for the place.
