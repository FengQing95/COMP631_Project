Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////One of the best meals we have had in Houston.  There is always a line.  The parking isn't good.  The food is AMAZING.  Staff helpful.  Started with a triple chocolate brown butter cookie (excellent).  Mrs got a cherry and cheese croissant.  One of the best things I have eaten. Ever.  For lunch I had the daily scramble.  They gave me a hash Brown potato cube situation. It was fantastic.  The scramble was awesome.  Came with two biscuits.  Two best biscuits I have had and they came with actual homemade jam.  So good. I asked for a substitute for bacon and they offered avocado.  They gave me half of an avocado.
