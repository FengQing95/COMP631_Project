Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The ambiance is loud for a coffee shop.  It's a good place to grab coffee and catch up with friends, but I would not recommend coming here to study.  There are a few tables and a bar that lines the perimeter of the restaurant where you can drink coffee and people watch.
