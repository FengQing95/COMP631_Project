Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////UPDATE: About a year later, I came by for breakfast around 8:00am on a Friday. Now, there were many more options (i.e. menu items that were *in stock*) and only one item that was not in stock (maybe someone got in before me & ordered the entire stock of one item for coworkers??). Again, the coffee/latte drinks I tasted were delicious, as were the breakfast items.
