Baby Barnaby's////Ohhhhh my goodness! We just left baby barnabys and I'm so full I can hardly breathe! It was so good. After reading the reviews on yelp I was pretty sure we had picked a good place but I didn't want to set my expectations too high and then be disappointed... Well I wasnt disappointed at all!! I had the green eggs, my husband had the migas and we shared the Â pumpkin pancake. It was a lot of food and it was all amazing. I can't wait to go back!
