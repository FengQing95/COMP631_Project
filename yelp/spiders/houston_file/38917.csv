Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I gave a list of places for my daughter to pick from to celebrate her 18th birthday and she chose here. She wanted to do brunch with her friends and I must say she chose well. From the host, to the waiter to the kitchen --everyone was amazing. They all ordered the donut burger and loved it. It was served with sprinkles on the donut bun; Super cute I thought to myself. I ordered the totchos (tater tots with queso, jalape√±os and eggs) and the short stack; both were delicious. My mother enjoyed her pork belly tacos. I can't forget to mention the breakfast in bed shot. It consists of a shot of maple bourbon, oj and a delicious strip of bacon on top. It was interesting to say the least lol. The boss lady cocktail was mighty fine indeed. Instead of the regular smegular birthday ice cream you normally get at restaurants, they brought out a tray of desserts for my daughter to share with everyone. It was so nice and thoughtful. I think they knew we were a picky bunch lol. The music playlist added to the wonderful celebration of 18 years of life with my daughter. I'll definitely be back.
