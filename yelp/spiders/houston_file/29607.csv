The Pit Room////Today I had the 3 meat special and my son had a 3 meat turkey, the Jalape√±o sausage and Pork ribs. My sides were corn and chips; he had the mac and cheeses and potato salad. The corn was good as usual. I almost think I day dream about the brisket.. We both tore it up. He was full by the time he got to his ribs.
