Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I ended up going yesterday (Sunday) to meet up with a friend. I got there and they said it would be a 20 min wait for a table, so I figured we'll just wing it at the bar. I'm actually glad we sat at the bar because Meagan who was the bartender was awesome! They make their mimosas perfect and that brunch ros√© is delicious!
