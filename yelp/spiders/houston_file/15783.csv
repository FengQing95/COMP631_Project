JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Staff is always friendly. Services were fast. Ramen was brought out quickly despite the place was packed. They have booth seats, bar seats, and community tables. The interiors were trendy with low lightings. Their happy hour is 3pm-5pm. Overall, definitely one of the best ramen place in town.
