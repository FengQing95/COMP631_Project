Uchi////Finally a restaurant that lives up to its hype! Hands down, one of the best sushi Restaurants I've eaten at. For my first time here, I tried the signature tasting that consisted of 6 courses. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and they graciously gave us a $25 voucher card and a bowl of Brussels sprouts during our meal.
