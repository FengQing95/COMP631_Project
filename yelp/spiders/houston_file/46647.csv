Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is filled with flies and the crew is used to it when you ask the staff about it (black lady with mushroom earings and mexican lady who picks up everything with her gloves she wore since she idk maybe clocked in at work)they just Â shrug their shoulders like the flies are part of the decor of the pastry. Used to go here a lot when I'm in Houston.
