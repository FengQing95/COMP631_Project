The Pit Room////Grew up in Houston on Goode Co, which I still love. BUT, The Pit has superior beef and pork ribs, and the menu is diverse. Loved that they have brisket tacos and queso! Â Atmosphere is so welcoming. Staff was unbelievably friendly and welcoming. 5 different people greeted us and asked us about our experience here. Feels like a great work family:-) Will come back. Oh and draft beer!! Yeehaw!
