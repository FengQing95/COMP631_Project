Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////One too many subpar croissants has led my affection for croissants to embark on a gradual, bitter decline...only to be reignited by these babes!! I could get lost in those flaky layers of bliss any day, and the perfectly-balanced-not-too-sweet fillings seal the deal (speaking for the almond & chocolate). I would get 'em warmed up as well, as we all know that carbs + heat = heaven.
