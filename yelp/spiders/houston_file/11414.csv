JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We did opt for dessert and had their mochi ice cream in both chocolate and green tea flavors. My friends enjoyed their chocolate mochi ice cream. I didn't enjoy my green tea ice cream. The reason is I've tried plenty of green tea ice cream before Jinya, and I think the ice cream itself lacked any green tea flavor. The mochi - how do I put this, it tasted like cotton candy, but not in a good way. I probably wouldn't order the mochi ice cream again.
