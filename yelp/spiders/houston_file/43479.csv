Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is always crowded. However, its not pet friendly and the staff was rude asking me to leave when I was sitting outside patio waiting for my husband to get a coffee inside. I told him I will leave as soon as my husband got his coffee. Nope, I have to leave and wait on the street, not even waiting on the premisis. I have a puppy like its going to bite people. He was rude. No sign said no pets allowed even on patio. Horrible and stuck up customer service!
