Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The Bosscat Burger the chef's way is the best burger I have ever had. Sadly, I have not tried anything else on the menu because the burger is so good I just can't bring myself to order anything else. The fries are also fantastic. Big thick steak fries that are actually crispy. I had to opportunity to meet one of the owners when touring The Whiskey Room and told him the same thing. Best burger I have ever had.
