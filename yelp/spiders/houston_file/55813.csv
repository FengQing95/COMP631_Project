Kata Robata////Last December I treated my niece to a birthday lunch here at this restaurant. This food was delish, delish, and delish again. Now, this was my first time eating here and compared to other Japanese restaurants, I thought it rose to the cuisine's occasion. It was good. I'm surprised it took me so long to finally eat here. My niece chose to eat here. I was very pleased later and had considered many times, but just had not taken the time.
