Baby Barnaby's////Two of us had the green eggs ($7, I mean, it would seem wrong to come here and not order it b/c of the rave reviews) and the other had the salmon, bagel, capers, onions, cream cheese.  We loved everything we had!  The eggs were as delicious as they sound.  The potatoes that came with the platter tasted like a less greasy version of the curly fries from Jack in the Box.  While I like the taste of JITB curly fries, I must say I was a tad disappointed, as I was hoping for some skillet potatoes instead.  The chicken apple sausage was better than any I've had, and much tastier than pork sausage.  We also got the fruit bowl and it was full of fresh blueberries, blackberries, melon balls, pineapple, etc.  Fresh and delicious and it all seemed healthy.  Nothing was heavy or greasy, even our full bellies didn't feel weighed down.
