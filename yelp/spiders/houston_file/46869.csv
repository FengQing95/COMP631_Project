Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Very disappointed in the service and food. Ordered something simple and requested eggs over medium, they were Runny. Ordered toast double toasted to ensure it would be toasted, I don't think it was even put in a toaster. Â When we flagged down the hostess since we didn't see our waitress, she said I'll get your server rather than take the muffin to the back to get toasted. Wanted to try out a new place for something different but won't be coming back !!
