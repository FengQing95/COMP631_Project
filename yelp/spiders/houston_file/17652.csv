Uchi////I was in Houston on a business trip and met up with an old friend who suggested we go to Uchi. Â She said it was the talk of the town... We ordered so much from the menu and I didn't hate any of it. My favorites were the Brussel sprouts which I need to make a dupe at home of, the ham and eggs roll, avocado nigiri, machi cure, and of course fried milk for dessert. Ahhmazing. If I'm ever in Houston again it is definitely on my list of places to visit again!
