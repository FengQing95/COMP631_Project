Uchi////+ *Hamachi nabe - we added this last dish toward the end of or meal, afraid that we wouldn't still be hungry, and it definitely put me over the top, but no regrets on ordering this dish. "Baby yellowtail, koshi hikari rice, soy broth, and farm egg." What the menu didn't mention was the delightful little pieces of tobiko that dance around the raw yellowtail sitting in the hot, white pot before the server poured the soy broth right on top of the hamachi nabe. He explained the the dish was being cooked right there. It just smelled soooooooo delicious already, just like he said "like eggs and rice in the morning." It was hearty and filling. The yellowtail and rice were completely satisfying in my tummy and kind of had a smoky element to its flavor. gahhhh, yummm!
