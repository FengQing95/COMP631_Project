JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I prefer my egg runny, and the broth my ramen is in to be much more flavorful. I mean, the reason why you dine out for ramen is because of the broth,  this place just didn't get it right, which is a huge let down seeing how ramen is their specialty.  According to a few of the people in my group of 6, this place isn't consistant with their quality.
