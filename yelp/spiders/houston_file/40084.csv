Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The overall ambience of the restaurant/bar was pretty nice too. The lights were dim with lots of natural light pouring in and a bar in the center of the place. Lots of people were there either having a drink or grabbing a quick snack after work with co-workers it seemed like. Their happy hour deals looked great too!
