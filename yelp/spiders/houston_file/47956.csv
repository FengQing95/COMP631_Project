Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////On to the food! I had the "Dirty Drunken Chai" to drink. It was good, but nothing special. The best part about this place is obviously the food. I got the Benny Duo with the Chilaquiles and the Bella! Bella! Benny. They were both very delicious and had a unique flavor. I was also impressed because both of my eggs were PERFECTLY poached. I don't know what it is about Houston restaurants, but they struggle to poach an egg and I really appreciate it when it is well done. They also had plenty of hollandaise which I loved. Basically, this place knows how to do benedict right. When I come back I will probably just get the Bella! Bella! Benny. The other one was good, but the Bella really stood out. The Benny Duo comes with hashbrowns which were just ok. Ask your server for the green sauce to add some flavor to them.
