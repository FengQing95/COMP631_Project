Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Went on a Monday morning and there was still a line- that's how you know a place is good! I didn't even notice that the food was taking a while, but multiple servers came up and apologized for the wait and updated us on timing. The waitress was also super helpful when we needed help choosing what we wanted to eat.
