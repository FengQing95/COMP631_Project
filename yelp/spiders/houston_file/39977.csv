Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The atmosphere is great. Very nice establishment. Extensive whiskey list. The service was great at first. Our waiter disappeared for a long time and we had to ask the hostess to find him but that wasn't a huge deal. I had a tequila based drink that was very good and it came in a cute pineapple shaped glass. The pig candy app was ok. I had high hopes because I love pig candy. I wish it were a tad sweeter like other restaurants' pig candy. It wasn't sweet at all and I wish it were warmer. It came out cold but I couldn't figure out if it was supposed to be cold. The Madeline's app was also good. Even though we mixed the dip it came with (with salt on top) it was too salty for my taste. But my friend liked it. I will return to the restaurant mostly for the atmosphere, whiskey list, and to see if the other food items are good.
