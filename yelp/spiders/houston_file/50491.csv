Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////It didn't end with the french toast, of course. The breakfast tacos have a note on the menu (an insider tip, as they call it) to add some veggies or meat. I chose meat (again, Texas). This wasn't just meat. Think burnt ends meets bacon meets maple syrup. That's what they put on my already-glorious breakfast tacos. I'm nearly crying as I type this, rethinking that experience. It was so beautiful.
