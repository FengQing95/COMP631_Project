Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Pretty good brunch food but prepare for the wait and the limited parking in the parking lot but there's a nice man that will let you know if the parking lot is full before you get stuck trying to back out of the tiny lot - so mostly street parking. Â Pretty good booze drinks for the AM drinkers (its 5 o'clock somewhere!) Cool that you can get pancake flights and pick 3 to share, ask for the daily special pancakes!!.. If its your birthday you get a free pancake with a candleeee!! Happy Brunchin' ;)
