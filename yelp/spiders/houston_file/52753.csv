Kata Robata////NOT RECOMMENDED. Highly overpriced. After $250, we still left the place hungry. Sushi rolls were average at best. But way too skinny for the price. Sashimi was also average in freshness, but the slices were so small and thin that I thought I was eating in a French restaurant. The description of many of dishes lacked information. For example, one of the dishes I ordered was an octopus slice dish that cost $15. I ordered that as my entree. As it turns out, it was much more of an appetizer than anything else. And even as an appetizer, the portion was ridiculously small. With so many sushi places in Houston, I will definitely not go back. Oishii down the street is MUCH better. On the positive side, our waiter was very good. Hostesses, not so good.
