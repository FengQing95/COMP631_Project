Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Service was okay. They were really slow with the food and it took probably around half an hour to get our food and both of my friends had messed up orders, but our server corrected it right away and gave us one of their pancakes on the house (not sure what it was, but it had pecans in it). Their pancakes are SO fluffy, but definitely coated in way too much syrup and sweetness for my personal taste. If you can handle sweetness, the pancakes are definitely the fluffiest and softest I've ever eaten.
