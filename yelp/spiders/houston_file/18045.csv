Uchi////12. Fried Milk: This dessert is a myriad of textures. Smooth from the sorbet, crunchy from the fried milk, creamy from the chocolate, crisp from the chocolate croquant and chocolate soil. However, the flavors, while still really good, are quite run-of-the-mill. I've had chocolate and milk before, but I think the charm of this dessert falls within the execution of the dish. Every component is perfectly prepared.
