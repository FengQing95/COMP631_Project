Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////HIPSTERS galore! This place was made for you in mind. Organic, free range, and a full bar to satisfy your every need and mood. Their pancakes are nothing to scream about, but I do like their selection of eggs, and their quinoa bowl is on point. They change their menus seasonly so beware, your favorite item may not make the cut.
