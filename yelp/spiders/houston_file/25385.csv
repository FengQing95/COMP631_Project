Uchi////For us regular folks uchi is definitely a treat. My husband brought me here to celebrate my birthday. And let me say, he did good because we loved our dinner. I told him that I definitely considered this meal to be the best meal I've had this year. The food was delicious. Our favorite was definitely the foie gras, not something you'd typically think of for sushi but my mouth went to heaven with this dish. My second favorite was the engawa. It was fatty and had an extra umph of flavor from the searing. The staff was so wonderful and helpful. They even prepared an off the menu dish as a gift for my birthday. We went early so that we were able to order off both the happy hour and regular menu. Will definitely be coming back for our next celebration.
