The Pit Room////I was so disappointed cause I had such high hopes for this place based on the high reviews!!! Ok so the place was off Richmond with parking in the front and in the back!  I liked the atmosphere and the feel of the place with the small outdoor front patio seating and the interior seating.. very chill and everyone is super nice.  They even have a condiments station in the middle that wraps around where you order your meats!
