Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Once we were seated the experience was OK. Food service was slow, but it wasn't the waitress' fault. Just a busy restaurant with a busy kitchen. Their menu has a wide variety of options. Pancakes were some of the best I've ever had, as well as the bacon. They specialize in making the classic unique. Plenty of specialty drinks to choose from their brunch menu and they have fancy coffee drinks.
