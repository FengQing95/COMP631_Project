Kata Robata////Love the ambiance and service at this restaurant.  We were seated right away for our reservation and the waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and recommended some great dishes.  The sushi and sashimi came out first.. The hamachi was good but the rising sun roll with the peppered tuna and truffle oil with the yellowtail in the middle was bursting with flavor and absolutely delicious - probably my favorite dish of the night.  The kakuni pork belly was cooked so that it was nice and soft.  It came with a spinach, egg and chick peas.  You break the egg yolk into the dish and serve the mix.  The sauce was a little on the sweet side, which isn't my preference for a meat dish, but good nonetheless.  The uni baked with the egg was one of those that won an award so I wanted to try it.  This was nothing special - uni on top of a baked egg pudding with shiitake mushrooms and an Asian bean.  The spicy ramen was good but it was also on the sweet side and the noodles weren't typical ramen noodles.  The banana creme brûlée with Nutella cream was delicious and cooked to perfection.  I would say the food was good but probably not the best sushi/ramen I've had in Houston.
