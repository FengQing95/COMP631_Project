Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food:  so many options! I got the eggs Benedict Duo (You can choose two different type of eggs Benedict) and let me tell you it is amazing!!!  This is by far the best tasting brunch spot in Houston.  I was blown away by the taste of the food.  We also got the pancake flight ( you can choose three different type of  pancakes of their menu).  The pancakes were crazy delicious with a lot of flavors. I could go on and on about how delicious the food is.  It was simply the best breakfast I had in a long long time.
