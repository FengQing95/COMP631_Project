Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We were big fans of the baguettes in the past, since this was the only place in the USA we could find that had baguettes close to what is available in France. It was crisp, crusty, and had huge holes. Sometimes we would go to Common Bond just for the baguettes.
