Uchi////Amazing dinning experience! Every dish is tapas style with perfectly balanced flavors. As someone who doesn't eat raw fish I found great dishes.  Cooked favorites: ham and eggs,  jar jar duck,  bacon tataki,  gyutoro, foie to hazelnut,  yaki niku maki,  beet salad and the fried milk dessert.
