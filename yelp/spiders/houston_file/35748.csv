Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My servers were absolutely wonderful, and I loved the two appetizers I got - pulled pork tacos and brussel sprouts.  They just changed their menu, and I did not try anything from the previous menu, but thought there was a good selection.  They have great craft cocktails and beers on top.  The only drawback is the hostesses are completely rude.  They were extremely standoffish and unwilling to accommodate any requests.  Instead of explaining that they were busy that night, they wrote me off and acted as if I was unworthy of their time.  The hostesses need to learn how to be in a customer-facing role.
