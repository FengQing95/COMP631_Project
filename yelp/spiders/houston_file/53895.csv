Kata Robata////I absolutely love this place. I have been to Uchi and for all those people that compare it to one another it's a completely different experience. At Kata Robata they have traditional items such as karaage, agedeshi tofu, and items such as pork belly buns and kobe beef tacos. They are all delightfully appetizing and all available on the happy hour menu. Both times that I visited Kata my family and I got the omakase sashimi special. There was so much to be happy about. It's almost 50 pieces or so of beautifully cut sashimi pieces. Sometimes it varies but my favorite three are the fresh raw shrimp, flounder, and fatty tuna. The fatty tuna just has a way of melting in your mouth and everything tastes so fresh you don't get that taste of the sea.
