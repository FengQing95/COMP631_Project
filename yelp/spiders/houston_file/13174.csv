JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For the ramen, struggled with the multitude of different options available, but eventually went with my gut and got the classic black broth ramen.  This is going to be your traditional ramen with the pork belly slices and thick bone broth.  Was very pleased with the consistency of the noodles.  The broth was rich and very flavorful, and very importantly not too salty.  The egg was prepared perfectly and I like how they gave you 2 uncooked slices of the seaweed which you could mix I to your bowl.  Very happy with the ramen. The ramen with the appetizers was the perfect amount of food.
