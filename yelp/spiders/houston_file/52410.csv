Kata Robata////Well I cannot tell a lie....this was the most incredible sushi experience we have had in so long!!  Under the watchful eye of Hori-san, every bite was an orgasmic and cataclysmic event!  From the cleanest citrus oysters, richest foie gras and sashimi masterpiece, melting Kobe bites, triple-sushi jewels topped with quail egg and caviar, creamy U-10 scallops with mushrooms, Korean BBQ laced crab salmon roll only to be topped off with the ethereal cloud of heavenly dessert.....well what else can one say except RUN DON'T WALK to this temple of freshness called Kata Robata.  You will not be sorry!  And treat yourself by sitting at the bar while the Master Hori-San makes your dreams come true!!!
