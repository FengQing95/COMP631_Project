The Pit Room////Really enjoyed The Pit Room. I was working from a coffee shop down the street and discovered this delightful gem on Yelp. I had the brisket, pulled pork, and pork ribs with mustard potato salad and charro beans. The best bite was probably the pulled pork. I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for some good BBQ. I tried to get an ice cream sandwich but they were already sold out. I guess i will have to swing by again during my business trip this week.
