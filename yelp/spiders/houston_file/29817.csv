The Pit Room////The brisket is really, really, really good and I actually liked the turkey as well. It wasn't dry at all and quite tasty. Husband had the venison sausage which is slightly spicy and very tasty, though nothing I'd go to get again. The mustard potato salad side goes really well with the BBQ, the chips have just the right amount of salt, but then the elote (the corn) we thought was just OK. Not good not bad, just OK. They had the okra side special the day we went, which I wish I had tried, looks quite good in photos posted here on yelp.
