Baby Barnaby's////Red velvet pancake: Not too sweet, the texture of the pancake was soft. We ordered this because the waitress had said this was one of their items and it wasn't on the menu yet. The pancake itself could feed 3 people. The cream on the pancake made it too sweet to be eaten with. You can get it with banana slices on top.
