JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Konichiwa, Andrew! Thanks for your review of JINYA. We, too, have noticed many Japanese-Americans (and quite a few Japanese tourists) coming to try our ramen. For what it's worth, their predominant ramens-of-choice are: Tonkotsu Black, Tokyo Yatai and Tonkotsu Assari. And most recently, one Japanese guest taught us the word for hard noodle: "katamen." Thanks for coming to our shop and we hope to see yall again in the near future!
