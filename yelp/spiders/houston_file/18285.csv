Uchi////The service was also really amazing.  Everyone was so friendly and seemed genuinely interested in sharing their knowledge of the food with you but without sounding condescending or know-it-all'y.  They were also just super friendly and even gave us 2 dishes on the house -- a great sizzling-stone-bowl of rice, salmon, and some other things, and some delicious dessert.  Top notch.
