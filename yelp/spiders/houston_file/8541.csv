JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Excellent ramen and consistently prompt, attentive service. We usually try to arrive before it gets loud and the line starts going out the door. The crispy chicken appetizer is excellent, as is the carmelized cauliflower. I usually stick to the spicy umami tonkatsu ramen. It is very, very flavorful but not so spicy that I can't eat it. I like to add an egg, fresh garlic, and extra noodles. It's very filling.
