The Pit Room////Loved my visit to The Pit Room! Ordered the brisket tacos with potato salad and coleslaw as my sides. The brisket was divine! Portions are big so come hungry. I really loved that it was authentic Texas BBQ with a bit of a twist. They doctor up the tacos with all kinds of good stuff, but there is also a station to add pickled onions/peppers/etc. which were all very yummy too. I don't know if they make their own lemonade there too, but it was delicious! The staff was super friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was really great too! I want to go back already!
