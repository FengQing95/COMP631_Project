Uchi////I might not know a thing or two about running a restaurant but Uchi Houston your workers are rotten. By simply not saying a thing about some imaginary folks complaint about the 'noise' and not bringing our drinks and the lame face 'manager' showed up and explained himself and squeezed my shoulder to released his anger...yea I felt ur anger within ur squeezes lame face...smh 1 star is for the food that u cleaned up while I stepped away to the lady's room! How can this establishment still stay in business with this kind of customer services????
