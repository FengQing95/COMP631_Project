Local Foods////You walk in and you order at the counter. I always get their sandwich with the pretzel bread of course. Which they get the bread delivered from this special bakery which mr.peeples get their pretzel bread too. I like how the pretzel bread isn't an actual pretzel like some places have it, it's pretty much a pretzel bun. My favorite sandwiches are truffle and the crunchy chicken. Their both so good and the crunchy chicken good luck trying to finish that in one sitting, it's HUGE! Good thing about this place you can make any sandwich to a salad if you're trying to watch the calories. You can get two sides or a cup of soup for your side. For my sides I always get the kale which is amazing I don't know how they make it but it's always good. I have tried their beet salad and quinoa which are also amazing. My friend got the vegan chili which the worker said you can't tell there is no meat because the consistency is exactly like a meaty chili but without the meat lol. It was actually pretty good and I might get that as my side next time.
