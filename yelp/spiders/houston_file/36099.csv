Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Loved this place. Will return! Music and atmosphere both fantastic. Drink options a plenty. Ask for their extended whiskey list (whiskey from around the globe). Try the Bosscat burger, you will not be disappointed! Avocado salad is fresh and light, maybe a touch too peppery for me. Try the BC lemonade, made with jalape√±os for a touch of spice. Our server Terry was absolutely amazing! Thanks for your enthusiasm and knowledge, see you again soon
