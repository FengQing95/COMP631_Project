JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Best Ramen I've had so far in Houston, I've had Jinya in two different locations, service has been great at both, but this one in midtown was thankfully able to accommodate our group size. There was a tad bit of a wait, but Â our ramen was good and our server was attentive.
