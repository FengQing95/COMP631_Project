Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////dined in around 1:40 on a tuesday with no wait and had the eggs benedict duo (chile verde and smashed avocado) and their standard breakfast plate. the flavor of most components was fine, but every item was lukewarm at best. to compound the mediocrity of the food was also arguably the worst service i have received at a full service establishment - it essentially ended the moment we placed our food order. our server could not even be burdened to return to the table to process our cash payment, confirm the accuracy of/check on the quality of the food we received, refill beverages, or offer a togo box. which is fine - mediocre service exists. however, when management responded with sheer indifference i can only believe that this accurately reflects their standard of service - in which case, you'd be far better off spending the money you've earned elsewhere.
