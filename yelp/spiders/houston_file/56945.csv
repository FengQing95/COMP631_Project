Kata Robata////My favs are: King Uni Spoon ($7 a bite, but worth every bite) Chawanmushi (loaded with Uni and lobster, lotus fruit, mushrooms), Oysters in a vinaigrette sauce (I've had different versions, but today was one of my favorite- cilantro vinaigrette and topped with fish roe), award-winning lobster mac & cheese (strange place to find it, but the best in the city, I kid you not!), Any of the fresh sashimi, a lot straight from Japan.
