Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Cute little shop with ample lot and street parking. We stopped by on a Sunday around noon to order to go some brunch snacks to go. All employees that I saw were wearing masks correctly and they had someone at the door pacing the number of folks coming in and out. Jennifer at the pastry counter was cheery and helpful with information on what was available and her favorite picks. I ended up with a blueberry muffin that Castro so nicely got warmed up for me and a lavender latte with oat milk, that Jennifer recommended and the woman in front of me excitedly encouraged. The gentleman at the register suggested I get it iced and I have to say, my crowd sourced drink order was extremely tasty and not too sweet. Pop in, they've got warm and cold drinks and dishes for dine in (indoors or patio) or carry out along with a million sweets to tempt you.
