Uchi////The food was remarkable as always.  Everyone was impressed with the tasty courses & it's hard to say which was the best.  The 8 course meal started off with appetizers of the edamame & roasted brussel sprouts.  I can't decide between the Pork Belly & the Rib Eye on which was my favorite course.  We had a wonderful party and my guy was very happy and everyone had such a great time. It was fun introducing UCHI to at least 7 of the 12 people there.
