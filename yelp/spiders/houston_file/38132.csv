Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My husband and I went to Bosscat for our Friday night date night. We hop around town and had never tried Bosscat before now. This place is wonderful! The atmosphere, the food, and especially the drinks. Our server, Ally, took care of us with such courteous and superb service. She recommended the shrimp & grits (which were SO tasty) and a Bosscat cocktail to start us out. We shared other treats as well such as the Cornbread Madeleines and the delicious Brussel sprouts. We will be back for sure!
