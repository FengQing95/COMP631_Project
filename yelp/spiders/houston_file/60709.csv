Baby Barnaby's////There are many things I enjoy on the menu. I think my hands down fave is the green eggs. Spinach artichoke and eggs? YES. The potatoes are pretty much to die for as well.. and I even really like the toast here! Both the chicken apple sausage AND the veggie sausage are so good! I usually cant decide. Generallly I try and keep things healthy.. so I usually order the low fat high protein burrito. Egg whites, chicken, black beans, salsa, and guac... its really good!
