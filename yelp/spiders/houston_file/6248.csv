JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Service is very mixed. When they are busy, they can be inattentive and slow. My first visit, the waitress told us that we couldn't order more noodles if we still had broth (which isn't true as I later discovered). During my third visit, the waiter forgot to get our add-ons, never made sure our water was refilled, and was always flirting with this other waitress. The other times were average service. Another problem I have is that the only time you get GREAT service is when the bus boys come to take your dishes away, except they come immediately when I finish all my noodles. No thanks, I'm still trying to enjoy the broth. They need to teach the bus boys to just wait until the customers leave or at least pay for the bill. It wouldn't be a problem if it didn't happen every single visit that I had to tell them "No, I am still working on it."
