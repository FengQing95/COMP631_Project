Uchi////Went for my wife's birthday.  We ended up getting there at Happy Hour, and didn't even know it.  What an awesome deal!  I've only hear that this place is super expensive, but good.  But our bill was less than $150 WITH tip and we went ALL out on the food and drinks.  I can't remember when happy hours ends (I want to say it was 4-7p) so if its your first time, try to go then so you can sample more without killing your wallet.
