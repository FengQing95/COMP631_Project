Baby Barnaby's////My friend and I ended up here when there was a long line at a nearby breakfast place and we were very pleased with what we found! Our food was excellent (I had the migas with chorizo and my friend had the green eggs) and was half the price of the nearby place. Looking around at other diners' plates made the choice difficult because everything looked so good. We loved the friendly atmosphere and the service was great. I'll definitely be back!
