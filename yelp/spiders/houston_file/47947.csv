Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Came here on a Friday around 9:15am and there was only a 15 minute wait. There is complimentary coffee while you wait which is nice. I had the Breakfast Potpie topped with your choice of egg. It was good but really flaky. My boyfriend had the chilaquiles Benedict. That was amazing! I would definitely recommend getting that. It's very flavorful. Our waiter was very quick and attentive. Perfect breakfast/brunch place with nice ambience.
