Baby Barnaby's////I've been to Barnaby's before and the food is always awesome. A friend of mine recently adopted a puppy from BARC and he loves her so much he didn't want to leave her, even to eat so I recommended we go to Barnaby's for breakfast. However, when we got there, the patio chairs were all stacked up and locked so my friend poked his head inside to ask if we could be seated since the patio seating is the dog-friendly part of the restaurant. The server said that they were understaffed so the patio was to remain closed...wah wah wah wahhhhh! Â We ended up getting drive thru from a nearby taco bell and eating in a park. The only reason I'm giving two stars for this review is because I KNOW their food is awesome and the wait staff are great. Just wish we could've eaten with our furry friend which is kind of what Barnaby's thing is.
