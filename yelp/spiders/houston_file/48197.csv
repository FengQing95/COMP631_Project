Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Perfect spot for brunch! We came here on a weekday, so we didn't encounter the huge weekend queues. The food was fantastic. Although we did not have the pancakes which I think is popular at this place, we had a Ham Benedict and Corned beef hash. Both were perfect. A dash of dirty chai as well to spice things up!
