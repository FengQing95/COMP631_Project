Uchi////Once inside, the entry is very small, but very chic with warm cappuccino colored wood that adorns the front entry. The hostesses were friendly, but unforgiving that no incomplete parties could be seated. I waited at the bar with one friend while we waited on the others to arrive. I was meeting friends here for my birthday dinner and we had 5 in our party. The 5th person ended up not showing, but they wouldn't seat us until everyone was accounted for. We ended up only waiting 10 minutes past the reservation time in order not to lose our reservation and ended up with just 4 of us. Ensure that everyone in your party is accounted for if this is the case.
