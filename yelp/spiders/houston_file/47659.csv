Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food was good, but service was below average. Prices are a bit high for portion size and breakfast. Wait time was an hour for us. Meal had several items that are at The Egg & I, which rarely has a wait time and their prices include meats. Here you have to pay extra to add meats to most of the already above average priced items. It was an "ehhhh" experience for me.
