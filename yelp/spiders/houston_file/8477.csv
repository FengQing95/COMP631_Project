JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I usually get either the spicy Tonkatsu black, or wonton noodle bowl. The broth in Tonkatsu black is savory and not too salty; now, I do wish that it is richer or "bone barrow-y" if that makes sense. But overall a solid broth that none others in Houston can compare. The egg is excellent, the pork is juicy with enough melt-in-your-mouth-ness (can't go wrong with fatty pork!), and the noodles are firm and not too chewy. Grade A stuff here.
