Uchi////All I can say is Wow!!  Very impressive! I was a bit skeptical as I've been to the Uchi in Austin and wasn't very impressed at all with the food or service there. But the Houston location exceeded my expectations!! Great food and impeccable service! Definitely a fine dining experience!!  Granted yes, it's an $100/person type place but the food is spectacular!  Their kaki no shiki (Kusshi oysters with green apple and lemongrass) is so divine!! I want wanted a dz of them!!  Their Hirame with fried quinoa so light and perfect! They balance food so well!  Very creative in food pairings! Love Love Love!!
