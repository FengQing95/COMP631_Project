JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food? Awesome! Get the spicy chicken ramen! Don't go mild, don't go hot! Spicy is just right! I don't mind hot things, but a certain level will take away its taste. There are options to customize your ramen as well. I cannot emphasize enough how good the food is... and really, the only way is to try it yourself, but I can virtually guarantee you'll enjoy it. Â
