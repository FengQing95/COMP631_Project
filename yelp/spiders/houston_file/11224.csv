JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Side W. - Thank you for the 5-star review. We greatly appreciate it. The Cha Cha Cha is one of the classic JINYA recipes that has helped get us to where we are today. I am especially glad that you received good service in spite of how rushed and busy the house might have been. Regarding the music, I wish we could change that aspect of our restaurant, but as a franchisee, we are beholden to numerous directives from our corporate headquarters -- music volume being one of them. That said, we do try our best to accommodate our guests in all facets.
