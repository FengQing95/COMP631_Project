JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya's ramen is tasty & although sometimes there is a long wait for a table on the weekend, the food comes out fast. We always have great service every time we go. With all the asian restaurants closing in the midtown area, I actually prefer to come here when I'm craving noodles rather than drive to Bellaire.
