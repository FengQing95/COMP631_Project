JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your review of Jinya Ramen Bar.  I do agree that the broth is the most important aspect of a bowl of ramen.  Each and every one of our broths take 12 to 18 hours to prepare and we use an Atago Refractometer to check the density of the broth to maintain quality every 4 hours.  The Tonkotsu Black is our "standard bearer" since it's the most popular ramen from the Jinya locations in California.  This is the ramen that famed food critic Johnathan Gold named "best ramen in LA"  I, however, feel the broth is too thick and rich to my liking.  My stomach can't even digest milk so a super thick and rich broth won't be doing me any favors.  I prefer the Yatai ramen and the Tonkotsu Assari.  Both are much lighter and possess a different taste and texture compared to the Tonkotsu Black.  We prepare 5 different kinds of broths each day and of the 11 kinds of ramen we carry, many of the broths are mixed and matched to "fine tune" the flavors.  I'm sure we have a ramen on our menu that you will like.  We hope you give Jinya another shot in the near future and please ask for me or any of my managers (Keith, Wynne and Sara).  We will be more than happy to help you select a ramen to your liking.  Thanks again for your review and feedback.
