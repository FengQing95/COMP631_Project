The spaces are narrow, so it's completely necessary to squeeze yourself out the car door rather than swing the door open and get out. Some of these people who try to park are crazy. I know we're competing for spots but don't play chicken with me at 30 mph in a parking lot! To avoid this, come early or park on the street!
