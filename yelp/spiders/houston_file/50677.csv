Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////OMG I love Snooze. I love everything about it, except for the lack of parking and long wait times. But here are some options. Just give up on parking in their tiny lot and find alternate street parking. Walk up to the host stand and give them your name and cell number and they will tell you an approx wait time while you chill at the Starbucks on the same side of the street, just steps away. However, if you choose to stand and people watch, just inside the door is complimentary hot coffee while you wait out your possible 1 hour wait. For real. But it's worth it.
