Local Foods////Only possible negative things to say is that this place is too popular-parking and finding a table can be tough at lunchtime and on the weekends.  That being said, this is a go-to meal for us.  I love the posole and the pretzel bun is amazing.  Favorites are the smoked salmon sandwich, the egg salad, and the crispy chicken sandwich.  The homemade chips are tasty.
