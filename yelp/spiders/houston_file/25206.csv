Uchi////The food was good, but so expensive and the portion sizes were very small. We got the vegetarian omukase (one of our friends was vegetarian), as well as different rolls. It was so pricy, but the bigger issue is that all of us left hungry. We actually went to Velvet Taco across the street afterwards. The service was also exceedingly slow as we sat down at 5, and left at almost 8. The service was very friendly and accommodating but just very slow.
