Baby Barnaby's////I met a friend here for lunch and we had a great time! It's a cute little cafe that has a lot of great different options. We both ordered the house salad with chicken and it was really good. I wish I ordered it in their smaller size since I only ate about half of it. Definitely a larger portion than I thought! We also got the $1 brownies at the end which was the perfect bite size amount to end our meal. Definitely recommend this place and would love to come back in the future!
