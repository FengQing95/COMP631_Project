Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So my review is on the scraps, which seems to be the norm if you aren't waiting in a line early in the morning/lunch rush. I ordered 2 chocolate chip cookies, $3.95. They're quite large, and delicious...a little soft. 1 oatmeal cookie, $3.95, it was good too...very cinnamony. The macaroons , $2.25ea were good as well. PB&J was my fav. The salted caramel was good as well. Note, just good. I don't know if i'd wait an hour to get these. Maybe the other stuff that was sold out is exceptional.
