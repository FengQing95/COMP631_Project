Uchi////My wife and I went in with high expectations . We noticed that the ambiance was modern but not cold or sterile as some might assume when hearing the descriptor "modern." It has a warmth. Like coming in off the cold street in late November to a warm cup of cider that grandma had cooking on the stove. Our server was knowledgeable and created a tasting menu for us based on our preferences. The food was great; our dessert was magical. Some of our dishes were underwhelming but even those that we felt missed the mark were still very good when compared to other restaurants. We will be back.
