JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Hillary - Thanks for your great review. I'm very glad you enjoyed our fare, though I'm curious to know if you were aware of our new Spicy Vegan Ramen. We introduced this and some other new menu items on Tuesday of last week, so hopefully you can come back and give it a try if you missed it. Regardless, we appreciate you and your friends trying us out, and we hope to see you again soon.
