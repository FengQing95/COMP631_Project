Baby Barnaby's////The food was really good - pretty straightforward breakfast items. I got the Breakfast Plate and he got Green Eggs. The biscuits, green eggs, and apple chicken sausage were all great! The bacon was thick - I prefer super crispy bacon, but that's me. Overall good but not worth the 1.5 hour wait.
