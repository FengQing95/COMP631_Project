JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The bar is the first thing you see as soon as you enter. The bar had mainly employees going from the bar to the back. The hostess led us to the back where it was 360 degrees from what you see outside. Here you'll find people eating with loud DJ music sort of to give that club-feel. Great atmosphere for it being late at night. So far, so good.
