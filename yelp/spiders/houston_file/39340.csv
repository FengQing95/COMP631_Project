Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////WASTE OF TIME!!! Came for dinner here for a friend's birthday. Everything that could have gone wrong went wrong. The service was terrible, it took nearly two hours for us to get our food after we ordered. There were hardly any people in the place so its not like they were super busy for it to take that long. I ordered the only vegetarian burger on the menu and it came loaded with bacon and although the server offered to change it, I didn't want to wait another hour for the food to come out again; and at that point I was so annoyed that it killed my appetite. Most of my friend's in our group ordered the steak night special and none of them touched it. My husband was so hungry after waiting as long as we did. He was the only one that ate the "Gold medal chicken sandwich" and was immediately sick and ended up throwing it up in the bathroom. After everything went wrong the manager offered shots for the table, great for everyone else but neither me nor my husband drink alcohol. Im not one to write negative reviews but the service and the food here was straight up TERRIBLE. I wont be recommending it and i wont be returning. Had to go to another restaurant to try and get food after leaving this place because we were all still hungry!
