Kata Robata////I'm a huge fan of soft shell crab so I had to order this roll. The flavors were not as uplifting as I would've liked. The bbq powder gave the dish a very strange flavor profile. It wasn't necessarily sweet or savory. All the spices added to the roll didn't help to diminish the strange flavors of the powder. The crab was cooked perfectly and had a crisp skin, which complemented the buttery, smooth salmon. I blame the failure of this roll on the bbq powder.
