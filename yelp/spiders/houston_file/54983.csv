Kata Robata////I always have an amazing experience when I come in here! Their sashimi is incredibly fresh (I just ordered the otoro and cherry blossom salmon off of their featured menu). Their Kobe skewers are also a must have! If you're looking for a great roll, definitely try the ocean picante. The servers are always very knowledgeable and happy to offer guidance in the selection process.
