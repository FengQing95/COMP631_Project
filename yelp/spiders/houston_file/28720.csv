The Pit Room////I had the feast No.1 along with my family today. it offered a great assortment of meats and sides for a pretty decent price. We got brisket, 2 sausages, beef rib, pork ribs, turkey, and pulled pork along with Mac, Cole slaw, potato salad, and beans. The brisket was pretty well done for the most part. It was well seasoned but not overly salty, I think it could've used a bit more. The moist was on the leaner side and didn't have a much fat which is okay, I would like a bit more on the fat cap. It was all extremely well rendered and delicious. (A-) The venison sausage was not my favorite and didnt have much fat at all which is to be expected. (C+) The jalape√±o cheese was much better and flavorful with good fat amount. its all made in house so I tip my hat to them for that. (b+) The beef rib was a real star of this mound of meat. I mean wow, we got an end rib which equates to super charred and super seasoned morsels of beef. The best bites of the day came from this meat. Truly mastered this. (A) The pork ribs were decent, not something that blew me away but well done nonetheless. (B) The turkey was a bit on the dry side sadly and wasn't getting that moist pure flavor you often get from some turkeys. (B-) The pulled pork was pretty great, flavorful, and moist. (B+) The Mac and the Beans were the stars of the side dishes. The Mac was probably some of the best cafeteria smooth based Mac I've had at a bbq joint. There was absolutely no line on a Saturday at lunch which is a HUGE bonus. Its always super refreshing to be able to walk up at anytime you please and get quality Q. Is the juice worth the squeeze with the Pit Room, I most definitely think so.
