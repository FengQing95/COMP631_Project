Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Went in today for Brunch. We there at about 12:45 and the brunch menu is served till 3 pm. There was no crazy line like everyone has been talking about but most of the seats were occupied. They were already out of the Bialy, Crab Chilli Relleno, and one more item - can't remember what it was. I wanted to walk out but my husband was really hungry and so I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich and he ordered the turtle soup and the bread platter. The bread was excellent but the food itself was okay. The turtle soup was quite oily, and the chunks of apple in my sandwich didn't appeal to my taste buds. And the fact that they run out of food hours before the day ends is ridiculous. I read somewhere that the head chef wants this place to be known as the best bakery in the US. He going to have to work pretty hard to get that title. Put more items on the menu for starters - just one salad and one sandwich is totally inadequate - and then make sure you don't run out of a third of them less than half way into the day. Though I have to say that the staff was really attentive and our food came out very fast.
