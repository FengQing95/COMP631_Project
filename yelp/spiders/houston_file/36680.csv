Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Terry was our waiter ! He was so friendly, hilarious and knowledgeable of the menu. We ordered the pimento cheese, pig candy, & pulled pork hush puppies for appetizers. For my drink I got the Bosscat signature drink & the avocado Cobb salad with chicken for my dinner. Everything was delicious. The ambiance is a nice modern industrial decor. My coworkers & I like to come here for happy hours.
