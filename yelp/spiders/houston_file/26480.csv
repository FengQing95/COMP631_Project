The Pit Room////I can easily give the pit room 4 stars. Had the turkey sandwich, mac & cheese, and corn. Everything was really good. Sausages looked great but I didn't get to try one on this trip. The mac & cheese was solid. Cheese sauce is really smooth and rich. Will definitely be back when I am in H-town. Keep smoking it up. You all are doing it right.
