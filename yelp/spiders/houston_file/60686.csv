Baby Barnaby's////While the eggs here were 10/10 some of the best eggs I've had. The wait at this location was way too long and the way they keep track of who is up next in line is terribly confusing. After 90 min of waiting and not knowing how much longer the wait was or who was ahead of us in line we finally got called. From there the experience got a lot better with the food being good. The eggs were by far the highlight. The sasuage, bread, and rest of the plate were average. Quantity could be increased, but overall good to try once, but perhaps a different location
