Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Every time I go, I always order the pancake flight. Usually with a french toast, and pineapple upside down pancake and switch up the third option with the pancake of the day or a seasonal item. The pineapple upside down pancake is hands down my favorite one! There has been a drunken monkey french toast and I highly suggest you stop snoozing and get your butt over there before 1/12/2017 when they switch it up with another specialty french toast. I've tried a few of the savory items like different eggs benedicts and the corned beef hash. Everything is always flavorful and filling. The side of hashbrown potatoes are amazinggg with a nice crust on the outside. The orange juice is fresh squeezed and delicious. The hot chocolate is rich and they top it off with some cinnamon that makes it different than a plain hot chocolate. Definitely order this if it's chilly outside and you need something to warm you up.
