The Pit Room////Wow! The rib I had was great! My wife loved her chop beef sandwich. I really like the flavor of the barbecue sauce also. Overall it's definitely a barbecue place I'll be coming back to again. We spent $49 including tip (Which they give you several choices to tip if you pay by card) but good bbq is rarely cheap.
