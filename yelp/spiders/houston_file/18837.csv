Uchi////We were let in exactly at 5 and were seated at the "community table" where they serve the social hour.  Well, me and my friends being the adventurous eaters that we are decided to order all of the items off the social hour menu so we could sample each thing.  I honestly could not tell you the name of everything I ate but I know a couple of items that stuck out.  The pork belly with some kind of egg sauce, the grilled escolar, some eggplant on nigiri rice were some of my favorites.  But every item I ate was truly packed with intense flavors which surprised me.
