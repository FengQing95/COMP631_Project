Local Foods////We asked what's the "it" item. W/O hesitation; replied was the Crispy Chicken Sandwich. The confidence that radiated off the attendants face said "okay we have to try it" and so we did. I love beets so I decided to grab a side of that too. The sandwich was okay. It was nice and crispy. The beets were blah at best. I'm not sure how beets become tasty but Local Foods hasn't found that recipe yet. Also what lacked was the damn season! I mean for peeps sake, I know you're organic but sprinkle a little salt and pepper. The whole time I'm wondering when the kick comes in.
