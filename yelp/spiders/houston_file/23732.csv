Uchi////The service was great, it was busy so the food took a while to come out sometimes but that's no big deal. I came in fully prepared to spend $200+, and if I did it would have been a 4 star review, but our check ended up being $137 before tip. For the amount/variety of food we ate (we were stuffed) and the service you simply cannot beat that price. 5 stars. We will definitely be back. We were also continually congratulated on our anniversary by almost every worker in the restaurant, which was very nice.
