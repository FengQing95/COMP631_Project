Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Their coffee is on point. I got an iced Americano and didn't even need to sweeten it. (I'm a coffee person though... Just saying.) also their pastries are amazing! Get the kouign amann.... It's like a croissant shaped muffin glazed with sugar. It's the bomb.
