Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is probably one of my favorite breakfast spots. Everything that I have tried has been delicious. The french toast, the burrito, the pancakes, I could go on and on! I don't go as often as I'd like because it's always so packed. If you have not tried them, you definitely should really soon. You will not be disappointed!
