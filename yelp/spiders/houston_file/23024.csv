Uchi////while in texas for a business trip, a coworker told us that this place's omakase was good, so we decided to stop by after a few drinks in downtown houston. when we first got there, we thought we could walk in without making reservations and get seated. Â welp, that idea backfired big time... there was a long wait, but luckily we were able to grab drinks at the bar to allow time to pass.
