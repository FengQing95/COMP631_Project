Local Foods////Food: All the sandwiches and sides look/sound amazing. I had the falafel sandwich with beets and tuscan kale. Really enjoyed the sandwich--large portion, falafel was flavorful and not dry because of the yogurt sauce, highly recommend. I liked the beets, kale had a little too much parm for me but overall great meal at a reasonable price. There's a decent drink selection too, what's not to like?!
