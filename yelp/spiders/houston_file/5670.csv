JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First time I came here I would've gave 5, I loved everything I ate. Came here this time and the app out did the entree. The tempura shrimp are delicious, that's a must. Didn't get a chance to get a picture. Then i ordered the Tonkotsu Black with pork and it was okay.. the pork in it was super fatty. Wouldn't get i again probably. But I'll come back to try other things.
