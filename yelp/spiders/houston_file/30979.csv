The Pit Room////Texas BBQ is one of my favorites, anyone that knows bbq knows there are so many types and styles of bbq it's virtually impossible to define who has the absolute best and that's because everyone has their favorites and for a variety of reasons. I'm no expert even though I've eaten bbq hundreds of times from sea to shiny sea and my love for bbq covers many styles and I find no reason to say this one or any other one is the best I just try and enjoy it all. I find bbq is very subjective and we all have some bias when it comes to picking our favorites, fortunately these "pit masters" are prideful people and they take bbq very seriously so we are luck most are very good.
