Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Opened yesterday, Tuesday and I'm really looking forward to visiting!  News crew is here, not sure what channel.  I walk in and love the interior.  Tons of sunlight, airy, bright!  I love a bar around the perimeter of the café too, somewhere I can set up shop and work.  I'm standing in line and it doesn't look like they have a ton of options.   Maybe a handful of pastries...but they do look amazing!  With the recommendation of my helper, I get the chocolate croissant and the bosoft.  I also want the cheese Danish, as it's my favorite...but they're out.  I get to the cashier, order a vanilla almond milk latte, and they are out of almond milk...it's 9:30...AM!  The line is long and cashiers slow, so far, I'm not having the greatest experience....obviously they're still working out the kinks...
