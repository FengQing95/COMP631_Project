Uchi////We couldn't let one of our favorite spots fizzle out, so before the year ended we wanted to continue supporting Uchi and also redeemed the gift card given out to folks who ordered takeout months ago. Prior to modifications, Uchi was strictly take out only for the first few months following March. Today, tall makeshift plexiglass barriers constructed with wood sit in between booths. Again, no bar seating. The entire bar is plexied to the teeth, as well.
