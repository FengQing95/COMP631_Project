Uchi////With recomendations from our friends as well as Dustin, we tried the vegetarian nabe. I was expecting a soupy like hot pot from the description but Dustin's accurate description of vegetarian fried rice was more accurate. Holy crap. Basically, it was vegetarian fried rice that was fried to a point where it was slightly smoky but crispy. It was the perfect way to start the meal. We continue on with the brie ringo (which was tempura fried pieces of brie on a sweet potato dip topped with apple chutney). It came out in the perfect portion - four pieces. The combination of sweet and tangy was just perfect. At this point, my boyfriend and I were super excited about our main course sushi. We got gotten the spicy crunchy (jalepeno, avocado and cucumber), shag (tempura roll, avocado and sundried tomato) and pitchfork (crispy leek, avocado and yuzu kosho). After the appetizers, the main course was a little underwhelming. Obviously there are going to be limitations with vegetarian sushi but it was still good. The spicy crunch wasn't really spicy and it was rather plain. I liked the pitchfork more than the shag while my boyfriend liked the shag more. The unique think about the pitchfork is that it had a seasoning that was made by the chef specially for it. Dustin actually brought out a sample for it and we put it on all the sushi because it was amazing. It was a crushed paste of lemon, lime, chilli pepper and garlic. I also had a ikura nigri on the side (i think i had some tears of joy, the salmon roe was amazing) along with nasu (eggplant with lemon miso - another fine choice). We topped off the dinner with peanut butter semifreddo (I told you we did out on 6 course meal!). Once again, another highlight! The semifreddo was a creamy but light mouse that was peanut butter flavored with an amazingly refreshing tangy taste of apple miso sorbet.
