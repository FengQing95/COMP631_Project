Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I decided give this place a try after a few people recommended it to me. We visited this place last night to celebrate a birthday party, there was 11 of us total. Let me just start by saying that the lady who helped me with making my reservation initially was VERY friendly and accommodating and even helped with making last minute changes to the total guest count. I have no complaints there.
