Kata Robata////Sushi - So here's the deal, their rolls are alright. While we were waiting they were passing out free rolls to try and the two we tried were not that impressive, BUT when we sat down we ordered some nigiri and everything about that was fresh, perfectly sliced and delicious. Honestly I know I'm down playing this a little but seriously the sushi here is delicious and is played beautifully. You go here for the sushi first! That being said!! (like my segway...)
