Local Foods////Crab and shrimp sandwich was better than most lobster rolls I have had on the east coast. Whole shrimp were bountiful with sweet crab meat. The sauce was a light aioli that didn't distract from the stars of the show. Kale and pine nut side was the best of the bunch and the homemade chips were solid.
