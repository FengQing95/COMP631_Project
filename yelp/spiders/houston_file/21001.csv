Uchi////When we came at 7:30 p.m. and gave our name we were told it would be an hour and forty-five minute wait. My mom loves sushi and supposedly this is the best sushi spot in town so we said okay we'll wait. Well, we've been standing and waiting well over two hours now and haven't been seated. Not only that but the hostess is completely ignoring us. You'd think in a fancy restaurant they'd at least be friendly and nice. Someone would come and say it's only going to be a little while longer... but no.
