Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////--Snooze Spuds Deluxe - (5/5) A bed of hash browns, stuffed with 2 items listed at the bottom of their menu and topped with 2 sunny side eggs.  I got bacon, chorizo, mushrooms, and jalapeños and it was delicious!  I didn't add any sauce because the egg yolk itself drizzled a good amount into the hash browns to make soggy already.
