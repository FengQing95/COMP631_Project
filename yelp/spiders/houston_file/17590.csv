Uchi////Best Japanese food I had in Houston.  Not your everyday sushi or roll place.  Yes it is expensive but you get what you paid for.  We had 21 dishes between the 4 of us and they were all great.  Highly recommend to do the Signature Selection if you haven't been there and just add some more to share.  A few dishes that really stood out in my mind were the Walu Walu, hamachi nabe, uni and geoduck.  The service was very good, all the staff are very knowledgeable and explain each dish to us.  Will save up some money to go again.
