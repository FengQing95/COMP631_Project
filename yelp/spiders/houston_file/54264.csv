Kata Robata////Soy Ramen: I got hyped about this because the diners next to us were talking it up in their conversation (sorry, not sorry for eavesdropping). It had a really classic and beautiful presentation. I dipped my spoon in to taste the broth. Whoa. This is disgusting. Like, we couldn't tell if they added mayo or an absurd amount of butter to the broth but the only flavor we could get taste in the broth was this butter/mayo taste. Jinya is LEAPS AND BOUNDS over this ramen, and I don't even have a deep love for Jinya.
