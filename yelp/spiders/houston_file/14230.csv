JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Food: I ordered a few things: Crispy Shrimp balls, Wonton Chicken Ramen, with seasoned egg, and Gyozas. The cripsy shrimp balls were delicious. They're kind of like the shrimp balls you get when eating Dim Sum, but not really. The gyozas were pretty legit, but if you really want good gyoza, then head to San Dong noodle in Chinatown. I still think their dumplings are the best in town. As for the ramen itself? DE-LI-CIOUS. I usually don't really like soupy meals, but for this ramen, I definitely could make an exception.
