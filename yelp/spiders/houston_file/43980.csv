Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The fourth and most recent visit was pleasant. Luckily it was a girls brunch date, so I overlooked the minute things that would probably pester me. But the lunch items they ordered were delicious (I believe a shredded chicken torta and a halibut tartare) as well as the raspberry and pistachio tart pastry (surprised by this one since I don't like either main ingredient, rating: 4/5). I do like their cappuccino (3/5) but I've had better. On the other hand, their kouign anann that was recommended by one of the ready-to-please servers, was not so pleasing to my taste buds (2/5).
