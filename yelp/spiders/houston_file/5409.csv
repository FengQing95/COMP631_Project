JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Aspen - Thank you for the excellent review. I would say the majority of our business comes from personal referrals, so I'm always grateful when customers give us a try simply based on the recommendations of friends and family. Honestly, that's the best advertising there is! Also, we appreciate your understanding regarding our wait times. By this time next year we will have two more JINYA outposts in Houston, so we hope that might alleviate the crowds a bit. Thank you again, and we look forward to serving you again soon.
