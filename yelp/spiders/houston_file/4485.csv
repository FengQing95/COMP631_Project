JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hopped in for a quick lunch on a Wednesday after working out at the 24 hrs fitness upstairs. Got seated at the "community" table. I got a booth the last time I came here when I was with a friend two weeks ago, but I was by myself this time. I didn't mind sharing this table with others although I noted that I was the only singleton there; everyone else being happily coupled. Â I ordered the same dish as last time, the Black Tonkatsu, remembering how yummy and garlicky it was before. I had ordered the spicy bean sprouts and received a huge plate for a buck last time, so I figured I would give the the bok choy a try this time. For a $1.50 a got a measly 4 stringy pieces of the most anemic excuse for a "topping".
