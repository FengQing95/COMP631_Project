JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Secondly, our most expensive ramen is the Cha Cha Cha at $13.95. Our closest competitor (in comparison to design-buildout cost and location / rent structure) charges $14 for their basic chicken ramen. In addition, their most expensive pork (tonkotsu) ramen is $20. I'm not trying to convince you that JINYA is a better value, rather, I'm simply making a point that we are located in a prime real-estate location, and our prices are heavily dependent on factors other than just the cost of the food we buy from our suppliers.
