Baby Barnaby's////Amazingly good! I had the green eggs with a biscuit instead of a toast for no additional cost. All of if was very good! We also split a pumpkin pancake with my boyfriend and it was delish! Plenty of good food for a very decent price. We will definitely come back despite the little wait at the door (30 minutes at 10:30 AM on a Saturday). It's worth it! Service is also good. Very friendly.
