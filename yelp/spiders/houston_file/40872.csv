Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////You know what I love better than good food? Great customer service. Last evening I went back to one of my favorite spots Bosscat for a quick bite and drinks before I hit the town. I ordered the 12 hour short rib meal. In short there was way more cheese in those scallop potatoes than necessary. The manager came over after the meal and asked about it. I shared my feedback. He shared from the looks the food wasn't prepared to their standards. He took care of it for me. I have had many great meals here and the service is always excellent. We also continued to drink and drink some more. Here are a few recommendations of libations from last night we had to get your evening started:
