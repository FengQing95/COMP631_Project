JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I went here with a couple of friends on Saturday night. We planned to arrive at 5:30PM but ended up here late as usual at 6:30PM (at peak dinner time). The interior is small for the weekend rush, so if you are coming with a large group I suggest coming early. There are a couple of smaller booths along the side and two large picnic-style tables in the center.
