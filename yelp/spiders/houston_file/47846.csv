Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////If you're patient enough to wait a few hours you'll be rewarded with some of the most creative (and quality) pancakes for the price point in Houston. I was very excited to see Snooze make it to our city after having a great experience in their downtown Denver location. The service is almost always friendly and helpful (we all have bad days, especially at a place that is always as packed as this) and on several occasions we've had the chance to try the pancake of the day, on the house. The rest of their menu has lived up to the same quality as well. Get your name on the list and check it out.
