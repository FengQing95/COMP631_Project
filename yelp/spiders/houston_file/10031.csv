JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So what is their best, spicy miso ramen. The broth seems to originate from Tonkotsu (I am speculating, my apology if I am wrong) but they blend the miso and added Japanese style miso very well, so the broth is well balanced. This goes well with a thick noodle with mild waviness. The broth and the noodle are well matched, and I can give a close to 4.5 out of 5 for this. So well done. And this is my favorite. It is better than Tiger Den. Tiger Den needs to create their own broth for miso ramen is my personal opinion. I like it, but Tiger Den does have a new challenger.
