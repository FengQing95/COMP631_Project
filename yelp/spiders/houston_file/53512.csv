Kata Robata////That's not to say that it's not a solid restaurant. It wasn't bad sushi, it just wasn't...great. The sushi plate (assorted nigiri and a tuna roll) was extremely overpriced for the number and size of the pieces. The fish, in general, was a bit flavorless. One exception to this was the special copper river salmon they were offering--frickin fantastic. Of course, it was $6/piece, so it better be frickin fantastic. I was pretty disappointed by the lack of a sashimi plate as well.
