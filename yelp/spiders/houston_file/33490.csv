Local Foods////I love the idea of Local Foods, and I always go with high hopes and expectations, but I am never amazed by my meal. I do appreciate the philosophy behind the food, and usually I am pleased by each individual ingredient, but for some reason, I have never quite detected a synergism of the components in these inventive sandwiches.
