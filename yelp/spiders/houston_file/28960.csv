The Pit Room////The food is DEFINITELY delicious, it is definitely delicious. The workers here seemed very enthused about working and being here. The vibe is warm and cozy, it doesn't take many people to make the line go out the door, so when it's very busy you can find yourself waiting outside. The line moves very quick though, if they get too busy, there is extra seating next door in "The patio". I feel like the prices per portion however are slightly inflated due to the neighboring neighborhoods, the prices are not absurd, just that for a cheaper price and not much change in taste, you can go somewhere else. You won't be upset here at all however, I would recommend The Pit Room if you are in the area.
