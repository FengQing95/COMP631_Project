Kata Robata////I came here for the happy hour and was thoroughly impressed.  the happy hour menu is full of interesting rolls and various appetizers, so naturally, my friends and i ordered all of them.  the rolls were all great; very creative and well presented. the crunchy eel roll was particularly impressive, garnished with multicolored tomiko. and the happy hour prices are a steal. we got out of there cheap, considering what we ordered.
