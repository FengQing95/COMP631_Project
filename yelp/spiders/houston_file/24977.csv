Uchi////Super omakase.  My buddy and I had a memorable meal tonight.  We ordered the ten course omakase.  It was magnificent!  We had a terrific sushi chef who prepare our own special tasting menu.  We had delicate fresh fish, carefully prepared vegetables, meats, all paired with  sauces and beautifully presented.  We had such that included ahi, akamachi, hamachi, hamadan, inure paired with uni, kani, karei, shake, and toro.  We had wagyu beef cooked on a sizzling hot stone.  We had hot mushrooms with crispy rice.  An amazing combination of a central puddle of parsnip puree surrounded by roasted cauliflower and aparagus and topped with cashews.   Foie gras sushi.  Then desserts: fried milk and separately apple compote with rolled oats.  The service was excellent. A wonderful meal!
