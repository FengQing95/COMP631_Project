Uchi////Excellent service; excellent foods; totally worth the wait! The new husband and I waited 45 minutes to be seated and were offered complimentary mini veggie cut roll sample during the wait; loved such great courtesy! All foods were fresh and delicious. Loved the oysters, the zero zen (Hamachi) rolls, the fatty salmon sashimi, and the Hamachi nabe (hot pot rice). Â Each dish was presented nicely that added an appetizing touch. Last but not least, the Fried Milk! Oh mAH Gawd!! It was Fabulicious, ending our wonderful Uchi experience on a sweet note.
