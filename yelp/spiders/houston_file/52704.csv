Kata Robata////The experience went downhill after that. Our drinks were not promptly refilled and our server would ask how the dinner was going, but not wait for our responses. I also started to notice that all the tables around us were offered hot towels when they sat down, but not us. And guess what? They were not ordering from the HRW menu. Towards the end of our meal, a couple was seated at the table next to us. The restaurant made a really big fuss when they requested the HRW menu, insisting that they did not make a HRW reservation when the guy clearly told them that he did. A Kata employee even brought a print-out over to their table and showed the couple something about HRW reservations. The whole time, they completely disregarded the guy who insisted that he made a HRW reservation. I felt so bad for them, that their dining experience was marred by Kata's reluctance to allow them to order from the HRW menu. My husband and I have been avid patrons of HRW over the years and this is the first time we have seen a restaurant discriminate against HRW customers. If you're going to treat HRW reservations like the red-haired stepchild, please don't participate in the HRW. Our experience at Kata Robata definitely left a very bad taste in my mouth.
