JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////And then Tiger Den has the cheaper ramen by far at $8.00, even accounting for the lesser chashu and egg portions. With the extra $5, you could get an appetizer or load up on extra toppings. But to be fair, I haven't seen ramen as low as $8 anywhere else except for maybe a few shops in California.
