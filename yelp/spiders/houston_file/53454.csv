Kata Robata////Kata Robata is one of those places I always go to "when in doubt" for a nice dinner. Located on Kirby, it's next to Dessert Gallery and Snap Kitchen. This place is a tapas and sushi concept and they're the same guys that came up with Soma and Azuma. Â I love robata because you're able to taste a bunch of plates.
