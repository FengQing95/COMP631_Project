JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen that I chose was jinya tonkotsu black and it was good, I regret dipping the nori into the broth because it felt like every bite I would take would just be so much Nori. My egg had a nice creamy yolk so it was cooked well. My friend ordered the tonkotsu spicy which is an extra dollar than just a regular tonkotsu which was interesting to me when there is seasonings on the table. Mine was nice density and creaminess.
