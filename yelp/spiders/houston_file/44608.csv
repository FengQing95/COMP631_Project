Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love Common Bond. However, the parking is complete crap, but once you get around all that, it's a great place to brunch or even study/work... if you can handle the noise. They have pastries and baked goods galore. When I usually come, it'll be during the day time, either for brunch or to work. I recently ordered the Smoked Duck Tartine, and it was great! The fries it comes with are yummy too! When it comes to the baked goods, it's so hard to decide. It'll range from the macarons to their mini sized pastries or cakes. I like small indulgence.
