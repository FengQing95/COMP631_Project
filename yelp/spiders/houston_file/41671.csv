Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Come early, I mean before noon at least. They are always run out the pastries in the afternoon. Which is a good thing! Get Kouign-amann! very buttery, flaky, and it has caramelized sugar. Almond croissant is very2 good. Big and flaky. The almond filling is very good, not too sweet, and not too almondy. Latte is very consistent, I like it. This place is one of the top-notch french bakery in Houston. And don't forget to get some baguette home!
