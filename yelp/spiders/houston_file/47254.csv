Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////After finding out the wait would be 45 min, we almost left...but I'm SO GLAD we stayed! They offer complimentary coffee to people waiting, but I was able to get a Bloody Mary at the bar while we waited (they make their own mix from scratch and it is delicious). The bartender was super personable and, among other nifty menu tips, informed me that I could sub French toast for 1 or more of the pancakes on the pancake flight if I wanted to try more of a variety. The OMG! French toast definitely deserves its name. The place seems inefficient when it comes to clearing tables/seating people and the wait on the weekends can be very long, but I'm still giving them 5 stars because the food was so good.
