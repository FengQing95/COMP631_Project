Baby Barnaby's////Best potatoes ever. Haha, I'm obsessed. I got the steak and eggs with potatoes and orange juice. The steak was medium rare just like I asked for, the eggs were perfectly cooked to my liking, and the potatoes have had me dreaming about going back since I first found this place. After my first time being here I literally went back the following day lol. It's so tasty, the waiters are all so friendly, and it's creatively decorated both inside and outside! Oh and the orange juice is a MUST try. It was so delicious!!!!
