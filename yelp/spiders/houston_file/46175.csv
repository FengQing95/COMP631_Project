Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////You order cafeteria-style so you have to walk past ALL the freaking pastries before paying the cashier at the end. I walked inside with the intent of buying one pistachio croissant pastry but ended up also ordering a goat cheese and beet salad and an almond croissant for tomorrow morning. Â No regrets, though.
