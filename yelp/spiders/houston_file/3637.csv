JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'll take a tonkotsu spicy ramen with skinny noodles please!!!! I love ramen so much and this place made that happen!!! It was my first time trying and now I can't get enough of it!!! I am so happy they opened a 1960 location!!!! It is so close. Do it. You won't regret it!
