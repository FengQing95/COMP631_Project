Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Everyone enjoyed what was ordered. Around the table- breakfast burrito (myself and one other ordered this). We both enjoyed it but agreed the sauce served with it adds saltiness more than anything. I could only eat 1/2. I ate other 1/2 at home and tried it with jelly and it was perfect. Four others had pancakes and all commented on how amazing they were. The French toast was had by the kids at the table and they were all quiet until their plates were clean. The donut burger was a great balance of sweet and savory.
