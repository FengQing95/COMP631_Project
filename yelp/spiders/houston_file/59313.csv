Baby Barnaby's////Being in a somewhat healthy mood, i went for the high protein burrito, but i substituted my tomatoes with their potatoes (which the waitress was more than happy to do).  The eggs in the burrito were amazing... so fluffy, flavorful and buttery - i cant imagine how that thing was healthy.  The potatoes also had the right crisp outside and warm soft inside.
