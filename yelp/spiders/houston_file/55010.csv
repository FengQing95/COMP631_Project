Kata Robata////I made reservations for a double date night on Friday.  When we arrived, we had to wait about 15 minutes for our table, which I thought was interesting given their warning that they had the right to give our table away if we arrived 15 minutes late.  At this point we learned that it probably wouldn't be a top notch service kinda place.
