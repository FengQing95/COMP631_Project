Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I grabbed a chocolate chip cookie at the counter.  And OH MY GOSH, it was so tasty! It was perfectly sweet and so moist.  I ended up only eating a bite prior to my meal, and even when I got home hours later to devour the rest, it was still just as tasty.  I also had the breakfast sandwich, which had a large piece of patty type sausage, an egg, aioli sauce and lettuce.  The flavor was great and I didn't leave feeling overly full.
