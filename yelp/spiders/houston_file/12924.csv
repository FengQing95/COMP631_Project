JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I came to Jinya Ramen with two friends on a weekend afternoon. We were seated at group seating which was OK since we said we would rather not wait at a table - the seating at the group table was however pretty tight. I wish it was a little more spacious. Once seated service was solid, waiters were attentive and quickly brought our drinks. Ordered the tonkatsu ramen special and it was good, I had heard a lot of great things about Jinya and I think it may be a little overhyped but overall I'd probably come back to try it again. The broth was a little salty and the noodles could have been a little thicker but maybe I ordered the wrong thing for myself. The pork cutlet however was amazing. All in all I'd come back - just next time I'd wait for a table to open up.
