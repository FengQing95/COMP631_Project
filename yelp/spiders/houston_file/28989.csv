The Pit Room////I apologize if the staff was not as accommodating as we aim for. Our menu works in various ways; you can order by weight or you can order a 1/2/3 meat combo which comes with sides. When dining in or visiting for the first time, we always recommend the latter as if gives you more variety! We are glad to hear you enjoyed your meal and yes - portions are hefty! We hope you took some home with you :)
