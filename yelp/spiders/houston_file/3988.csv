JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have eaten at Jinya quite a few times and tried many menu items. In these visits, I have had good bowls of ramen and mediocre bowls of ramen. Â The mediocre bowls were lacking in flavor and nothing memorable. I have also gotten cold Ajitama (soft-boiled egg) which is not a good contrast to the lukewarm to hot broth. Jinya does a decent job, but the consistency needs to improve.
