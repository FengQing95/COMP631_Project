Uchi////Every time I have been to Uchi the wait staff has been really knowledgeable about the dishes, so I usually go with what they recommend. The dishes that totally blew me away were the carpaccio, this one tuna? roll, and all of the deserts that I've had there. I would actually recommend going here just to try the deserts - don't get any food, just order every single desert. Yum.
