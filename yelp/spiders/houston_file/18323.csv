Uchi////I brought my husband here for his birthday dinner on 03/10/2017. This use to be his favorite restaurant, but over the last few years it has gone down-hill. Our server and food were magnificent, but we were charged for two items that I ordered and never received. I told our server not to worry about it and we went ahead and ordered our desert. I never thoroughly looked over our bill before paying it and that was my mistake because I was charged for both items that I never received. Its unfortunate because after this being an issue in the past we will look for a better place to enjoy our sushi.
