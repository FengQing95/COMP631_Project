Uchi////Wow! This place is amazing, I've never had anything like it. They describe it as "Japanese inspired" & that's exactly what it is. It's not your typical sushi place. The service & atmosphere was very welcoming, comfortable while still being very busy. We didn't have reservations & it was a 30 minute wait (well worth it) on a Sunday night. We were served by 4-5 different servers who all were very pleasant, our sushi chef at the bar was spot on. We tried a little bit of everything - all had great, unique flavors. I can't wait to go back & can't wait to send people here. From the hostess & valet to servers & chefs - this place has it going on.
