JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've only had their No.1, the JINJA Tonkatsu Black. The Tonkatsu Black features pork broth, pork chashu, a seasoned egg, nori dried seaweed, and kikurage. This serving of ramen is both hearty and flavorful with bold aromas emanating from the rising steam of the piping hot broth. This particular option is garlic heavy both garlic oil and fried garlic chips; fried onions, and green onions also enhance the flavors, here.
