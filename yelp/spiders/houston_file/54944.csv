Kata Robata////For those comparing Kata Robata and Uchi...I've been to both restaurants frequently, and really they are just too different to compare. Uchi is definitely more innovative, and I would always stick to their hot and cold tastings. Kata Robata's strong suit is definitely its sushi, whereas I would not ever order sushi at Uchi. Just my two cents!
