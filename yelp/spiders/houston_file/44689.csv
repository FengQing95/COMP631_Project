Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My friend and I used to come here at least once a week, and while this review is not about the majority of the food, it is about the fact that the quality of certain products has considerably gone down in the past year. First, the coffee roaster partnership has changed and the coffee is consistently more acidic, the shots aren't well pulled, and the milk isn't properly steamed for the milk drinks (from the past 3 visits). I understand that some baristas may be in training, but there are so many consistently excellent coffee shops in the area that the change is very stark. Second, the macaron size is now smaller, and the texture is inconsistent from flavor to flavor. It is truly a guessing game and chances are that one will be chewy, another crispy, and the third a combination of both. I had the lavender macaron today and it tasted like a drop of lavender essence without any balance to the flavor. This wasn't the case in the past and we used to consider the common bond macaron the best in town.
