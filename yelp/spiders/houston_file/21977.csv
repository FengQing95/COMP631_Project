Uchi////Uchi is one of the best sushi restaurants in Houston.  It's actually fusion sushi, which makes it interesting in a different way.It's in a historic building where the Felix Mexican restaurant formerly was.  It's chef is Tyson Cole, James Beard award winner.  The menu is very imaginative and tasty.  The fried milk dessert was unique and tasty.  The vibe was cool, hip, and happening.  A great place for sushi!
