Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Ever since my first visit, I've been seriously addicted. I never have any self control when it comes to delicious croissants and pastries. I even made sure to come here the morning of my wedding day so I could start the day of with something delicious. I was very concerned about eating as I'm sure I wouldn't have ate anything until dinner that night!
