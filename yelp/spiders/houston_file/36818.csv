Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great vibe and good drinks. The Bosscat burger is awesome, but the short rib Chilaquiles and Chorizo Benedict were descent at best. Pro tip: the carafe of mimosa only ended up filling 7 glasses but costs more than if we just got 8 individual glasses (we had 4 people). Do the math before you order...if you don't want to get ripped off.
