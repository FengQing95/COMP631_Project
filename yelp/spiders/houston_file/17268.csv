JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Showed up just before 10 pm and the place was packed! Expected a 20 minute wait, but it was about half. The waiter was friendly and the food came out in good time considering the amount of people inside. The shrimp tacos aren't too heavy on flavour but are light and yummy. REALLY enjoyed the crispy chicken; it's to die for! My friend got the spicy tuna taco, she enjoyed it, she said I should let y'all know 'this crunchy'.
