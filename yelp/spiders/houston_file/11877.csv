JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Lidia - Thank you for your great review. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay with us, and we thank you for understanding our situation. With hindsight being 20/20, four years ago we would have built a location twice as big had we thought demand for ramen in Houston would be so high. Nevertheless, we are thankful to folks like yourself for dining with us. Thank you again, and we hope to serve you in the near future.
