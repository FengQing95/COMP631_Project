Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////A must visit if you like coffee, pastries or fresh-squeezed orange juice.  I brought a friend from out of town here since he doesn't ever see any bakeries like this living in the country.  We ordered an iced valrhona mocha, small banana nut bread, and kouign amman which is like a butter croissant.  We loved everything.  The prices are a little high at first glance, but I look past it either because some of the portions are large, ingredients are top notch, or it just tastes so damn good.  Atmosphere and scenery is another great reason to come.
