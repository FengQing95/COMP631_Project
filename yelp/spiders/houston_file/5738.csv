JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Every time I come here I love it even more! Great food!! Only issue is the wait time (1hr+ on weekend nights), but it's what I'd expect for a place this great. I usually try to come around lunch time or weekday nights to reduce the wait. Even while waiting, you can sit at the bar or take a walk around the neighborhood. Also, if a seat opens up at the bar, it's full service - order your ramen there!
