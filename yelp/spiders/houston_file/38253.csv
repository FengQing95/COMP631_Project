Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The patties were impossibly thin. I use that word because they were too thin to actually hold together. I assume they were fried in a pan and not on a flat top or a slatted grill because the patties weren't actually burnt as much as they were "crusty." Luckily the flavor of burnt grease was there because the center of the patty that wasn't crusty had no flavor whatsoever.
