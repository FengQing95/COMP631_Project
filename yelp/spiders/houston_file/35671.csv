Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Before I get into what we ordered, I have to mention the restaurant's interior. It's extremely spacious with an open floor concept. The high ceilings and lighting really set a nice ambiance. We originally wanted to sit at the patio, but it was either not for sitting outside, or it was too early and the tables were not set up yet. I'm not sure since it was our first time.
