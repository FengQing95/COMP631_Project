Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////On weekends, don't even try.  There is a line out the door.  I have no idea where the people parked, since the lot is very small and shared with an adjoining business (Space), and always full.  Street parking is dicey, since there is a lot of retail in the area.  At 10:30 a.m. on a week morning, they were already pretty much sold out.  I bought a biraly for 3.25.  There wasn't much onion in the center.  Crust was pretty tough.  Pass on that one. Inside, the tables are crowded together, and it's extremely noisy.  There is one long table down the center of the place for shared seating.  Of course, there were the obligatory squatters on their computers.  The tables are close together, and finding a seat to enjoy your food is iffy.  I didn't try any of their food items.  I suppose I should come again, but the prices are high, and ambiance ranks high as one of the elements of enjoyable eating, in my book.  Pass on this one.
