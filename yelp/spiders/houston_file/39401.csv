Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came here for a birthday brunch on a Saturday. It wasn't too packed and the servers were very attentive considering how large our group was! (About 15 ppl) If you're coming for a boozy brunch, the drinks are pretty expensive. I got there first and the bartenders were all really nice and made me feel welcomed. One of them recommended getting this special irish coffee that he makes that was amazing and tasty! However, it did come out to $15 which was kinda steep.
