JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Very decent ramen in a lovely warehouse hip space.  The octopus balls appetizer is excellent, check out the picture!  So the ramen is above average, the broth is rich and full bodied, but slightly too salty.  Also, they do charge extra for additional ingredients, like an egg.  But their prices are on par with other places.  If you like ramen, try it and then compare it with the Tonkatsu ramen at Kata.
