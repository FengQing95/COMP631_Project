Uchi////Unfortunately, my first experience emptied out my pocket so since then I only go to their Happy Hour (5pm-6:30pm).  But I always order everything on their HH menu and then never skipping out on their fried milk dessert and doubling my order of their eggplant (nasu nigri) aka melt in your mouth deeeliciouness.  Do make sure to flip the eggplant so that it touches your tongue.  You can thank me now because it'll make a wonder of a difference to your taste buds.  :)
