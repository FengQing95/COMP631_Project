Uchi////Despite everyone's friendliness, the service was extremely uneven. I really don't like sitting at a sushi bar because I find slabs of raw fish rather unappetizing (how can you look away?) and it also always seems chaotic, y'know, kinda like sitting in a restaurant's kitchen which some people adore, but I do not. I worked in a sushi restaurant for years and got to watch a master at work, so these days, I prefer to sit at a table to enjoy the conversation of my dining companion, not watch a show. As we didn't have reservations, of course that's where they sat us. I understand that, but it just wasn't an ideal experience for me. Not to mention our waitress announced she was there to take our drink order and give us a spiel about the restaurant and how one orders at the sushi bar, but then left before taking our order. Huh? It had been a trying day and we needed a damn drink. About five minutes later, she returned to take our drink order as the sushi chef took our food order and misunderstandings ensued. It's a bit of a pricey place and I think this kind of confusing experience while giving an order is just not ideal for anyone.
