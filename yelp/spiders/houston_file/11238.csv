JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Our flight was delayed, so we got to Houston very late, hungry and this was one of the only places open at the late. We had our 8 year old with us. The place was pretty busy after the pride parade, but they still managed to get us a table pretty quickly after I explained our situation. Â
