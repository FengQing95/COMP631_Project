JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The seating area in the dinning room had large multi-party dining tables in the center and combined table/booths along the periphery. Our party ordered different dishes which I enjoyed sampling; all of them so yummy! We split a 10 piece crispy chicken appetizer, the batter perfectly fried and tasty, and I noticed many other tables around us ordering it as well. I ordered the Cha Cha Cha-For Garlic Lovers which definitely was garlic infused but is not too overpowering. The pork chashu that comes with it was the best part; it simply melted in your mouth! It also comes with seasoned egg which was okay (this is usually my favorite part, but this was not the best egg I have ever had). My husband enjoyed his Spicy Umami Miso ramen which had the right amount of heat without taking away from the other flavors (he usually enjoys things very spicy). Another person in our group had a Tonkotsu bowel and his choice of adding extra butter was an excellent idea.
