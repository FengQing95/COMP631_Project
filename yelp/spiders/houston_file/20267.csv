Uchi////We arrived and put our names in, table for 2, and were told the wait was about a hour and 15 mins..eek....we sat out on the adorable patio and had some wine & peppers while we waited. The peppers btw are a gamble, some are super spicy and some are not so if you want a little adventure give them a try. Â The servers come around and give you "tastings from the kitchen" while you wait which is awesome. About 45 mins later we had a spot at the sushi bar.
