Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////If you are looking for a relaxing brunch, I would suggest coming on a week day. Snooze brings out the brunch beasts on the weekend and brunch brings out the B in people. Parking and waiting is intense; as others have mentioned wait times range from 1-2 hours. The wait was 1 hour by 10 AM on Sunday. We managed to grab some seats by the bar, which are first come first serve. (despite being mean mugged by another couple that wanted the seats too)
