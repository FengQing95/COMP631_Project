JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi John - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry you did not enjoy our ramen. If you're ever dissatisfied with our food for any reason, please let your server know so he or she can offer something else or remove it from your tab. Otherwise, can you provide more specific details as to why you felt our food was "disgusting"? We work very hard to provide a quality product that a large majority of Houstonians and visitors to Houston seem to enjoy. So whenever we miss the mark with a patron, our livelihood depends on finding out what was wrong. On behalf of our entire staff, we thank you for your feedback.
