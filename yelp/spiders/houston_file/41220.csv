Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Loved this place!  The French toast is ON POINT!   And there is enough to share.  The tomatoes soup is thick and flavorful. I added a carmelized bialy with it and it took the soup to the next level.  Get there early as it is crowded on Saturdays and pastries sell out.
