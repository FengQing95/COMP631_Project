JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I am not a huge fan of pork, which is sometimes problematic when trying to order ramen at other restaurants. However, Jinya has a great variety of chicken and plant-based broths. I usually get the chicken ramen dishes because the broth is extremely savory without being too heavy (unlike many pork broths, in my opinion). I also love how Jinya has a large array of customizable add-ons and spice levels. Due to its immense popularity, I recently tried the Jinya Bun as an appetizer. Although it was very flavorful and momentarily pleasing, it was way too heavy and fatty for my preference. It caused me to be far too full to enjoy my ramen.
