Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is literally the best brunch I've ever had. Yes parking is horrible and you need to plan to wait over an hour, BUT IT'S SO WORTH IT. We had the Benny Duo: one with pulled pork and the other was the prosciutto and arugula and both were amazing! I loved being able to try both. We also split the pancake trio with chocolate chip, blueberry, and the "pancake of the day" which had corn, cheddar, bacon, and jalape√±o. I am so sad this is not a standard menu item because it was delicious!!!! We will absolutely be back to try more! I hope they open more locations soon!
