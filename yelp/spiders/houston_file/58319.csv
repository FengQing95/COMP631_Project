Baby Barnaby's////I been to this location a few times but I'll never go again after my experience yesterday. I had friends in town for a football game and I thought this would be a great place to have brunch. Â We signed in and waited in line like everybody else. The line was moving fast, so we moved to the front. Once we got there, the "hostess - tall caucasian male" called a name. We weren't sure if he said Sam or Saen so we asked and got some attitude back. We continue waiting, he came back and asked us to stay on our right side and let people walked by (again, he wasn't not nice about it). We did as he asked but it wasn't enough. He asked us to move back. We started walking and he shout "Vamos, Vamos, andele!" We were a group of 6 Hispanic young professionals and he assumed that was the proper way to communicate with us. Wrong!! Half of our party doesn't speak Spanish and aren't Mexican. What he did was rude, racist, and 100% uncalled for. We will never go back to this facility and we hope the management takes care of this individual's poor behavior.
