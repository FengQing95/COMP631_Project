Kata Robata////Oh. My. God. Kata Robata was my first sushi experience, and now that I've been around the block a few times I can say with certainty that this place is extremely high-quality. I very much seafood, so I am not very hard to please, but my absolute favorites are the fatty tuna, the hamachi, and the anago.
