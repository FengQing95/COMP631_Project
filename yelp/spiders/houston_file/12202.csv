JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food was good. Nice taste and the beer was cold. The prices are a bit steep. It was $80 for three beers, two small plates and two bowls of soup. Not exactly an inexpensive meal when considering it was soup. But was a good meal and the draft beer is good. The ingredients are nice. The meat was well seasoned and the soup base was true to the menu.
