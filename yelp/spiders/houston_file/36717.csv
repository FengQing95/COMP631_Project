Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Second time I've visited this location and absolutely love!! Terry was an absolute dream. So charming, fun, and attentive. Visited with girlfriends and just looking for a casual place to grab a few drinks. DJ on Friday was fantastic. Played perfect mix of current and old school music. Love the environment and will definitely be back.
