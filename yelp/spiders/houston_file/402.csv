JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jennifer - I'm sorry you and your husband did not have a pleasant dining experience at JINYA. Our seating arrangements were designed with several factors in mind: efficiency, ergonomics, traditional Japanese decor and traditional Japanese (ramen) dining practices. JINYA Ramen Bar Houston is a franchise concept, which means every last detail of our restaurant was determined in advance by the JINYA corporation, which is headquartered in Los Angeles. The founder of JINYA is Japanese and has designed nearly all of the franchises in a similar fashion.
