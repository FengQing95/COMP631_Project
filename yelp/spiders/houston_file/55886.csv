Kata Robata////Came here for my birthday dinner with my family! My brother and I had the omakase. Unfortunately, since there were five of us, we had to sit at a table and not the sushi bar. I'm the total sushi bar type, but a "Bye Felicia" to my family for my birthday seemed a bit rude... especially since they were paying LOL.
