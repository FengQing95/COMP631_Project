Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Peanut Butter Chocolate Cupcake - The frosting was sprinkled with cocoa nibs, I think there may be a little sprinkling of fleur de sel as well. Â I certainly had a hell of a time peeling off the thick liner that encircled the cupcake. It's perfect if you're going to eat out of the liner, but I wanted to see the actual cupcake. The frosting is most likely an italian meringue buttercream whipped to an airy perfection with just the right amount of peanut butter. I prefer italian meringue buttercream because it's not so gritty and never too sweet. I'm over the cupcake craze but this was the best cupcake I've ever had. The chocolate cupcake was so moist and paired with the peanut butter frosting, it practically melted together in my mouth. I don't think I can ever go back to any other cupcakery, ever.
