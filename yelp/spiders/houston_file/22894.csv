Uchi////I realize eating sushi from to-go boxes in the car is NOT the ideal way to consume it. Especially from a high-end place like Uchi. But that being said -Â we literally were given our food, walked 24 steps to the car, sat down, and ate it. I don't think it would have tasted much different from inside the building. The only difference was that it as hard to differentiate what each roll was, without a waiter's help. We basically just ordered everything from the review highlights, and played the guessing game as to which was which.
