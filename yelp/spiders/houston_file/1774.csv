JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Let me clarify by saying that, if I could give partial stars, I'd give Jinya a 3 1/2 or 3 Â 1/4. I had a craving from ramen and decided to find the nearest place to campus to get my fix, that place ended up being Jinya. After a quick glance at the reviews, I decided to give it a chance. I ordered the Jinya #1 (the Tonkotsu Black) with the suggested accompaniments (corn and a spicy ground pork). The ramen itself was quite good, the broth a nice mixture of spicy, salty, and savory. My one complaint is that they added too much corn to the soup; while a nice compliment, the corn's strong flavor overwhelmed some of the broth's subtler flavors.
