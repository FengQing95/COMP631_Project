Kata Robata////The maitre d was terrible. We stood for 45 minutes,with three booths, open and were not seated. It smelled funky. When we were seated, our waitress was nice. But, we ordered scallops and never received them. Yes, we reminded her three times. Two hours later and no scallops. I ordered a Pinot Grigio, to pass the time, and they brought me a Chardonnay. Maybe, that is not a big deal but I feel like we worked extra hard to pay for a "big ticket" dinner. Â Not returning. Glorified bar.
