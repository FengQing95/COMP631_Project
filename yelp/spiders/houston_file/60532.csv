Baby Barnaby's////We got to the cafe and was able to find parking pretty quickly as it is all street parking. It was packed which was expected due to the awesome reviews and the time of the hour. We quickly found out that we just had to put our names down ourselves and just wait to be called. The wait was pretty quick too and we were seated at a booth inside in about 10mins. This place also has a patio and just to note..it is dog-friendly. I love the idea of this even though I don't have a dog..I love restaurants that are so accommodating!
