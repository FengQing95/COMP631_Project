Uchi////For a restaurant in this price range, we were a little bit disappointed. We went in as a party of four, and we all ordered the tasting menu. We had made a reservation before we went, and the table that we were put on was right next to the front door. People constantly opened and shut the door and two people in our party were blew by the air and it was quite cold in December. For the tasting menu, this was the first restaurant that I've ever been that grouped up four ppl's order into same plate to serve, which was fine with me but the portion in each plate, which was meant to serve four, was really small. Another thing was that we felt very rushy eating as the plates/courses were coming up one after another almost every other minute, except for the last course dessert, which literally took them forever to bring it up. As for the food, they were decent and mostly fusion-style - I would have expected a few more creations. Their fish was very fresh so the sashimis and nigiris were yum. I would recommend the cold dishes from this place than the hot ones.
