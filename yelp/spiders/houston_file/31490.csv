Local Foods////Oh yum. This restaurant has ALL my favorite qualities: fresh fresh vegetables, lots of vegetarian options, locally grown everything, fresh brewed iced tea, locally made baked goods, clean, spare, fancy-European-farmhouse decor, communal tables, waiters with moustaches.... Don't laugh at me; I was in heaven.
