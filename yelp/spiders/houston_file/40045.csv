Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Had a boss meal at Bosscat and I want to tell you all about it.  Came here to celebrate a birthday.  Reservations were made and our table was ready when we got there.  Parking was easy, but you also have the option to valet.  We were immediately seated and Cristobal was our waiter.  He took excellent care of us and made sure the birthday gal was well taken care of.  We had trouble choosing from all the choices and he lead our group to all the right decisions.
