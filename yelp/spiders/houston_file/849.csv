JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Don't really get how this place has such good reviews. The broth lacks the well developed flavors of a good ramen. Honestly it tasted like they took an instant ramen packet and then squirted sriracha into it. The egg was really over-done, the yolk was completely set and dry. We sat at the ramen bar and it really looked pretty messy and you could see things caked on the surfaces of the equipment. After having tried plenty of good ramen in Japan I wouldn't come back here.
