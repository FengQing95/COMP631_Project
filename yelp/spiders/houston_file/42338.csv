Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I decided to do a sampling of a few macarons, so I ordered one of each of the salted caramel, vanilla, peanut butter & jelly, and pistachio. Immediately upon setting the dessert out in my parents' kitchen, my mom and dad split the salted caramel in two and dove in before I could blink (so I have no idea what it tasted like...probably a combination of salt and caramel if I were to wager a bet). According to them it was amazing. The other three were delightful. I loved the quirky playfulness of the peanut butter and jelly macaron, the vanilla macaron was simple but satisfying, and the nutty sweetness of the pistachio macaron sent me through the roof. The outer cookie (cookie? biscuit? insert fancy French word here?) parts of the macarons were lightly crisped on the outside, but like clouds on the inside, and the inner filling was perfect and not at all overpowering.
