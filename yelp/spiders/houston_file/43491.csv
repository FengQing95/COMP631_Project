Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Now for the customer service - I didn't expect to write about this but I have to make mention of what the folks at Common Bond did to make my experience a positive one. They were having difficulties with their internet and printing out orders, and my order got deleted somehow in the mix and I was left waiting for 20 minutes without food. To make up their mistake, they served me my entire meal for free AND let me choose a pastry to go on my way out. I had a kouign amann, a pastry I never had before and can't wait to have it again. I will definitely return to Common Bond again!
