Uchi////Went here for a celebratory dinner on a Friday. The bar was packed but the bartenders were attentive and answered whatever questions we had. We ordered Saki wine. I'm not a huge fan, but the rest of my party loved it. Our waiter was awesome (wish I could remember his name). The main attraction is the food (Obviously!) We had a little bit of an idea of what we wanted but wanted to sample everything. We did the "chef's special" but out waiter kind of customized it to our taste. Everything was perfect and got progressively better as the night went on. The waiter explained everything they were serving and explained how to eat it. I loved everything with yellow tail. In particular, "hama chili" was very good. It was light and citrus-y. We also had "Hot Rock" and "Short Rib" (WOW). The meats were DELICIOUS! At first it felt like one taste wasn't going to be enough, but by the end of the night we were stuffed. This place is an experience but be prepared to spend a lot. You get what you pay for though! Definitely recommend for date night or a special occasion.
