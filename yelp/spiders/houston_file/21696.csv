Uchi////This is my favorite sushi spot. Hands down! But, I'm not surprised because all great restaurants get their start in Austin. Uchi's no different! It can be a bit pricey though, so if you're going to try it, you should go to happy hour. There are deals you cannot beat! And, get there early because the line will be wrapped around the building! My favorite thing on the menu is the ham and eggs roll... delightful!
