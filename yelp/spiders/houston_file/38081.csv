Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////One thing I've always found difficult is finding a proper libations locale in the Galleria/Sharpstown coming up 59 from Sugar Land. Whether divey or upscale, the options are limited. Because of that, stumbling upon Bosscat was a welcome development. It's still ITL, but it's at least a few minutes worth of time savings.
