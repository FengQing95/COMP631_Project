Local Foods////I'm not really a sandwich person which is why I have been putting off. Visiting this place for years. Everything I want to eat in life while searching through Google or Yelp this place pops up. It seems I can't escape this place so I gave up and last week when it popped in a Thrillist I made the drive over.
