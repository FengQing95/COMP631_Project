Baby Barnaby's////My mom got the ribeye and eggs, which I must say is not actually a ribeye steak... its more like a think flank steak. Good none the less, but it aint no ribeye. We shared one of the blueberry pancakes, yum! Fresh blueberries were delicious, it came out just right. I had the green eggs which came with that fantastic chicken apple sausage, toast, and these potato things. The eggs were delish, sausage was great which is a big deal for me considering I don't really like sausage, toast was toast, but those potato home fries/tator tots/hash brown thingies were just not that great to me.
