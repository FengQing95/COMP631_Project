Baby Barnaby's////Disappointing first time visit. Was Saturday 10am,  short wait for a table, no problem. Waited on and ordered. Later, a couple sat next to us and the man ordered same meal as me. We waited 45 min for ch fried steak/eggs. That couple got served, ate and finished before we even got our food. Had to complain by then. Food came at 11. Steak was ok, eggs were runny and undercooked. Wanted breakfast,  not lunch.
