Kata Robata////I guess this place is usually packed late on the weekends.  Lucky enough we we were able to snag a parking spot at 6:30 p.m. on a Friday night.  Seen a lot of great reviews on this place so wanted to try it out.  I didn't know that they even took reservations for 2...interesting.  We were promptly seated.  Atmosphere is pretty loud with all the chitter chatter, but not so loud that you are having to shout to talk.  Maybe because there's no background music to drown you out.  I just hate restaurants like that.  Anyways...I had a Lychee Martini which wasn't on the menu, but that sucker ended up being $12...a bit pricey? Hell yes!  The bf had crown on the rocks which was only $6 so I guess it balances out a little.
