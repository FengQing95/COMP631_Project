Baby Barnaby's////Luckily there was no parking at the Zoo on Friday so it was decided to have breakfast.  13 minutes from the zoo it was the best decision ever!  Everything from the food quality, taste and presentation, service and friendly warm atmosphere was amazing!  They have fresh squeezed OJ that's so delicious and refreshing.  Their portions are more then enough and everything as cooked to perfection with their buttery eggs and flavorful bacon, their French toast was on point so so delicious I ate every bite.  I just couldn't stop taking about this place it was amazing.  Kudos to the chef and kitchen staff as well as the servers for doing such an amazing job!  Seating inside is snug but you can always opt to sit outside if your claustrophobic.  We sat inside and felt where we sat we had plenty of space.  LOVED everything about Baby Barnaby's and can't wait to be back soon!
