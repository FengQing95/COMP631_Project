Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've never been a fan of driving into the city for brunch but this place completely changed my mind. I can see why it's always packed on Sunday mornings. The coffee here is pretty standard but it's the food that makes the drive worth it. My pastry of choice was the original croissant but I also ordered a breakfast sandwich cause big boy's gotta eat! The food was amazing. I would recommend it to anyone who's willing to spend a little extra for quality. It may be crowded so prepare for a lively atmosphere!
