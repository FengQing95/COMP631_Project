Uchi////Can't compare the original Austin location because that place is my favorite. But this is just as good! If you like avocado rolls, you have to try it here because they have the best avocado rolls in Houston! I usually get like 2-3 orders. Also have to try the brussels sprouts and the shishito peppers.
