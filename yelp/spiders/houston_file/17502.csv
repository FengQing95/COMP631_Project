Uchi////Ok, so uchi has a ton of reviews here but here we go. Having waited for a special occasion (and babysitter) to get a reservation for uchi, my hubby and I finally had a chance to go.  We had a mix of raw and cooked food off of the happy hour and regular menu mostly chosen by staff. This was definitely the way to go. I loved the sushi and rolls. The only suggestion I wish they would heed is to take a cue from their diners and not bring new food while you are still trying to enjoy the previous dishes! I've never been anywhere of this quality that messed up the service like this. We definitely felt quite rushed and although I know full well that sushi amounts to a quick dinner when you are trying to savor your food you don't want to be rushed and pressured this much. Also, I swore they asked me three times if I wanted another sake. There is a difference between attentive and pushy service and this was pushy and not aligned with the place. Made me feel like they were desperate to get us out of there.  This definitely affected the experience for me and I couldn't fully relax which kinda stunk because we don't get to go out much and we were trying to celebrate a special occasion.  I especially didn't appreciate that although our main waiter caught the hint that their pacing was messed up when we had almost 3 dishes sitting almost untouched on our table and asked us if the pacing was ok, they still rushed us ! No, the pacing wasn't ok, thanks for asking and then pretending you'd fix the pacing which didn't really happen. I loved their food but the next time we have a chance to go out, I'm pretty sure it won't be our first pick. I feel like they have gotten so popular that they feel they can serve you any way they like.
