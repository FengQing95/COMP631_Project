Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Indya is the manager-hostess and she is amazing. Since Covid I come here 2-3 times a week. Staff and service excellent. By all means join the waitlist on their web site. You can see in advance. I do it from bed when I awaken and calculate my arrival time since the app counts down for you. Indya makes sure she sees me and seats me from waitlist. Exceptional pancakes. Snooze classic option good value. Fancy coffees and juices. Love it with the spacing-before pandemic it was too loud and busy for me. Now it's more zen.
