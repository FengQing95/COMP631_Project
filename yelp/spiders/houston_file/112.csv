Uchi////Excellent, excellent, excellent!  Here on business and Uchi was shown to  be highly rated so gave it a shot.  It did not disappoint.  Our "master of ceremony"...Ryfu...(Ryan F) waxed poetic as he led us through the menu and it's nuances.  The choices were eclectic and amazing.  Just order anything with pork belly...yum!
