JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Located in Midtown, where parking is always a struggle, I think that Jinya did well since they have a 3 story parking garage located behind their restaurant that they share with other restaurants. Just look for the sign which shows all the restaurants participating, and Jinya will be one of them. There is complimentary valet parking or self parking for the second and third floors. We didn't bother with valet parking, since the valet driver wasn't too keen on parking our car. Best not to waste my tip on that guy. Anyway, once you park, you might have to ask a couple of people how to get out and reach the restaurant. We took the stairs down and came out around the corner not too far from Jinya. It's located right next to Piola and a seafood restaurant. Gonna have to try these other two restaurants later.
