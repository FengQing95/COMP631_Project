Uchi////The part that always stays with me, though, is how passionate each server is about each dish. Without fail, you will get several people running food to your table, and each will present it with the flawless aplomb of a museum tour guide expounding upon the virtues of the work of art in front of you. I love that, and it's definitely what sets Uchi apart from the crowded dining scene in Houston.
