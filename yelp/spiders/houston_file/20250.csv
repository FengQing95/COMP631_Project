Uchi////I was so impressed with this place! The food was amazing, happy hour prices were friendly to my pocketbook, the service was outstanding, and the ambiance pleasing and trendy. The best part about this place was the waitstaff; the presentation of the food was accompanied by a very tasty description of each dish, detailed in such a way that my mouth was watering just listening to it! I LOVE this place.
