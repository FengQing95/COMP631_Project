Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I obviously thought Common Bond would blow all the other cookies out of the water. See my previous boastful review. But it seems my peers in the 2014 Cookie Crawl do not agree. The texture of the added walnuts threw them off, and it wasn't soft nor gooey enough for them. I'll admit, I typically don't enjoy nuts in my cookies, but in this case, I didn't mind.
