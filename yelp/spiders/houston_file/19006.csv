Uchi////Uchi is a foodies dream come true! They have a menu that somewhat changes daily as well as staple items that they always have on their menu. If you are a fan of fresh raw fish then this place is for you. We tried a couple of their traditional Sushi rolls and they were excellent. Not much of a difference then other Sushi places. Where UCHI shines is with their sashimi and raw dishes. The fish they use is so fresh and you can tell the difference in quality then other Sushi places around Houston. Drink menu is great and it is a great place to come with clients or large groups just be sure to make a reservation. The deserts are phenomenal. Be sure to try the fried milk!
