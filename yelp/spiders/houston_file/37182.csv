Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This was the first time visiting. The hostess seated us right away, it was close to the main door and it was cold because of everyone coming in and out. The waiter came right away and asked for our drink order, he explained the special of the day. We opted for the special, New York strip with long green beans, Mac and cheese, salad and bread, everything was great except for the cold air coming through the door. The parking was a little bit of hassle unless you went with Valet parking. The restaurant was a little hard to find, all they had was a large B on outside of the building until you got to the front door and there was the name of the restaurant, it was in a strip with other businesses. We will come back.
