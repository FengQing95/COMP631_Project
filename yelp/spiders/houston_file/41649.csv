Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Service is also quite spotty, probably due to their crazy ordering and delivery system.  Needing to ask for cups for water.  Needing to ask for silverware.  Needing to get one's own silverware after having asked.  Needing to reach over other people to get to the silverware.  Get the picture?  Yes, that's Common Bond, a little bit of France right in Houston.
