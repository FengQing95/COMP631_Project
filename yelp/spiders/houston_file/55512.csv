Kata Robata////My favorite dish here was the 72 hr slow cooked beef skewer. It was heavenly and I don't think I've ever had better steak anywhere else... The dishes are very small portioned but I guess that's the selling point. It's not enough to fill you up but leaves you wanting to try more and more!
