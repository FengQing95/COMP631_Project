JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I opted for the thick noodles thanks to Yelp reviewers and boy, am I glad I did! It was filling and savory without putting me into a deep msg-ridden slumber afterwards. The soft pork and whole seasoned egg were perfection. I know some reviewers didn't care for the whole uncut egg, but I am an egg fiend and didn't mind it at all.
