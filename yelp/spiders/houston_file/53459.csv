Kata Robata////The real winner of the night was their black sesame panna cotta (offered before and during the holidays). This was so freakin' delish. It topped the meal off perfectly since it wasn't heavy at all, and it wasn't too sweet! The serving size was pretty small... about the size of my palm. It was topped with mango sorbet, candied sesame, sesame oil and ginger foam. This was definitely one of my favorite items of the night.
