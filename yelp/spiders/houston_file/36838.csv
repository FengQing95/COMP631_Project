Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////as soon I left this review the owner came up to me and very graciously consulted me on the exact details of why the food was the way I explained it. He compensated our meal and was extremely gracious and kind and explaining that they have different menus that they're trying out and he urged us to come back and try again so we definitely well. Again incredible service and great drinks.
