The Pit Room////So run down, order at the counter cafeteria style, they have bottled beer and a few drafts, Mac and cheese and beans looks like their main sides;x I didn't come for the sides though, as well as tacos, chips and salsa or queso, and a few other things.  The place is plenty big; I'd guess room for 100 to sit and eat, and the parking was easy both times I've been.  All the BBQ has a great crust, think salt and pepper and not sweet; just the way I like it.
