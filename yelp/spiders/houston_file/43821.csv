Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Dropped by Common Bond on my way out of town to grab a quick bite. The line was long and parking was scarce. BUT, the line moved quickly and the food was worth it. They have a fun assortment of pastries and desserts. I had the spinach quiche with a mimosa. Definitely worth the wait. Get there early! Staff was friendly. Would be a good place for meeting up for brunch with friends.
