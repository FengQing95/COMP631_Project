Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'm obsessed with Common Bond! I love its simple modernity, the way the smell of freshly-baked bread hits you as soon as you enter, the ample amount of indoor and outdoor seating; and, most importantly, the delicious food. The boo and I came a little while back and enjoyed the following: Fig and Prosciutto Tartine; Beet, Orange, and Goat Cheese Salad; Fruit Tart; and Orange Juice. The portions looked delicate, but were filling. Aside from the freshly squeezed orange juice, which was tiny. Everything in the tartine and salad was perfectly portioned. The tartine featured delicious jam, and the brie, prosciutto, and arugula went so well together. The salad had just the right amount of beets and goat cheese, and very delicate crunchy things. And the fruit tarts! The pastry dough was delightfully crunchy and the cream with fruit had a balanced sweetness (and they keep well in the fridge). Can't wait to come back again!
