Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////As far as the actual product, the cake was tasty, but I went with simple vanilla buttercream since it was also for a baby. I bet their other flavors are better! The confetti cupcakes were actually fluffier and better in my opinion. I prefer fluffier versus the denser vanilla. I also think keeping the cakes in the fridge overnight might have compromised some of the flavor, but everything was really delicious!
