Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Did not find Snooze to be the destination dining breakfast spot that others make it out to be.  Cute place once you get in.  But once you find parking and stand outside waiting or playing cornhole, you could be in and out of many places with better food.  Just not worth the hassle.  And we were there pretty early.  Can't imagine folks that get there after 9 or so waiting in the Houston heat.
