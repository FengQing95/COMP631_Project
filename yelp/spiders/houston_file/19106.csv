Uchi////Great option for Japanese in Houston.  It's very inventive and the dishes are very fresh.  My favorite things were not sushi at this restaurant.  The Omakase is a great way to try the different dishes.  We loved every single preparation of raw fish.  Omakase is not the best way to try their sushi, I think we'll need a return visit to have a better informed decision on the sushi.  The fried milk dessert was ok... nothing to write home about.  We preferred the special dessert of the day consisting of fresh strawberries.
