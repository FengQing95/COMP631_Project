JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Visited 2 years after my last visit, great fresh food, attentive service, no wait on a Thursday night. Their watermelon delight is delish to start with. I would recommend the jinya chicken ramen, its creamy, I like to add the Hot Sauce you'll find it on the table, and add to my liking. Or you can you ask for hot, spicy, mild, inferno, etc.
