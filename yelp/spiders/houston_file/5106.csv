JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////She ordered the chicken teriyaki with a few pieces of fresh sushi, while I chose the ramen with several pieces of salmon and yellowtail. Ramen was pretty good, but the broth could have used a bit more depth and complexity of flavor (to contrast, Kata Robata does this flawlessly and that's where I normally go for ramen). It seemed as if I literally only had two small pieces of pork in the entire bowl, but it wasn't bad.  Coworker liked all of her food very much, so that was a plus, particularly for someone who had never before tasted raw fish.  The salmon and yellowtail Nigiri were both of good quality, however the rice fell apart on practically every piece as soon as I picked them up, and the rice itself could use quite a bit of work. A sweeter, top-quality sushi rice more densely packed together would have vastly improved the flavor, in my opinion.
