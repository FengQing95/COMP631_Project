Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We tried so many things on our first go here.  We had that fluffy oddly named buttery piece of bread that they are famous for, an apple dessert, a passion fruit dessert, a cookie, coffee, and a cupcake.  All of it was good.  It was so good, that they will from here on out be the bench by which I measure other bakeries.  To top that off, their coffee was even impressive!  I had a straight espresso shot to cut through some of the sweetness of the food I was eating, and it was an incredible pull.  They have talented Chefs and Baristas at this locale and I highly recommend it.
