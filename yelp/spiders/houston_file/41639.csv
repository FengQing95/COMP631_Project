Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Ok, so the macarons, fruit tart, and oatmeal raisin cookies are the most delicious desserts I have ever had. This is after returning from Paris, eating Pierre Herme macarons! I want to go and try EVERYTHING now! AND keep in mind that I did not eat these at the store, they were brought back by a friend so I'm eating refrigerated desserts! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh soooo good! The oatmeal cookie is so soft, buttery, and filled with raisin goodness. The fruit tart is beyond any other fruit tart in Houston. I can't even describe the macarons. My favorite is going to be the lemon and pbj. I want more!
