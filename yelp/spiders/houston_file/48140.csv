Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food: The food was amazing. I got the pancake trio (peach cobbler, blueberry danish and the monte cristo). My husband got the Benny with the salmon and cream cheese. We devoured it. Also, bacon....you haven't had bacon until you've had their bacon. That's all I'll say about that! I also like the fact that they get most of their ingredients locally. I think the price is reasonable for the quality of food you get. Portions were perfect.
