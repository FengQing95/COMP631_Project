JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Bethany - Thank you for your great review. I'm glad you enjoyed your experience with us, and we appreciate your kind words. In the coming months, we plan to open more locations in the greater Houston area, which we hope will alleviate some of the wait times at Midtown. Otherwise, on behalf of our entire staff, we thank you for your patronage, and we look forward to serving you again soon!
