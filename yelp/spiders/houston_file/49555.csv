Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Such an awesome experience this AM! We sat at the bar and the service and food were both amazing! Valerie and the other bartender were attentive, friendly, and extremely accommodating! There was a "customer" that become extremely irate and rude over a glass of water and they handles themselves professionally and appropriately even though I can't say the same for this person they were dealing with! I would highly recommend this location!!
