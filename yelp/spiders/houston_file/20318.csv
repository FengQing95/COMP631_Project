Uchi////As lots of my friends love this place and said so many good things about this place, we finally come try it today during the happy hour. The service is great, our waitress is very attentive and even gave us a free appetizer since it's our first time and the whole restaurant has a very modern/hipster/chic vibe. However when it comes to food, it is a little bit less satisfying. The crunch spicy tuna roll and shrimp tempura are my favorite which are good but not mind blowing (maybe we have too high of expectations before coming here) but honestly you can get food of safe quality in lots of other Japanese restaurants here with lower price but I get it that you are paying for the vibe and experience, not just food. The eggplant thing and wulu wulu (a type of fish) are not bad but again not that amazing. The portion is extremely small but well it's goumet so we understand. The Brussels sprouts and cauliflower are the ones that really disappoint me. Our waitress told us the Brussels sprouts is the most fav item on the menu but it has such strong vinegar flavor I had to drink water immediately after eating them otherwise I'll start coughing like crazy in such a nice restaurant. The cauliflower is also very very greasy and heavy since if maybe fried in some cheese sauces so it make you really feel uncomfortable after eating a few (the portion is very good tho). I'm no Japanese food/goumet expert but I've had tried good Japanese food in Shanghai, Paris and Tokyo and they are all very delicate and easy for your stomach, even if it's fried food. I think the whole philosophy of Japanese food is it's delicacy. So I don't know if it's because I ordered the wrong food or just had too high of an expectation, I had to say this experience is kinda disappointed. In summary 5 stars for the service 3 stars for the food and 5 stars for the vibe.
