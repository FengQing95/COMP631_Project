Baby Barnaby's////I had the corned beef hash and eggs (something I love and haven't found since leaving California...homemade, that is...not the Hormel junk).  Served in an individual cast-iron skillet (awesometown), it was an amazing breakfast.  I didn't like the potatoes cut into squares and then fried.  That detracted from the overall taste of the hash only because they were pretty greasy.
