Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So why is this a 3 star review? If you plan to go on a weekend parking will be a chore and you may not be able to park in either of their 2 assigned lots. Once you manage to park the wait will likely be 15+ minutes, sometimes up to 30 for just a quick pastry or 2 to go. I'm not sure what the answer is since they are tight on space, but I can't imagine another register during the crazy busy weekends would hurt.
