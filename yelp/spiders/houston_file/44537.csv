Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The coffee is strong and the almond crossaint was not tender and flaky. I have had delicious tender flaky almond croissants elsewhere and this place cannot compare. I also tried the cranberry scone and again I have had better ones elsewhere. They aren't horrible here but not something I would come back for. The strawberry shortcake and macaroons were great though. The place is small, long lines and seating is limited. They have either bar type seating or 2 and 4 seater square tables.
