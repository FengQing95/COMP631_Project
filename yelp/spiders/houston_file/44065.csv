Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////For brunch, we had almond croissant, warm cappuccino, and the andouille dish (forgot the name!). I didn't care too much for the savory dish...it was very meaty and heavy. But man oh man that almond croissant was insanely good and complimented with a sip of that cappuccino...perfection! I recently had a study session at a nearby coffee shop and couldn't help myself from stopping at Common Bond. I got the $3 chocolate chip cookie. It was super dense, soft, filled with chocolate chunks and walnuts(?). Sooo good... Although mostly everything here is pricey, there is no substitution for the pastries they offer!
