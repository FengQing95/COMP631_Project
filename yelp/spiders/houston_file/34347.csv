Local Foods////I am assuming they used local ingredients to make their food which is a great concept. What makes this place great is the pricing of their food because most places that use local ingredients are expensive and doesn't justify for the price. We came in around 1 PM and there was a small wait to the cashier. I ordered duck confit while my boyfriend had the crunchy chicken as well as two local beers.
