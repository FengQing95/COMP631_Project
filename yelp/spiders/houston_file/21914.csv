Uchi////I had their hamachi yellowtail CUT roll and their Wagyu beef (cooked) CUT roll.  Can't remember the names of those two dishes but the ingredients list really made me wonder what I was getting myself into.  Seriously..... it was like diving off a cliff with no parachute!  I despise ordering something strange/foreign to me and then having them take it back.  It pains me, not because I feel sorry for the restaurant but that I feel sorry for myself.  The wait, the worry..... thinking "they are gonna spit in my food now".....
