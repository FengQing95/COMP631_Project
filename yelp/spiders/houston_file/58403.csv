Baby Barnaby's////questionably best breakfast in town. the wait can suck sometimes, but excellent, excellent food, great migas as Ashley said in her review, great pancakes, great fresh squeezed orange juice. excellent staff most of whom have worked there a long time. if want to avoid the lines, try on a week day. great spot
