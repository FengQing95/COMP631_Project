Kata Robata////At first i wondered if Houston could do sushi since they're so known for their meat and being landlocked... Boy was I wrong! While I might have been lucky and Yelped an amazing place. This place was above and beyond regarding service, food, quality and atmosphere. I enjoyed every minute of my meal and can't wait to go back again next time i'm in town!!!
