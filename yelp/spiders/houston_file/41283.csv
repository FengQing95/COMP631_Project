Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I had a cup of soup with a side of baguette and a cup of drip coffee. The baguette was good, the soup was tomato bisque and had a nice texture and had a nice level of spice but wasn't really rich in tomato flavor. It was okay but I didn't find it particularly special. The drip coffee was strong, which I like, but it was also really bitter from sitting in a heated unit, and I was surprised that they didn't have another roast option. I normally drink my coffee black but had to cut the taste with milk. I'm sure it's better first thing in the morning.
