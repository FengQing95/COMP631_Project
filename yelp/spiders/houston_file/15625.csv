JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We were staring at the servers, trying to Jedi-mind-trick someone into paying attention to us; but most were standing around in the back, one on a phone, others chatting. I have no objection to any server social time, I was a server for years, I like happy servers and laid back attitude, but this was out right neglect and willful laissez-faire towards customers. (There is a general attitude that they don't give a crap about customers; quantity trumps quality when it comes to how they get their tips and really couldn't care less.)
