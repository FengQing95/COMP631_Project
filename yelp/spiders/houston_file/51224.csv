Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Must go place for brunch. Try and get here early because you will wait but the food is worth it. We got the shrimp and grits and a flight of pancakes and we were not disappointed. Pancakes were light and fluffy and super tasty. Grits were creamy and so delicious. Also like that you can put your name on the wait list and they will send you a text when your table is ready.
