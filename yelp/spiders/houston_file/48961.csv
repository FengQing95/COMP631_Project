Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We ordered the Benny Duo, one of the few places, I have seen them offer two selections, because I have been torn many times in the past.  Chilaquiles Benedict and the Chile Verde Benny.  In all honesty, I screwed up.  I didn't read past the first sentence, so didn't realize both of these were going to be served on tortillas instead of english muffins.  Now I have to come back to try their other bases.  However, their twist was excellent.  Just by doing the duo, I was going to get to try 2 different samplings, but in the end I had two similar experiences, even though both good, defeated my original goal.
