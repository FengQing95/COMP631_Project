The Pit Room////Excellent BBQ restaurant. The brisket and pork ribs were tender, smoky and full of flavor. I don't normally care for okra, but their grilled okra was delicious. The elote is a side dish of corn kernels with seasonings topped with a white creamy cheese, cilantro and spicy sauce that was very tasty. The staff was friendly and helpful.
