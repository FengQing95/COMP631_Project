Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love Common Bond for their stellar pastries/desserts and delicious espresso drinks. They even have their own private parking lot that's not just for valet, which is a big deal in Montrose IMO, and the ambiance/decor of the place is very rustic chic. My favorite pastries are anything with lemon in it (they used to have a lemon tart that was OUT of this world), any croissant (so many layers! so much goodness in the almond frangipane), and any of the macarons. I've had brunch and lunch here maybe 3 times and every time I've been disappointed. I've had a few sandwiches, which from their descriptions always sound incredible, but always been let down because the meat was too tough or one flavor is too overpowering. I've also had a brunch entree that had octopus in it and it was so salty -- everyone at my table took a bite and left it alone. The entree menu changes often so maybe I just keep picking the wrong ones, but after 3 times of bad picks, I decided to just stick with the baked goods.
