Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My friend and I both ordered the breakfast sandwich. My other friend (3 of us in total in case you were keeping track) ordered the Duck Poutine. We all split a Chocolate Croissant, Fruit Croissant, a Cookie (chocolate chip and walnut) and an Oatmeal Creme Pie.
