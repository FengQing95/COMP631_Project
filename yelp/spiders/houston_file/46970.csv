Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////In town for the Texans Chiefs game this weekend and woke up this morning wanting some breakfast food. We decided on Snooze,based on the menu descriptions online. Parking is very limited at this location, but we did find a spot. Checked in and were told 20-30 minute wait, no big deal. Actually ended up waiting about 15 minutes so not bad, as they were pretty busy. Service was a bit slow, but our server was nice. He took our order and we waited about 25 minutes for our food. Again, not a big deal because they were packed. Food came out nice and hot. The problem with this place, in my opinion, is that the food was kinda bland considering the way it is described on the menu. Many items sound really inspired, but they fell kind of short. My wife ordered the basic eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast. She was okay with it, even though it was about $10 for a simple plate. I was excited about the "Benny's" (their eggs Benedict). They offer multiple variations on the theme and also offer the option of choosing two different styles (for an extra dollar). I ordered the more traditional one with ham, English muffin, egg and hollandaise and another that was tortilla rounds with pulled pork, egg and what was supposed to be green chili hollandaise. Sounded great but was in reality just okay. Â The atmosphere is pretty hipster, cool interior space and just okay food and service. I would never try to discourage anyone from trying it out. But for me, based on slow service and okay food, I felt it was a tad overpriced. But whatever, we gave it a shot. I really wanted to be blown away but wasn't.
