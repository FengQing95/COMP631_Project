Uchi////- This place is expensive. If you're with another person or two, it could easily be $100-$200 if you want to leave relatively full. But if you have a special occasion where you can afford to splurge, this place is worth the chunk of change! Savor each dish and take in all of the flavors. This is not a scarfing-down kind of place!
