JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Food: ramen here is truly one of my favorite ramens ever. I like all things spicy and the Spicy Chicken Ramen with Hot spice level really lived up to my standard of spiciness. The broth is flavorful and thick and the noodles don't feel like they're out of a cheap package. I've been to popular ramen bars around the country and JINYA's ramen stays on top of my list.
