Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I'm new to Houston from California and use to frequent the Bosscat location in Newport Beach. Today we tried the Houston location and loved it!!! Chad was amazing and ensured our large party had a great time. If you're at the bar, find Chad as he is a great bartender and really ensures the group has a fun time. The food was amazing as expected and the service was top notch. I recommend this spot if you're looking for a fun Sunday Brunch.
