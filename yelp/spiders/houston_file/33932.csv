Local Foods////This place is AMAZING! It's a "go-to" spot for myself, friends, & the hubbs. I've had almost everything here. I love the atmosphere, staff, & of course the food!! I'm usually in the Medical Center which is why I love this location due to its convenience... try it out they sell food seasonally & have a few vegan options!
