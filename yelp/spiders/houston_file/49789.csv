Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Tip: NEVER go here on the weekend or on a holiday. There have been a few times where I've walked out after hearing about the hour long wait to get a table-- that's just too long for my impatient self. Weekdays don't usually have wait times. Parking can also be a struggle. They have a very small parking lot but luckily there's street parking available.
