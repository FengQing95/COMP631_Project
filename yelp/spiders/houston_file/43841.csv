Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Aside from waiting in line for about half an hour to put in our order, our overall experience at this place was perfect. Their baked goods were phenomenal.  We ordered a few pastries but making the decision was pretty tough given the beautiful selection of pastries, cakes and macaroons.  The coffee was especially good and the cortado was incredible. The only thing I would have done differently, is that i would have asked for my pastries to be slightly warmed up.
