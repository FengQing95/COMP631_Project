Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Everything everyone else says about the line is true. It's kind of insane, and a little awkward when you're eating at the bar and there are random people hanging around because theyre waiting to swoop in and take your seat when you leave. I mean, I get that they want their turn, but how about you stop lurking in my personal space? It's creepy.
