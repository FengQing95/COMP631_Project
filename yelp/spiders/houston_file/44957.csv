Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I received hair in my food.  Had the kitchen manager not have dismissed it as if I jus complained about the color of the toast, I would've given a better rating because at least the service would've been top notch.  But, he dismissed it by just saying do you want another one.  No apology or anything similar.  The french toast (without hair) was just ok.  The ambiance is cool.  I doubt I will give them another chance because of the experience with the hair.
