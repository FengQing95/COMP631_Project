JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've always wanted to try out this famous ramen bar because everyone around me always raves about it. Although I was not able to eat at the store due to covid, it had very nice, modern and dark interior. The takeout was also packaged extremely neatly and conveniently. I ordered two ramen and one rice bowl.
