Kata Robata////There is a lot of sushi in this town, and I really encourage you to try it at Kata.  Sitting at the sushi bar you can see the care and joy Chef Hori and his team take in preparing the food.  They genuinely want to know if you enjoy.  At this point, I doubt they ever hear anything to the contrary.  The know it's good and they are right.
