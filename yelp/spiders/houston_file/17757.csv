Uchi////As a group, our order for the kitchen was quite large. Thank goodness I had someone tally the number dishes that came out, because there were some discrepancies. Then, the event planner comes into play because she had proposed a "tasting menu" based on the dishes I pre-ordered, but she did not specify any change in pricing. When the bill came, the difference between the a la carte and tasting menu pricing was a couple HUNDRED dollars! Thankfully the manager was able to rectify this situation after all the guests had left.
