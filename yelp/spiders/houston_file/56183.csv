Kata Robata////My friend and I came for dinner on a weekday after going to the disappointing Poke Pop Up event. Since we were craving some kind of fish, we decided to get some sushi. It was my first time coming to Kata, and I'll be honest, I didn't set my spirits high. The sign looks like your run of the mill 4 dollar sushi roll restaurant, but I guess you should never judge a book by its cover. The interior of the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous, but could do with a bit more lighting.
