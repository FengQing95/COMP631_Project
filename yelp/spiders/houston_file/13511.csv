JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////On to the ramen. It is amazing! I get the slurp up cilantro every time (I know, I should really branch out) and it's always so delicious. It reminds me of the flavors of pho but upgraded, heartier, and more robust. It's incredibly delicious and satisfying. I always make sure to leave enough broth that we can order a noodle refill to go and have it again for lunch the next day. It's super satisfying and tasty.
