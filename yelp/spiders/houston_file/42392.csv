Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The girls are the front were super friendly and willing to help, and they steered me in the direction of a carrot cake muffin. The muffin was amazing, and the latte I consumed was equally pleasing, both aesthetically and taste-wise. My friend and I sat at the 'bar,' and were thoroughly entertained by the baristas chatter (doesn't hurt when the staff is good looking either).
