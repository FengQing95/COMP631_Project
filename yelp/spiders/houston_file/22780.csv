Uchi////Uchi delivered again.  Celebrated my son and his fiancee's recent engagement last night with the 10 course Omakase for 4.  10 hits and no misses.  We added the brussels sprouts and karaage chicken along with 5 extra rounds of nigiri for each of us.    The nigiri are dressed perfectly and the fish from the daily special menu are unique and all were delicious.  The Wagyu Short Rib was the outstanding plated dish of the night.  Service was outstanding, and the atmosphere is lively, but not as loud as some restaurants can be.  Thanks Uchi for making this special occasion dinner memorable.
