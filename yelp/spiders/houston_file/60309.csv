Baby Barnaby's////Baby Barnaby's is my new favorite brunch spot. Take the prices ($10 for most expensive meals) and the ambiance (lively and cozy) and the delicious food and you've got a winner. The service was great and we we seated after a few minutes. We were offered coffee and a pitcher of water to start. And I ordered a fresh glass of OJ (you literally see the machine squezzin your oranges) and it was fabulous. I ordered the green eggs after seeing some great reviews and I concur. They were DELICIOUS. It's the classic spinach artichoke dip with eggs (basically) and tastes phenomenal. With a side of potatoes and yummy sausage the meal is a real winner. *note I asked for biscuits instead of toast and they were some of the best I've had. Warm, soft as slightly sweet. Â 10/10 in my book. Will definitely be heading back :)
