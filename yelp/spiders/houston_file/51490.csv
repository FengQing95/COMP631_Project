Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Let me start off by saying that I always go to a different location when I want snooze, but the one I go to had a very long wait time and wasn't doing take out until the afternoon, for some reason, might've been that they were busy. Anyways, I ordered online for pickup at this location, I went at the time they said it'd be ready, when I got there they told me it'd be an extra 5 minutes because the food was being "packaged", I was told this twice. When I got my food, it was cold, I checked it when I got to my vehicle, I wasn't about to wait an extra 30 minutes to have it re-done. The drinks were a bit watered down. This is the second time that I order from this specific location and it's a bad experience. At least I know to not return to this snooze.
