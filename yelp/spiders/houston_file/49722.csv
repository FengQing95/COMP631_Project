Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////But once you're seated, you're golden. They had so many delicious options to choose from I couldn't decide if I wanted pancakes or benedicts. So I ordered both! But when it came down to choosing a Benedict, I couldn't. Luckily they had the combo option! So I went with the Benny Goodman (lox style) and the Chilaquiles (barbacoa). Omg, get the Benny Goodman!! The cream cheese hollandaise is to die for! Everything was so creamy and tangy... it just married so perfectly. My husband who isn't normally a fan of benedicts love this one. This one just had that pop of flavor that I didn't quite get from the Chilaquiles. Although it was still good, I enjoyed the lox style more.
