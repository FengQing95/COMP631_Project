JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////One minor point of clarification, any and all parties will be added to the wait list as long as one member of the party does so in person (we don't allow customers to call in and add their name to the wait list). That said, however, a party will get skipped if not everyone is ready to be seated when the table becomes available. We do our best to accommodate everyone in these situations, and fix mistakes if and when they happen, but our policy is to only seat complete parties when we become very busy and require a wait list.
