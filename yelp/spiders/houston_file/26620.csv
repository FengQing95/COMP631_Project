The Pit Room////Pretty disappointed with my visit here today. Unfortunately the food looks much better in photos and is just very overhyped by the positive reviews. The brisket was very tough.  The flavor of the turkey was standard and it had a strange rubbery texture to it. The pulled pork taco was a little sad. The tortilla it came in was almost cardboard like and the pork was  bland and little on the dry side. Main standouts of the meal were he Mac and Cheese (that was very good) and the potato salad. They do have a condiment bar where you're able to grab as many fixings as you'd like, but personally I wasn't a fan of the way any of them tasted. Seems as though they were homemade, but I think they just tried to do too much and it doesn't work. $44+ including tip. Not the most expensive BBQ I've ever had, but unfortunately I wouldn't return and pay that again for sub-par bbq.
