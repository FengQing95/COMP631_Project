Local Foods////OVERALL: I'm always a fan of locally sourced fresh foods and it's clear that Local Foods isn't just providing lip-service in that department. The service is great, the food is good and it's a nice (if not a bit cluttered) atmosphere. At the end of the day, I think they try to get a bit too cute with their execution and fall a bit short sometimes.
