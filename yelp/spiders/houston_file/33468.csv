Local Foods////BF got the crunchy chicken sandwich, which was very tasty. A rather simple sandwich of juicy chicken, pickles, and chips piled high on a pretzel bun, I have to confess I was disappointed it wasn't "nut-crusted" as the menu claims. I've had the pecan-crusted chicken 'n' waffles at Benjy's, so I was hoping it would be similar to that. Nevertheless, the sammie was delicious (I'm a total sucker for pretzel buns). He also got the cabbage slaw, which I wish I'd gotten instead of the gai-lan.
