Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Sadly, we also ordered and paid for a sunflower rye loaf that we didn't get. Ordered it, girl gave the info to the cashier & I paid, another girl came in and it took 10 minutes for them to take it out from behind the glass and off the shelf to get into the box, so I assumed surely it must be correct if it took that long, I had even left a 25% tip on top of the 19$ order (I don't like to be guilted into tips just bc they show up on all receipts but I always leave a tip anyway). 1.5 hour drive home and oops no loaf, so my bad for not checking but it didn't seem like the sort of place that would forget such an obvious item especially after a tip, but that goes to show tips don't ensure good service if u tip in advance. I suspect it was the communication that caused that issue, transferring that order between 3 different people. I really don't want a small mistake to bring down the rating, but as a team it wasn't one person's mistake, any one of them could have prevented that and if I don't be honest about this others may get burned, so simply check your order if you get take out!
