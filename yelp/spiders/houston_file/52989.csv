Kata Robata////Before I go into detail about the ambiance, pricing, etc, I'm going to tell you what you need to order there: OX TAIL RAMEN! This dish was created by one of their chefs and I doubt you can find this anywhere else in Houston. After you've melted away from its deliciousness, try to piece yourself back together and give compliments to the chef who created it, Gabe!
