Kata Robata////This was definitely a great romantic sushi place with high quality freshness. It was extremely packed on a Saturday night but my bf made reservations prior to arriving. I would suggest doing rsvp first so you can be guaranteed a quick table ready! Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful with describing each dish that we had questions on. Each dish tasted amazing and unique! The fish were fresh and had no fishiness smell to it at all. Definitely worth the visit.
