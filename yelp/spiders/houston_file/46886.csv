Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Tried the Benedict duo and both were solid. Pancake flight was good but I would like to try other flavors/combos. Would definitely dine here more if often if it weren't for the wait. What surprised me was that the omelette was very good even though that's a staple breakfast item you can get anywhere. It was stellar.
