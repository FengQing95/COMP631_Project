Kata Robata////One of the better sushi (and Ramen) joints not only in Houston but period.  As others have mentioned, happy hour is the way to go for a drink and bite, however, Kata really shines with omakase.  Expect to spend a few more dollars, though totally worth it.  Oh and don't pass up the Uni Pasta when they have it.
