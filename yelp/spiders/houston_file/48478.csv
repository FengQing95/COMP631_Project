Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We went the morning of their grand opening and had no problem finding a table. We ordered the Breakfast Pot Pie, Chilaquiles Benedict and a pancake flight where you can choose three pancakes of your choice. We had chocolate chip, blueberry and the special of the day which was peanut butter and jealousy. Great taste with big Texas-sized portions. Friendly and attentive waitstaff. This place is going to blow up!!!
