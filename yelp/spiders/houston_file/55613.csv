Kata Robata////For appetizers during happy hour we ordered the duck gyoza and the "Kobe" beef tacos.  I kind of broke my own rule by ordering those tacos because restaurants that lie and say they serve Kobe beef piss me off -- there is no such thing as Kobe beef in the U.S.  Repeat after me.  NO SUCH THING.  Kobe beef is not exported to the U.S. from Kobe, Japan.  At best it's some sort of Japanese derivative cow breed, which may or may not be good quality, but is NOT Kobe.  But, the tacos were recommended so I tried them.  They were pretty good, but not worth the price point to me ($7 for 2 at happy hour) since there are so many other places I can get delicious tacos for a fraction of the price.. I liked the duck gyoza a little better because those were more unusual as well as tasty.
