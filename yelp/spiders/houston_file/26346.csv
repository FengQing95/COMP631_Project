The Pit Room////Yesssssss, This place is so friggin good. I loved everything about it. It wasn't too overpowering and SO JUICY. All the side dishes were amazing. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't too crazy because it was a weird time to eat. I really liked the atmosphere. They have indoor and outdoor seating. I recommend EVERYTHING especially the ribs, brisket, and sausage specialties.
