Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Really cute coffee shop in the Houston area. I got the lavender latte--really good, but a little strange aftertaste. The aroma is amazing though. There are a lot of pastries and finger foods for purchase such as macaroons. Also their cakes are beautiful! I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a place to do work. I think this is more for a date/friend hang out rather than working.
