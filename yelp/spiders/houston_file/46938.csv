Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////It started getting bad, when after 55 min of wait, (we were starving by this time) they sat us down, and our waitress had an awful attitude. She was HORRIBLE, rude and careless since the beginning. You could tell she was tired and it must have been a long day (we went for a late brunch on a Sunday around 2pm) She even told us that it was getting close for her time to leave. She took our orders and forgot to bring some items, rolled her eyes all the time and kept answering our questions about the menu in a very unpleasant way. When it was time to get the check, she came with the bills, and then took off for a good 15 min. By this time, we were just ready to pay and leave, since the whole experience had been bad. I had to find another server to go find our waitress. She was eating lunch in the back, since she was probably off duty at this time, and had forgotten to come charge us.
