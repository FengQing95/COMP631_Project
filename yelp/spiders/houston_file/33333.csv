Local Foods////The bad: after browsing many reviews here on yelp I got the shrimp and crab sandwich. Now I really enjoy my seafood. I'm a Baja shrimps Torchys tacos fanatic so I was super excited for this. Sadly, I couldn't even finish it :( It actually smelled fishy in a bad way and tasted the same. Won't be ordering that again. But maybe it was an odd coincidence.
