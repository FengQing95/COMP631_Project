The Pit Room////This place can probably do no wrong.  Everything I have ever tried here -- brisket, all the sausage varieties, the ribs, the tacos, the okra, the mac n cheese, the cole slaw, the beans, etc. -- has all been amazing. My mouth waters thinking about it.  You can tell these people know barbeque and take alot of pride in it.
