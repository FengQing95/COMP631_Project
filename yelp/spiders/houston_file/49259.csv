Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the tofu scramble with jalape√±os, avocado and pico de gallo. I got it with hash browns and tortillas- SO GOOD! It was my first time trying tofu eggs! I was afraid the texture would be too much but I was pleasantly surprised. We went at 9:00 and the wait was only a half hour- but worth it! Free coffee while you wait. Lots of drink options, including alcohol! I would definitely recommend this place. Great vegan options!
