Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The bad: Though I love the high ceilings, wide windows that let the sun in, and the industrial chic ambiance... Every time I try to find a place to sit there's a level of stickiness and grime that's slightly miffing. If you're the type who likes to visit coffee shops to do work, this isn't the place since the wifi goes in and out.
