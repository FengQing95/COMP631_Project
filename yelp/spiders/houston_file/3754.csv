JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////- hostess did call us for our table prematurely and told us to hang tight, they'd let us know. waited an additional 40 min (after having already waited about 10-15 min - and we were told just 45 min). when we went back to the desk to check on the status the hostess couldn't find our buzzer number which leads me to believe they crossed us off the waitlist when they incorrectly buzzed us the first time. she gave us the "oh dont worry, you're next" line. *EYEROLL
