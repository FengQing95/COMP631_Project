Local Foods////The crunchy chicken sandwich is the BEST sandwich I've ever had.. EVER.. and the house made pickles on the sandwich are too die for! I'm not a fan of venturing out and trying new things that I haven't had before, that being said local foods has some pretty unusual sides, for example garbanzo beans with cauliflower, and orzo salad with tomatoes (not things I would usually try) but I highly recommend tying all of their sides because they're AMAZING! The house made chips are by far my favorite and I love that they have a seasonal fruit to choose from as a side. If you haven't been here yet, you need to go!
