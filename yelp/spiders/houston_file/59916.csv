Baby Barnaby's////Other than that, the green eggs dish is awesomeeee!  I could have passed on the chicken sausage, but the eggs and potatoes were so yummy that I didn't even care that the chicken sausage was bleh.  The dish was very filling and worth the money.  Will definitely be visiting again in the future.  yum :)
