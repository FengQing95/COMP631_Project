Baby Barnaby's////My favorite of the Barnaby's family! It's a bit cozy, so expect a wait. Once you struggle to find legal parking in the back neighborhoods, come hungry and get ready for a really homey breakfast/brunch. I love the protein burrito, and their migas is great, too! Also they have a juicer squeezing fresh oranges all morning, get a glass of juice, it's so tasty!
