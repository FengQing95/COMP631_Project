JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Phenomenal! I'm vegan so most of my reviews regard wether or not there are vegan options and if they are good or not, but Jinya has the most amazing vegan options and they even continue expanding them each time I go! The spicy creamy vegan is good, but not spicy enough for my taste, but they have great chili sauce on the side to add extra spice. The Flying Vegan Harvest is my absolute favorite, but I get it without the beyond meat just because I'm not a fan. Also I love any of their cocktails so overall very satisfying experiences every time.
