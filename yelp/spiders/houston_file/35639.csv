Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This was my first time at Bosscat and the experience was excellent!  I had the Bosscat burger The Chef's way and it was delicious.  I don't care for blue cheese, but the chef managed to enhance the burger with the powerful cheese.  Our waiter Terry was the best and very attentive to our party of 5.
