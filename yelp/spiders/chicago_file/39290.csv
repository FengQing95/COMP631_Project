Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The service was awesome and our server Joel was exceptional. We had the cold lobster,dry aged ribeye bone in with a side of bone marrow, elote corn, mashed potatoes, very delicious truffle mac and cheese and the chocolate cream pie. We were not disappointed in any item we tasted even the sour dough bread with the salted butter yum!!!! I would definitely return the next time I visit Chicago.
