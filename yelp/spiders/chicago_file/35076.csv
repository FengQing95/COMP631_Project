Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For side dishes we had the corn, loaded baked potato and sweet potato.  Baked potato was nothing special...other than it had more of that amazing bacon on top.  The sweet potato was excellent.  The corn was just ok.  Other reviews indicated it was wonderful.  I found it to be just ok.
