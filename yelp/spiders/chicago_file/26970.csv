Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Not going to lie I was pretty excited to try this famed pizza spot, however I left really disappointed. Honestly it tasted like pizza hut..the one inside the Target stores that are microwaved. No wonder why the crime is so high in this city. Truly overrated, I would skip and go to pequods (which is way better in most ppls opinions)
