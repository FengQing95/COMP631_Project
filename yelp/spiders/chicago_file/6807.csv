Art Institute of Chicago////I have coming to the Art Institute since I moved to the Chicagoland as teenager.  I can recall the many Metra train rides we took as hoodlums downtown to witness one of the great art museums in the world.  Now living in Chicago, I was lucky enough to acquire a membership here and I have been taking advantage of the walk in and no wait.  I have to say that the Modern Wing is really the things dreams are made of.  Not only the artwork but the building itself with openness, natural light, and sharp lines.  I could spend all day in this wing.  Now, that is just one part of the museum.  The rest of it is just as fantastic and beautiful.  The must see in this museum for me are; Ivan Albright: That Which I Should Have Done I Did Not Do, Pablo Picasso: The Old Guitarist, Salvador Dali: Inventions of Monsters, Jackson Pollock: Greyed Rainbow, and Abbott Thayer: Winged Figure.  And that is just a few, I could go on and on about the Monet's, Manet's, O'Keefe's, Motley's, Rembrandt's.  There is just too much to see in one day.  This is a must experience if you are a tourist or not.
