Smoque BBQ////The sliced brisket was the best I've ever had. I haven't eaten a lot of brisket in my life, but this was really good! The Mac n Cheese is really good too and the people I was with said they liked the Peach Cobbler a lot as well. The wait wasn't very long either, despite it being back. Parking was easy too. Check it out!
