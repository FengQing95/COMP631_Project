Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Six of us had dinner last month for a birthday.  The staff and management are outstanding!  There was a slight issue that was immediately fixed above and beyond expectations.  Anyone visiting Chicago needs to put Bavette's at the top of their must visit list.  Special thanks to Kaitlin from Kathy in Ohio.  We looking forward to coming back.
