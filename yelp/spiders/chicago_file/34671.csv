Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Unpretentious. There is a $9 hamburger on the menu (compare to $27 on my hotel's room service menu!). They brought us tap water without asking and without trying to upsell us into bottled. A crab and avocado salad plus the sourdough bread would have been enough to earn this place 5 stars. Both were crazy good. I'm 6' tall and ate a business dinner here with a 6'2" tall colleague. We split a 24 oz. steak and two sides and were more than full. The sides are absurdly rich.
