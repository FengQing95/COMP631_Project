Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been coming to this restaurant since 2016 and it's about time I give it a review. The food, the drinks, the service, the ambiance - absolutely magnificent. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba will forever be a favorite of mine and I will continue coming back. The tapas are excellent, but the paella is to die for, so make sure to save some room for it! And definitely don't skip out on the desserts!
