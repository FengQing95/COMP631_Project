Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The menu said a medium sized pizza only feeds 3 people. Therefore, we ordered two medium sized pizzas. Little did we know, we didn't even eat the second pizza. One medium pizza was enough to feed a party of 6. We ordered the Lou (which is the veggie one) and the Malnati (sausage). The one we actually ate was the Lou. Even though it was veggie and had no meat, it was just so heavy and just wayyyy too cheesy. Definitely felt a little uncomfortable after eating this meal because of the grease. We togo-ed the pizza we didn't touch. After about an hour, the pizza was a hardened rock of cheese. We sadly didn't end up eating this pizza.
