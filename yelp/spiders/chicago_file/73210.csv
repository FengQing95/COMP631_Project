Little Goat Diner////My friend and I had the Bullseye French Toast and the Kimchi Pancake and it was DELICIOUS!! The french toast had the full yolk of the egg in the middle of the bread and it was pretty much the most amazing thing I've seen done to French toast. Still wondering how they did that. It was served with fries chicken slices and strawberries. You might thing, "that's the weirdest combination dudee?" Let me tell YOU something, it IS weird, but so GOOD!
