Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Excellent steakhouse with a great atmosphere and service. The food was excellent and definitely exceeded my expectations. We ordered the crab cakes, bone-in filet with bone marrow, mushrooms and the mashed potatoes. These were some of the best mashed potatoes that I have ever eaten and roasted garlic and chicken au jus brought them over the top.
