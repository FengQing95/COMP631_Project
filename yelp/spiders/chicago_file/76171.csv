Little Goat Diner////I just had breakfast here, but it was pretty amazing. Get the bullseye french toast, decadent egg in the basket french toast, covered with fried chicken bits, syrup, and strawberries. If you don't like a runny yolk, I suppose this could gross you out, but otherwise this is a must-get item. Throw in a side of the hash browns because this isn't your local diner's hash browns...there's cheese in them thar hash browns.
