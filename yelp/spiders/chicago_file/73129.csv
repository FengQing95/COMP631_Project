Little Goat Diner////Went here at 12:30pm for lunch. Wow, extremely loud place and hard to hear each other speak. I'd prefer the bar next time. Overall though, Large servings, Great service with a good looking menu. I had the kimchee burger and my guest had the banh mi burger. Both were good and tastes fresh but it didn't blow my mind. Kimchee was surprisingly good.
