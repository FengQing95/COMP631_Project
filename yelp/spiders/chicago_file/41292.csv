Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Definateley my favorite tapas place hands down!!!! the food is mouth watering and sooooooo delicious!!!! I have been there multiple times and have probably covered everything on the menu by now. there is not a thing on the menu that is just OK. Everything is EXCEPTIONAL. their raspberry sangria is sooooo good!!! and if you are not super stuffed, try their tiny deserts!!! the caramel flan hit the spot!
