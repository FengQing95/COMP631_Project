Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////While I don't dine at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba more than a few times a year, it certainly gets 5 stars from me. The restaurant is very loud with high energy, so keep that in mind! Their sangria is a must, and I recommend a pitcher if you're with more than 2 people. It's ALWAYS busy, so you should make a reservation.
