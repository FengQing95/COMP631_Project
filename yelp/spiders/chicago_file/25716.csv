Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The manager and waiter offered their apologies, but we left before finishing our food. I would never recommend this place again, especially to those who have sensitivities to food of any kind. I understand these kinds of this can happen, the reason for my review is the combination of lack of knowledge of the menu and attitude the wait staff took with our group when we inquired about whether or not the appetizer contained dairy.
