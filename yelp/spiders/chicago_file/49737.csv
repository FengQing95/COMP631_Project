Smoque BBQ////Great BBQ!  The mac and cheese is an absolute must have.  I greatly enjoy the chicken as well.  Cornbread is outrageously good, and you won't want to share.  This is a must go 5 star place!  There are usually long lines and waits, so be prepared.  They will clear you plate when you are done in attempt to move you out quickly, but not necessarily rush you.  I understand.  Great place!
