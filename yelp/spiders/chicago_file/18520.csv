Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a (former) Chicagoan, I am pretty feisty when it comes to pizza.  Chicago pizza is the best and we all have our preferences as to what the best pizza is in town. I'm a Lou's girl and always will be.  That crust. That buttery flaky crust.  That delicious spinach mix they put in the pie. That sausage..... My mouth is watering just thinking about it.
