Smoque BBQ////Based on reviews we had high hopes for this place. We waited on low for about 30mins which wasn't a problem. But we were disappointed to learn they sold out of St. Louis style ribs by the time we made it up to order. Long story short we ordered the baby back ribs. They were decent but not worth the wait in my humble opinion.
