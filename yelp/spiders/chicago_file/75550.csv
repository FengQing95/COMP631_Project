Little Goat Diner////There is one thing that really bothered me about our visit. After I ordered my burger, our server asked me if I'd like fries with it. I said sure and the fries arrived with my burger in a small bowl. But when we received the bill, we noticed that we had been charged $6 for the fries alone. This seemed deceptive on the server's part because the way she phrased it - "Do you want fries with that?" - implied that it was included with my meal. I felt like I had been intentionally misled into paying $6 for a small amount (about a cup and a half's worth) of plain fries that just tasted okay. We still tipped and we did not complain about it (we're both pretty non-confrontational), but I still think this needs to be mentioned. If your server offers you a side item, make sure you're aware that it costs about $6 extra.
