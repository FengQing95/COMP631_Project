Little Goat Diner////We sat at a table by the bathroom but you wouldn't know it because the door to the bathrooms blend in with the wall. Whaaat?!? Why wouldn't you want people to know where the bathrooms are?? There isn't even a sign. Nope, not one indicator. One of the bus boys was basically directing people all night. And at one point I even told someone walking by that yes that was the door to the bathroom.
