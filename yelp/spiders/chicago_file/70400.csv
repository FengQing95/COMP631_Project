Little Goat Diner////I thought this place was great! The portions were quite large, we ended up taking half out meal home! Dude ordered a bull's eye french toast, which is like a twist on chicken and waffles, and what a twist! The runny egg is in the center of the bread, and everything is sweet and syrupy and then the fried chicken is crispy and flavorful, i was super jealous!
