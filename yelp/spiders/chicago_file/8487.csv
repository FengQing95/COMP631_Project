Art Institute of Chicago////This art museum is phenomenal, and the only bad thing about it I think is that the map is a little hard to follow. My brother and I got lost more than once trying to make sure we had visiting every crevice and every room in this mansion of art. And for some reason we didn't really find any of the furniture worth our time in this museum either, but I'm sure that floats other people's boats so we just walked by those exhibits and went on to all of the famous pieces.
