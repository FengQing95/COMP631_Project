Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////1) Reservations are difficult this place fills up spots quick, and months in advanced, but fret not my friend, sometimes on the weekends or day of your dining experience if you check for reservations early enough in the morning some tables will open up that arent at 10pm at night. Â Still hard to come by but worth a shot.
