Little Goat Diner////On our recent trip to Chicago, we attempted to come to Little Goat twice.  The first time was on a Sunday morning about 9:30am.  While we were told it would only be a 30 minute wait (not bad at all!), we were pretty hungry, so we headed to the bakery, which shares the space with Little Goat.  Over in the bakery, my wife and I both had a bagel.  Let's be honest here, though, this wasn't just any bagel you get from your corner store.  I had the apricot with a smoked salmon schmear, which was delightful!  My wife had a rye bagel with the sweet onion schmear, which she also enjoyed.  Bagels and schmears are all made in-house, so you should probably just try them all.  We also each had coffee.  Now, I know what you might be thinking, "Oh, diner coffee?  Nothing special."  Well, dear reader, you're wrong.  Seriously.  One of the best parts about Little Goat is that their coffee is from Stumptown, so even the drip coffee was delicious!  This is not your average diner, trust me.
