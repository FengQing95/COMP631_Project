Little Goat Diner////The diner was packed, but we had a reservation, so we didn't end up waiting long. This place had a pretty diverse menu and unique daily specials. The food overall was really satisfying. We had a larger group, but the service was definitely lacking; hence the lower rating. I really wanted to love this place, but for the price, the service should have been way better. It took forever to do anything with our waiter. We were in the diner for over 2.5 hours simply because it took so long to order, eat and pay for our food.
