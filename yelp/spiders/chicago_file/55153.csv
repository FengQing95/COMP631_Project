Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So it's been ages since I had dined here but I have to say the place is still packin them in a churnin out some tastee tapas. The space is larger that it appears from the outside so don't expect an intimate dining experience. Meter parking is an option but sometimes limited ...they do offer valet @$13. It gets packed but they do a great job accommodating the crowds and crankin out the food. Nice wine and beer selection and of course sangria. The tapas we sampled were all well prepared and fresh and although fairly typical defiantly prepared to order. The service was nice and knowledgeable and kept the ball rolling on a busy nite. So if your in the mood for some tapas this old standby is still working like a fine oiled machine. Oh and make sure to checkin to receive a free dessert.
