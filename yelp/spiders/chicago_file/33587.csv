Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Best steak in Chicago. I had the bone in filet, a nice bourbon and Mac and cheese with bacon. Wonderful food. Great atmosphere. Superb service. This one is rated among the best restaurants out there for a reason. Get your reservation in early though as there can be a 3+ month wait.
