Little Goat Diner////I Love Love Love The Little Goat Cafe!  I'm not sure where to begin. The food is incredible. Service is always great.  Interesting food combinations and everything is incredible.  I've had burger, french toast and chicken, goat chili, the smoke fries.  Seriously everything is delicious!  Yes there can be a a wait but if go during off hours you can normally get in without a wait.  We tend to eat late and the best part is the kitchen is open until 1am!  We've stopped in after a late Hawks game!  I highly recommend it!!
