The Purple Pig////Btw, we were pretty hungry and they were already at an advantage since we probably would've thought anything was good at that point, but it wasn't. I Â wouldn't go back again and wouldn't recommend this place. However, service was excellent and atmosphere was nice. If you want to try this place, go on an off hour. But with a lot of good food places around, I would recommend trying other places. Definitely not worth the wait.
