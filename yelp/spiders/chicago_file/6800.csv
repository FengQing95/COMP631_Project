Art Institute of Chicago////This place is awesome! This place has art from the Greeks to the modern/contemporary art. There are 2 floors to explore and let yourself get lost in art. The flow and layout of some of the place reminded me of the Louvre in Paris. It's a very good art museum. Â They do have a large collection of European art, American art, and Asian art. It's a cool place to spend a day in. It's not bad for $20 a ticket.
