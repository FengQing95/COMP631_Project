Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Hands down, one of my favorite place in the city! There's not much to say that hasn't already been said: Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is amazing and there's plenty on the menu for everyone.  As many of other people have already said, the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce is incredible and I get it every single time.  The stuffed mushrooms are also to die for. I usually get one or two of the seafood options, and have have never been disappointed.  One word of caution: the spicy scale can vary quite a bit...some things labeled as spicy don't have much heat, while other will leaving you pounding your sangria down too fast. (Side note: get the sangria...all the sangria!)
