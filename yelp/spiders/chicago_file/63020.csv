The crunch on top was soggy, the peaches in syrup should have been bubbling so create that warmness in peach cobbler, and there was no pastry base to it. It was more of a crumble then a cobbler. The bread pudding was so dense, heavy, and dry. It needed more of that pecan caramel topping on it. The topping was actually pretty good. It added that necessary crunch to the bread pudding.
