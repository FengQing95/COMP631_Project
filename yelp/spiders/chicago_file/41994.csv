Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ok chads and trixies listen up! Sangria is served with ice, Ice is made or ? what ? you can do it , Thats right water genius. So if you order a pitcher and sit at a table for an hour or slowly sipping your sangria whilst you discuss what soriority/frat you are gonna rush or omg how hot the guys in Fall out Boy are, the ice will melt. Â And Cafe BaBaReeba isnt a chain, its a busy restaurant in Lincoln Park Not Spain. Make reservations so I can actually get a seat in the bar without having your drunk girlfriends spilling all over me. Thank you I am done now
