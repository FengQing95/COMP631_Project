Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I've been here may times and NEVER tried a dish I didn't like. In fact, I've identified so many that I flat-out love that I have a hard time deciding and often end up with more tapas than I can eat. The food is delicious, the service is very good (I was once in a group where we asked to be moved to the patio, and then it was uncomfortable, so we asked to move back inside, and they were SUPER nice about it even though it was an obnoxious request).  The outdoor patio is really nice in the summer.  They bring the plates out at a nice pace. The sangria is delish.  And I love that they have tiny desserts available because I'm usually too full for more than a couple of bites.  I mostly go for dinner, but the brunch is also very good.  They take reservations, which I STRONGLY advice on weekends as the wait can approach 2 hrs on a Friday or Saturday night.
