Little Goat Diner////Really solid stuff. Im just sad we were too full to try more things. The menu is pretty large and varied and i noticed that there is a gravitation towards kimchee for some reason. Very interesting. The place is bustling even for 2pm, and it's a much larger space than i thought. Definitely need to return to try more of the fare.
