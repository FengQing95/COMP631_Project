Art Institute of Chicago////O-M-G!!! This place is overwhelming!!! The various styles of paintings under one roof is amazing!! It was a bucket list checkoff of mine to lay my eyes upon some of the names I've only read and seen in magazines. Although I didn't see the work that most were well known for, it was still an honor to look at their other paintings and admire their beauty.
