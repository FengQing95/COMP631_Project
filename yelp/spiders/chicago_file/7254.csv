Art Institute of Chicago////One or two summers ago, I went to the Art Institute with a friend of mine. Since she had a membership we didn't have to pay much for the museum itself, only the parking. Luckily, I covered that since using the park whiz service saved me money and time when it came to finding a place for my car, since I could pay for parking before going to the Art Institute. We basically spent the whole day there, and explored several exhibits, including a presentation on industrial design in Europe. There were also several suits of armor and artifacts from antiquity, which was the coolest part for me! I saw that it makes sense to get a museum membership if you come there a lot, but since I'm not that much of an art guy, I'm willing to pay a little more when I come there on my own. Overall, the Art Institute is a very fun place to spend a hot summer day.
