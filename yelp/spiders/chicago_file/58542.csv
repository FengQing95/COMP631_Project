Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It is a tapas restaurant so I recommend getting a bunch of dishes to share, around 2-3 per person should be enough for a hearty meal. My favorites were the shaved brussel sprout salad, the patatas bravas, the calamari, and the buttermilk fried chicken thighs. I love that all the dishes are super flavorful and all very unique.
