Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Holy oh my god. This place is absolute fire. Sangria is typically too sweet for me but hot damn this one is perfect, and not too badly priced (go for the full pitcher). We ordered all tapas and everything we had was absolutely on point. Bacon wrapped dates, spicy potatoes, piri-piri chicken, spinach and manchego mushrooms, and so much more (we ordered a lot). Wow. Obsessed. Also try the butterscotch desert because another 10/10 recommendation.
