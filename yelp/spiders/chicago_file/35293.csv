Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Elote Style Corn- I'm so glad I saw the yelp reviews before ordering here because this was the most amazing corn dish I've ever had! It was basically like creamed corn but in a queso cheese sauce instead of cream. Â It was creamy and rich with just a hint of spiciness from the cheese, which was balanced beautifully with the sweetness and freshness of the corn. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!
