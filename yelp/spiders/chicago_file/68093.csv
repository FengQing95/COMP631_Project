Little Goat Diner////But let's talk about the actual meal I had.  I ordered the hot chocolate, which took a really long time and was cold by the time I got it.  I'm sure it would have been really good if it was actually hot.  The server seemed frazzled but friendly, so I didn't want to bother him with taking it back (especially since it took 10 minutes to get there in the first place).
