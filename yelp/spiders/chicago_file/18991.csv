Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I split a small pizza with a friend--the perfect size for two!  We got the Lou (tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, 3 kinds of cheese) and it was spectacular. I'd never tried deep dish before, and don't consider myself a true cheese lover--but I was blown away by the flaky crust, comfort food flavor and the pure fun of eating it with a knife and fork!  (Also, the cheese really didn't overwhelm the pizza--there was a lot else to enjoy on the plate.) Sat outside and enjoyed a view of River North passers by.  Highly recommend!
