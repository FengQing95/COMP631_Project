Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's has some of the best pizza in Chicago. This is definitely the spot to go if you're looking for quality deep-dish (Chicago's Pizza Trademark :)! I always order sausage, mushroom, and spinach deep-dish and have always been satisfied. Their minestrone soup is amazing!
