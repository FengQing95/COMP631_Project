The Purple Pig////I heard a lot about this place, it was a first time we visited this restaurant. Â The food was inventive and very flavorful, but a bit heavy on the butter. Bone marrow was tasty. Liked pork ribs which was melt in your mouth. Great ambience and service. Our waiter was very pleasant.
