Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For some reason, whenever I have guests, I always take them here.  Lou's/Pizano's style is my favorite deep dish, and while I think Pizano's might have a pinch better food, somehow the location, the athmosphere, the dependably good service, and a solid (but definitely not exceptional) beer selection round out a great meal.  Be sure to call ahead and/or order salad and appetizers, because the wait for a deep dish pizza is usually 45 minutes.
