Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Tonight we experienced GREAT customer service from Lenny, one of the managers at Lou Malnati's.  We accidentally were sent a pizza with green peppers.  Since neither one of us cares for green peppers, I was disappointed and called the restaurant.  Lenny was very understanding and offered to send a pizza back to us with a rush order.  It was our anniversary (hence why we ordered such a special meal) and Lenny was so sweet to send over cookies and ice cream with the pizza!  The second pizza was absolutely perfect, and the chocolate chip cookies were to die for!
