Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started with just three oysters, I regret not getting more, at home in other restaurants-I usually can only "handle" one-eating them out of pressure from everyone around marveling over them, now I understand the obsession, but question why all oysters can't be like the ones at bavettes.  We also ordered the avocado crab salad, hands down the best salad I've ever eaten, so fresh, so clean! Sean, our waiter made sure our napkins were folded every time we stepped away from the table, talk about service! He made great drink recommendations and was genuinely interested in our satisfaction.  I couldn't recommend this place more! It is a must when traveling here, be prepared to spend a bit, but it's worth every penny.  Easily one of the best nights of my life, and the food just enhanced it!
