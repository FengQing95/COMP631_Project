Little Goat Diner////The menu may be a bit of a risk taking for people who prefer mild, classic & simple flavors but it tastes like absolute heaven. I am not one of those people and I promptly followed the waiter's suggestion to try "The Little Pig Went to China" which then became one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever eaten. A cheddar biscuit filled with sausage & PERFECTLY cooked sunny side up eggs bathing in a sea of a sesame/soy sauce of sorts, accented with yellow grape tomatoes... I honestly have never been so surprised by a breakfast dish and cannot wait to go back.
