Smoque BBQ////I have not gone there yet, as I've only had it as a take out order that someone else has gone to pick up.  I'm a huge fan of brisket, so I've only had their sliced brisket sandwiches, but both times they were to die for!  To me there is nothing special about their mac & cheese, but I LOVE their coleslaw!  I am a huge fan of vinegar based coleslaw and their is so good I can't stop eating it!  If you like creamier coleslaw, you will not like this one.
