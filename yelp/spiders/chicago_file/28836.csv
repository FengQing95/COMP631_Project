Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time trying Lou's. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. She did make sure to warn us of the time it would take for the pizza. We ordered a salad to start and the dressing which was a low cal ranch was amazing! Pizza was also super great. Expensive for pizza but worth the price.
