Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Absolutely the best meal and dining ambiance I encountered while visiting Chicago. This is a must visit. Â Not only was the food fabulous but the atmosphere was one of the best I seen. The place was perfectly dim lit and well designed with a swanky 1920's French American speak easy feel.
