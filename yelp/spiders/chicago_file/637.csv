Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Always crowded, and for good reason--the food is delicious and reasonably priced.  Servers are friendly and efficient. Best of all, you can get breakfast OR lunch at any point.  I ate here frequently as my office was nearby--now I look for a reason to get back. Don't even try to get in during Lolla or other big downtown events, but they will give you a pager, so if one person checks in, you can save a lot of time that way.
