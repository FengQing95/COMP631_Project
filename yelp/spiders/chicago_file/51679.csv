Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We also got the White Peach Sangria but it was honestly just underwhelming. It really wasn't that strong and didn't have that much flavor. Between two, you can get 2 glasses out of a pitcher. I really won't get the sangria again but the price is honestly worth it for the amount of tipsy I got. ;)
