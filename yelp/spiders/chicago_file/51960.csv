Smoque BBQ////A great place for delicious food at a moderate price.  Smoque has a concise menu so they can execute the food properly.  There is usually a line, but it moves pretty quickly and they will find a seat for you after you order at the counter.  The decor is purely functional, but you won't care when you are looking at the food.
