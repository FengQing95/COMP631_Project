Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////During our last morning in Chicago we were trying to find a place near the Loop to eat breakfast before heading to the breakfast. Wildberry Cafe popped up as one of our searches and being that it got decent reviews and the fact that it was pretty close to the hotel we were checking out of we decided to give it a try. it's right across the street from Millenium Park so we expected it to be a little crowded since so many people were vacationing in the city at the time. The weather wasn't too agreeable with the mix of rain and wind so we wanted to sit inside anywhere we decided to go. The restaurant was already busy and crowded at 8 am but the wait for a table for 2 was only 10 minutes. We were seated relatively quickly. We scoped the menu and decided on a savory and sweet dish: the breakfast burrito and the banana bread french toast. They serve Intelligentsia coffee (!) so that was a a plus.
