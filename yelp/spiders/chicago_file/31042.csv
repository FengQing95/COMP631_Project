Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first time trying deep dish pizza and when I told my friends I was going to Chicago, everyone suggested that we stop here. This is a Chicago staple and the place gets packed. You can pre-order your pizza with the cashier and get on a waiting list. This gives you the impression that your pizza will be close to ready by the time you sit, but we were on the list for about 30-45 minutes and it took an additional 30+ minutes for the pizza to actually reach us. Not sure what the point of pre-ordering was. On the upside, our appetizer of cheese sticks came in relatively fast so it curbed our appetite a little bit.
