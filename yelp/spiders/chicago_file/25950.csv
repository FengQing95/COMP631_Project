Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Excellent food and not expensive.  BUT - be aware it takes TIME to cook one of these signature deep-dish pizzas all the way through, immutable laws of physics being what they are...  so either plan on sitting around for a while with your friends after you order, or PHONE AHEAD and they can get your order into the oven before you arrive.
