Little Goat Diner////The menu offers dishes for the adventurous palate (but also has "safer" options as well). They offer classic dishes with their own twist, such as chicken and french toast instead of waffles, or the sloppy goat and goat chili. It's also more affordable than Girl and the Goat and portions seem more generous.
