Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For dessert, we ordered the chocolate truffle cake and the Butterscotch Caramel Custard. The desserts might have been my favorite part of the evening. DO NOT leave here without getting dessert! The portions of the desserts were very small, and that surprised us at first. Once we tasted each one, we knew why they were small. The desserts were SO amazingly sweet and rich, we could only handle a little bit of them! I think that's why the portions come smaller. The custard was just phenomenal with the caramel and the cake literally tasted like (and had the consistency of) chocolate fudge. Heck, I'll go as far to say that this place is worth a trip just for the dessert alone! Yes, it was THAT good. Our server packed up our leftovers (we had paella leftovers - we ate all the desserts!) and gave us our bill. For everything that we had there and the excellent service we received, it was a very reasonable price - $80 for tapas, the entr√©e, 2 sangrias/person, plus dessert!
