Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our Uber driver recommended this place for deep dish pizza. We were expecting a line, but got seated pretty quickly, and even though the place was relatively packed, our waitress was extremely attentive and very quick. They noted that the pizzas usually take around 30-40 minutes, so she took our order immediately, and the pizza came out extremely fast.
