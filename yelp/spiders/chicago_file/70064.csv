Little Goat Diner////The best part of the meal was the cinnamon roll, though even that led to a bit of the complaint.  We'd ordered one to share before our main meals came out just to get a taste and they basically forgot it, not bringing it out until we were almost finished.  I do give them kudos for comping the roll but it was slightly irritating, especially because the diner was not bustling.  All that said, the roll was delicious with a healthy dose of cinnamon that made it quite tasty.
