Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////--- I thought after eating all that food, I couldn't even think about dessert. Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending how you look at it, this slice of Heaven was too good to resist. With some vanilla bean whipped cream on top, and a crunchy crust, this dessert was a perfect combination of deliciousness and even more deliciousness.
