Smoque BBQ////Still Smoqin' it's been a while since I have been here but I think the slaw has gotten better. Tried and loved the corn bread. Spicy sauce is the way to go on the sliced brisket. The brisket a little dry this visit maybe because it was Sunday. Fries still rock but the baked beans are way to sweet for me. They had my pancreas doing back flips.
