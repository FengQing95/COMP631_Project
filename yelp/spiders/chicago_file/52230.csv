Smoque BBQ////By far, the best BBQ joint I have been to in Chicago thus far. I cannot rave enough about the pulled pork sandwich. It was everything I had been craving for the longest time and more. The meat was absolutely perfect - the consistency, the smokiness, the amount of BBQ sauce - all served on a bun with plenty of exquisite homemade french fries and a mouthwatering crisp coleslaw. I mean... I just couldn't stop eating! And the best part is that even though I was completely stuffed by the time I left, I still had to get a box to pack some of the food to-go - the portion was very much worth the price. For about $10/sandwich combo, this hidden gem is a place I will frequent and recommend far and wide from now on :)
