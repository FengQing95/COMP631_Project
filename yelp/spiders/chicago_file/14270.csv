Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The crust was rich, crisp, firm, and--yes--buttery. The mozzarella was good enough: full-bodied but not too chewy. The sauce was above my expectations but just a simple, light red sauce with chunks of crushed tomato. It probably comes from a can but its not too metallic, sugary, or pasty. On the whole it's a good mix that holds up well under its weight.
