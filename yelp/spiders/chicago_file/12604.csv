Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Mailed ordered sausage, pep and spinach.  We have only tried the sausage so far and threw it all away.  The sausage is one big piece on the top, very low quality, no flavor and lots of grizzle. Sausage on pizza should be of fine italian sausage quality and either thinly sliced or crumbled.  I sincerely hope the other two types are better.
