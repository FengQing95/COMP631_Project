Little Goat Diner////Watch out: The weekend wait can be upwards of 40 minutes. We got there around 11 which seemed like a little early then peak brunch hours. I would suggest the attached coffee bar and checking out the little merchandise wall while you wait. The parking in this area is valet or meter. The best bet is to find a meter.
