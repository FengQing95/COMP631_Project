Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We won't be returning to this breakfast spot until management/owers are replaced with different folks whom have diversity skills and can understand how to run a resturant at the front of the house. Â Staff definately needs some retraining here, before I'll ever spend the money to go back.
