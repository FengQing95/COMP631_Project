Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizzeria Uno, Due and Giordano's tend to get most of the deep dish hype but Lou Malnati's is the win. There you will find the perfect crust - a hint of toastiness and an excruciatingly delicious-to-bite-into crunch - which is key since with all the dough and the sauce and the toppings, it's easy for a lot of places to get this all wrong and leave you with a soggy mess (I'm looking at you, Giordano's). Plus, the ingredients always taste fresh and somehow, even though you've eaten your weight in dough, you manage to not feel that awful.
