Art Institute of Chicago////We actually purchased a membership for the Art Institute for a few reasons besides the expanded level of financial support for the Institute. Members have an express entry line, don't have to pay extra for special exhibits, and have access to a nice, relaxing lounge area. By the time we paid for two entries and special exhibits, it just made sense to buy a membership and skip the long entry lines. Plus we can return as much as we want for the next year!
