Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Me and my boyfriend spent a date night at this place on his business trip in Chicago and it was an amazing experience for us. They provide professional atmosphere and our waiter was competent and an expert on the menu. I had the best crab cake in my life even when I had a lot of crab cakes in DC and Maryland just the weekend before. My boyfriend got Filet Mignon and he also liked it.
