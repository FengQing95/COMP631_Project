Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The waiter had a bad attitude. Because salad dressings usually have wine vinegar and I'm pregnant, I asked the waiter whether the dressing had alcohol, and he replied saying that I wouldn't get drunk with the salad dressing, so I proceeded to clarify that it was because I'm pregnant that I was asking, to which he reply, "it won't hurt the baby." Very impertinent and condescending. He is not a doctor and because of such he shouldn't make such a comment. He also made a mess when serving us the salad and didn't clean up. He got my utensils and napkin dirty with the salad and didn't apologize or offer to bring a clean set. Very rude and bad service.
