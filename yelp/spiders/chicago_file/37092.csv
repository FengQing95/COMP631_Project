Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Literally everything that's part of the Hogsalt franchise is amazing, and this place is no exception! Careful not to over-order as they have very big portions! My faves are bone marrow, wedge salad, and corn (out of all things? but trust me there can hardly be better and fattier corn than this).
