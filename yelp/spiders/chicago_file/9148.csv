Art Institute of Chicago////I returned to Chicago and I spent a delightful day at the Chicago Art Institute.The Chicago Art Institute's collection of French Impressionist Paintings and Modern Art is very well publicized.However,I spent my day being captivated by its fine collection of Medieval and Renaissance Art in the Deering Family Galleries of this huge art museum.In the Deering Family Galleries,I appreciated fine Medieval Period Paintings and Relics.I especially relished the Ayala Altarpiece,Retable and Frontal depicting the lives of the Virgin and Christ.This work was done in the late 14th Century Spain and it employs egg tempera and gold leaf on wood panel.This is a very punctilious work of Art.I also appreciated its fine Late Medieval Period Paintings by these Italian Painters;Master of Bigallo Crucifix("Crucifix",done in the 13th Century),Spinello Aretino("Pope Honoring Saint Francis"),Lorenzo Monaco("Processional Cross With Mary Magdalene and Hermit"),Taddeo di Bartolo("Crucifixion")Paolo Veneziano and Workshop("Saints"),and Gherardo Starnina("Death of Virgin").This area of the Chicago Art Institute had wonderful holy relics produced in Medieval Limoges,France.I also enjoyed fine Renaissance Period paintings by Antonio Vivarini("Saint Peter Exorcizing Woman From Demon"),Johan Koerbecke("Annunciation"),Sano di Pietro("Virgin and Child With Saints"),Matteo di Giovanni,Apollonio di Giovanni("Adventures of Ullysses"),Master of Female Half Lengths("Mary Magdalene Reading"),Lucas Cranach the Elder("Eve"),and Conrad Faber Von Kreuznach("Portrait of Fridrich Rorbach").Other areas of the Chicago Art Institute have awesome Renaissance Period Paintings by Master of Moulins,Rogier Vander Weyden and Workshop,Jean Bellegambe,Giovanni di Paolo("Saint John in the Wilderness"),Sandro Botticelli,Vincenzo Frediani,Jan Scorel,and Master of Lille,among others.Kudos to the staff of the Chicago Art Institute for its outstanding curatorial work.
