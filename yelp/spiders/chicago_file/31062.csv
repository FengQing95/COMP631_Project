Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Right when we arrived, we could get the cool vibe emerging from the place. First off, a few people were conversing outside waiting on their pizza. The conversations and laughter coming out the little crowd made us thing the we were off for a good start. We got in and put ourselves on the waiting list for a table. There is an option on putting your order in online while waiting on your table to reduce the wait time; however, since it was our first time there, we didn't want to risk it. So we waited about 30-45 minutes.
