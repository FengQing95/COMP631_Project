Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food: I started with an apple an mixed greens salad which was very good. My boyfriend had the bone marrow which he loved - he said it was decadent and was pleasantly surprised at the large portion. For our meal we both had the 10 oz filet - they were perfectly cooked. The knife slid through the beef like butter! And we shared pomes frites which were very tasty.
