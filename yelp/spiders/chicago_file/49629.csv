Smoque BBQ////After all this time, I finally went back after much cajoling from the husband.  Not likely to happen again.  Still as dry as ever and I am not interested in any of the sides that they have.  $4 for a half sandwich of dried-out pork on a weird bun is not my thing.  Husband tore into his half slab of ribs with fries, cornbread and coleslaw and when I asked about why he was not eating anything but the ribs and fries he said, "I love the ribs and the fries are okay, but the rest I could do without."  And why do you come here all the time then?  Find a place that has everything to offer.
