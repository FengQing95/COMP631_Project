Little Goat Diner////After we got our seat we ordered some sides to share, the Mac N Cheese and the Fries. Fries were pretty good! Not the best ever, but a good fry. The Mac n Chee was disappointing. Really expected more. The texture was off on the cheese sauce and the noodles were too soft. Made you want to wipe your tongue off with your napkin, but apparently they frown upon that in this establishment.
