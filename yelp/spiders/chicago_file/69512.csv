Little Goat Diner////Always a great meal and the atmosphere is very fun, love their music selection! I have to eat gluten-free due to a gluten sensitivity and they are very up on what meals are recommended and which to stay away from. I have never once gotten sick here and the food is just fabulous! Servers are always friendly too. Highly recommend you check it out but they do pack 'em in, make a reservation!
