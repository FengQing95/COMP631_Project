Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////But when we got our bill, we were charged for two dessert tapas, with only one free.  We called our waitress over, and she gave us nothing but excuses - "oh yeah, we've been having trouble with those yelp check ins, it's only for one dessert."  I pointed out to her that the wording of the yelp coupon said that it was for 1 tapa for EACH guest, and she only said, "oh sorry, that's not what the deal is."
