Little Goat Diner////I went to Little Goat Diner with grand expectations, as I had gone to the one at the French Market and loved it. I went to Little Goat Diner for brunch and found that it has a slightly different interpretation of breakfast than what I am used to. This may or may not appeal to you. When I go out for breakfast, I like to see creative, and innovative items, yet I still want to have plentiful selections of more traditional breakfast dishes (with a twist). Little Goat has few "traditional" items, and has reinvented breakfast - which for some could be a good thing, but for me, it's a bit too fussy.  I will say that they do have more traditional items when it comes to sweet breakfast items like pancakes and french toast. As a savory breakfast lover (eggs, omelets), there wasn't much of a selection that I was interested in tasting. The one omelette that I was interested in was sold out, so I opted for the "Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing"  - it was tasty, but I wouldn't order it again. It just didn't satisfy my breakfast craving for more of an egg-based dish. My friend ended up making her own omelet, which she enjoyed, but I like there to be more omelet selections that were designed by the chef vs. me trying to piece something together, hoping that it tastes good.
