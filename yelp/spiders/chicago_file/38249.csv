Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is my favorite place in Chicago, especially with close friends and/or a special someone.  While it's a steakhouse, there's more than your regular Gibsons-type fare.  I love the vibe, the cocktails, and even the, in some cases, "funky" seating where you may be eating while seated at a table with 2 couches or similar.
