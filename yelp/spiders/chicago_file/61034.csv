Smoque BBQ////So, yeah. Cafeteria seating. Deli service (in the short time we were there, they went from yelling out 60 to the mid-80s - that's not impressive, that's a factory line of food...again, like a BBQ McDonald's). Food that isn't made-to-order. The entrees are overpriced, the sides are excellent. Disgustingly-sweet sauce. $40 for this? The equivalent of fast food? No, thank you, not with all of the legitimately incredible options out there. Guess it'd be alright for a quick lunch if you don't mind blowing $40-50 on lunch for 2. Their prices are ridiculously inflated for the quality of the food and the dining experience.
