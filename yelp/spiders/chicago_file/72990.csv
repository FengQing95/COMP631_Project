Little Goat Diner////So obsessed that I went here opening night & then 2 times again n less than a week. each time I've gone I got pretty lucky and didn't have to wait for a table any longer than 10-15 minutes. (hopefully i didn't just jinx myself now haha) Each time that I've gone the service has been great and the servers are super friendly & knowledgeable about the massive menu.
