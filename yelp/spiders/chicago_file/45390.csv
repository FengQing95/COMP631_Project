Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////As a visitor to Chicago, I really enjoyed my tour of Lincoln Park - ending with a tasty meal at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.  We were initially concerned when we heard it would be an hour and a half wait for a table, but we were quickly seated five minutes later in the patio.  Despite the cold weather outside the patio stayed relatively warm, but got colder as the room emptied.
