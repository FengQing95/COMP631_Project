Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had filled up from the gratuitous sides and 16 oz each of meat and thought about going with a couple glasses of Port to cap off a wonderful night.  John said "I think I have the perfect thing for you" - and proceeded to tell us about green chartreuse - an herbal liquor developed by some ancient Monks and still produced today.  He said it'd be the perfect finish to our meal.  He offered a taste and it was PERFECT.  It's super "herby" and a bit absinthe-like medicinal but wow - what a perfect way to end a great meal!  We had never heard of it before, but will definitely add it to the liquor cabinet to close out future good meals (trust me, after drinking it, you won't want anything else!)
