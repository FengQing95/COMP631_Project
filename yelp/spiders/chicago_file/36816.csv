Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm glad I did. I got the 42 day dry aged ribeye.  As anybody who reads my reviews knows, I am a huge dry aged steak guy. 30+ days or don't bother! The first time it lacked the funky earthy punch that I expect in a really good dry aged steak. The second time was radically different.  So different in fact that I wondered if maybe there was a mix up and they didn't give me the dry aged steak the first time.
