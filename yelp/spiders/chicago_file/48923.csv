Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Do make reservations, and do come in. I feel like this was a great environment for my girl friend and I. The prices were fantastic for everything we ordered. Especially the sangria's - completely worth it! And, I would definitely do a birthday dinner/bachelorette dinner here too.
