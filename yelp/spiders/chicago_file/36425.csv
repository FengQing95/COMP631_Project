Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place has great ambiance, the severs are very knowledgeable about the menu for food and drinks. My party ordered individual meals and we also ordered for the table. One of the items was bone marrow, by far the best I've had. It was perfectly seasoned and a huge portion. For a great overall dining experience, this place was fantastic. It is a bit pricey but we'll worth it.
