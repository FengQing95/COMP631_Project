Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When you visit Chicago you have to have real deep dish pizza! That is not up for arguments or question. Lous gave me exactly what I was hoping for in a chicago style pizza. My boyfriend brought me here on our last day in the city and I was not disappointed. The building is rather average and seemingly small. Once inside it expands into a back room as well so it offers more space that you would expect. But due to high demand if their oh so gooey pizza it's pretty packed with tables and a full bar.
