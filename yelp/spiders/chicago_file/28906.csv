Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great service! Even though two medium pizzas were ordered for just two people dining in, our server didn't miss a beat and understood that we wanted to try a little of both and take home the rest. We chose the classic and lou, the latter being vegetarian. Both were good, but I, the carnivore, preferred the flavor profile of the lou more.
