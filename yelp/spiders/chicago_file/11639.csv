Art Institute of Chicago////What can I say.... amazing! We spent 4 1/2 hours (about 20 min of that to eat) and we didn't see everything. I highly recommended to everyone! I will be back. You can take pics of everything (just no flash). The people that work there are very helpful! I see them helping numerous people and seemed happy to do so. We upgraded to the fast pass and for me it was worth the extra $. I knew it's be busy on a Saturday afternoon and there as a line but we were able to walk right thru. No waiting. It can get confusing as to what is where and where you are in the building but it's still all so wonderful. I will definitely go back again.
