Art Institute of Chicago////The modern art exhibits here are where they really shine as this museum was the only US art museum to host the 1913 Armory Show, which put many cutting edge European artists on the map like Duchamp, Brancusi, Cezanne, Rodin, Matisse, Picasso, Seurat et al. Many of which went on to be considered masters of their time. Today, this museum showcases outstanding pieces of their work picking out just a couple of pieces in some cases that show the breadth of the artist's work over time.
