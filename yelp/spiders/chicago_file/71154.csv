Little Goat Diner////My friend and I had the nachos which wow, look out, it's a HUGE pile of cheese, guac, onions, beans and several other amazing things that will fill you up in and of itself. We also each had an entree--I had the pork belly salad which was very excellent (a great counter to the heavy nachos) and my friend had the roast beef sandwich. Both were very professionally done with high quality ingredients.
