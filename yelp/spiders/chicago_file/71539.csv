Little Goat Diner////- Los Drowned Sandwich (My favorite!!): extremely tender and juicy braised beef with so many different levels of flavor and depth in every bite. Possibly one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. I'll be telling everyone about this and coming back just to eat this amazingness again.
