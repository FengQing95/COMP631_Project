Smoque BBQ////Smoque has some of the best bar-b-que beef brisket I've ever had.  I don't even like brisket normally and I crave this stuff.  There must be drugs in it.  Have the brisket!  Everything else is very good (chicken, ribs, pulled pork), but the brisket is great.  5 stars for the brisket.  The mac-n-cheese is very good, but I wish it was bigger.  A large order is simply two small orders, so my dreams of a large tray of mac were dashed.  They have a very usefull 1/4 st. louis ribs option, which is nice for the indecisive like me (brisket!).  I do mostly take out, but as a sit down place the owners try their best to get everyone a seat.  The inside is very informal, kind of cafeteria style, but is kept very clean and usually very busy.  Its smaller than you may expect and usually the line is out the door for dinner.  Smoque definitely has some of the highest overall quality BBQ in Chicago.  It is not so much a dine-in restaurant that serves BBQ, but more of a specialty BBQ joint that you can sit in.
