Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The waitress seemed confused with  our preorder pizza ( where they have fix it then finish it  off  in the oven when u are seated so  it comes out quicker) well that was a fail because we waited 30-35 min for our pie. We ordered the classic Chicago deep dish. It was phenomenal. Just what I wanted, buttered crust, full  of cheese and top with one of the greatest tomato sauces I've had.
