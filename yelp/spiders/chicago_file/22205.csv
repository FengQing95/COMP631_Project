Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a small. The menu says it serves 2, but there were 4 slices which was enough for us. My friends loved the butter crust and I liked the sausage. But by the time the pizza arrived, I was already stuffed! I ate less than half a slice. I know, I know. I should've saved more room for it to get the full experience, but that salad... nom!
