Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We didn't eat too much but what we did have made me want to come back for more! The enviroment on the patio is great (covid note- lots of space between tables and every team member wore masks and gloves). The staff was super nice and helpful in making our covid experience the best it could be. And I'm impressed by the size of menu they have for a tapas place. We started with drinks. Their sangria flight is a great way to try all of the sangria. The classic red was my favorite but the black raspberry was a close second. Austin had the mezcal mule which was delicious! They we had the brussel sprout salad which was full of flavor and freshness, along with the peri peri chicken which had a nice kick to it without being over powering. But the flavor there was unmatched! If you get anything get this plate. Although we didn't try any they did have vegan and vegetarian options available. We will definitely be back to try more tasty plates.
