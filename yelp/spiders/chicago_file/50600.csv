Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place was good and my friend was excited to find another fun place in her neighborhood she hadn't been. I know there are many people that hate them, but I am a huge fan of small plates. You get to try a bunch of different food. We tried a bunch of different plates to share which is the way to go. The bacon wrapped dates were a standout. There are so many choices though. If I lived in Chicago I'd have to go back to try different things.
