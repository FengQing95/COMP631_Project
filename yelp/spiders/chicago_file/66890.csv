Little Goat Diner////LG is quite a little operation and I'm glad we went there for breakfast.  I had hash and my wife had bulls eye.  We were there early enough to sit outside on a beautiful morning.  I wandered around a lot while there and was impressed by the bar, bakery, cafe, & restaurant.  This is a cool place and most important the food is great.  The taste of the bulls eye was so awesome and Mandy was so happy to find an egg hidden in her french toast.  My hash was great and it's what I often order so I like to think I have discriminating taste.  I enjoyed twisting my fork in the stringed potatoes like it was spaghetti and grabbing egg, corned beef.
