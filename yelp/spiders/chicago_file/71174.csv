Little Goat Diner////Breakfast is the best meal of the day, and Little Goat makes a case in point. This is where I take visiting friends and family to start out weekend mornings. Big booth seating, creative-approachable food and friendly service helps begin a Saturday right. Â It's dependably good and lives up to its hefty hype.
