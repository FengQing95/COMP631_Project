The Purple Pig////Fried pig ear - 3/5. Deep fried pig ear, served with kale and diced banana peppers. This was tasty, but I didn't feel like I got any pig ear taste, it could've been deep fried anything. Otherwise, the banana peppers gave a nice brightness to the dish that contrasted well with the slightly fatty/greasy pig ears and the slightly bitter kale
