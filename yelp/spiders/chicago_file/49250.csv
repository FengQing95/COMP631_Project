Smoque BBQ////My husband and I have been patrons since they opened.  Over time, we got tired of the wait and the lines, so the last several times we have done carry out by phone.  This has to be done a couple of hours ahead because the restaurant primarily focuses on those dining in or waiting in line to carry out.  We are diehard brisket fans and Smoque has the best around.  But for the first time tonight, we got home with the vittles and sadly, the brisket was unusually dry.  First time ever.  Fries were over cooked and dry, too.  This won't be a deal breaker - but we were somewhat disappointed...
