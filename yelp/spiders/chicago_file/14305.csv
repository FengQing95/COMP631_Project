Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Confession - I was raised on NY city pizza with good doses of New Haven 'za thrown in intermittently. My college roommate was from Chicago and introduced me to Chicago deep dish - he now lives in the Bay Area where we often go to Zachary's "chicago style" deep dish and thoroughly enjoy it.
