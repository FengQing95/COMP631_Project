Art Institute of Chicago////The museum itself has multiple wings and floors, so it's best to pre-plan or spend 5 minutes consulting the issued map once you are there.  I like the fact that the main staircase to the upper floor takes you directly to one of their most iconic paintings, "Rue de Paris, temps de pluie".  However, after you see it, you still need to venture to the next gallery back to see  the even more popular Sunday on La Grande Jatte.  They use the first one as a warm-up for the second.  There are, or course, a lot of other impressionist works in these and the adjoining galleries.
