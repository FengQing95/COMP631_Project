Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////My wife started with the biscuits and gravy.  The gravy was good but scarce and the biscuits were dense and not fluffy.  I had the breakfast scramble which didn't use any fresh ingredients which the mushrooms were the most notable.  The raspberry and white chocolate pancakes were amazing.  So we recommend sticking to the pancakes which this place is known for.  Not a foodie type of place.
