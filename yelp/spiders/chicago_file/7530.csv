Art Institute of Chicago////My last visit I was with my husband and a group of his friends (ok, not real art types....) and I was being rushed as the guys were getting anxious to get to our next stop.  So to maximize my time (ok, I'm not the best with directions and I get lost easily) my husband suggested I talk to a security guard that was working there and ask her where the things I was interested in were.  I was skeptical that this would work, but I was amazed at how helpful and patient she was with me.  She totally made my day, I was slightly irriated about being rushed through such a great place and she understood and helped me see more that I thought I would in my short amount of time.  She knew where everything was, got us there quickly and even provided us with commentary!  It ended up being the best museum trip ever.
