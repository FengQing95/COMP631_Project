Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The sangrias here are great. Any flavor is good, but I prefer the flavored ones over the traditional.  The meats are cooked really well and the potatas bravas are always good. The least impressive thing I've had on the menu is the escargot.  I've had it twice and both times it was overpowered by the cheese.  Good place to take date, if reservations seem too late just walk in, they always seem to seat me.
