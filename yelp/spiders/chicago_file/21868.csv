Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There was a long-ish wait for this restaurant on a Friday night. We ordered the pizza while we were waiting, and it still took some time to get the pizza once we were seated. Disclaimer: we were hungry, so the wait might have seemed longer than it really was. But when the pizza arrived it was delicious and quite filling! The wait staff was pleasant, but a little slow, and the restaurant was clean, but a little chilly.
