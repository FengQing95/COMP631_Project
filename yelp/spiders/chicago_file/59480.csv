Smoque BBQ////I don't know why but I can't get on the Smoque bandwagon; for some reason this place gives me a tummy ache, and not from over-eating because it's a tummy ache that is unique to Smoque. Everyone raves over the mac and cheese but I find it slimy and gross; the fries are soggy and dense; the baked beans are overly sauced and I can't taste the bean. The pulled pork and beef brisket are amazing and perfect and all that, but they use that Hawaiian style of bread, which I don't think works with BBQ; the sweetness of the bread combined with the sweetness of the sauce just makes the whole thing too sugary. I also never really care for a soft roll with loose meat. I need something firm in a sandwich, whether it's the bread or the stuff inside the bread. Overall, Smoque just doesn't quite do it for me.
