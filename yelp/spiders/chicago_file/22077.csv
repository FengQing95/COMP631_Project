Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Although the place was packed, they have a good system  and our wait wasn't long.. the pizza was amazing ! I recommend starting off with the cheese bread ! They give u two large pieces of bread covered in cheese with a bowl of marinara sauce to dip!!  Great place.  Staff was very nice and the beer was cold !
