Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my one and only real deal Chicago deep dish experience so I don't have anything to compare it to. Skip breakfast, skip lunch even. This pizza is rich and heavy! We made a mistake of ordering some appetizers and we could barely finish 1 slice when it came. We shared the Malnati Classic which is tomatoes, sausage, and a thick layer of cheese. It was absolutely delicious and we have craved it ever since but again, show up hungry! Our server was super attentive and nice.The restaurant is brimming with very cool black and white pics of celebrities that have visited along with Chicago history and cool sports memorabilia. Very authentic and memorable experience!
