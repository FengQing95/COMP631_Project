Little Goat Diner////Pretty wild to see the empire of Stephanie Izard and the West Loop/Fulton Market neighborhood grow side by side over the years. The first time this place opened, I was ecstatic that there is now a place to eat in the mornings on what is now called Restaurant Row. Today, of course there's numerous places to grub in the mornings now.
