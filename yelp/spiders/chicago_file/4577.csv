The Purple Pig////If you're in Chicago, you really need to stop by. They don't take reservations so plan ahead. The food they serve here is quite the experience! Everything we ordered was amazing. Everyone at the tables next to us looked like they all were enjoying their food as well! (The tables are quite tight here).
