Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We absolutely loved the design of this place. Â Comfortable and cool, with a Prohibition style feel, we felt right at home here. Food was mostly excellent. Rib eye steak was perfect, her short rib stroganoff was good (quite rich), we didn't love the duck terrine or the elote corn, but loved the brussel sprouts. Our waiter, Johnny, was great and was able to recommend a good bottle of wine when our first choice was not available. Already looking forward to the next time.
