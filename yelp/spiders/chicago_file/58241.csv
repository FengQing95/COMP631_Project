Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The empanada was fresh, crispy, and meaty. The creamy garlic sauce (aioli?) it came with was just fantastic as well. While the garlic potato salad was great, my favorite were the patatas bravas, which were so crispy but fluffy inside, seasoned perfectly, and complimented Â the garlic aioli so well. The seasoned chickpeas were tasty and filling, and the meatballs were so juicy and delicious, with a mild but tasty tomato sauce.
