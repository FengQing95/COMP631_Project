Art Institute of Chicago////I always thought Stendhal syndrome was a load of crock, I mean really? I love art but it always seemed a bit extreme to me to experience it at that level. Sure I get goosebumps and emotional when it comes to music, but this is a very visual place and while art moves, I didn't think it moved people quite that way.
