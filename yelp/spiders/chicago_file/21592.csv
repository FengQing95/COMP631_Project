Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Anytime I'm in a new city I like to try it's pizza, and this did not disappoint. Great deep dish pizza, with gluten free options if necessary. The only downside is the long wait, but because the pizza is made to order, it is to be expected with deep dish pizza. I would recommend leaving at least an hour and a half if ordering deep dish.
