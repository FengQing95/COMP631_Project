Smoque BBQ////Smoque is a no frills counter style bbq place where everything, even down to the sides, is wonderful.  I'm not normally a fan of chicken at bbq places, but this one is amazing.  The peach cobbler and the mac and cheese are also regular items for me.  It's byob and parking is pretty easy.  The only catch is that it's a popular place so sometimes you have to wait, but it goes pretty quickly and is definitely worth it.
