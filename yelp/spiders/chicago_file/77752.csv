Little Goat Diner////*Only Bongo Room can compete, but I think this is the best brunch item of mi vidaaaaaaaaa! My friend (who is a svelte 6'4" and can eat for three) got a bowl of fries (fine, kind of shoe string style), a pulled pork bbq sandwich (YES. Not v brunchy in my book, but SO GOOD), and a Fat Elvis (too sweet for me to want a whole one, but great for mooching).
