Little Goat Diner////I've been dying to try this place out for a few weeks now and finally got a chance today with a friend. The first thing we noticed upon walking in was how well decorated the restaurant was -- it has a very laidback diner feel but the quality of the booths and the natural lighting through the skylight gave it a modern, more upscale touch. And can I just say how awesome it is to have coat hooks right next to the booth? Ugh, so convenient.
