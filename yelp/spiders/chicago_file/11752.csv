Art Institute of Chicago////World class art museum!  A must-see, in my opinion.  I'd highly recommend buying tickets on-line in advance to avoid some long lines on busy days.  This saved us 15-20 minutes.  We were fortunate enough to visit while the Andy Warhol exhibit was being featured, which was plus, but I'm confident that everything they feature would be worthy of your time and money.  We spent 4-5 hours and barely scratched the surface.  Don't miss the impressionist exhibit.  It's an impressive impressionist display, if I do say so myself.  The cafe and gift shop are both awesome, as well.
