Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When visiting the pizza capital of the world a few weeks ago I was pleasantly surprised to eat the finest pizza of my life.  We had the Lou's famous pizza... sausage  , deep dish style.   It was so good... not talked about as much as Giordano's or some of the others... but absolutely the BEST.  Thank you.
