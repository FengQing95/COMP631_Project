Little Goat Diner////This is not a kid-friendly (i.e., infant/toddler) place. Parking is difficult, there is usually a long wait, and you feel kind of rushed during your experience. However, the food, ambiance, and service is wonderful. I love their shrimp and grits, and blueberry pancakes. The cinnamon rolls are amazing. And, I believe they serve breakfast all day.
