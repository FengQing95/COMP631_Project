Art Institute of Chicago////The art museum was sub par in my opinion. First when i walked up the lions were wearing helmets....? that is totally unrealistic and slightly ridiculous. Apparently the local hockey team was playing in some championship game, so I tried not to let it bug me as i entered. As you walk up the unkept stairs into the Institute i was not greeted warmly by any of the employees sitting on the stairs, instead i was harassed for change by them! their uniforms are filthy and many looked like they hadn't showered in days. when i got inside things got a little better.... but not by much. The art selection is very one dimensional and has a limited selection for someone with any taste in art at all. Many of the paintings looked as if they were painted by special ed third graders. Pablo Picasso was one artist that was scattered all over and possibly the worst art I have ever seen, yet it seemed to be set on a golden pedestal. Being a world traveler like myself, I have seen the 7 wonders of the world, this is not one, it isn't even worth mentioning in a brochure at a dentists office. I wouldn't even walk past this garbage heap again. I suggest that the city tears it down, as it is an embarrassment to everything and everyone that lives in the greater Chicago land area
