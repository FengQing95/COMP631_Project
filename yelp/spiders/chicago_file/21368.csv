Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The chocolate chip pizza is amazing and I don't even like sweets. The cookie is served warm and fresh in a small deep dish pan and topped with ice cream and whipped cream. I didn't want to order it the first time I was there because I was already full from the pizza, but after the first bite I made room in my stomach for the rest of it because it was that good. The individual serving is big enough to share between 2 people but you might have to fight for it.
