Art Institute of Chicago////Come for the art, stay for the experience. The Art Institute is an outstanding way to spend your time with others or even alone. There's such a great variety of art styles being presented through different time periods. Everybody will find something that appeases their interests. The regular price tickets may be on the expensive side, but is pretty worth it considering how much there is to see and how much of a day can be spent here. Be on the look out for certain days that offer free deals. I was able to get free tickets through a special offer from my university. Overall, you won't be sorry visiting the museum and will leave with lasting memories.
