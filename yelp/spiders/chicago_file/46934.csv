Smoque BBQ////i've been to smoque when it first opened a few years back and didn't return until recently when i was waiting for my mechanic at grace automotive to finish with my car. i ordered take out the beef brisket and pulled pork sandwiches and mac and cheese. Â i had forgotten how delicious it all was. i love how their fries are greatly induced with black pepper! i didn't mind waiting for the oil change as i munched on their awesome fries.
