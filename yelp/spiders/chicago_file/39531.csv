Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////You don't have to always get crazy with things. Stay tried and true and do it well. There's lots of value in that. At Bavette's, of course there's frites as a side. Of course there's asparagus served with butter. Fluffy bread to gather up all the meat juice? Oysters for appetizers? Yea of course, it all makes sense. This is an approachable traditional steakhouse, and that's exactly where they want to be.
