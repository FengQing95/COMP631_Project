Art Institute of Chicago////A visit here will set you an arm and a bloody leg.  There are discount days (Thursday evenings are free for Illinois residents) but there will be no peace and quiet on those occasions.  The Grant Park Garage puts you right underneath the museum and it will cost you less than a human kidney if you get in early.  Your best bet is to park somewhere near an El train line.  The Adams-Wabash station is a stop for Orange, Brown, Purple, Pink and Green Lines and that's just a block from the main entrance.  Excellent gift shop with a good selection of books.  Fear No Art.
