Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great pizza, but was it worth the wait? I polled our 9 guests after we waited 2 hours for a table. We tried thin crust, deep dish butter, veggie and cheese. Everyone said yes, worth the wait to check the box that they have been here and tried it, but no, they would not come back on their next trip to Chicago. It was good, but not life changing. We had a great time and our waitress was amazing. If you can have Laura, get her! Sample the goods, check the box, say hello to the traveler next to you (because no one in here is a local) and enjoy your pizza.
