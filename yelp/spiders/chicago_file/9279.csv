Art Institute of Chicago////An incredible collection of art!  So many classics.  Unfortunately, American Gothic was traveling.  Still, I spent 3+ hours here.  There's a wonderful variety of styles and mediums.  The impressionist collection was to die for.  Tickets are a little pricey.  I bought the fast pass, which amounted to about $7 more and I didn't even need to use it.  I went early, so there were no lines.  This truly I a must-do, if you appreciate art.
