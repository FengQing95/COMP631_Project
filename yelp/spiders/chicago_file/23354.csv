Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Classic Chicago deep dish. I'm not from Chicago and had never been before, so I figured I had to try this classic famous chain. It was okay. May be that I'm just not that in to deep dish in general, but the pizza was very saucy and cheese was kind of hard and not melty. Would probably try another place for deep dish next time.
