Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Only in Chicago will you find the best deep dish pizza.  Lou Malnati's is the best hands down, sorry Uno's.  Not once have I been disappointed with the outcome.  These are by far the best tomatoes I've tasted in my life, add that with cheese and the famous "buttercrust", you get a perfect pizza.  I've made it a point to go to Lou's at least once a month because it doesn't get better than this.  Hopefully they can work on getting a location in or one that delivers to Oak Park.
