Little Goat Diner////The food...I ordered a cup of tomato apple soup and was brought chicken bacon.  Once I tried it and realized it was smoky bacon in there and not tomato I had to track our server down to let her know.  Her excuse for this was that the runners see red (since both soups are red) and just grab one.  It happens.  Thankfully I am not a vegetarian, but I have a big problem with this.  Who is expediting?  Why would a runner not check to make sure they have the correct order?   Hopefully this is something that more training will work out?  The soup itself was pretty good.  Not WOW, but good.  I would get the goat chili every time though, it is fabulous.
