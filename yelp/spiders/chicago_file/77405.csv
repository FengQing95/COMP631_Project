Little Goat Diner////This was my second visit to Stephani Izard's wonderful diner.  Everything on the menu looks extremely creative, definitely not your typical run-of-the-mill breakfast and brunch spot.  I ordered the Tonkatsu, as it sounded pretty hearty and I was hungry after not eating all day.  The sandwich is massive, it's practically two sandwiches on 4 pieces of white bread!  It's comprised of a pork cutlet that has been pressed into a very thin breaded patty.  The Asian bbq and mayo form a very rich and creamy sauce.  I also split the macho nachos with a buddy.  Delicious but too much food!  The chips were based off corn tortillas but very different than most chips found at your local Mexican joint.  The chips were fluffy kind of like a pita chip.  All the toppings were well balanced and the nachos were not overwhelmed by the chili.  I also tried a piece of my friend's French toast, it's best described as a Toast version of chicken and waffles.  The fried chicken with the bbq maple syrup was outstanding.
