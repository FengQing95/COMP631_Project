Art Institute of Chicago////Now onto the lifestyle amenities. Art Institute of Chicago offers visitors a great place to relax, excellent cafes and great places to lounge around and rest. The cafe food is of high quality and reasonable prices. It is served in a modern and airy environment. There is a nice lounge with special seating for the extra special members. The courtyard is beautiful and romantic. On the Thursday that we went, there was live jazz music and fine quality appetizers and drinks to snack on....what a romantic place for a date.
