Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////No wonder there are always lines! This was our favorite pizza when we visited Chicago. We got the Chicago original and a small cheese and loved it. We also had a skillet cookie with ice cream that was our favorite as well. The wait was a little long, but it ended up being okay because they have customers pre-order Chicago Style Pizza because it takes a while to cook.
