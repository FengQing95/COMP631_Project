Smoque BBQ////// St. Louis Full Rack - $20.95 - Theses ribs are so tasty. They have a pretty decent amount of meat on them. They are very soft and tender. It is REALLY hard for me to decide which one I prefer: St Louis or Baby back ribs. The baby back ribs are smaller and more curved. They are a bit sweeter. But the St Louis are more straight on the bone and have a little bit more meat. Not as sweet. I would recommend you get some with a friend and split the two.
