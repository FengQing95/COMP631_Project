Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Always a great time at Ba Ba Reeba! Second time here, this time with a larger group and it knocked it out of the park yet again. We all just threw in 2-3 tapas and had plenty of food to go around, and many new favorites!! We also went with a couple pitchers of sangria which hit the spot.
