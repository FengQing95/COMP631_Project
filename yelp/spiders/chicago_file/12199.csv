Art Institute of Chicago////I haven't been to the Art Institute in forever. It's sad that we don't take advantage of our wonderful city. FYI.... The museum is Free on Thursday's and it's a $1.00 charge to check in your coat and book bags or any other carrying items that you bring into the Art Institute.
