Art Institute of Chicago////I love this place. It's nice to have a place were you can go and see beauty from start to finish. Even before you step inside, you see the lion statues and the building itself is wonderful. From impressionists to the modern wing it's all golden. I could spend the whole day wandering around in here. I always like to stop by the architecture exhibit.
