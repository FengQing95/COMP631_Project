Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first Chicago style deep dish pizza experience and it wasn't great. We waited over half an hour for a table and then a further 35 minutes for a warm, not hot at all, pizza to arrive. We orderd a salad too and had to ask them for it again as they clearly forgot. I had a dirty knife too.
