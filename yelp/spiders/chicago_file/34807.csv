Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As sides we split the creamed spinach and the elotes. They were fantastic. The creamed spinach at first alarmed me as it looked too well done but after I got past the crispy crust it was full of bleu cheese and caramelized onions and so comforting. The elotes was a dish of buttery corn with lime, chili, and Parmesan. A-Maize-ing (that was corny-!- but you're almost done reading) decadent and well seasoned. I hope they add a macaroni and cheese option, I may just fall in love.
