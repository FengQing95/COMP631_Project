Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Three eggs, bacon, hash browns + substituted toast with Wildberry specialty pancakes.  I didn't even need to pour the syrup on my pancakes.  Portions were more than enough and the bacon was thick and cooked to perfection.  Everything was delicious and the wait wasn't as long as we anticipated.
