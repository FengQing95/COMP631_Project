Smoque BBQ////I should start by saying that I'm a bbq enthusiast and smoke my own baby backs, spares, butts, and briskets.  I wanted to try Smoque because of all the raves it's been receiving.  Let's face it, Chicago is not the place for good q, but hopefully that's changing.  I tried everything they had and, for the most part, liked it (and it didn't cost as much as I thought it would).  It's nice that they actually smoke the meat, on the prem, in their big ol' Southern Pride Smoker.
