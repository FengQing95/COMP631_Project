Little Goat Diner////I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudit√©s platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I've also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!
