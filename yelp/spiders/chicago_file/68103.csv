Little Goat Diner////My friend and I both started with the Goat Chili.  It was delicious and bursting with flavor!  It would have been even better if it was served hot! It was a little on the cold side, and I even considered sending it back.  If it was a tad bit warmer, I would say it was the best chili I have ever had.  I guess that is why I couldn't be bothered with sending it back.
