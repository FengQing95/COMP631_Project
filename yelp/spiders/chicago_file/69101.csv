Little Goat Diner////As good if not better than Girl N The Goat...  The casual environment was fun, service outstanding, loved the menu (mix of traditional diner + foodie). My group had some eclectic eaters and some very picky eaters...we were all thrilled and can't wait to return.  Suggest to make a reservation, although we got lucky and walked right in about 5.30 on a weeknight with no wait. But it filled up immediately after we sat down. Very reasonable pricing too.
