Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza here is SO good!!! My SIL brought me a pizza when she visited me in Cali so when I visited her in Chicago, I had to bring one back! I Uber'd here and was told when I placed the order that it would be a 45 minute wait. I didn't mind tooo much. Just sat there and waited.. while I was waiting I looked at the menu and say they had already frozen ones ready for the taking so I picked up one of those too so I could take it and bake at home! The place is big but cramped, expect a wait, but if you like Chicago deep dish, this is the stuff!!!
