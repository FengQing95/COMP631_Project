Little Goat Diner////Menu was quite unusual, with a big Korean food influence.  If we wanted Korean food, we would have gone to a Korean restaurant.  Not what either of us expected and neither of us found the selections too appealing.  All the hype and heck, I could get a patty melt anywhere..nothing special about that, I wanted something that sounded good.    Nothing really did.  Kimchi was one of the sides and other items I had never heard of, with no explanations of what those were.  I'm not a newbie to dining, whatsoever and my friend was a chef instructor and we both were very disappointed, so we left after our wait.
