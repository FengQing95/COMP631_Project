Smoque BBQ////(I'm addressing the new location in the old CPS building in the loop, on Adams across the street from the post office) Actually, nothing to "complain" about here... just not worth a "rave" of any sort.  I had the (sliced) brisket sandwich and the jalapeno sausage.  The brisket was tender enough (a bit dry) but had just the BAREST hint of smoke - my guess is they are wrapping it too soon, and it's just not getting enough "smoke time". The sausage had a good bit of heat (a nice surprise, since they usually back off a bit so as not to offend!) but was so INCREDIBLY greasy that it seemed to be trying to slide down my throat before I'd really chewed it.  Potato salad was good, but middle of the road, and an extra 0.50 for pickled jalapenos seemed a bit of a stretch (like I was being asked to pony up extra for the ketchup on a hotdog, or a pickle on my cheeseburger).
