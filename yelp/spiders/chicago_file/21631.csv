Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Which was delish. Our small pizza was perfect for me and my man, I'm a small eater and he's a big eater. We got "The Lou", which was decorated with spinach, mushrooms, and fresh tomatoes. The crust was crunchy, almost buttery, albeit kind of bland. Â Deep dish deliciousness all the way and the toppings picked up the slack. Definitely a noteworthy Chicago deep dish go-to!
