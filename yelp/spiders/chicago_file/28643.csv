Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here around 11am on a Saturday in case there would be a wait.  Restaurant was mostly open but filled up by the time we left. Got the calamari as an appetizer and it was amazing! Pizza was really good - nice crunch on the crust and the sauce was well-balanced.  Enjoyed the Lou (vegetable pizza) more than the classic (sausage); the Lou has cheddar which I thought enhanced the flavor whereas the sausage wasn't as much as a favorite.
