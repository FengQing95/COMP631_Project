Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place is between and 4 and 5. I so love steak and they do it well. The dry aged bone in rib-eye is the way to go. I considered just the Chicago Cut ribeye but my sister emphasized I should go bone in. Ok, twist my arm. It was so tender, flavorful and perfectly coooked (please don't order it well done). Yes, I couldn't finish it but I enjoyed it for the next two days. So we started with cocktails, solid but nothing spectacular. The oysters were excellent fresh and tasted of the sea. We also shared the crab and avocado salad, you have to get this. I could eat it everyday, it had a perfectly dressed Bibb lettuce and half an avocado with a crab salad. Doesn't sound mind blowing but it was. I tried my husbands steak frites, tasted ok but not as good as mine. My sister got the fried chicken (insert sigh). This was after she told me you don't go to the steak house and order fish. It looks dry and overly cooked. The sides mushrooms were good. But their creamed spinach was overly salty and sweet. So a couple of misses. Next time I go, I'd order the dry aged ribeye and that avocado crab salad.
