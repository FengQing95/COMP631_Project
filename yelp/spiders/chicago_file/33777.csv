Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's exceeded all expectations for a birthday dinner from their perfectly made cocktails to the engaging service (I believe our server's name was Brandon?).. the romantic and dark ambiance (downstairs in the parlor) to the wonderfully tasty garlic shrimp.. from the most impressive Wedge salad I've ever eaten to their steaks prepared to perfection. I can't wait to return with friends for a cocktail and oysters upstairs, or for another cozy date night downstairs. What a wonderful addition to the Chicago restaurant scene!
