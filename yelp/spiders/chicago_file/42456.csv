Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////In general food was great, I had some Pinxtos, Montaditos + Tapas.  The waitress was very friendly. I highly recommend the calamares a la plancha. The only reason I did not give this place a five star review was because the guy serving the food just threw the food on the table, and when some of the food spilled of the plate he just said "oh sorry" and left. This happened twice.  Love the food just not the service.
