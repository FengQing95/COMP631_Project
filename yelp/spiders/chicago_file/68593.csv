Little Goat Diner////I heard about this place when looking up where to eat in Chicago. Came for breakfast on a Saturday, the food, staff and cleanliness of the place was great. We waited about 20 min to be seated but once we sat everything was a lot quicker than we expected. I ordered the bulls eye french toast and it was phenomenal!!! Unlike anything I've ever had. My hubby got the Little piggy went to China and it was amazing as well. Definitely coming back next time I visit.
