The Purple Pig////The food was nothing short of amazing.  We ordered the bone marrow, scallion garganelli (chicken bolognese), grilled octopus and affogato for dessert.  Every single plate was practically licked clean.  Since we had shared seating, I got a chance to see other patrons choices up close and everything looked mouth watering.
