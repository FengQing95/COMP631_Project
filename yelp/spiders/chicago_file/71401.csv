Little Goat Diner////The food we ordered was sublime.  I had the Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes, aka the Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing.  Hubby had the Bull's Eye French Toast, with a side of the home fries.  There were so many layers of flavor going on, complex but delicious and with a clear purpose.  For sure, it's the best breakfast food I've ever eaten in my life, and it ranks right up the with the best meals I've ever had as well.
