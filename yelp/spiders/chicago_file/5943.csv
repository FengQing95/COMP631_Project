The Purple Pig////I ordered from the bar and the service was great. The pork belly and steak came out within about 15 minutes from me placing the order and it was cooked to perfection. The steak had the thinnest crisp on the outside and such a tender middle. The pork belly was tender and flavorful. The sauce was very interesting. Almost like an Asian zing/orange sauce.
