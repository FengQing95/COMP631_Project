The Purple Pig////My friend and I ordered 2 cocktails off of the menu. She ordered a basic Old Fashioned and I ordered a House Cocktail (can't remember the name of it but it was vodka based). Our drinks were pretty standard in taste, and the presentation was nice but one of the main reasons why I gave The Purple Pig 3/5 is that if I'm paying $14+ for a drink I expect more than half of my glassware to have liquid in it. The large ice cube they put in my cocktail literally made up half of my drink (see picture). I was pretty shocked because I've never ordered a cocktail where most of it was just pure ice.
