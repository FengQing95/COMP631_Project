Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First up was the bacon wrapped dates (in some kind of apple glaze) and shaves Brussels sprout salad. The bacon wrapped dates were unreal! The apple glaze paired very well with it, and it wasn't too sweet. The Brussels sprout salad was also delicious. It was light. The dressing wasn't too much. And it had some kind of tangy cheese thrown into it, which I was a huge fan of.
