Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here for a friend's birthday in July, and I can honestly say I do not have a bad word to say about the place. I am not big on tapas or Spanish food, so I had no expectations walking in. They defiantly blew me out of the water on everything. The waitress recommended that each person pick 3 plates each and then just pass around everything to share, so that's what we did. A little tip that is WAY too much food!!!!! We were swimming in plates. But everything was very tasty, there was not a single plate ordered that we did not enjoy. My recommendation is to look for the things you know you like chicken, steak, veggie, or seafood and pick anything that sounds good. We went with a few adventurous options and really enjoyed those as well!! Â
