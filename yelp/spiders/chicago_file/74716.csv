Little Goat Diner////We also got some beers, but apparently the beer list they had was inaccurate so it was like playing Blind Man's Bluff but drinking. I ordered one I didn't like and when I let him know that it wasn't something I liked he took it away and gave me an Alpha King without charging me. "I'm not going to let you drink something you don't like."
