Smoque BBQ////I'm not a BBQ fan but this was crazy good. I had the brisket which was cooked so perfect that it barely took a fork to cut it. The slaw with it had GREAT flavor (homemade), I had the BBQ beans which were a bit smokey but had killer taste and the fries which were really good. My boyfriend had the pulled pork (I liked it a lot also) and we tried the sausage (I probably wouldn't get that again). We got there maybe 5pm and they were getting busy. I would either phone your order in or come a bit early unless you want to wait awhile. He was correct...this place is awesome...I'll be back!
