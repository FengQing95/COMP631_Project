Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I will always prefer New York style pizza but deep dish pizza is also spectacular. There's no need to debate which is better; New York is undoubtedly the superior style, but deep dish is also tremendously tasty. As far as I'm concerned it's a win/win. Lou Malnati's pizza packs a ton of sauce, sausage, and a bunch of cheese in every bite. It's sauce heavy, but the sauce doesn't overpower the sausage flavor. If you look at a slice's side profile, you'll see a beautiful layered portrait of bread, cheese, sausage and sauce (from bottom to top). It's a holy mixture that's sure to please.
