Art Institute of Chicago////I've been here a few times and i had alot of fun the first time and the second time was pretty fun also but would have enjoyed it if a rude security guard wasn't swearing at me and my cousin...anyways They have alot of really interesting stuff there to look at. I'm really into asian culture so i Â enjoyed looking at all the buddhas and everything.
