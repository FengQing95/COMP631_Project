Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It is really a pain (especially with a big group) when you have to be careful leaving room for everything on the table without spilling something.  Here you are seated at either a large round table, banquet table... whatever suits your group... with plenty of room for multiple plates and tapas to try, while still being able to converse with everyone.
