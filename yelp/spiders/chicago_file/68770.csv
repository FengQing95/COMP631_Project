Little Goat Diner////I've only experienced a couple facets of Little Goat. Picked up some bread to accompany a dinner and had a drink at their bar while we waited for our table over at Girl and the Goat. In both cases I was extremely impressed by what Izard is accomplishing at the little sister of Girl and the Goat. The bread is delicious and amazing (although not quite with the same amazing factor that you get across the street) and the beer list is small but well picked. I was really impressed with the house beer (Girl and the Goatee) brewed up by the folks at Haymarket down the street. I'm really looking forward to trying the diner portion of Little Goat to really get a feel for everything that's going on here.
