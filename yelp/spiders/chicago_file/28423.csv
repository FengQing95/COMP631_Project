Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Super nice restaurant in a really cute part of town, I would go back. I'm giving it three stars, however, for a few reasons. It was a little over meaty and cheesy, and overall I just believe pizza should not be eaten with a knife and fork. Goes against everything I love about eating pizza. Good experience though!
