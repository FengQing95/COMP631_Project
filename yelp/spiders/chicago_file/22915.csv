Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My only gripe was that I had ordered a personal pizza...which was was there and gone in 2 minutes. I wanted more but did not want to wait another 45 minutes. I secretly hoped the couple next to me who ordered a full-size pizza (and had many slices left, let me tell ya) would offer me a slice. Haha!
