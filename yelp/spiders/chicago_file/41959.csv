Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////While the menu is extensive, with plenty of options for hot and cold tapas.   I felt that the service was lacking, and the food is just  "OK."  I really had high hopes for this place as everyone seems to be raving about it all the time.  The only thing that was really good were the desserts.  The sangria was alright, but I've had better.
