Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Of note: they will tell you your table is ready and have you step inside. We weren't sure what to do with ourselves and stood awkwardly. There is a little lounge space, feel free to sit there until the host comes to guide you to your table (picture below) - we noticed this was the process for each group.
