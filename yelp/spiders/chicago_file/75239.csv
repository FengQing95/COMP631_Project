Little Goat Diner////I did my due diligence and RSVP'd a table for 15 people two weeks in advance. I adhered to their rules for larger parties on the weekend and agreed to an 8pm dinner slot. When little goat called 30 minutes prior to our arrival to confirm number of guest I promptly responded 15 people.
