Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////ORIGINAL - As far as food goes, I'd recommend give it a try. However, keep an eye on your credit card bill. They changed my tip, and I was charged $78 on the tip for a $90 meal (including $9 tax). Granted I rarely dine at this kind of restaurant, so I just wrote a normal 20% tip on the check, and my US friends always tell me I don't necessarily have to include tax when calculating the tip. I was dining quietly alone, and all service I asked for was food, drink, and an extra seasoned salt. It was my first trip to Chicago, and this dining experience is definitely the "highlight" of the trip.
