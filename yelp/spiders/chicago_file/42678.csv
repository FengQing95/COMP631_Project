Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////They apologized, and sat us immediately. Also gave us free appetizers, and also free dessert. The manager even walked the dessert out to us and apologized again. I felt bad because really we had only waited about 15 mins to be seated - not too big of a deal but they went above and beyond to make it right.
