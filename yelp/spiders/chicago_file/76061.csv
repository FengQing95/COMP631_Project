Little Goat Diner////Stephanie Izard's a force in the Chicago culinary scene. Sure, she's the first female chef to win Top Chef. But more importantly, she's staked her culinary claim in the West Loop area of Chicago, which is certainly a dining hot spot. Chef Izard's got Girl and the Goat & Little Goat Diner amidst bastions such as Aviary & Next as well as Publican & Blackbird. And something's clearly going right in her kitchen, because both of her locations are regularly packed.
