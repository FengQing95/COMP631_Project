Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had a fantastic time celebrating my friend's birthday here last night. We ate at the bar, and had the wonderful Victor as our server. The food was wonderful, especially the deviled eggs, beef empanadas, garlic shrimp, and tenderloin with blue cheese. Every dish we ordered was excellent, but it was really because of Victor that I would describe our experience as outstanding. He was friendly, attentive, and genuinely cared about giving us a wonderful experience.
