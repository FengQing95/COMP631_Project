Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Delicious! The first time I had ever had tapas, but I went with my tapas-experienced husband. I had been having a bad week and this place cheered me up. I ordered the special wild mushroom soup with aspargus-manchigo cheese toast / potato + onion omelette (with a delicious sauce) / olive platter and my husband ordered the "citrus cured salmon cucumber bread" and "beef skewer with horseradish cream and caramalized red onions".
