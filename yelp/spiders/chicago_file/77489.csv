Little Goat Diner////Goat Almighty Burger - DAMN, is all I gotta say. All the signs of its enormity were there: it cost $20 and even the waiter flat out warned us that it was pretty big. Having some pretty large appetites though, we sort've just dismissed these clues. Let's just say we were pretty shocked when it was brought to our table. This monster of a burger had two skewers lodged in there just to keep it upright. It was just so tall that there was no other way to eat it besides fork and knifing the thing or eating the top and bottom halves separately.
