Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ordered online from the Elk Grove location on Tuesday. We ordered 2 thin crust pizza's and a salad, and they said 40 minutes. We showed up 10 minutes after the time slot and gave our number and waited. We waited, and waited, and waited. 40 minutes later I had to get out of the car to inquire about the order. "Sorry we are really busy". He finally found the pizza- no salad. The pizza was cold- not warm but cold. Very disappointed in the service. I asked to see a manager and waited 10 minutes for her to come out- she did not. We have been coming to Lou's since it opened in Elk Grove. We love the pizza, but after this we will use White Cottage more often. The fact that the pizza had been done for quite some time and it was not due to it not getting made in time is not acceptable.
