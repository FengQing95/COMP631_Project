Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Sorry Chicagoans but I'm just not convinced. Chicago deep dish pizza still can't hold up to things we do better here in NYC... i.e. Pizza, bagels, baseball and electing horny politicians. I'm willing to give your pizza another shot next time I'm over there, especially because of my fondness for your crust, but for now, NYC it is.
