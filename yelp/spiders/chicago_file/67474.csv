Little Goat Diner////It too me a while to get back there for lunch but I finally did and everything was wonderful.  The food was tasty, the atmosphere was wonderful and the servers were so very friendly and helpful.  I will definitely return.  It was a delightful lunch.  My only reason for not giving it five stars is that once again the food did make my stomach do flip flops. In interest of full disclosure I do have a delicate stomach and the entrees have too many ingredients for my digestive tract to handle.  That being said, I'll take my medicine before I go back because I will go back and perhaps with stomach medication I will bump up my review to 5 stars.  I had the breaded whitefish taquitos and my friend had a goat burger and we share their wonderful fries!
