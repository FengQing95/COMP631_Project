The Purple Pig////Been back and forth about trying out this restaurant, but I am so glad I finally did. The entrance of the restaurant is confusing and beautiful at the same time. It gets super packed here so you can expect to wait for a seat. They have small tables, a bar, and two big community tables so you'll likely be sitting close to other people. The staff are not the friendliest, but honestly appeals to the ambiences of the place
