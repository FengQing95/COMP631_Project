Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Loved everything. I got the garlic shrimp first and I think it came with a lot of bread so I got full pretty quickly. Was a bit too full starting the bone marrow, which also came with more bread. The tokyo old fashioned was recommended to me by a friend so I tried it; I thought it was pretty great considering I don't like old fashioned's. Since I'm really a wine or vodka drinker, I got a great red wine recommendation by the bartender.
