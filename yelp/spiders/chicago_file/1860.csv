Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Went there with my friends a while ago. It was a very busy Sunday morning and we waited almost 1.5 hours to get a table. But it was worth the wait. The food was amazing! The red velvet french toast is to die for. We also had the Butcher block which was fantastic. The portions were generous, had lots left to take home! During the summer, the patio is perfect and it is conveniently located downtown. Great place to take friends and family visiting Chicago or even just brunch with the girls.
