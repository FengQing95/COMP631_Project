Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This is hands down the best breakfast restaurant in the entire Chicagoland area. If you have a party of 4 or less you can use the 'No Wait' app, otherwise be prepared for a long wait on the weekends, especially on Sunday. I will say though if you are up for it the food is absolutely worth the wait! If you go for the skillets or omelettes, for a dollar extra you can get a side of their specialty pancakes, the berry bliss are a must try!
