Smoque BBQ////PPPPS - You know what? I really should have done this review as a music analogy.  Like you know how there were a ton of versions of Hound Dog?  And the Elvis version is okay and all, but the Big Mama Thorton version is such an awesome different animal that it straight whoops Elvis's ass, but how the Elvis version is waay better that wack ass Freddie Bell and the Bellboys version? Okay, so at a real bbq place, like Barbara Ann's or something, that would be like Big Mama Thorton and the Bellboys would be like The Patio or Arby's or Famous Daves or something.  Smoque would be almost like Elvis.  And what's wrong with that, right? People like Elvis.  And good for them, too.
