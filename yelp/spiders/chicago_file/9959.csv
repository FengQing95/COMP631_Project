Art Institute of Chicago////The miniature house rooms(in the basement of the Michigan Ave side), the art library(forget the name, but it's also on Michigan Ave. side) and the old Chicago Stock Exchange room were always my favorite parts of this museum, but really there's so much interesting things to see here outside of those 2 things.
