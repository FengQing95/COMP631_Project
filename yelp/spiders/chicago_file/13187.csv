Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Yum!!! I'm much more of a thin crust NY style pizza fan but when in Chicago you HAVE to try deep-dish!! A friend who is from Chicago recommended Lou's and man am I glad he did!! This is by far the best deep dish pizza I have ever tried!! We had a little bit of a wait before the server got to us, but she was very attentive once she did. She was sure to tell us that the pizza would take 40 minutes to cook, so no surprises there. You have to try this place if you are visiting Chicago!!
