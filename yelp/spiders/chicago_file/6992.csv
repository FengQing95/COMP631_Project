Art Institute of Chicago////If you're currently in Chicago for any reason and you haven't been here, you need to hop on the next Brown line and get with the program. I love the Art Institute and that really means something coming from me because I'm more into science and hands on exhibits than I am hanging art. I have lived in Chicago for three years and the Art Institute keeps drawing me back. The modern wing is beautiful and could take up an entire afternoon alone. Some Thursday nights throughout the year they have free admission. Even if you do have to pay for admission the value is great. Admission is much cheaper than several other Chicago tourist hotspots. It is very easy to get lost so don't' attempt to rush into it and operate on a time budget, it's just not going to work. Allot your time wisely and just get lost in the long corridors and hallways. This is also a great place for a date as, in my opinion, it is very romantic and sultry. At Christmastime they hand wreaths on the lions out front along with some beautiful lights, don't miss it. If you have children, don't miss the miniatures exhibit. Being a nerd for the classics, I really enjoy the Greek and Mesopotamian art.
