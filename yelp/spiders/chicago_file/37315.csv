Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We ordered the foie gras which was yummy and served with a different selection of fresh, crusty bread. The crab cake was huge and by far one of my favorites, as it was filled with tons of meat and minimal breading, like, I did not even taste any breading at all. I do not usually like wedge salads because I do not eat pork, but this salad is served with 2 slices of thick bacon which can be easily removed. The salad was so good and the chunks of bleu cheese really set it off. We also ordered the elote corn and roasted tomato. The meal was fantastic, but it became one of my favorites of all time when we ordered Â the infamous chocolate cream pie and a side of the salted caramel gelato. The chocolate cream pie made my week! I will be requesting 2 whole pies for Thanksgiving!
