Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I made a reservation for my best friend and I to come here in celebration of her birthday. Neither of us had been here before, but we'd heard good things about it. We came on a Monday night, and expected it to be pretty empty. We were quite wrong! You'd never know that is was a Monday night here. There were lots of people there and the place was kicking! We got a table in the back area. The d√©cor of the entire place was GORGEOUS. There was art on the walls, dim lighting, candles in Mason jars - everything was just so perfect!
