The Purple Pig////Atmosphere: It was very cramped. The dining space is quite small and I can tell they try to accommodate as many people as possible. They have communal tables, so it's not really an intimate environment. I wouldn't choose to celebrate a special occasion here. A our communal table, there were FOUR separate groups (five of us and three pairs). There weren't any hooks for purses or coats. I had to awkwardly drape my big purse over my chair and people kept bumping into it as they walked by.
