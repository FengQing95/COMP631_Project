Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First of all, if you don't have a reservation you will have to wait... Awhile! It's worth the wait but I suggest planing ahead!  The sangria is out of this world and the food is delicious.  The goat cheese and marinara is amazing as well as spicy potatoes.  And #54!! It's great for groups IF you have reservations!
