Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For this being rated "one of the best" steak houses in Chicago... I was not impressed. The overall atmosphere was very cool. Dark and awesome decor. The service was good, but was not happy with my steak. I ordered the petite filet, medium rare. It came out extremely rare. I have never been picky about my steak, but the middle was downright cold. They brought it back and it was still cold in the middle. Luckily my boyfriend likes RARE steak so he ate it with no complaints. The sides were okay. Service and atmosphere were great, but I will not be coming back for a steak.
