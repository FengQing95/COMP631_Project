Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////was craving for pizza and wanted to give another pizza restaurant a try besides the usual Pequads i always go to..  came across Lou Malnati's Pizzeria since i saw a lot of reviews and high rating.. came here on a weekday night and it was pretty packed and had to wait 10 mins before being seated..
