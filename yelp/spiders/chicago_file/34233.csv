Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Excellent! I only hesitate to award five stars because we only enjoyed appetizers and cocktails, but OH did we enjoy them!! Yes, Bavette's relies heavily on its mood lighting, but it's attention to food and drink does not fall short. Â We were wowed by the beef tongue and the generous duck terrine.
