Art Institute of Chicago////An amazing collection of art; I only wish I'd had more time to see everything. I was a little disappointed with the embarassingly bad layout in the contemporary wing (and the more-than-usually pretentious wall text), but loved that you had to go through the strikingly modern asian art wing to get there.
