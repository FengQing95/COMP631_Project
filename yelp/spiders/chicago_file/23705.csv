Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I always thought deep dish would be thick dough. I have had Chicago pizza before at Giordanos and was not impressed. Malnati's pizza is layer after layer of cheese, tomato sauce, pepperoni (or sausage) then cheese again and so on. Never ending. When you bite into it, the cheese oozes along with the sauce perfectly. And the smell? heaven!
