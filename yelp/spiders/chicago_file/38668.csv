Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This most recent trip, we started off with the baked goat cheese.  It was so hearty, it was like eating eggplant parmesan.  Then I ordered the lamb chop with a side of bone marrow.  My boyfriend ordered the classic ribeye. We shared the loaded baked potato.The lamb chop was amazing! Not gamey at all, juicy and fatty deliciousness.  The bone marrow is a must. The ribeye was also perfectly cooked both temperature and seasoning wise.
