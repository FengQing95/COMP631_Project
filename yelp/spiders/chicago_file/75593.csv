Little Goat Diner////I try to stray from reviewing highly popular restaurants as I feel as though my review will get lost in the mix (unless it's a negative one because I had a bad experience and in that case I don't even hesitate to write). HOWEVER, this place is worth the hype. I walked here thinking this was Girl and the Goat and my tired eyes and hungry stomach just saw the little Goat on the top of the restaurant and assumed I had reached my destination. Because I was alone, I was immediately sat at the bar and given a menu that read "The Little Goat Diner" to which I said " Oh.". I had come this far and was already sat that I decided to stay, especially since after doing some research I knew this sister restaurant was just as good, and it was.
