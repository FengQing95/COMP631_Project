Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Honestly some of the best pizza I have eaten. Not as good as Reginas in Boston, but pretty damn good. The salads were also stellar.... Not giving the fifth star because their beer selection was not great and for a great pizza place, the beer selection should match the great pizza.
