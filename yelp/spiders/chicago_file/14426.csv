Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////...So, if it was just the pizza, I would have given this place 3 stars. But since the salad was so freakin' good... I'll give it 4. Oh and the soda was freakin' big too... I guess that's a plus. Oh and the company was great. :) Overall, I am not impressed with THIS Chicago style deep dish pizza... Who wants to recommend another one that might beat Zachary's? ;) Coz it's still the best thing ever!
