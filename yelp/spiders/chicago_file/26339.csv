Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had the Chicken club salad and the Lou's deep dish pizza. The salad had chicken, bacon, and a couple of different cheeses. Tasty but too heavy for us. The pizza had mushrooms, tomatoes, and a lot of cheeeeeeze. Pizza crust was nothing to write home about. Too heavy. Prefer NY thin crust.
