Smoque BBQ////The bad - the brisket. It was cooked too long or too high resulting in a brisket that practically fell apart like a pot roast. I was hoping for a little more texture.  Also, the crust on the brisket slid right off which was due to the fat underneath. A bit weird for me.  I didn't care for the sauce much either. There was a flavor in the sauce that made me pass on the extra provided.  The ribs were also very tough. You can't really separate them easily and biting in doesn't really work that way it should.
