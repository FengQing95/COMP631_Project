Smoque BBQ////Now onto the food. I got both types of ribs (no regrets) and my roommate got the brisket. I was shocked but I actually liked the St. Louis style ribs even better than the baby back ones. There was a ton of meat and while it's a dry rub, it comes with killer BBQ sauce on the side that you can drench them in. I dipped everything in that BBQ sauce. Fries, corn bread, ribs, brisket, my hands, my face. It was so good.
