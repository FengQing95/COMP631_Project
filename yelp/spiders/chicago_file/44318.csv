Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Café Ba Ba Reba is a great spot to go with a group of friends and enjoy a bunch of different small plates and some great sangria.  Make sure you make a reservation because this place is always packed!  I think they even do a great bar deal for happy hour and late night diners.  My favorite things to order are the goat cheese and marinara sauce, the bacon wrapped dates, spicy potatoes and the beef tenderloin & blue cheese.  I like the red and white sangria - get a pitcher because it's worth it!  Café Ba Ba Reba is another great LEYE restaurant so if you're a member, bring your card and get those points.  Also, check-in on yelp... you will get a free dessert or something similar.  I've been here many times and will continue to go because I have never had a disappointing dish here.
