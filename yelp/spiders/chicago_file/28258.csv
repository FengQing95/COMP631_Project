Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ate the pizza with a knife & fork, the pie had cooled and we didn't get that stretchy goo of mozzarella. It thought "Italian sheppards pie", the tomato flavor of the sauce was outstanding. I'm not going to say it wasn't good and it wasn't bad but been there done that keep the shirt.
