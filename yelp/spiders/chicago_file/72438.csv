Little Goat Diner////Food: Average. Elvis waffles were burnt, plain bagel was salty, and the fresh fruit had a garlic taste to it (I did mention the garlic taste to the server and to his credit - he offered a replacement). The Elvis waffles weren't completely lost - love the peanut butter and the bacon syrup.
