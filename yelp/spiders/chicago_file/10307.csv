Art Institute of Chicago////Having our cocktail reception in the Grand Staircase, a private viewing of the Impressionist Exhibit, to come looking above the the dinner reception in the Modern Wing... guests were not only pleasantly surprised but just floored at how beautiful it was. Although we missed the cocktail hour because we got to take pictures on the bridge (in front of the best view of the city as our back drop) everyone complimented the cocktail hour, and the food throughout the reception. It was consistent and exactly what we had at the tasting. FEW RECS:  a super elegant touch was having desserts passed around by servers.  As people are dancing the night away, desserts were at our fingertips instead of confined on a table in one area.
