Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got here around 7:30 PM on a Sunday. We were quoted for a 90 minute wait, but got inside in less than an hour (funny how an hour-long wait became something to celebrate). After that, it took another 40 minutes or so for the pizza to get to our table. One negative was that, instead of leaving the pizzas at our table, the waiter kept it on a tray by the wall, which means that we had to wait for him to come by every time to refill our plates. I don't know if we were allowed to just walk over and get our own slices or what, but that was kind of just a strange thing, and since the restaurant was crowded, we ended up sitting around waiting for more pizza, which should not have happened. So the service wasn't the best, but it was tolerable. However, the ambience was the best of the four pizzerias that I visited - just a nice, clean place to enjoy great pizza.
