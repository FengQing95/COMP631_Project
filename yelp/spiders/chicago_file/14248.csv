Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you like or want to try deep dish the Lou's Chicago Classic (sausage) is the best there is to me. Excellent Malnati house salad.  Also the vegetarian "Lou's"  thin crust is exceptionally good.  Really never had a bad experience - always great - just plan, order or book reservations well ahead of need - as it gets crowded.
