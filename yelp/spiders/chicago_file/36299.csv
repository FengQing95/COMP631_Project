Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Love this place!! One of the best restaurants in Chicago...My husband and I have been going here since they've opened and now just writing a review! Â The food is amazing! The wait staff is awesome went there last Saturday on the fly and got a table by the bar within minutes(which is unheard of for the most part) Michael the bartender waited on us and he was great!!! Good conversation but not over baring brought us over som e champagne since he knew we were on a loooong overdue date night (bc of a 2yr old) little things like that go a long way!! Love this place!!
