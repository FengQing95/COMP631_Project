Smoque BBQ////My boyfriend and I went out to Smoque on a date due to a suggestion from my brother who saw the place reviewed on tv. What we got was not exactly what I was expecting. The place is kind of assembly lined like a fast food restaurant. That is, they turn tables, fast. Also if you think you're getting your own private table to eat your meal, don't count on it. A server walks through the line and gets a count for your party and somehow by the time you get to the front of the line to order your food there is a place to sit. We were set next to a nice couple who makes Smoque a regular stop on their way through the area.
