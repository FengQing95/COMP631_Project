The Purple Pig////Loved the environment, while it was quite busy it wasn't so loud that you couldn't hear each other across the table.  The restaurant is in a great location to take a stroll down Michigan Ave afterwards to try and digest some of that yummy food.  I will definitely be returning next time I'm back in town!
