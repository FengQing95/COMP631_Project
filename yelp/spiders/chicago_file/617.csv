Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I must come here every time I am in town. Absolutely love the Wildberry pancakes. All the coffees and teas are delicious. Ham and bacon are actual meat not frozen squares of toughness. I have never waited more than 5 mins for a table and have always had helpful and friendly staff.
