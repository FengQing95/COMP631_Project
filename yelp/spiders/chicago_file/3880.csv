The Purple Pig////Won't lie, I always thought this was a burger place and just never walked in (not that there's anything wrong with burger places, I'm just generally not in the mood for burgers). What a delightful surprise when I found out this was one of the more popular downtown, small plate, locations that is notoriously hard to just walk-in to.
