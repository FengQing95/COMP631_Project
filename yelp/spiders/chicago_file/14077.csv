Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was the best deep dish pizza I ever had.  The pizza was perfect and despite the restaurant being packed, the service was excellent.  The pizza was worth the wait and I think this chain is better than giordanos.  Overall, the restaurant was good because the pizza was crispy and flavorful
