Art Institute of Chicago////After coming here for several years, I've come to the conclusion that this is one of the best conglomerations of artistic relevance in the United States. On top of its numerous collections, it has an amazing impressionist collection, including some very famous paintings that I don't even need to mention. If you're in Chicago, you have to see this place at least once before you leave, it is worth every dollar you spend on admission. I suggest the free Thursdays after work....
