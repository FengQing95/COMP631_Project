Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Despite my delight in the paella and the dates - if I come back, I'll be getting both again - Ba-Ba-Reeba didn't really change my mind regarding tapas places.  To fill yourself up, you need to order several items.  The variety is nice, friendly to the taste buds, but less friendly to the wallet.  I can definitely see the appeal of this place; some of the food was quite good.  However, it's hard for me to look past the price for these small dishes, which ultimately prevents me from giving a better review.
