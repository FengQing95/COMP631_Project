Smoque BBQ////While the sides are,,,well, just that, their beans deserve mention as well.  They come as an appealing mixture of textures, and smoky flavors.  Fries are crisp and fresh.  Also, I tried the peach cobbler once, which is served hot, and loaded with peaches and crunchy crust, but in the future I will just eat more of whats in front of me without seeking desert.
