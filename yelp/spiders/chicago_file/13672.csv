Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Have been here a couple of times now. It is nice because you can order your pizza while you wait. This location isn't very big. The prices are not bad. Did not see a difference in what the butter crust means. The pizza is lighter than Giordano's and the sauce has a lighter flavor but it's nice. The deep dish cookie is pretty good.
