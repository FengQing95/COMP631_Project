Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////With all our own positive feedback from all the items we sampled this night, I will have to say that I am truly going to miss Lou Malnati's. Again, another satisfying pizzeria that is only located two time zones away from me. =( Come on Lou, open a spot in LA and we'll bring you plenty of business.
