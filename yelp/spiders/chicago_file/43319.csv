Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had the Atlantic salmon, the goat cheese with marinara, the stuffed mushrooms and the roasted eggplant with goat cheese. (Well I shared all four of these dishes, I don't think that I could eat all of that!) Everything came quickly and was hot hot hot (except for the dishes that were supposed to be cold) All was good (the goat cheese is always my favorite)
