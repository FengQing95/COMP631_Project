Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////THE BAD: We rushed to get there exactly 8:20pm and that is where the BAD started. We walked in and we were told it would just be a few minutes, but we should just go sit inside and get a drink. I was famished, and the last thing I wanted was to wait. I had just spoke to the hostess 25 minutes ago arriving exactly when I said, for an 8pm table that she was holding. How is it that 20 min after our reservation someone is still eating at our table? I'll tell you, poor management skills for an upscale restaurant is how.
