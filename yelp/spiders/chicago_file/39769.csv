Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////All in all, this was definitely an enjoyable experience. This is obviously a top notch restaurant that serves quality food, and offers an awesome atmosphere to enjoy it in. Service was great. Is it the best? No. I had better in Chicago just during the 6 days I was there. Would I come back? Yes, but not on my dime. I'm onto the next place. Go ahead and check it out for yourself.
