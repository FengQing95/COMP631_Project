Little Goat Diner////OMG!  Do not pass up the crab dip appetizer!  It is the kind of dish you'll wish you had ordered for the main course as well.  Delicious doesn't even begin to describe it. It's a melty, creamy, savory, mouthwatering, crabtastic experience that delivers the type of overwhelming joy I can only compare to the first time I went all the way... with someone else... It was so satisfying, yet it was finished much too quickly.
