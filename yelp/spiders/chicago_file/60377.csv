Smoque BBQ////The line can be a bit of a wait, but it is well worth it. That is, is if you can withstand every single person exiting the place (the exit conveniently next to the line) thinking they are at amateur comedy night at the Apollo. My personal favorite was: "Oh no, they are all out, sorry about that (as they rub their belly)". About every third person out the door gave us that one... However, for every person that made the obnoxious joke, there was another behind them offering a supportive: "Don't worry it's worth the wait (also while they rub their belly; that is a consistent theme)". Â Overall, if you haven't already been there, I'm jealous of you that you get to go for the first time very soon...
