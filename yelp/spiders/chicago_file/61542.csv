Smoque BBQ////I rocked up at dinnertime on a Thursday, and the host told me all about the system. You have to order your food, and when you've finished ordering, he'll find you a table. We learned upon arrival that it's BYOB (poor research on our part), so we had to make a quick trip to 7-Eleven before we could order. No big deal.
