Little Goat Diner////Good breakfast spot. Been here two times now. First time got the little goat goes to China. Second time got the parathas burrito. The description said it had chili oil, but I couldn't taste any spice or heat at all. Flavor wise was good, but it could have used a kick. The cinnamon roll was warmed before so it was nice and gooey, and their house blend coffee was very nice and earthy. While the food has never been outstanding, we keep coming back because the service is phenomenal. Our waiter was super attentive even with a full breakfast crowd for the hawks game, and gave us to-go coffees for our morning walk. Will keep coming back!
