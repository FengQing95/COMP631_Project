Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Unfortunately I would have to say the pizza was pretty good, but not mind blowing. We ordered the Chicago Classic Pizza. The ingredients tasted fresh, but were a bit bland and watered up pretty quickly in the middle of the pizza, causing the crust to become soggy. The butter crust was okkk..kind of a dry, bland corn meal type crust. The cheese did not appear to be of high quality. It was more on par with mozarella from Round Table or Pizza Hut.
