Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For as long as I can remember Lou's has been my place for great pizza.  When I found a long hair in my pie, yeahhhhhh lets just say that was a huge turn off.  Its been really difficult for me to over come and enjoy their pizza since.  However, still think they have the best in Chicago....just couldn't move past the hair.  If I rate the pizza alone its 5-stars, but this last experience....not so much.
