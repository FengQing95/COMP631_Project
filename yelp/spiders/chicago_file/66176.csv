Smoque BBQ////We go out of our way to go to Smoque when in Chicago. We are picky with barbecue- especially with brisket- and Smoque always hits the spot.  High quality ingredients, amazing flavor, tender meat, solid sides... it's worth going out of the way for.  Definitely the best brisket in the Midwest. Parking can be a challenge, but we make the trek anyway.
