Art Institute of Chicago////The museum is expansive with their addition of the Modern Wing. It's the second largest art museum in the United States. We didn't even get to visit all the collections. There were many artists represented that included household names and artists that I remembered when I took humanities as an elective in high school (I guess the class wasn't a total waste of time.).
