Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Meh - it was just barely ok. I have had better fried mozzarella sticks from the local grocer's freezer section. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to have this deep dish. I just gave half of my leftover pie to a very nice homeless lady. I hope I didn't offend her by handing off this kinda bland pizza.
