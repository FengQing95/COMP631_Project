Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I haven't even eaten here yet. I just got seated but my pizza is already coming since I ordered when I checked in with the hostess. Crazy popular and busy place but they manage it outstanding!!! Â Best pre service operation I have ever been to. I'm pretty positive the pizza will be good to. Kudos to the hostess and the bar tender who kept me happy while I waited for a table!
