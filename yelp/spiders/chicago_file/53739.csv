Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered the octopus, but it came out burnt. The service was good in that the server came out with another plate right away, but the second plate was still semi-burnt. We also tried the seafood paella. It was good, but not the best I've had. The rice was soft and crunch at the same time, but I wish we had more seafood and more flavoring.
