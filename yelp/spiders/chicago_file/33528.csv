Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Tonight's experience was less than stellar. I fear Bavette's is getting too big for its britches, starting to suffer from an Emperor's New Clothes effect -- people who don't really know what they're talking about blindly praise it and the restaurant believes the hype and stuff starts to slip. It's drinking its own I'm-so-cool Koolaid.
