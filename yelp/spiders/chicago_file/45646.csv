Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our waiter was great. We tried a couple tapas, and they were awesome. We ordered the seafood paella, and it was simply amazing. I may have peed my pants a little, it was so good. I may have almost ruptured my stomach from too much food, but it was all so good that I could not stop eating as leaving anything on your plate would have been nothing short of an abomination.
