Little Goat Diner////Interior/Exterior: It's in the West End of the Loop. Having never been there before we were intrigued to go. We were amazed at the beauty of the recent development that is has gone through in the past few years. Little Goat fits in this neighborhood like a missing piece to a puzzle. The neighborhood is charming, and the design compliments the hip and low key attitude of it's residents. Â We liked the rotating door that faces the corner, and the potted pine trees on top of the building with twinkle lights. (They can be seen through the main dining rooms skylight too.) The burlap looking canvas shades worked nicely with the slightly distressed bold font on the windows.
