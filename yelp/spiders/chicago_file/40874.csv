Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////REALLY GOOD SANGRIA, but REALLY BAD SERVICE!  These waiters don't give a shit.  They made me feel inferior for not being able to eat gluten.  The guy told me that he couldn't list the things I couldn't eat on the menu, but he could tell me if what I wanted had gluten.  He was super rude about it.  I don't know why but he delivered food that he repeatedly told me I couldn't have and then said to me as he was dropping it off, "you can't eat this".  What the hell????  I was so pissed.  If the sangria wasn't amazing, I would have left.  I didn't even want to tip him and that is really rare for me.  He rushed us out and made us feel bad if we asked him to come back when we weren't ready to order.  Isn't the point of tapas to be a nice long meal full of small dishes?  What the hell?  Also, the walls are weird.  They have gold claw marks in them and the main room looks very "cafeteria".  Get the sangria but try to ignore the waiter.
