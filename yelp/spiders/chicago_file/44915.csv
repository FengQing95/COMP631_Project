Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The bacon wrapped dates were like eating tiny pieces of heaven.  The deviled eggs were so good that we ordered seconds!  The cheeses melted in our mouths...and I know my boyfriend loved the meatballs.  Amazing.  Simply amazing.  the calamari was a LITTLE overcooked, but it was good, nonetheless.
