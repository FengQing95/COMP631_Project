Little Goat Diner////Like a fool, I waited over an hour to eat here.  I assumed that it would be at least as half as good as her other restaurant.   I didn't even really like the menu.   I like strange things but the strangeness of this menu didn't work for me.   It reminded me of how I copied Madonna when she first hit the scene: the gloves, the bracelets, the lace, the headscarf, the hair, the lipstick, the black m.c. Hammer pants (I actually went to school dressed like that) - I was trying too hard and so is this menu.   And am I a jerk for saying that it is too touristy?  It in no way compares to her place across the street so don't even....
