Art Institute of Chicago////I have been going to Chicago's Art Institute for decades, and it never fails to disappoint. I have been to art museums all over the country, as well as in several European cities (Paris, notably) and still feel that this is a standout museum on so many levels--the magnificence and variety of its collections, the grandeur of its displays, the sheer impact of the building and it's setting. I love being there.
