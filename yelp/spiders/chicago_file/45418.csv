Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have only eaten here for dinner, so I cannot say how it is for lunch.  I typically order a couple of my favorite tapas and one or two new things I have never tried each time I go.  They now have some even smaller tasting tapas called pintxos, and if you are really hungry you can order the larger paella rice dish.  if you get the Paella, order it right away since it takes quite a while to get - and there is a minimum order of two, so if you really want to get this, make sure you are going with someone else that wants it also.
