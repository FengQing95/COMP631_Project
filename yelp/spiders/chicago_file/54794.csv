Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here on a Monday night and it was the best thing because of the $5 cocktails!! which we didn't know about before coming here (bonus :D). Everything on the menu is around $6-$8 and I recommend 2 dishes per person. We ordered spicy potatoes with tomato alioli, rioja-braised short rib, and galician empanada of bay scallops all were pretty amazing. The tab came to about $20 per person (super cheap for tapas) :)
