Little Goat Diner////We didn't love the Okonomiyaki and I think it's because there seemed to be a lack of presence from the pork belly. I imagined that it would be chopped or in the scallion pancake, but I *think* it was shaved on top? Not sure. The Okonomiyaki also had a strong fish sauce/ shrimp paste taste to it, again not sure which one, but we didn't love it.
