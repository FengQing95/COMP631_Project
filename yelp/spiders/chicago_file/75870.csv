Little Goat Diner////Food - Lots of flavor, i ordered a "This Little Piggy Went to China" Sesame cheddar biscuit. Sunny side eggs. Szechuan pork sausage. Chili garlic chive sauce. Gooseberries, something different for me and had good flavor a bit overwhelming and hoped that the sweet would cancel out the saltiness of the other ingredients but dint happen. the dish was too salty for me and struggled to finish.
