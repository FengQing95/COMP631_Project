Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Picture this on our last visit : a 9 month pregnant woman, three adults and 3 toddlers (which make a party of 7), decide to wait for exactly 1 hour and 40 minutes to fulfil their craving of the Belgian waffles. The kids and the pregnant woman obviously tire out and are glad when their name is called out. The manager then brings you to the table but refuses to let you sit down because one of the adults in the party isn't there. We proceed to tell him that we are all ready to order and the missing adult had to run out Â to get something for the toddlers after such a long wait and that the very visibly pregnant woman is really tired. He smugly pulls out 1 chair and says only she can sit down in a corner and the others have to wait till the 1 adult is back. The next minute the missing adult rushes in and they are allowed to sit. The very busy server than takes your order and goes missing for the next 28 minutes when he finally brings out orders for 4 people and proceeds to lie rather than apologize for forgetting the orders of two people on the table and who now wait an extra 20 minutes to get their food. So after arriving at 10.07 for breakfast you get food at 12.34.
