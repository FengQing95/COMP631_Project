Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm no connoisseur when it comes to deep dish pizza but I know what I like and what I don't like and I like Lou's deep dish. We ordered a classic sausage deep dish pizza and it tasted deliciously delicious. Â The dough was buttery and didn't taste doughy. I've tried other places and the crust had that distinct doughy taste of something from the 80's. Anyways, the cheese was thick and gooey and stretched out with every bite. The sausage patties were thick and had a bit of a nice spicy kick. The tomato sauce was sweet, tangy, and chunky. Great service! Our server came over to our table on multiple occasions to check up on us. All of these elements combined made this deep dish my "go to" place if I'm visiting Chicago.
