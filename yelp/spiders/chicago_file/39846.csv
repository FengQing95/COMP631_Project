Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Steaks are all $55+ except for the petit filet.  I got the bone in New York strip, which was tender and at the level expected for a steakhouse.  I did think that the steak was a bit more chewy than I hoped it would be - but maybe I should have gotten it medium rare instead of medium.  My wife had a crabcake and a salad, which were also at the level expected for a steakhouse - kind of average because it was not a steak.
