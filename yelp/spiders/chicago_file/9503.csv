Art Institute of Chicago////Docents were on top of it without being intrusive and I received a very nice tip from one of them. When you are exiting the museum, turn left past the coat check and take the elevator up to the walkway. You descend into Millennium Park with the most beautiful view of the city, Pritzker Music Pavillion and the Cloud Gate (the "Bean").
