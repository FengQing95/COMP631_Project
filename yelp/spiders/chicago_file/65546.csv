Smoque BBQ////My husband says this is the best brisket he has ever had. It is dangerous to live so close to this barbecue staple! So I'm a vegetarian and I just wish there was a smoked tofu or maybe entree-sized Mac n cheese option. I tried a salad once and was unimpressed, but hey I didn't expect a lot from a salad at a BBQ joint. I know it's probably sacrilege to complain about veggie food at a BBQ, but we would go there more frequently if they had a couple more options. My meat-eating friends and family cannot get enough of the place though!
