Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As far as the food goes everything was amazing there was nothing I didn't like. Some of the highlights for me were the bone in filet mignon, east coast oysters, Mac and cheese, and to my surprise the mashed potatoes. I really dislike mashed potato's but someone at the table ordered them and they were magical. Oh and don't forget dessert, carrot cake was out of this world.
