Art Institute of Chicago////I see the building several times a week when I walk by for work...it has a regal appearance.  I came in yesterday for the end of "free February," alas I came for the last 20 minutes before the museum closed.  But I've been here before and it reminded me how much I like it.  It houses quite impressive pieces of art, and it might be smaller than some of the art museums in New York or other international cities, but I think it can hold its own.  My question is, how much do you have to donate to get your name on the wall?
