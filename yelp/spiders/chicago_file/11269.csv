Art Institute of Chicago////This is truly a world-class museum. We came here in the late morning and stayed almost to closing and didn't get to see everything. They have an extensive collection of Asian art and sculptures, Roman and Greek sculpture, medieval armor and art, and post renaissance and modern paintings. Â
