Little Goat Diner////We popped in for lunch Friday afternoon (without reservations) and got seated right away! For a trendy spot in Chicago I was so happy to see they had crayons and a menu coloring mat for our 2 year old! They also didn't seem annoyed we brought a toddler in . I would definitely say make reservations if you want to eat here. The food was great. I got the grilled cheese with a cup of the tomato apple soup. My hubby got the patty melt. Both were delicious. Their fries are so unique and good! They had a smokiness taste to them. Couldn't stop eating them!! After lunch we ordered a birthday chocolate malt for our daughter - they were so nice to put a candle on top and the waiter even stayed to sing happy birthday ! We are from Milwaukee so we were very happy with our choice to pop in and try this restaurant - definitely try their other restaurants as well! Girl and the Goat is one of my favorites :)
