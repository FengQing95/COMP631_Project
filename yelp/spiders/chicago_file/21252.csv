Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Coming from San Diego we have a couple places that do make deep dish pizza but never tasted like this! We ordered the calamari for our appetizers and it was delicious as well and a large pepperoni and vegetable deep dish pizza. It took about 30-45 minutes to cook but trust me it was worth the wait! When it came out it was huge! I was only able to finish one piece! Our server was an older lady and she was so sweet and even gave my husband a complimentary brownie because he was in uniform! Everyone here was polite even the customers who seemed to be regulars were very welcoming and seems like most of the customers knew all of the servers!
