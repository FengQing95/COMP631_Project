Art Institute of Chicago////If you don't have time to wander around all day, I'd recommend the 3rd floor of the modern wing, the 2nd floor of the American wing including the Leichtenstein exhibit (while it lasts), the impressionist galleries, and several of the European painting galleries. Â Or just follow the visitor guide to the best-known pieces.
