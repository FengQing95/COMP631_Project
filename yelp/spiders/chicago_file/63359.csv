Smoque BBQ////I'm in BBQ Heaven again, I had the sliced brisket sandwich, and it just melted in my mouth, there are not enough food adjectives to explain this taste and feeling! I now have a new comfort food HQ, and its practically walking distance from one of my clients. I can't wait to bring out of town friends to eat here, even if it means waiting in line for 45+ minutes, its worth the wait!
