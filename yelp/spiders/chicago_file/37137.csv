Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My biggest complaint is the restroom situation.  There is one single-person restroom for each gender, so ladies, be prepared to wait in line.  There were five women waiting when I was there.  It seems like they'd be required to have more than one toilet per gender based on the number of people who actually fit in that restaurant.
