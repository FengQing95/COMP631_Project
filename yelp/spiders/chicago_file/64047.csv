Smoque BBQ////However, when you rank this place against other BBQ places in Chi? Its for sure top 5. Which is a small pool to draw from, but man, I thought Smalls topped this place, followed by Dino's just on selection. Never mind the unnecessarily intimidating ordering process. Which is like, what? It made me feel awkward, I don't know why. Also the layout of the restaurant is pretty bad. I also was with 2 children, but it just was overall just OK to me.
