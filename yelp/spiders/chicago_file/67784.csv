Little Goat Diner////Next, I'd like to thank Greg, the head baker. Not only did Greg go above an beyond by taking Taylor on a tour of the bread bakery (Taylor is a baker herself so something like is very special to her), but he also offered to let her come in whenever she'd like to help out and learn how they operate. As if that wasn't enough, Greg also had a special made bread platter with "Happy 25th Birthday Taylor" baked into it. VERY COOL and VERY UNIQUE! Greg was very personable and easy to talk to and I am very glad to have met him. Â
