Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wild Berry Pancakes were delish. Fresh fruit on top was a plus as well as the three different sauces. Not too sweet. Eggs Benedict was also good. Ham was nice and juicy. Chorizo Benedict was also good with a good hint of spice from the chipotle sauce. Not a long wait at all during the week.
