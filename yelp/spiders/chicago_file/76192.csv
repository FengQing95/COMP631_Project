Little Goat Diner////So this section right here is dedicated to the Little Pig Went To China plate. It was definitely different. Not bad, not great, just different. This dish consisted of a sesame cheddar biscuit with Szechuan pork sausage, sunny side up eggs, chili garlic chive sauce poured all over and gooseberries. Definitely didn't taste like a typical breakfast dish. May possibly be better for lunch. The biscuit was good, the sausage was full of flavor, the sauce wasn't bad either. I just felt that it all didn't go together well. The gooseberries were nice and sweet too. Overall the dish has a very strong Asian influence to it. All the flavors were there and were actually good, just not together for me. Would I order it again? Probably not. It's more of a one time dish for me.
