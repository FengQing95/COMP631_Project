Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We decided that we were going to split everything since we wanted to order way to much... So we got the king crab tower, prime aged bone in rib eye, and the corn elote.  Crab tower was one of the best I have had anywhere, succulent huge pieces of crab and great fresh oysters.  Next we split the steak which was the perfect amount for both of us.  Absolutely delicious, definitely a top 5 steak for me so far.  The corn, even though it seems strangely out of place on the menu, is rich, buttery and flavorful.  Definitely a new favorite!
