Little Goat Diner////Food: I decided on the white fish chilaquiles for something different (normally I would head straight over to the all-day breakfast food part of the menu). Last time I was here, I got a portobello mushroom burger with shoestring onions on top and it was incredible. The chilaquiles were amazing, too, complete with salad on the top. I was surprised at first when these came out of the kitchen because it looked at first like it was just a bunch of salad! I really enjoyed my main entree. We also had ordered brussels sprouts, which were supposed to be an appetizer. I would have preferred to receive the brussels sprouts before our meal, but it came out as a side. The brussel sprouts were disappointing. They were cooked perfectly, which is not always the case for brussels sprouts. However, they were MUCH too salty. I would definitely not order these again. It was not palatable at all! Even though I love Girl & the Goat, I also found a few of the dishes to be way too sodium-laden for my tastes, which was consistent with Little Goat.
