Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After the requisite hour and a half, we got texted back to the restaurant and was ushered to go upstairs where they have more seating. While waiting for our pizza (The "Lou" with Buttercrust $19), also ordered a plate of Buffalo wings ($10) and a pitcher of sangria ($30). Wings and sangria come out first - decently slathered chicken that wasn't overcooked. Standard celery and blue cheese to the side. Sangria wasn't bad - wish it wasn't a blend and just straight red wine, but strong nonetheless. Pizza comes out some time later - thick dough topped with spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, and cheese. Got to say, really loved the addition of the buttercrust; it gives the pizza an added bonus of flavor rather than dry bread.
