Little Goat Diner////I ordered the Mac and cheese per a recommendation and it was delicious. I'm always disappointed when ordered Mac and cheese at restaurants, buy this was by far the best I've had. Not too cheesy, but rich enough to satisfy. My mom had the goat o goat o salad. It was also really good. I had some of that as well. Really good flavor overall. Just Asian enough for my liking.
