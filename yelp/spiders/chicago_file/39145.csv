Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Impeccable service. Ribeye was fantastic. Crab avocado salad was also good and light. Bread was tasty. Fried chicken was too fried and not enough spices for flavor though meat was juicy and tender. I'd skip on The fried chicken. Mash potatoes n gravy was good but we didn't Â finish it all.
