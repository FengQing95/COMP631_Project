Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////If I was to somehow end up on Death row and I had my choice of a final meal, this mean would indisputably come from Bavette's Bar and Boeuf. Just the bread and the butter alone tasted better than most of the meals I've had in Chicago. From the ambiance, to the friendly and knowledgeable staff, to the perfectly mixed Old Fashioned this place left a huge smile on my face. I've tried the burger with King mushrooms, perfect, a side of cured bacon, perfect, loaded baked potato, perfect. I tried a cut of their dry aged steak, perfection. I can't say enough good things about this place. If Bavette's Bar and Boeuf was a woman, I would propose on the spot.
