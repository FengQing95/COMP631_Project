Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is absolutely my favorite tapas in the city.  The atmosphere is SO incredibly fun and lively.  This is a great place for a first date, birthday party, any type of celebration or just a regular night out.  It is definitely best to come with a larger (4+ people) group so you can try all sorts of dishes.  Everything here is delicious.  Some of my favorites include the spicy potatoes, goat cheese, chicken and ham croquetas, roasted dates with bacon and skewered chicken.  The sangria is AMAZING.  I have literally had all types (classic, white peach, raspberry, passion fruit, etc), and they are all delicious.
