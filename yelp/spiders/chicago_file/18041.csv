Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I recently tried "The Lou" pizza with spinach, mushrooms, and sliced roma tomatoes and a blend of mozzarella, cheddar, and romano cheese. I made two variations to it by ordering it on thin crust and adding sausage. It was so good - the thin crust was crunchy and not as filling as the deep dish pizza crusts. The sliced roma tomatoes (usually I do not like these on pizza) were a great touch and the cheese blend was perfect. This might be my new favorite pizza at Lou's!
