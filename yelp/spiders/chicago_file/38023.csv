Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The earliest reservation I could get was 9 p.m. on a Friday (so be on the lookout and book early!) because peak dinner times go fast. We arrived right on time, but the restaurant was pretty backed up from the One of a Kind Show across the street. We probably waited 15 or so minutes until our table was ready, but no big deal because the bar is AMAZIN'. Cool cocktails, bartenders and overall vibe at this place. I got the Bavette's Punch (because, obviously) and my boyfriend got the Mint Julep. Both were so good!
