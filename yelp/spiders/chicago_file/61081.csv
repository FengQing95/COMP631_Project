Smoque BBQ////These folks are the expert smokers, I mean BBQ'ers. We ordered the baby back ribs and the meat was so tender. It had a good meat to fat ratio. Plus, the meat had a wonderful crust that was not charred up with burnt meat. Â It was smoked really well and you can taste it in the food. We were so impressed!!!
