Little Goat Diner////My sister came to visit from Pittsburgh and we were looking for a place close by that we could walk to on the West Loop. I saw this place on my Yelp and I hit the pavement to check it out. It's been a few months since I was there, but the place adds interesting fusions to all of the dishes and I remember my pork loin sandwich to be great, although I forgot that it would be fried and I'm not a huge fan of fried foods. The prices aren't too unreasonable especially for the area.
