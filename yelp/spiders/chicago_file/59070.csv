Smoque BBQ////For a first visit, Smoques was good...not five star good but decent enough to warrant 3 stars. First the staff was efficient and courteous. There was a wait but we didn't mind because the staff was really good about keeping us informed and seating us promptly once a table for 6 opened up. The prices were a bit high but not totally unexpected for city eating. Now I got the pulled pork, my boys ribs and husband the brisket. We agreed that the bbq was good not great. The meat was tender but like the other items on the plate ie mac, cobbler and coleslaw could use a deeper flavor profile especially in the smoke department....at the very least more salt and I am not big on salt! The Memphis sauce left a bad taste in my mouth but I kept trying to eat it due to the need for more flavor. The Carolina sauce was decent. Overall it was a good experience.
