Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba last night for dinner and was not happy with the quality of the food at all.  The service was great, but it was Spanish food adapted for the American palate.  The high point was the Calamari and dessert, everything else was lacking. Ordered the Spanish sausage tapas and the sausage is supposed to be served charred, but this was more like boiled.  The flavors were not what I am use to in Spanish sausage. We ordered the Paella and it was tasteless except for the salt. Normally you would have shellfish, along with the other seafood.  It is supposed to have a slight seafood taste, but this was sanitized.  Today my lips have one less layer of skin on them.  Dessert was very good.  The Sangria was a bust.  The fruit is supposed to sit in the pitcher and soak up the flavors and the fruit is supposed to have some citrus, but not this one. I have eaten Spanish food in many countries and this was the worst. Even in my adopted home of Bangkok, Thailand there is a Spanish restaurant that is perfect with full flavors.  The Paella at Ba-Ba Reeba was more like bad Chinese fried rice.  I've spent mush time in Spain and I do understand and know what good Spanish food is and this was not.  I did not give this review 1 star, because the server was great, but he was smart enough not to ask us how the food was. So is you want cheap Spanish, with little flavor in a noisy restaurant then this is the place to go.
