Little Goat Diner////I'm not quite sure what to make of this place.  On the one hand, it's a diner through and through: greasy, comfort food.  There is a sense of elevation: the quality of ingredients is high, and there's an interesting Asian twist, that you would never expect.  In theory, some of the combinations don't make sense, which I think is the point, really pushing the fusion envelope.  The problem is, that they actually don't work.  I felt like this was an opportunity for genius to shine through, but it just missed the mark.  We got the goat chili cheese fries to share as an app, and then I got the reuben as my main.  I basically ran into the same problem that I had at Girl and the Goat: the quality is good, but there was always one ingredient I would have liked to have taken out.  That being said, this is some serious comfort food.  As a note, I eat a lot of unhealthy food, but this did give me a stomach ache after I was done.  Not a food poisoning kind of ache, just a grease belly.  It may be exactly what you're looking for as a hangover cure, but for me, it was just too much.
