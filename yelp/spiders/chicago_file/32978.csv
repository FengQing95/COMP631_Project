Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Was I on the set of Mad Men?! The atmosphere was amazing. Dim lighting, leather booths and chandeliers...fabulous. Meal was delicious and the pacing was perfect. An awesome server just added to the experience. My new favorite restaurant. Worth every penny. If you like Maude's and Mastro's...you will love Bavette's!
