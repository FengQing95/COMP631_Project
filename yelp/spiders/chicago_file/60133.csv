Smoque BBQ////3.5 stars for food: Yeah, the BBQ is good, but it's NOT GREAT/AMAZING/EARTH SHATTERING. The portions are decent and the food has some flavor. Sauces are unique and have a kick. The fries are great. The food is priced on the expensive side however. I've had better so I'm sorry to say I can't give it an amazing rating.
