Smoque BBQ////I mean cmon. If you don't go to Smoque and get something for the here/now and some for later, you're not taking advantage of their pulled pork or brisket. I think the play is getting a rack of ribs and some chicken and around 5 sides b/w two people, in person. Then you get a pound to take home and grow on in the freezer. This place is delicious. There's nothing I haven't liked. The cole slaw has red onion and is vinegar based fyi. The mac and cheese is pretty special. The brisket chili/cornbread goes great together and the chili is heavy on the cumin, imo. fyi. That said, the STL ribs are a dry rub (but wet) dream. Charred black on the outside and falls off the bone. GREAT SAUCE!
