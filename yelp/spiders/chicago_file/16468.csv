Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's pizza is our favorite pizza place when we visit Chicago. We ordered the Malnati Chicago classic. It's the deep dish pizza with lean sausage extra cheese and vine ripened tomatoes on a buttercrust. It takes about 40 minutes to cook but it's worth the wait. The pizza is very filling. We ordered a large so we would have extra to carry out for later. Next time we are in Chicago we will definitely be back. Lou you need to open a location in Las Vegas so when we go there we can enjoy your pizza.
