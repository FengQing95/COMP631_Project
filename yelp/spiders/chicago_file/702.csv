Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The hype about this place is real people! To think we almost didn't make it and it would have been a shame! We came at 2:15pm and the place closes at 2:30pm. Service was excellent -- prompt and friendly. Food came quickly and we never felt rushed! We had the Mexicana skillet and their signature berry bliss pancakes. They were divine! If we live in Chicago, we would come here every weekend! This is one place you don't want to miss!
