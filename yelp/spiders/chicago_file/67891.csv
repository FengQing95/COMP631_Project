Little Goat Diner////I've been here twice and had 8 different dishes, including many of the favorites: breakfast spaghetti, kimchee and bacon and eggs etc., bull's eye french toast, dark chocolate chip pancakes, and much more but the brandade and belly is hands down the best dish so far. I'll have to try the fat elvis waffles the next time I visit.
