Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Absolutely love this place!  The steak is unbelievable!  Definitely start with a price of their oh so delicious bread! Anything you order you can't go wrong from seafood to steak you will love every bite!! The only negative part for us which is good for them is trying to book reservations it's always busy!
