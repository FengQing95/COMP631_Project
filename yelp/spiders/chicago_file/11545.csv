Art Institute of Chicago////We spent all day here. Our friend we were visiting is a member, and treated us; which included free admission and a shorter line to see the special exhibit, Van Gough's bedroom. Being a super-fan of his work, it was a treat to see so many new paintings of his I hadn't seen elsewhere. Â FUN!
