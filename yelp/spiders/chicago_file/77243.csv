Little Goat Diner////This restaurant is at a prime location in Chicago. The only downside is to find a good parking stop (Unless you go for Valet). Once you figure out where to park, and when you finally make it here you will love it. You will love all the Goat artsy stuff. We had a 35-40 minute wait time. Once we checked in, we walked around to explore the places around.
