The Purple Pig////If you must have a Chicago dog during your visit to the Windy cities, make it the homemade hot dog at the Purple Pig.  I  am going to take it a step further and say it is the best hotdog I've ever tasted!  Served on a delicious homemade roll finished off with a truffle butter and accompanied by excellent smashed/fried potato's it was beyond compare.
