Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I went with a friend to this restaurant because it was his first time in Chicago. The moment we walked in, we were not greeted and was told to wait 15 minutes. While we were waiting, MULTIPLE groups behind us was seated. My friend went up to complain to the manager and she showed her apologies. Please keep in mind both of us are around the age of 18 while everyone else were older. We found this place disgusting because they discriminated based off of our age. If you are young PLEASE do not come here as you will be discriminated and looked down upon. Although there food was mediocre, there service made me not want to come to this chain ever again.
