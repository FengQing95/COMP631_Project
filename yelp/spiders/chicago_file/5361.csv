The Purple Pig////We ordered the Roasted Bone Marrow (3.5/5 one of my friends favorite dishes and she said this was just standard- but the portion was very large), Roasted Pineapple (4/5 pretty interesting flavors), Asparagus (5/5 the best thing I ate here, it tasted like pasta but the whole dish was just tiny cut up asparagus), and the Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder (5/5 the meat melted in your mouth and the mashed potatoes were delicious).
