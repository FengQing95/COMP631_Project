Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had a great meal here with 3 friends on a Friday night. It was bustling in the restaurant, there were several tables around us in the midst of loud celebrations which I didn't mind, but instead added to the lively nature of this gem of a restaurant. My friends and I ordered a bunch of shared plates, and there was no issue accommodating my friend with a gluten allergy. However my favorite part was the sangria! Definitely don't skip out on the sangria, you won't regret it!
