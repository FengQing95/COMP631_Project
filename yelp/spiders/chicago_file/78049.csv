Little Goat Diner////Came here for a quick bite to eat before heading off to the airport. A couple things to note, it's better not to come here if you're pressed for time. There's typically a wait, but there's plenty of counter and shared tables if you're ok with that. We were here for a little over an hour and had a great experience. Our server was super friendly and gave great suggestions.
