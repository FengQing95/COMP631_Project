Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Rob then helped us to order two appetizers (we were just going to get the calamari, but he sold us the fried cheddar cubes as well).  Both appetizers were outstanding!  He also made sure we ordered the proper crust for our pizza (we didn't know what we were doing, but he made sure we got the butter crust).  The pizza was phenomenal!!
