Little Goat Diner////Last night I had a love affair with the Chicken Cordon Bleu sammich. My friends were a little uncomfortable, but you know what, it was THAT good. I dreamt about it. The pulled pork sammich wasn't drowning in BBQ sauce (a good thing for those of us who like to taste the main ingredients; anyone can grab a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's and drown their food in it if they want that), and the Los Drowned is such a beautiful version of a braised beef sammich. The smoked fries and the fried pickled onions & pickles (YEP, they pickle the onion which gives the dish some extra zest) are must haves.
