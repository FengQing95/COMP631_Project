Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Lastly, we had chocolate creme pie and whiskey icecream. Totally worth trying and stretching your stomach. It was just perfect. Our server Brandon made our night even better. He is humorous, polite and fast! Â My flight got delayed by a lot, so we got there at 10:50pm for late dinner, but the service was flawless. Thanks for the great food and fabulous service! Strongly recommend trying this place.
