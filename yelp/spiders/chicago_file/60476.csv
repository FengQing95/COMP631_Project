Smoque BBQ////I should begin by saying that I've only been to Smoque during very off-peak hours, so I've never had to deal with the ridiculous line, however I like it there so much that I'd gladly wait for a taste of that barbecue.  Specifically, the Jew in me loves the beef brisket and the St. Louisan in me loves the pulled pork: slather both of them in sauce and I'm a happy gal.  The mac & cheese deserves a special shout-out because it is SINFUL: its perfectly creamy, but it has a good breadcrumb crunch on top.  And the peach cobbler is a great way to end the meal: I could eat it for breakfast the morning after!
