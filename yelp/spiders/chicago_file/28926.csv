Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First night in Chicago for a couple Oakland A's baseball games so we went straight to Lou Malnati's for a deep dish pizza! Great decision! We've always gone for a thin crust pie - NY style. But, I gotta say Lou Malnati's pie was just as good as any of the best NY pies we've had. Simple ingredients, very fresh and flavorful. We did the Malnati's Chicago Classic. It was sooo good I wish I could have eaten another whole pie. The balance of sausage to cheese to the wonderful sauce was excellent. And the buttery crust! My, oh my!
