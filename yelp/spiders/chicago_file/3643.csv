The Purple Pig////This place was recommended by a Chicago local contact while we were in town for work.  The waiter was very polite and funny. It was impressive the meat and cheese tray food deliverer went through each single meat and cheese then wrote it down on paper for us since there was so many items.  This was a great experience for us.  Also they have a good drinky-drink selection.
