Little Goat Diner////First of all, the menu is huge!  We had a tough time choosing just one thing.  We ended up going with the chili cheese fries.  O.M.G.  They were amazing.  I forget the price, but I remember it being on the pricier side, as were the beers (although they had a good selection with plenty of local beers).
