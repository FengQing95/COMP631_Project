Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been here many many times but never did a review because so many of my visits were myself and 80 to 90 of my Jr High Spanish Students.  Ay caramaba - not only did I live to tell the tale but I came back here, voluntarily, on my own risking a flashback experience.  For those of you who have never organized a trip to a Spanish restaurant for 13 year olds to eat new food and experience Flamenco dancing I can only say, it's not as glamorous as it sounds.
