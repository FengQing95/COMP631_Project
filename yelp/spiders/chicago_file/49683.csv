Smoque BBQ////Well I finally went to see what all the hype was and just like I expected, it was hype. The food is very good here for sure, I wasn't disappointed at all with anything they serve, but to claim to be the best is such an exaggeration. The ribs were not as "smoked" as could be,it tasted burnt and there was minimal meat on my slab. Without that sauce not much to mouth water on. I read reviews on all the amazing sides that come with the ribs but isn't it about the ribs? Chicago sucks when it comes to ribs so when a place pops up claiming best ribs everyone flocks there like wolves. Look around and see that other places do taste better, try moving to a southern state.
