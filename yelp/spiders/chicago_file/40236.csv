Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Entrees: The best steak is the bone-in 42-day dry-aged ribeye because it's sooo rich & cooked perfectly, and the buttery bernajse sauce complements it so well (though it's great just with the salt rub!). If ribeye isn't your thing, the filet is so tender you can cut with a butter knife. My favorite sides are the button mushrooms, cream spinach, or pomme frites with super-rich garlic aioli. I've never had dessert but I'm sure they are divine!
