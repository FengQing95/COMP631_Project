Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Authentic tapas at their best.  Garlic shrimp, mushroom toast, garlic/tomato bread and the short rib were some of the highlights.  We topped the night with every dessert on the menu and were NOT disappointed - especially the butterscotch pudding and the Marconi almond bar - crazy.  This place is deeeeee-lish.
