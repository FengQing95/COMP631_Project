Smoque BBQ////Fast forward five or so months to my graduation from college.  We were planning to have a party at my apartment for 20-30 people, and I decided I wanted to have it catered.  Smoque was instantly my first choice.  I called, placed an order with their catering lady and everything was set.  Until..... we arrived 30 minutes before my party began to pick up the food.  I tell someone at the counter that we are there to pick up our order that I had placed with the catering manager, and after running around for a few minutes, he returned only to tell me they had no record of my order!  Immediately, I start going into freak out mode in my head (what am I going to feed all these people!!!), until the owner Barry Sorkin came up to put my mind at ease.  He assured me that he would have the food ready in 15 minutes and that he would personally deliver it to my apartment.  Eventually, they did find my order, but for some reason it didn't make it onto their clipboard.  He told me not to worry about paying, that we could take care of it later.
