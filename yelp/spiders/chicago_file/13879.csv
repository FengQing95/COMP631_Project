Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My favorite pizza place. I don't care about the long wait for my order, I don't care the price. I just love the rich flavors and textures. I will get the togos and fly with it to meet my family in Michigan (They all love it). But last time I flew to Chicago, I failed to get it. Still feel sad about that.
