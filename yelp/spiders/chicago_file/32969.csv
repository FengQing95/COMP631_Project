Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went here last night and had a wonderful meal.  I thought I made a reservation via Open Table, but it somehow did not get confirmed.  However, I still was able to be seated (I did get there when the opened).  I was dinning alone, but they sat me at a four top toward the front of the restaurant which kind of sucked but they were so nice that I quickly over came this feeling.  My waiter Brandon was so kind and accommodating, he provided some of the best service I have had this year.  He have quite a few tables but still managed to make me feel like I was his only table.
