Little Goat Diner////Now the fried stuff, onion rings and pickles were really oily.  You can taste it at first bite. The fries were salty and cold. We also ordered a dessert, a cake that had caramel, peanut butter, butter cream and... I dont recall what it was called but if the cake itself was not so dry, I think it would of been awesome. But each bite we needed to put a dollop of icing or whipped cream to help with the dryness.   The service was good, very attentive.  Overall if Im in Chicago fairly soon, I would give it another try.  They could of just been off that night.
