Smoque BBQ////The smells tell you down the street that this is going to be good.  My husband is from the BBQ belt, and is a serious critic of all BBQ.  But even he was pleased.  Great flavor, great pink smoke rings, great sides.  It was not clear where the menu was when I walked in (it covers an entire wall, was I distracted by the meat?  Yes, Yes I was).  They want you to order first, and then they seat you.  And expect to share a table, European style.  The place also does a really brisk carry out business.  Their vinegar sauce I have to rave about, this is not usually a sauce that I like.  But theirs was the best I've ever had.  A special note to tourists and out-of-towners:  be sure to carefully read the parking signs in the neighborhood.  Our Chicago parking is quite interesting.  Great food, amazing food, but your whole experience will be tainted by a ticket.
