Smoque BBQ////We didn't feel rushed, even with 30+ people standing in the aisles waiting for a table. Overall, this place runs great -- they should give crowd management lessons to some other restaurants that will remain nameless. And to all my fellow melanin-challenged white kids out in suburbia, it's okay, nothing to worry about here -- c'mon down!
