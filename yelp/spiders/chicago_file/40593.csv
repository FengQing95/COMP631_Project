Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What a great place! The ambiance was simply fantastic, and the staff was kind and accommodating. Â I wasn't sure we would be able to get in with no reservations but able to sit at the bar, which was worth the experience as the conversation with the bartenders was great. I also was able to watch them make several unique cocktails.
