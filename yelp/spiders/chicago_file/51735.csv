Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite go-to restaurants in the city. Great for any size group, but make a reservation for more than 2-4. The bar/high tops are open seating, which is great for drinks, apps, or dinner. Gigantic menu of Spanish tapas. Great quality. Various types of sangria. Lively atmosphere.
