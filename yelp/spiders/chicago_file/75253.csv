Little Goat Diner////For food we ordered: the parathas burrito (not really a burrito..more like a naan flat bread, but go with it), biscuits and gravy, omelette, this little piggy went to china ( laugh all you want - it's damn good.), and the hot crab dip. I have to say the "This Little Piggy Went to China" really knocked it out of this world! The not so amazing part was the crab dip...too fishy tasting for my taste-buds and didn't blow my socks off like I was hoping for.
