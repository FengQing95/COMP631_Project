Little Goat Diner////Would originally give 5 stars but the last visit was incredibly disappointing. Service was very slow and was recommended the Bull's Eye French Toast. Husband LOVES the blueberry pancakes--they're awesome! The French Toast, however, was "disgusting" to quote my husband. It had a very odd day-old-Chinese-food sweet & sour aftertaste to it that was completely unwelcome. Don't get me wrong, I love Chinese/fusion food, but if I wanted that for breakfast, I would've ordered the Okonomiyaki or the Little Piggy dish. I just wanted French toast and it came heavy with that odd aftertaste.
