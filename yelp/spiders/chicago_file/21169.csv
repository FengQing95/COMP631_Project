Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have tried deep dish in Chicago from two different restaurants, and both were disappointing. I'm from CA and the deep dish pizza here is so much better than Chicago's. Ironic. The Yelp rating for Lou Malnati's Pizzeria is really off and I'm very disappointed that it turned out this way.
