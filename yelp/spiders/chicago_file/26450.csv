Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There is usually no wait to be seated but you need to be willing to wait for food. It takes time to order the pizza and then 30-60 min to get it depending on how busy they are. But meanwhile, why not get their appetizers? Pretty cheesy and delicious- perfect way to wait out the time it takes to make the pizza.
