Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I usually don't like going to any restaurant more than once. I always like trying new restaurants, new flavors but I make exceptions for GREAT restaurants like Cafe Baba Reeba, so far it's the best Tapas place in Chicago. I went there twice, the only thing i hated about my second visit was the table, it wasn't in the nice lower floor area like where we were seated the first time, but I don't blame them, we didn't have reservation and it was super crowded.
