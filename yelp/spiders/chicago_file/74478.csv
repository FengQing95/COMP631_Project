Little Goat Diner////I tried the Breakfast Spaghetti 'n clams 'n crab. This is quite an interesting dish! I did not expect it to come out the way that it did. So the eggs are cooked like an omelet on top of the noodles, and it's steeped in clam soup. It's like spaghetti with eggs in clam soup, and pieces of crab, clam and pork guanciale on top. The flavros worked well together and I'm glad I got to try it! Very unique and different.
