Smoque BBQ////Ordered the half slab of each: St. Louis and Babyback. I really liked their menu flexibility where you can add on ribs/brisket/other sides if you want to try something new. The prices were reasonable, and each order came with a substantial amount of food. The ribs were really tender and the brisket was scrumptious as well. I would recommend the brisket over the pulled pork sandwich, but they were both delicious so you can't go wrong.
