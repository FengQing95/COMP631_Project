Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Just always amazing. Good vibe, good selection of foods. A place to go for over 25 years. Took our teenage boys there which was really nice since they could experience a place I experienced when I was a few years older then them. Highly suggest the beef with the horseradish and onions which is been on their menu forever. Sitting outside during the summer is also great. If you go for it there for lunch I would also recommend it.
