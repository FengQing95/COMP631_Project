Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The best Chicago deep dish pizza that you can get!!! Thin crust is pretty good too but I would recommend the deep dish. Also, they have amazing lasagna!!! The best lasagna Ive ever had delivered and I get a lot of lasagna delivered. They also have a really good spinach salad with chicken goat cheese and pear slices with balsamic vinaigrette!!!
