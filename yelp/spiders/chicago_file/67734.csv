Little Goat Diner////The food is DELICIOUS. We came for breakfast on a Saturday and were told it was going to be a 45 minute wait. W were going to leave and come back another time when less busy but see walked over to the cafe side (yummy looking breads and coffee) to see what they had to offer but decided we would eat elsewhere. We wanted the real deal breakfast that day. As we were leaving, the hostess stopped us kindly and said to bar seats just opened up so we grabbed them! Just our luck! This place is beautiful btw. So we had a great server, enjoyed a cinnamon bun and I had a special omelette of theday while my boyfriend had their breakfast burrito.
