Smoque BBQ////My BF ordered ribs with the brisket chili and mac & cheese, I ordered the chicken with corn bread and mac & cheese. They really are sides, quite small, which is fine. The sauce is VERY VERY VERY sweet, like, 20 sugars dumped in per serving sweet. The chicken was fine, the ribs were fine. Far, far, far from the best we've had, but certainly not the worst...just meh. The main dishes were just...fine. Nothing to write home about, at all. Maybe they'd have tasted better if they hadn't been (barely) luke-warm. The sides were excellent, and I wish they were available as their own entrees. My boyfriend completely devoured their coleslaw (I'm not a fan of coleslaw in general), so that's also a plus in terms of sides (and comes included).
