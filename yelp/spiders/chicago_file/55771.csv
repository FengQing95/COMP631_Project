Smoque BBQ////Finally, the food is good- you get a lot of the $$ and even the sides are worth it. The mac and cheese is a must try, I was also a fan of the corn bread. As for meat, I thought the brisket was the best I tried, but I definitely need to get back there to try the ribs, I know I'm missing out!
