Little Goat Diner////I've been going to Little Goat Bread a lot recently too, because their Little Goat Latte is seriously delicious. I can't eat most of the baked goods, but they do have a gluten-free pineapple crunch muffin, which is surprisingly good, and a parmesan roll I haven't had yet. Everyone's pretty friendly over on that side, too.
