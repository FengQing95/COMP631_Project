Little Goat Diner////And while I hesitate to call it a true diner, they sure try for it in many ways. The sit down counter, the long window into the kitchen, waitresses in skirts carrying coffee pots, the Heinz bottles on every table, and the cute and colorful laminated menus. It's a wonderful little mish-mash that any diner lover could appreciate.
