Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had an excellent  experience at Bavettes last week.  The food and service was perfect! Such a beautiful space!  Had a funny yet personable and confident server who appeared to be sick that night and we were some what concerned about getting hs cold or the way our food was being handled.  I'm sure just our germ phobias kicking in.  Overall a great experience!  Must go.
