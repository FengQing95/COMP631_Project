Little Goat Diner////Went early for breakfast on Memorial Day.  Got seated right away not that crowded.  Waited about 10 minutes for coffee even though it seemed like there was at least 1 waiter/waitress for every customer.  Staff did not seem organized.  This is a breakfast diner?  They did not have oatmeal available even though it was on the menu.  They did not have the apricot scone even though it was on the menu.  Do not order toast here.  They grill it.  Think grilled cheese minus the cheese.  Very greasy and chewy.  Meal came and it was wrong.  Please write it down the next time.  I know it looks cool but it blows up in your face if you get the order wrong.  There were a couple of positives.  Our waiter was very nice and they picked up the check for our meal.  The manager came over and apologized.  That says a lot because we were not complaining.  Suggestions:  Have some jams/jellies and invest in a toaster.
