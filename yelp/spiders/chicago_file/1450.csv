Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I'm not a fan of pancakes but their red velvet pancake (even frozen for 2 weeks) is a silent piece of heaven. I ordered the garden skillet and the mushrooms, asparagus, spinach, tomato and broccoli were cooked to perfection! our waitress was also extremely helpful when my friend had come in just for a menu item that had recently been taken off the menu - she went out of her way and had a chef make it especially for her. while leaning towards the pricey side, the portions are generous and the atmosphere vibrant and upbeat.
