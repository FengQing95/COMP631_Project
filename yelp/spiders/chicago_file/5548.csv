The Purple Pig////I love the Purple Pig. Definitely a go-to spot in downtown Chicago. The line can get really long so get there early if you're going on a weekend. Regardless, it's worth it. We got seats at the counter/bar and got to watch the chefs prepare each dish. The vibe was pretty chill and low key but the food was mind blowingly good.
