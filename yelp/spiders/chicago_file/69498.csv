Little Goat Diner////Now, it's important to note that everything on the menu is a la carte.  This isn't a bad thing.  There's no NEED for sides.  C'mon, though, it's breakfast.  Live a little.  We decided on the cheesy grits for our side.  "Can I get the carbs, with a side of carbs?  Thanks!"  These also did not disappoint.  They were rich and creamy, just like grits should be.   Go against your better instincts and get a side.  Thank me later.
