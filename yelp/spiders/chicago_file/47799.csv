Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////After having dined here a few months back with my husband, I wrote a review about our not-so-stellar experience. We were unimpressed and likely would not return. Immediately after posting my review, I was contacted by a manager at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba. He was very receptive to the feedback I had provided and assured me our experience did not live up to their standards. He invited us back to give them another try. We redeemed his offer Saturday night and are happy to say we were really enjoyed our dinner.
