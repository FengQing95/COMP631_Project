Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I had an open table reservation and I was the last to arrive (I called to say I would make it there about 10 min late but my guests had arrived already and were waiting at the bar). When I arrived, I was told a waiter would come grab us at the bar when our table was ready. We had a drink, waited a good while and then asked the hostess what's the holdup. The hostess then tells us that we won't be seated because we arrived 15min past our res time. But NO ONE said that when I arrived. I was specifically told we would be seated. So I'm guessing someone they knew came and they gave our table to them instead? Either way, there was no apology made and there was a bit of an attitude that suggested I should get over the last 45min I had wasted waiting for a table I would never get.
