Little Goat Diner////An upscale diner-style restaurant, Little Goat exceeded my expectations and has the lead on my "regular" place when visiting Chicago. The interior is a very cool take on the American diner, particularly the leather banquette style shaft that housed the rotating door. The menu items were all innovative and sounded delicious.
