Little Goat Diner////We came here for a birthday dinner last night (a Monday) @ 630 pm, without a reservation. Given the buzz surrounding Top Chef winner Stephanie Izard and The Girl and the Goat, and not having eaten her food yet, I had high expectations without knowing what exactly to expect. We didn't have to wait for a table for a party of three. The decor is upscale diner. The booths are padded with comfy dark brown leather; I felt like I was sitting on a well-worn, well-made couch. Drinks anyone? I cannot remember, or find online, the name of my drink but it has vodka and chambord and tastes like a lighter version of a screwdriver. We also ordered The Jazz Singer, which has bourbon in it. My accomplice said it was delicious but on the boozy side. We shared fried pickles and onion rings. They were perfectly done and both the ranch and curry mayo accompanying them were so delicious and addicting that we would have been happy eating them alone. The hash browns were good but a little too greasy and probably the most unmemorable thing I ate there. Entrees: Wing burger with a veggie patty, spiced apple pancakes and the Los Drowned sandwich. My accomplices thoroughly enjoyed the first two. The bite of apple spiced pancakes I had was delicious, a good balance of savory and sweet, much different than your typical, overly sweet local diner pancakes--we barely drizzled any maple syrup on them. The owner of the wing burger could not stop commenting on how yummy the wing sauce was. I was blown away by the perfection on a hoagie roll that is Los Drowned. The beef was perfectly braised and gorgeous. The combination of the avocado, buttercase cheese, pickles and spicy mayo made for a balanced, creamy, flavorful mouthful. The sandwich came with a vinaigrette-like dressing (apple cider, maybe?) that gave it all the sweet, acidic touch it needed to excite my palate with each bite. I think I said "wow" after every bite. It was so good I almost cried. I thought about it all day today, I kid you not. Nothing I ate in the last 24-hrs. could compare. It was, hands down, the best sandwich I've eaten in my entire life. We wanted to have dessert but we had nowhere to put it. We shared the complimentary birthday sundae. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly and funny. The busboys were on top of things. Our water glasses were never less than half full. Three cocktails, two sides, three entrees. Bill before a generous tip: $87. I would eat here again in a heartbeat. A great place to take off your tie and meet a friend for dinner after work or to impress that special someone. This is easily one of my new favorite restaurants. I can't wait to go back! Grade: A-.
