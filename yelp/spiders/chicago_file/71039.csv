Little Goat Diner////3) Prices - I used to think that this would be a more affordable version of GATG food, but it's not cheaper at all. Most dishes are in the same price range, and the portions are a teeny bit more generous but not significantly. However, the environment and food are significantly better at GATG so at the same price range, I know where I'd prefer to eat.
