Smoque BBQ////I expected to eat the best barbecue in the city though. The ribs were good and I would recommend them. Came off the bone fairly easily. Had a good rub on them. I wasn't crazy about the provided sauces though and the smoky flavor didn't come through the meat as much as I would have liked.
