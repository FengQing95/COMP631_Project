Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visited this establishment on Saturday for lunch while in Chicago.  Excellent service and food.  We ordered the salad, cheddar cubes and classic pizza.  Loved it! The restaurant seemed kind of small but it was kind of cozy.  The wait was kind of long, but it really didn't bother me too much. Free Wi-fi so I could check in.  Will definately be trying this again.
