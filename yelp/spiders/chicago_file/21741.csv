Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Maybe it's because I ordered a veggie deep dish... but I was not impressed. I was really looking forward to it since all the reviews rave the deliciousness of their deep dish pizza. Also, I figured I am visting Chicago, so it's the best place for deep dish, but actually, the best place I've had deep dish is in the Easy Bay, CA!
