Smoque BBQ////We expected a lot from this place, and frankly we were disappointed. The pulled pork was average at best, the sides were small and (other than the mac-n-cheese, which is delicious) unimpressive. Coupled Â with the long lines and high school cafeteria ambiance it's unlikely that we'll be back.
