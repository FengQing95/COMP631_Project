Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was delectable. Â They have a vegetarian menu which is full of wonderful deliciousness and a provide a nice selection of options and I was quite content. My date had a steak which he said was one of the best steaks he had ever had. The dessert (chocolate pie) was delectable and definitely worth finding room for. The busboy was diligent and responsive and very nice and provided great service.
