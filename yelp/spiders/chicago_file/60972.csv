Smoque BBQ////I had the pulled pork platter, which is basically a heaping pile of juicy, tender meat which I topped with the super vinegar-y cole slaw. The acidity of the cool slaw really balanced out the smoky flavors of the meat. The platter also comes with two additional sides-- albeit small, both the cornbread and peach cobbler pack a tasty punch.
