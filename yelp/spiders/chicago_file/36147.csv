Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The service was impeccable, and the food/drink was phenomenal from start to finish. Some standouts were: the dark'n'stormy // the insanely soft, perrrrrrfect bread // the short rib stronganoff // the creamed spinach with blue cheese & caramelized onions // the prime, dry-aged ribeye. Good grief, I don't like chocolate cake, and that was fabulous too.
