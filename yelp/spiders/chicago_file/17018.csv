Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Had to have Chicago deep dish while I was there. It takes about 45 minutes to make a pizza which I am not so sure is worth the wait. Don't get me wrong it was a good pizza I think I may prefer thin crust. The crust on the deep dish was buttery and crunchy. I had the Classic that had sausage, cheese and sauce. The sausage was a thin party the covered the entire surface. May not be a place that I have to go back to if I visit Chicago again.
