Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So..... how to say, what to say.   The best deep dish pizza I have ever had.  Me and my wife tried 2 different ones and the classic Chicago deep dish was the best pizza I ever ate.  The reason I give this place a 4 is solely because of the alcoholic drinks they have.  In my opinion only the price was extremely expansive for the quality of drink provided.  And to finish off the review we had an appetizer called the trio is also expansive but the quality is great! I loved it and could just lick the plate where the dip came.  The food and the atmosphere is perfect.  Also a heads up the pizza is made from scratch or to order, so it does take a wHile to cook, totally do not mind since is so good, makes it worth the wait.
