Art Institute of Chicago////I really enjoyed the miniature architecture exhibit on the bottom floor -- everything is so detailed and it really feels like you're looking into the house of a tiny person in those time periods. Of course, the classic Van Gogh, Monet, Rodin works are always a hit and beautiful to look at. The modern art sections are definitely... different... and won't appeal to everyone. But that's what makes art great!
