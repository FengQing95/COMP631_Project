Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////David was our waiter - super attentive and friendly. We tried the garlic bread, calamari, and boneless Buffalo wings. All yummy. It was my first time trying deep dish and I really didn't think I would like it, but I was pleasantly surprised. I got a personal side extra cheese pizza-delicious! Not super saucy like I anticipated, it was actually super cheesy. The crust was great. Can't compare this deep dish to any other since I only tried this one, but I would definitely recommend it!
