Smoque BBQ////Absolutely divine St. Louis ribs and brisket - probably some of the best I've ever had. Portions are large and scrumptious, staff is friendly, though the place does get insanely busy sometimes. Love the lightly vinegary slaw and fresh hand cut fries. Each dish comes with two types of BBQ sauce: a tangier one and a sweeter thick one.
