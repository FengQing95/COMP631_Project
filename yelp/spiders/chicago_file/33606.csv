Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We came back in February for drinks with another couple for drinks, so we went to the downstairs bar area.  It was only 9pm on a Thursday and we sat in the bar area (not the booths along the perimeter).  Waiter was slow to bring drink menus and the drinks, and when asked if we could order a light appetizer he said "no, food is only for the perimeter seats."  We asked to speak with the manager of the restaurant as this seemed strange, especially since we were looking to order foie gras, not a whole entree or anything.  The manager came and relayed that it was the executive chef who told him no food was to be served at the inside bar area downstairs, but if we need anything else, please let him know.  We said "fine, whatever," and kept drinking.  Anyway, bill comes and its double what it should have been because the waiter gave us some other tables bill.  When we told him about, he had a bit of an attitude.  Not our fault guy - its yours!
