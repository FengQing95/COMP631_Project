Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Omg! I was expecting actual deep dish pizza. Strike 1- the pizza delivery lady dropped the cutter In our food !ugh) we don't know where her hands have been! Then the pizza crust was flavorless and thin, the pizza was full of oil and cheese. We didn't eat 80% of it! I was with 3 of my sisters visiting Chicago and not 1 of us liked the pizza. Then we order a cookie because we were starving and only the edges of the cookie were cooked. The inside was dough! Try Giordannos if you go. I heard they have actual deep dish with bread. It wasn't just us either. There were several others there disappointed
