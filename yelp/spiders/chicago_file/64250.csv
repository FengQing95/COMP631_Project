Smoque BBQ////This place is just ok. The food is good and it presents well, but you are stuck in a little shack with no alcoholic options. If I lived closer, the place would probably have more starts. However, there are other better options near where I live, like Green Street Meats (BBQ + Booze + Seating + Bar atmosphere).
