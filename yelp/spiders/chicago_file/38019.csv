Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went back again and had the Pom frites with garlic aoli. They were incredible. Also, my wife got a salad that was huge so I helped her finish. Even that was worth coming back for. Tried the steak without the Gorgonzola. Basically, you can't go wrong. In the future I think I'll go without topping because that steak is the best ever.
