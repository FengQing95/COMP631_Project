The Purple Pig////We ordered a 2010 Spanish wine for the table, and it was absolutely delicious! I have to say their drink selection is quite good with a great variety.  We decided to try a bunch of different dishes for the table.  I can't even tell you what I liked the best because it was all just amazing.  What I will say is don't miss out on the Pig Ears...didn't sound appetizing at first, but it's a must have on the menu! Everything else came out in great portion to share across the table.  Service was great, my water was always full, empty plates cleared immediately, and we may have had a bit of a spillage accident which was taken care of right away.
