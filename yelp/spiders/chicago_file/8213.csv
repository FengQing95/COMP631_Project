Art Institute of Chicago////It's too much to take in on one visit. And there are bound to be areas you never want to bother seeing again. But there are areas you'll want to go see again and again, and art you'll want to keep visiting to see what's different about it each time you see it. I have no artistic talents. But I love this place. It's world famous for good reason.
