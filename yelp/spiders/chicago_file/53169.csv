Smoque BBQ////Sides: The fries were surprisingly amazing. I don't usually associate these kinds of places with standard bar fare. The beans were good, but the mac & cheese stole the show. Great comfort food. Even though we were stuffed from the meat, we still managed to polish it off before rolling out.
