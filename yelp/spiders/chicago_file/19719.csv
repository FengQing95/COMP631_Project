Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The wait is ridiculous! They need to find a better way for seating people...like using an online reservation system like most restaurants do. It is so unproductive to have to put your name on the list in person, to have to wait in the small cramped area in the front with 50 other people waiting for that magic text that says "You are up". They recommend that you give your order to the cashier as you wait so that when you are seated your food would be ready. After sitting down we still had to wait an extra Â 30 minutes for our food to be ready. The pizza tasted rushed and the waitress was clearly overwhelmed. Sighh...
