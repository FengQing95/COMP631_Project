Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The atmosphere in the restaurant is romantic with candles lit throughout. Highly recommend taking a date here. I ordered the dry aged bone in rib-eye and gosh, the flavor explodes in my mouth. You come here for the dry aged flavors, and I can guarantee that you will be hard pressed to find another steakhouse that will deliver this quality!
