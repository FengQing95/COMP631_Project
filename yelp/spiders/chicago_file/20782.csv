Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I took one of my friends from out of town to get the "best" chicago pizza at Lou Malnati's. We came around 1:45 PM and just missed the lunch rush, so we were seated right away. Because we knew that it would take 30 minutes for our pizza to cook, we ordered the Malnati Salad while waiting. It was surprisingly really refreshing and enjoyable. I would highly recommend the salad while waiting for the pizza. When the Malnati Chicago Classic arrived, we were severely disappointed. The pizza was super dry due to the thin layer of tomato sauce even though there was thick layer of cheese and sausage. Although my friend and I agreed that the crust was a lot better than Giordanos and Ginos, we sadly both agreed that we liked the pizza at Giordanos more. Â
