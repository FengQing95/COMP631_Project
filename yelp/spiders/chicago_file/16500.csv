Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came here with my family and we ordered one pizza, which would take an hour to make, which is fine. But after 45 minutes we were informed that the pizza had accidentally been dropped and that they would compensate us with a free pizza and free dessert if we wanted to wait around for another. We stayed and waited and the deep dish cheese pizza was delicious. The wait was worthwhile in my eyes, and Lou Malnati's is a Chicago favorite in general.
