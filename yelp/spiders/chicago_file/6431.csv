The Purple Pig////Phenomenal place. Surprisingly easy to get reservations. The location is awesome just at the end or beginning of Michigan Ave, although parking hard to find. the place is cozy and always packed. Food items are amazing. Portions are definitely intended for sharing. Been here twice. Loved the beets, tartare, chicken, squid pasta, cheesecake. Service is quick and efficient. Prices actually reasonable. All in all, phenomenal place and of my favorites in the city. Highly recommend. Will defined come here again.
