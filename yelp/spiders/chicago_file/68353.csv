Little Goat Diner////The sourdough pancakes and side of bacon were delicious, and everyone else felt the same about their choices. And while the food lived up to expectations, so did the prices. It's a nice place to go once in a while for a nice breakfast, but the prices, in tune with the area, are high and would prevent me from going more often.
