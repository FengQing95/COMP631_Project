Little Goat Diner////Food has ambitions but is lacking in intellect and flavor. I had the fish tostadas and they were really, really bad. Undercooked fish (yes, I know my fish), topped with raw chick peas, chopped cabbage and thousand island dressing. I would have trusted a drunken mate with cooking up something more quality. Yes this place is seriously pretentious and a complete waste of money.
