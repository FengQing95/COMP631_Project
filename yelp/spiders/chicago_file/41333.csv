Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service is always awesome and the food is great. It also always seem like after ordering plate after plate, that the bill is going to add up to be astronomical and it never is! Very reasonable. With a table of six, with several pitchers of that passionfruit sangria and numerous plates of tapas, it usually comes to about $35/person.
