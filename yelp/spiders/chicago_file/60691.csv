Smoque BBQ////When we arrived, an older, unshaven guy in an orange vest told us where not to park or risk towing. I'm not sure if he was a city worker, valet, or The Parking Nazi. Once we parked legally nearby, we came inside the little corner joint. Inside, the restaurant is very plain in its decor. The menu appears on a chalkboard and is easy to figure out. Â What you need to know when ordering is that the brisket is either sliced or pulled. I chose sliced since I feared a mouthful of meat imbedded between my teeth.
