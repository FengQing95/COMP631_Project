Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were left to stand at the bar for approximately 2 hours, each having 3 drinks. Our first round of cocktails were a Southside and a Vesper. It was delivered with, "I'm sorry your cocktails are very labor intensive." I'm not quite sure why she felt the need to preface that, but alas I understand that and that's why we are here - to have high end cocktails created by hospitality professionals.
