Smoque BBQ////We like Smoque better as a take out joint then eat in. The place always feels a little...sticky. But the food is good, filling, and the price is right. The brisket just falls apart in your mouth. I always get the sliced brisket sandwich these days. I like their slaw, but my husband hates it. Â It is too vinegary for his tastes. To be honest, the BBQ is just a bit too vinegary for my tastes (thus 4 stars instead of 5), but it is still pretty awesome.
