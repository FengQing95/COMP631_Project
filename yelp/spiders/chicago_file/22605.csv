Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What comes to mind at Lou Malnati's: Ballpark pizza. Cafeteria pizza. Franchise pizza. Frozen pizza. The "Chicago special" was an embarrassing 3 ingredient failure (well 4, with the crust) - It had the consistency of a tire and flavor of reheated special from your local grocery store freezer section. We're stupefied people travel far and wide for this, wait in line for it, and send them in the mail. Apparently there is a real war for "best deep dish in Chicago". I'll help you: Malnati's is the loser.
