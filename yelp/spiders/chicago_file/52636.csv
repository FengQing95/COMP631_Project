Smoque BBQ////Smoque Catering beat out two other quotes from other, competing BBQ joints here in Chicago. I recently hosted a large family party at my home and was really excited to serve their food. Two days before the party, I checked-in with Peggy from their catering office and was really unhappy with the way she talked to me. She was short with me, inpatient, and sort of patronized me. It got me really nervous about my order. I admitted to her that a handful of people RSVP'd to the gathering later than I had wished and she managed to bring my conservative $350 order up to nearly $600. It was really more than I could spend but she said this, "So are you only trying to feed your guests just a taste because if this was my party, I'd order a lot more than what you're ordering." That statement really made me nervous... I told her a lot of the guests were not big eaters... I also have catering experience having planned conferences for a living professionally... well, I should have gone with my gut.
