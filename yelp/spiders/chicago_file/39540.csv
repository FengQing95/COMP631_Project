Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Finally came to Bavette's for our annual try a new steakhouse tradition and remembering to make reservations asap. It was around 8pm Friday and we were seated in 5-10 minutes. In that time, we waited by the packed bar. There was a layer of people in front of us, but the bartender was good and spotted us right away asking if we wanted menus. Boo got the cognac old fashioned and it was fantastic. Shortly after getting the drink and paying, we were seated at a nice booth in the front.
