Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came with a friend who was visiting Chicago for the first time. We had decided our first night would be classic Chicago Pizza. I have my own favorite, but ended up trying this based on the hotel concierge's recommendation. Long story short, I don't like to give 1-Star reviews. And this is not based on the food because I did not ever get a chance to eat it. Arrived and put our name in and there was a 35 minute wait. No problem and no worries. Certainly not a surprise. Pre-ordered the pizza at the counter as instructed. Seems logical. Got our table. Then waited and waited. We waited for over an hour. Tables all around us who had arrived and had not pre-ordered a pizza were happily eating. Our waitress, who was lovely, kept giving us the same excuse that there was some problem with our particular pizza and that she was working on it. Finally got up and left and tried a more efficient place for dinner. Look forward to returning to my favorite pizzeria tomorrow.
