Little Goat Diner////Love this place. Came here for breakfast. Very good coffee, bottomless, for a reasonable price. The menu has anything you could ever want. I got a nicely it sandwich cause I love biscuits and heard good things about their bakery. It didn't disappoint. The sausage and sauce that can with my Chinese style sammie was really good and spicy. I maybe should have been warned by the waiter, but I have a higher spice tolerance than most people, so I loved it. It had muddled blackberries too and was very vinegary. I want to try more here!
