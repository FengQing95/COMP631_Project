Smoque BBQ////The pulled pork is my go-to and it's very good. The sandwich is HUGE with lots of meat. I shared mine with my son and was stuffed between that and the sides. The french fries are quite amazing, and one order could probably feed three-four people. The slaw seemed less fresh and colorful than I remember, but it's basically free, so I'll give it a pass. Mac and cheese is rather bland, my kids didn't even like it. They've added a patio which helps with seating, but it's still a rather stressful experience even though they do good with crowd control, line and seating. There's inevitably someone who's new to the place, trying to jockey for a table and has to be scolded. And the soda machine is located way in the corner so you have to dance around people to get a refill. As will most BBQ it's not cheap, but competitive with other BBQ places.
