Little Goat Diner////Overall, the service was very good. Our food was interesting. I had the Spiced Apple Pancakes. They were good, but there was a flavor in them that I was not expecting, more of a spicy flavor than a sweet flavor. It wasn't bad, just unexpected. The garlic potatoes as a side, however, were fabulous and melt in your mouth good. I'm not sure I'd go back for breakfast, but I would be interested in trying their lunch menu. I think the flavors might be better for lunch than breakfast.
