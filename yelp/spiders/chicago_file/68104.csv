Little Goat Diner////I followed this up with the Grilled Cheese sandwich. I was so looking forward to it, but somehow it just missed the mark.  It was extremely salty, and it had loads of onions on it, which weren't mentioned on the menu.  I happen to love onions, just not necessarily on my grilled cheese sandwich.
