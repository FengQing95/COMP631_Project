Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////First I must applaud the service. I had mentioned making my reservation that we would be in a time crunch with three guests needing to leave to catch a flight. Our waiter was not only friendly and knowledgable but made every effort to keep us on pace and remind us of the time.
