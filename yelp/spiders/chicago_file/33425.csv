Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I guess we were fortunate that she returned a few minutes later saying that the chef agreed my husband's over cooked steak was in fact over cooked.  Within just a few minutes, a new steak was brought out...again over done (though not as over as the first one).  Given that my entree was getting cold, my husband decided to just accept it...but of course two over done steaks priced at $60 are unacceptable.
