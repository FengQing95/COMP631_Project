Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////6. Paella Valenciana was a tad too 'al dente' for me. It's unfortunate that if you're here on a date and want to try this, you must get a minimum of 2 servings. Two servings is enough for about 4-5 people, and with all those tapas to order, well you do the math. I was so stuffed I never wanted to eat again.
