Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I last came here after living in Madrid for 2 month.  I was here 2 days after landing back home.  I ordered a standard spanish stable "tortilla" which is a potato and egg kind of omelette.  I ate it almost every day in Spain and if you want to know how to properly make one, watch a youtube video.  No matter how you botch it up, it will still be better than the spongy tortilla at this place. I suspect that they bake theirs - which is not the proper way to make it.
