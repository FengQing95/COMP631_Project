Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we got the pizza, i grabbed a cheese slice and it was deliciousssssss. I love how much sauce and cheese there was on the slice. And i overall just liked the pizza a lot. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because im not crazy about the crust. Im a huge bread/crust gal so i love when theres a fluffy crust on my pizza. This crust was more flakey? It wasnr bad but i definitely do prefer a more bread-y crust. Ill definitely be back.
