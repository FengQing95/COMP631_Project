Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Overall, not to be a deep dish hipster, but I still think Pequod's is still my favorite. Screw it, I relish being a deep dish hipster. That being said, Lou Malnati's has stood the test of time, and rightfully so. With so many locations, the convenience factor is there, and while they're all mostly tourist destinations, you'll likely get a good, consistent, deep dish pizza no matter where you go.
