Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We weren't planning to try Lou Malnati's during our trip to Chicago but we felt like we needed to, in order to properly say which deep dish was better between Lou Malnati's and Giordano's. I can't really judge if this was a fair comparison though, because we ate Giordano's fresh out of the oven in the restaurant, but ate Lou Malnati's out of the box after ordering to-go. Another factor, we had two different flavors. Here at Lou Malnati's, we picked the Chicago style. The sausage was so tender and the sauce was just enough. However I think the difference was the crust, I just didn't enjoy it as much. Other than that I think it was pretty close to even between the two places, and you couldn't go wrong with Lou Malnati's - and I'm sure half of the population here would favor Lou Malnati's anyway.
