Art Institute of Chicago////Don't skip the miniature exhibit and the glass paperweights exhibit on the lower level!! I almost missed these because I was in a rush to beat the aquarium's closing time, but luckily I decided to hit the restroom on the way out and saw these two exhibits downstairs. The miniature exhibit was probably my favorite exhibit - I don't know how they get everything to look so realistic at such a tiny scale, down to the 'outdoor' lighting!
