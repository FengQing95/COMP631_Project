Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////However, in addition to the steakhouse classics. , BBB  also offers upscale takes on meatloaf, roast chicken, and meatballs, along with a burger, and fish.   The sides are terrific.  We tried the butternut squash, creamed spinach and the frites.  All of them were very good.  The atmosphere is "clubby". The martinis and other cocktails, rock.   Servers were well informed and very professional.
