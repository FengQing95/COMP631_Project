Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I had a wonderful dinner at Bavette's last night. We arrived just in time for our 5pm reservation and were sat at a two top along the banquet. Our server approached us within a few minutes. Perfect timing. It gave us enough time to look over the drink menu and decide on cocktails. My husband ordered a Weller 107 old fashioned and I had a congnac sazerac. Both drinks were perfect.
