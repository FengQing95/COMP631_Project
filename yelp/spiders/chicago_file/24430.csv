Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was skeptical to try deep dish pizza, but I have to admit... I'm obsessed. I am thinking of making a whole second trip to Chicago just to come back here. The sauce and the crust are so original, to die for. Trying this place of course as a local, and definitely as a tourist, is a must!
