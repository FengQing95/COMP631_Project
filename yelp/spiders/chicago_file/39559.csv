Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Hands down, one of the best meals and steaks I've had in my life, if not THE best. Got lucky with a table for my birthday and had a Bone In Filet with truffle Mac and cheese, bone marrow and oysters. Oh man... I'm still thinking about it. The bone marrow as a compliment on the side of the steak is the way to go. Perfectly cooked and service was great. I'm still salivating thinking about it.
