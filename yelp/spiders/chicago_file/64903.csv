Smoque BBQ////Deeelllliissshhhh. Oh my god. Smoque BBQ is the bomb dot com. Their chicken, beans, sauce, and fries are so good it's worth the extensively long wait Â for a table. You can also order to go and walk right up to pick up your food. We do that and then eat it in the car. The dessert/cobbler is also really good and I've heard the pulled pork is out of this world. You won't be disappointed if you eat here but get there early if you're prone to hangriness like me.
