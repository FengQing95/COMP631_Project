Little Goat Diner////My wife and I tried Little Goat Diner on Saturday.  What can I say after all of these rave reviews?   Besides, this place is a part of Girl And A Goat - we had high expectations when we arrived.  What?  1.5 hour wait!?!  No problem, we have high expectations, we'll wait. How do we keep track of our position in line? They have a slick text messaging system to keep you updated on your position on your mobile device.  Damn near everyone in the place waiting for a table had a phone in their hands and were nervously refreshing their mobile device.
