The Purple Pig////Came from California to visit Chicago and almost everyone recommended to try the purple pig so naturally we made a reservation a couple weeks in advance. 1 week before our reservation the restaurant contacted us and said they they decided to close on July 4th and our reservation was cancelled. Naturally we were upset and there were no other reservations available on any of the other days we were here so we called to see if they could squeeze us in and we were so thankful that they were able to offer an alternate time because this is really a must try restaurant. We got the Burrata and the orecchiette which were both amazing. Neither were too heavily seasoned and the combination of flavors was delicious. We were already so thankful that they fit us in but to top it off, they served us their cheesecake on the house to make up for the cancellation! Service is top notch and we were surprised they even remembered! Will definitely be recommending this restaurant to everyone who comes to Chicago.
