Smoque BBQ////So the only thing that kept this to 4 stars is that I can't give 4 1/2...they missed 5 stars with the little bit dry baby backs...although the taste was there. Give this place a try. It had the best brisket I have ever had. The four of us ate for $60...nice reasonable deal. Parking outside is problematic since you are in a city neighborhood (South Old Irving Park) but work with it and you'll be glad you did.
