Little Goat Diner////I've now been to Little Goat four times.  While it can be hard to get into during prime lunch (weekday's) or brunch (weekend) hours, if you go when the hip crowd isn't up yet (7 - 8am), the place is nearly empty.  While I've had a number of things on the menu for both lunch and breakfast, one of my favorites so far is the burrito.  It has some interesting flavor combinations with the indian sauces and the salad and eggs.  The pies are delicious, as well as the shakes.  Lastly, they maintain an excellent, rotating beer selection that's well though out and locally oriented.
