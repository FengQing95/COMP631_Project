Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////VERY Dissappointed. This place is not what it used to be 10 years ago. Menu has been shortened. Tapas not as special. Most were too salty. Mussels were not fresh -- even served us a couple of closed ones (where is quality control?). Sangria is overpriced, and overiced; tastes like coolaid. If you're going to have to wait long anyway, then you might as well go to Cafe Iberico for Tapas -- better value, better choices, better taste.
