Little Goat Diner////Went here for breakfast on a Saturday. The service and ambiance were both great.  The food was very good overall. The menu was on the more adventerous side so maybe not the best place for a picky eater.  The cinnamon rolls were delicious.  Solid meal but I was just not blown away enough to warrant giving 5 stars.
