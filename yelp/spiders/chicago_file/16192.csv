Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////While visiting Chicago at the beginning of July with my mom, I knew I couldn't avoid trying Chicago style deep dish pizza. Usually I don't really care where I am having pizza as long as it is good, but in this case I figured I better try one of the two establishments which are practically legends when it comes to this type of pizza.
