Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here with a couple of friends, had the seafood paella, patatas bravas, goat cheese croquetta, and some mango sangria. It was alright. I really like the patatas bravas, but the paella was mediocre. I have a tendency to compare restaurants (which I know isn't fair), but Toro Bravo in Portland does Spanish tapas much better.
