Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went on a Thursday around 6:30-7pm. Checked in at the host stand, put our name in for a table, told a 45 min wait. Went to the stand next to it and ordered our pizza in advance- we were advised that this is how they do it. This way the pizza has time to cook so you don't have to wait another 40 mins. It's timed with the table seating! Just pizza is preordered everything else is ordered through the waitress at the table.
