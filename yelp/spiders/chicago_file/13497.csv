Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Hostess was a B*tch.  Everyone else was REALLY nice and attentive (Host taking seat numbers, bus boy, waitress, even other hostess).  We see other guest waiting for their table, ordering ahead of time since all deep dish pizzas take awhile.  We went up and order and the host was very direct.  Thinking that we should place the whole order, we order a Appetizer.
