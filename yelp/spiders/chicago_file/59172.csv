Smoque BBQ////The first time I went to Smoque, we must have waited 30 mins in the line before getting in. It was a good thing that it was warm and not freezing cold. The menu is up on the wall and it's a serious BBQ joint. The location is pretty easy to get to as it's right off the Expressway. Parking was not an issue either as we found one fairly easily on the side street a couple of blocks away.
