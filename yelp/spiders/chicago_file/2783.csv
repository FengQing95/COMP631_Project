The Purple Pig////I haven't written many reviews but I like to write one when I have had a truly amazing above-and-beyond experience, and that was what happened at The Purple Pig. Important things besides the phenomenal food were 1. our excellent server and 2. How fast each plate came out! (Even though the place was busy) We had the pig ear, salt-roasted beets, pork belly and tenderloin and a pasta I can't remember the name of. Freaking delicious and an all around perfect time. Can't wait to go back!
