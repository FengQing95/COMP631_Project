Little Goat Diner////Review is for breakfast but the menu looks great for lunch and dinner as well. Alot of the options sound good, prices are quite high for breakfast. Little piggy goes to china was good but the sauce was very strong. Â Had trouble finishing it because it was so rich. The bullseye french toast was really good and the portion was quite large. Hashbrowns were the highlight of the meal. Perfectly crispy on the outside and goat cheese theoughout, highly recommend.
