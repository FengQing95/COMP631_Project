Smoque BBQ////Is Smoque the best BBQ in the whole wide world?  Probably not.  But by Chicago standards, this place is awesome.  But disclaimer!: if you order to-go in the winter, make sure you eat the food in a timely manner, because if you spent inordinate amounts of time outside with your takeout, the cold will ruin that hot freshly-smoked taste of the BBQ.
