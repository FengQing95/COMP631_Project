Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Upon entry, your first impression may very well be, I'd like to forego the steak and sit in these sexy vintage couches drinking sexy vintage cocktails.  And I would not cast aspersions on you for doing so.  My noble bourbon boozers may initially be confounded by the concentration of cognac on the cocktail menu, but be not abashed, I beseech you.  The Old Fashioned and Sazerac, prepared cognac style, are delicious and elegant and will add a certain Nawlins Jazz Age je ne sais quoi which may have been missing from your life up to this point.  We must all live and expand our horizons.
