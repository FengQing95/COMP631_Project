Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////On my road trip from San Francisco to the east coast, my friend suggested that I must check out Lou Malnati's. I'm so glad I did. On my last day in Chicago, after a week here, it was a good way to end the week long vacation Chicago style. The deep dish pepperoni cheese pizza was amazing. Drinks were measured, so I had to drink down 4 drinks (incl. a long island) in 1 hour though.
