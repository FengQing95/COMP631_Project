Art Institute of Chicago////Also the staff could REALLY learn to take a chill pill. I understand how stressful it must be to keep every grimy-fingered toddler and overly curious tourist from touching anything, but yelling at one friend who simply leaned in towards a painting for a better look, "THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH, SIR!" and the outdoor guard yelling that people can't sit on one set of stairs but CAN sit on the stairs 1 inch away, is excessive. Put a damn sign up where people can't sit, then. The only staff who didn't seem to absolutely hate their jobs or exude indifference were the coat check people.
