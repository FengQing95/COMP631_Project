Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Had to try Chicago deep dish again. The hostess was friendly. I sat at the bar, which was great. It was a busy night, and the place was hoping with energy around different sporting events. I liked watching the bartender serve the pizzas in worn, hot skillets with tongs and a serving spatula. The bartender was very friendly and charming.
