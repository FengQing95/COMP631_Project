Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm not from Chicago but I know they're pretty big on their steakhouses. A couple of friends and I were a little torn between Bavettes and Kinzie, and I'm so glad we chose this place. Right when you walk in the vibes are really nice, pretty dim like most steakhouses but also a nice modern feel. We were seated downstairs where there were huge booths and a center area with some couches and chairs.
