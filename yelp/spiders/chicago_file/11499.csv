Art Institute of Chicago////Truly a 5 Star museum, probably one of the best museums in America. This place has it all, paintings, sculptures, videos, beer and coffee in the cafe, new art, old art, a hipster wearing a beanie that says "abomination" a lot, religious art, that one painting from Ferris Bueller, Cat Milfs - that's that thing where a single older woman makes sure you tie your shoes to prevents falls, but you know she probably doesn't have kids, but probably a lot of cats and liberal ideals.
