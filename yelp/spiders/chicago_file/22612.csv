Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A really great Chicago style pizza. The highlighted original pizza is definitely the way to go and so Chicago. There is about a 45 minute wait. Make sure you read the descriptions on the menu, they are really helpful and accurate. The CRUST!!!! Just really well done, and fresh. The salads are huge, and take up unnecessary space in the stomach that should be filled with pizza. Our waiter was great, and his drink recommendations were fantastic. If you are in Chicago, I would definitely recommend you come here for the pizza. The sausage in the pizza was an explosion of flavor and covered the entire pizza completely. The prices are very reasonable, and the quality of the food is excellent.
