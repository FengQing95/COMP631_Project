Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am in Chicago a few times a year for work and I always make it a point to get my Lou Malnati's. I have tried a lot of the other places in town like Gino's East, Giordono's and Pizza Uno, and Lou Malnati's is the best, by far. My boyfriend and I even had some frozen pizza's shipped to us in New York, though they are not as good as when you eat there. A Chicago must have.
