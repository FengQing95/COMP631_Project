Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If you need further proof of how truly stellar this restaurant is, it won over my 70 year aunt and 60 year old mom, who both gravitates towards Asian food. Not only did they love cafe ba-ba-reeba, this place trumped ALL restaurants that I had brought them to during their trip here. They even ranked this above the three Asian-inspired places that I thought would rock their world.
