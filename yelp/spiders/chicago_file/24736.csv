Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So.  I nust revise my initial review.  Please note we visited this locale 1 year later and found EVERYTHING to be exquisite.  The gluten free pizza was excellent, as were the wings and tiramisu.   Huge portion, btw, of tiramisu.    Pizza was piping hot and so gosh darn tasty, I recommend it to all regardless of allergies.  Nice job !
