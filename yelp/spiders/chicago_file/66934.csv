Little Goat Diner////Great diner for visiting friends.  The food is remarkable.  Cheesy bread and fried pickles and onions are a great way to start.  Grilled Cheese, Fat Club and almost all of their sandwiches are incredible.  Would come back here again.  The menu is overwhelming with so many great items to choose from.
