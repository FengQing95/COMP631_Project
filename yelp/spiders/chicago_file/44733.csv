Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Was first treated very rudely by one bartender, super inconvenienced and arrogant. HOWEVER, I need to mention that our time was made much more pleasant once Luis took over. He smiled and was more than willing to keep us at the bar. Very kinda bartender, he also took off a mistake the other bartender made once we got our bill. Not to mention I saw he tried asking the rude bartender about it and was treated the same way we were. Keep smiling and being amazing Luis, because of you we will be back and hope to sit with you.
