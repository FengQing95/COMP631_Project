Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'll preface and say I got this for delivery...It came, it was good, but it wasn't amazing...I made my own. I put pepperoni, sausage, onion and basil. The sausage wasn't the best quality and Â was not cut up. I'll try another place next time...Not bad, just didn't live up to the hype.
