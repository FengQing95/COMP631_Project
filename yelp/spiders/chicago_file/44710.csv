Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Sooooooo DELICIOUS!!!! The menu is vast and everything we got was amazing! The spot is great for big groups, date night, or girls night out. It's super casual and laid back but the flavors are anything but casual. Definitely recommend the house sangria pitcher... So yummy! The location is outside the city so might be tricky for some people to get to but the train brings you right there. Real cute area and nice break from the city. Eventho this is tapas we left super full and less than $100.. Worth every single dollar spent. The ambiance and staff complete this amazing experience.
