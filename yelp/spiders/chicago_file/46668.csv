Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The first time I came here was with my best friend during Restaurant Week. We loved it so much! We were able to try so many of their dishes because of the Restaurant Week Set Up. A note: I was not that impressed by the Paellas, but this could be because by the time it came to us, we were completely stuffed.
