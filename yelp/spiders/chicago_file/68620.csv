Little Goat Diner////Absolutely amazing experience in all.  Had the crab dip to start, which is an absolute must, best I've ever had.  Then the Reuben, which basically melted apart while eating it, incredible.  The atmosphere was perfect for the diner setting, and the portion size was well within control and away from the normal insane American standards.  Tried the Cookie Pie for dessert, creative and tasty!  Can't recommend this place enough, you need to go!
