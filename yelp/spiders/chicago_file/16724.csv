Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was visiting Chicago and just had to try Chicago deep-dish. I was a bit wary of Lou Malnati's at first because it's a chain restaurant, which I always try to avoid.  But I have to say, I really tasted the love in every bite.  The sauce was a thick tomato jam.  The crust was almost brioche-like.  The mozzarella was generous.  I was a bit bummed that I only ordered the personal size and it was gone so fast.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  If you're doing delivery, order early as there's a long wait.
