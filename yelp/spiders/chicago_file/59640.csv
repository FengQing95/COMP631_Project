Smoque BBQ////I decided to go all out and eat like a pig. I got the sliced brisket platter with mac n' cheese and coleslaw as my two sides. Also I ordered the cornbread and peach cobbler. The brisket was delicious and the BBQ sauce that came with it was so good. Everything I ate was wonderful. I was even tempted to get more peach cobbler.
