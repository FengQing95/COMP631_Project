Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The steak tartare with the egg and toast is amazing! Best I've ever had. I was not a big fan of the bone in ribeye however, I loved the sides; mashed potatoes and the mushrooms were nice. Wedge salad was OK but the thick cut bacon was amazing. The vibe there is really great, the staff is nice and the music is awesome, heard some 90's hip-hop. Upstairs has a super cool bar and seating but downstairs is a hidden gem. Vintage lighting and artifacts Â throughout the restaurant. The dim lighting and glass chandeliers are nice upstairs! I will definitely be going back and want to try the fillet next but I'm trying to eat steak only once a month. High cholesterol problems! Great night at Bavettes, thanks for the hospitality.
