Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The upstairs had a quiet decent atmosphere and seating was spread out.  It feels like the upstairs is more romantic than the downstairs.  The downstairs was more informal it had house with a mix of hip hop playing.  It wasn't load, you can still have a conversation and I enjoyed it.
