Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our server (I think her name was Jelena) was quick, friendly, helpful, and attentive. It was a bit loud and almost rowdy for a Tuesday evening, but that just added to the fun atmosphere. I really don't think I can say one bad thing about this place. Our entire experience was wonderful and I would definitely go back.
