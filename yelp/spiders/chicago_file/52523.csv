Smoque BBQ////Finally got around to trying this place. Went on a Friday night around 8pm. Plenty of seating outside and seating available on the inside as well. I ordered the chopped brisket platter. The brisket was delicious, while I don't consider myself an expert on brisket, I don't think I've had better in the city or otherwise. Meat was cooked perfectly and the barbecue sauce was delicious. BBQ baked beans were amazing and the standout dish I tried. Mac and cheese was solid. It's a no frills design on the inside, which is appropriate for a BBQ place I suppose, but the seating can be tight, the staff hover over you a bit, and it's a quick turnover. Byob on the inside only. Overall, excellent BBQ for a reasonable price. Great place for carry out.
