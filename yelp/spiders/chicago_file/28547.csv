Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got this frozen Chicago classic deep dish pizza to share with my husband's dad (visiting him in Wisconsin) who had never had Lou's (omg I know right) he thought I had baked it myself! Lol it was so delicious you would have never thought it was frozen and traveled hours to Wisconsin before baking. That's what I call quality and consistency as we get these often. Thank you SB your customer service was awesome and made our experience that much sweeter!
