Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Soooo my sister and I came here for the meat and we were NOT let down. These Texas sisters were sweetly serenaded by ribeye (Chicago cut) and a perfectly rare fillet mignon. ON. TOP. OF. THAT. Excellent service. Siaire, our server, was kind and informative on the history of "Chicago cut". Thanks, Siaire! Thanks, Bavette!
