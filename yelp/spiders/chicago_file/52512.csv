Smoque BBQ////Places that get this much attention, usually worry me because they quickly forget about the quality and go for the profits. That was not the case with smoque. We ordered the full slab of baby back ribs, (sides-included) mac and cheese (of course), BBQ beans, cornbread and fries. First off , the mac and cheese is yummy. I rate my mac and cheese on crust only, which this one - had the best. The beans were good but my wife (the bean lover) did not have much of a reaction from them, so I will leave them as OK. The ribs were very tasty and cooked with just the right amount of burn to them. The ribs get a thumbs up from me. I ordered some brisket but in the rib eating frenzy, it got cold, I will leave that rating out. I asked my wife if she wanted to try the pulled pork and she gave a "I am about to explode" yes. The pulled pork sandwich is the best!!!! GO PULLED PORK SANDWICH! The pork melts in you mouth and the sauce (with a touch of Tabasco added by me) is killer!
