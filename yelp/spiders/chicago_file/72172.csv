Little Goat Diner////The day-of coordination was handled by Tiffany who was absolutely perfect.  Really, everything about the day and choosing things like menu items, timing of events, seating, etc. was done with ease.  We did everything over email and Tiffany was kind enough to answer all of our questions in a timely manner.  Her and the team helped set up the space and it looked absolutely perfect with our decorations.  Service was wonderful, the food was AMAZING, and we had the best weather possible so we got a lot of use out of that wonderful terrace.  Our guests could not stop talking about how great everything was.
