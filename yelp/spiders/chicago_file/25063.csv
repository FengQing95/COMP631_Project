Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were visiting Chicago on business and of course wanted to try pizza. We asked many folks before heading there and since most mentioned Lou Malnati's we headed to one close to the hotel. It was quite busy, but they take your order for pizza ahead of time at the counter and I guess fire it up once you are at your table so you don't waste time ordering it at the table. We ordered the classic with the sausage and cheese. We started with a house salad which was tasty. I also had their italian style margarita..which funny enough tastes JUST LIKE the italian margarita at olive garden. Figure someone from OG must have visited a LM and tasted the margarita and decided to "borrow" it..who knows..quite funny.
