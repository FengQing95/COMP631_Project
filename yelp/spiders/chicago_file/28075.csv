Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was staying a couple of blocks away and the hotel suggested I arrive early because the restaurant was small and fills up quickly. They were right. I walked up about a half hour before the restaurant opened and there was already a line. The restaurant did fill up quick and probably not even ten minutes after it opened the bar and all of the tables were full and there was a wait.
