Smoque BBQ////The food tasted pretty good but it's not exactly very thoughtful/polite to be serving your customers burnt food.  It gets annoying to have to cut off all the burnt parts off of the meat before consuming.  Inconvenient.  Also, I'm sure a lot of people just eat the burnt parts because they just either don't know that it's bad for your health to ingest it or they know but are too lazy to remove the burnt parts.  That makes the food here somewhat hazardous to the public.
