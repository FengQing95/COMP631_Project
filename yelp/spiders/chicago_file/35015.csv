Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I took people visiting from out of town here and was disappointed because the experience was lackluster. Split a steak with my boyfriend and received a butchered steak. Who does that to a beautiful ribeye? The steak itself was only okay but the sides were pretty tasty. The waiter took it upon himself to choose the birthday boy's dessert and charge us for it. Never coming back.
