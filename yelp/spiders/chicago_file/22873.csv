Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We came here early and didn't have a wait.  What a plus!  Seated right away!  Service was helpful and friendly.  We got the Malnati Salad and it was good.  The dressing was delightful and the bacon bits too.  We also got the Lou.  My only complaint is the crust was too soggy.  It didn't have that delicious buttercrust that usually holds its form.   It was still good but for me what makes a pizza is that nice crunchy crust.  That was a disappointment.  I've had the Malnati at another location and the crust was outstanding.
