The Purple Pig////I understand that in the downtown of Chicago, there will always be a long line for a seat and a packed seating arrangement in the restaurant ... but the two of us were uncomfortably squished side by side on a long table with many other groups ... (I mean we still LOVED the food and the waiter was awesome!) We had about a 1.5hour wait, but we quickly spent that in the shopping mall down the road! They're also so kind to text and call you to let you know that the table is ready! After the text they give you ten minutes to get back to the restaurant! So don't wonder off too far!
