Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is a go to deep-dish pizza place to eat when you are in Chicago. When you go here, keep your standards low. I say this because sometimes the pizza will be under cooked. Then sometimes the pizza will be just right. You never know what to suspect. Overall, this place is the best. I have been going here all my life and will never stop!
