Little Goat Diner////This place is really nice, and our waitress was so kind and funny. I got the bullseye French toast and I was really underwhelmed. I expected it to be heavy, which it was. Somehow the flavors didn't marry well together... it just wasn't good. It wasn't photogenic, either. The one thing it was... is soggy. I'd probably go here again but try something else... my boyfriend got the corned beef hash. He liked it! It looked good, but i didn't try any.
