Art Institute of Chicago////If you find art museums to be stuffy/pretentious, I would highly encourage you to pay a visit to AIC - especially leading up to the opening of the new Modern Wing in '09, there are going to be some amazing exhibitions. And don't try to cover the entire museum in one day - Thursday and Friday evening are free this summer, so check out a few galleries and then come back the next week! Your experience will be much more pleasant that way :)
