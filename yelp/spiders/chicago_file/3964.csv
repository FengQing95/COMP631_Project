The Purple Pig////For years my friends and I have contemplated going to the Purple Pig for dinner but were always discouraged by whole no reservations thing. This past Saturday was finally the day we were gonna execute our master plan: get to the city early enough, put our name down, then drink at a bar until we're pleasantly surprised with the call. It was Saturday dinner and we were prepared to wait 2-3 hours. By some crazy stroke of luck, we got the call after just 30 min.
