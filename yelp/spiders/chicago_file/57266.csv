Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went during the week and they had half price drinks. I had a margarita and an old fashioned. The old fashioned had the perfect portion of alcohol but the margarita was way too sweet. The interior of the restaurant has a cute enclosed patio type area making you feel as if you are outdoors.
