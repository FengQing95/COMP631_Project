Little Goat Diner////At 10 a.m. on a Saturday our wait was an hour, which is fine. When they finally texted us to get our table the hostess said, "Hope you don't mind eating outside." And that was that. Now, normally I'd be pleased to eat outside, but for some reason it's 60 degrees in Chicago this weekend (and it's July), and actually I didn't want to eat outside. But since we weren't given a choice, outside it was.
