Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here with a group of friends to celebrate our NCLEX success.  I'm not very adventurous when it comes to food but I enjoyed everything.  One of the girls in our group has a seafood allergy, and even though the server was very informative about what food would be contaminated, she was still very limited in items on the menu.  I would not recommend coming here if you have any sort of food allergy.  My favorite items were the sangria (duh) and the bacon wrapped figs.  They were like candy!
