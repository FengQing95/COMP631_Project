Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I wish I could give 3.5 stars because that is what I really feel.  I will say that the ambiance was spectacular, I really liked the vibe.  It reminded me of some really cool places I've been in Europe.  The let down here for me was the food, I had the 6 oz Filet Mignon and was not impressed at all.  Anybody charging these prices should be able to buy a quality cut of meat, cook and serve, but a steak is not a steak is not a steak.  Overall, it lacked panache to me, it was just sort of ehhh.  I also had a salad and the corn.  The salad was done well, but you know, it's not that hard to buy quality ingredients, chopped them up and pour a dressing over it.  I would expect a well done salad at a place like this and they delivered.  The Elote Corn that I got was O.K.  I wasn't blown away.  So great vibe, quality ingredients, but didn't feel I got the value that I was paying for.
