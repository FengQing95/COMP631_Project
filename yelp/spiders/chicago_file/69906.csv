Little Goat Diner////This place loves their kimchi and it's a good thing because so do I! We came here after high recommendations for brunch last weekend. We arrived around 9:30 AM on Sunday and had about a 45 minute wait so we decided to check out the bakery next door. While we were waiting, we decided to get a couple of onion rolls from the bakery to snack on. These were delicious and only $1.50 each - yum!
