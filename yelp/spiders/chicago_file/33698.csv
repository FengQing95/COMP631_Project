Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've had two incredible dinners at Bavette's. The atmosphere is incredible - very cool, speakeasy vibe that somehow still feels like an upscale steakhouse. The service is excellent, the drinks are awesome, but the best part is the food - it's really outstanding. It's not inexpensive, but worth a visit for a special occasion. Reservations fill up fast, so make sure to plan far in advance, especially for a weekend. One of the best steakhouses in Chicago.
