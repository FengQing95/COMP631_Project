Little Goat Diner////We had a fabulous brunch today. I got the blue plate special which was just delicious. It was Ropa Blue Corn Cakes, two corn cakes with pulled pork avocado, sauce, two sunny side up eggs, peppers, and chunks of fruit. Attaching a picture. My friends really enjoyed their food and the atmosphere. Lots of light, a little loud, but not too bad. A 20 minute wait, which passed by really fast with my Bloody Mary. Cute bar and bakery counter. Big time going back there, and soon.
