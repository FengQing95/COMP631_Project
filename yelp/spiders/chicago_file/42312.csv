Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I used to think this place was not so authentic, but my opinion has GREATLY changed!  Great sangria, and the tapas are really good!!!  The pimientos de padron are not quite like they are in Spain, but the other stuff I've tried is pretty good!  I ALWAYS get a pitcher of red sangria, the house platter (jamon serrano, salchichon, and chorizo with Spanish cheeses), and the bacon-wrapped dates.  You can't go wrong with any of those!  I also find the prices the be quite reasonable... probably the reason it's always SO packed.
