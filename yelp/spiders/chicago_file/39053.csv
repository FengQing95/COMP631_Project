Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Celebrating something? This is where you want to be! It is a classic (dark + romantic) french style restaurant. Â Steaks were cooked perfectly and the fries made an amazing side option, but GET THE BRUSSEL SPROUTS too! So good! Finish your evening with a sparkly celebratory dessert. Thank you Bavette's for making our anniversary trip so special!
