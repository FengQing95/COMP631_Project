Little Goat Diner////We settled on the Pork Belly Pancakes, and I had her surprise me with a libation paring of her choosing,  turned out to be something citrus-ey, with a body you'd expect from a Stout.   The pancake was layered with a thick juicy steak of pork belly hidden by a slaw.   Can I say OMFG on yelp ?
