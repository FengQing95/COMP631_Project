Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was the "must go to place" everyone told me to check out while in Chicago. Everyone raved about Deep Dish pizza the whole time. This place was so packed. Be prepared to wait, it's a very small menu so everything is flowing pretty fast. The pizza was good. We ordered the Lou. It was very filling. Good salads and other items also. Check it out, but it's very commercial-ized. I will opt for a local pizzeria next time. Still very good, and the service was good also .
