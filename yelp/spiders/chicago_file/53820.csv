Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////When we walked in there was an hour and a half wait for a table but we were lucky enough to find two seats at the bar. We got the pitcher of black raspberry sangria, which is more than enough for 2 but is really good. We had never dined there before and the bartender recommended 2-3 plates per person so we got the fried chicken, meatballs, spicy potatoes, and the beef tenderloin. Everything was amazing and would definitely order them all again and we could barely finish all of it. Service was great, food was delicious and I can't wait to go back and try everything else!
