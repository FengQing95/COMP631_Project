Little Goat Diner////little goat is one of my favorite restaurants in chicago! i've been countless times- on one of my first dates with my boyfriend, when my cousin came to town for dinner, and to brunch with a friend of mine. to be honest, i've only had three things on the menu after all this time: bloody mary, bibimbap, and the kale chickpea salad.
