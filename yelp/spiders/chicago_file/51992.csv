Smoque BBQ////The best things about this place are the price and the smell.  They have good meat and decent mac and cheese, though it was not everything some people have propped it up to be.  The sauce is way too thin though, and the cole slaw was so overly sweet that I was unable to eat it.  As seems to be a common fallacy of Chicago's BBQ joints, they did not have Texas toast.  They did have a very good soft drink selection, which sounds weird, but they have a lot to choose from.  I do have to say though that the staff was very good.  The place just didn't wow me overall like I had expected it to after reading about it online.
