Little Goat Diner////Little Goat Diner is the smaller Stephanie Izard restaurant compared to Girl & The Goat and Duck Duck Goat but this is not to be overlooked. Little Goat is a spin on classic American diner's with a modern twist. I've had their meatloaf and classic hamburger....both were so good and reasonably priced as well. Little Goat is a must try in the West Loop.
