Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I also live that they aim to please their customers. You don't dubs this often in Chicago. I'm from the South and that's a norm their. But here, most places have a culture of "You should be happy to fine here" instead of "We're so happy you chose to don't here, how can we keep you coming back". I miss that most about the South. But they definitely served up Chicago hospitality here. I didn't know that existed until now.
