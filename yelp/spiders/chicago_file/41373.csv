Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here for the first time earlier this week and I really enjoyed it! I'm not a huge tapas fan normally, so this was a pleasant surprise. My boyfriend and I split the bacon and dates, the garlic shrimp and the pork belly paella. The garlic shrimp was really good, but a little oily. The paella was good too, but I think I'd prefer the seafood paella. The bacon and dates tasted like...bacon. Not much surprise there. We also got a pitcher of the blood orange sangria. The sangria was pretty good, but very similar to white wine sangria. I'm normally more of a red sangria person, just because white can be too sweet, but the blood orange sangria was light and delicious. We also used the Yelp check-in deal to get free desserts. I got the coconut flan and my boyfriend got the caramel bananas. The caramel bananas were overly sweet compared my flan, but alone, it was good. The flan was amaaazing! Overall the food was delicious. The service was awesome, because we sat at the bar, so we never had to flag down a waiter. The only downfall for this place was the price for me. It was a little pricy for the tapas, especially with the portion size, but everything was definitely worth it. I'd for sure come back!
