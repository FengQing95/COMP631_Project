Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I would give a zero if I could. Down the street from my building. They deliver rotten, I mean spoiled, food. What idiot place does this and thinks there won't be bad reviews? Thanks to Yelp now people will know. Tourist trap with rotten food. I wouldn't go to this place if I were you, especially considering all the other really great pizza places in town. Even Bottled Blond across the street has exponentially better food-which is not rotten.
