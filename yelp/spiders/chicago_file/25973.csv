Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ok, that's not true. That's not true at all. They'll tell you that you have to try "lumilnottis" or "lumel knotty's." It's hard to tell. I finally had to ask my brother-in-law, a Wisconsinite, "Can you spell that for me? I need to look it up in Yelp." Â Ohhh... Lou Malnati's... now I understand.
