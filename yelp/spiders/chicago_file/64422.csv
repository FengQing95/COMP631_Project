Smoque BBQ////I have to dedicate a paragraph to the incredible service here.  You usually don't think about service too much from a place that doesn't have waiters but the guys & gals who work here are awesome.  They're quick to answer any questions you have and super friendly.  I was here on a packed Friday night with a group of 7, and usually at a place like this I'd expect to be separated with that many people, but thankfully they've devised a great system where there's someone to take down the number of people in your party and let you know where to sit once a table is ready.  The service even extended after I left the restaurant!  We were outside and one of the staff who was taking out the garbage helped out with a question he overheard us talking about, even going so far as to go in and ask one of the owners.
