Smoque BBQ////I just had the salad with chicken from Smoque BBQ.  For the first time in my 39 years I did a salad when I could have had smoked meat.  Just too much good eating this week.  Damn if it wasn't tasty.  The chicken was moist by breast standards and had a nice smoke flavor.  Could have used a little more spice and another thimble of dressing but then again it could have been a rack of ribs.
