Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is now my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The place is MASSIVE and we still had to have reservations for a Tuesday night. It was completely packed, and for good reason. The atmosphere is great, definitely an ideal place for a birthday/celebration dinner. As for the food, amazeballs. My favorite tapa was the buttermilk fried chicken. We also ordered a garlic shrimp dish, flank steak, and the potatoes with aioli sauce. I would recommend all of them.
