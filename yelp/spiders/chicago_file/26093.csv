Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The amount of Lou Malnati's Pizzerias around the Chicago area make it seem like a fast food chain. Do NOT be fooled however, the deep dish pizza, the appetizers, the service, and the atmosphere is nothing like a fast food chain. Their pizzas are made from scratch and you are forewarned that it will take 40 minutes for the pizza to cook. I highly suggest their fried calamaris for an appetizer paired with your favorite beer, in the summer potentially a Blue Moon or an Angry Orchard cider. For a pizza, I suggest The Malnati's Chicago Classic. The description is simple, but the pizza is far from it. The crust and the bread are perfectly crisp, and not soggy at all, with every bite providing a perfect combination of sausage patty, mozzarella cheese, and tomatoes! Perfect place to try Chicago's deep dish pizzas!!
