Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Agh second time at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! and the food and service seemed very average to me. I went for Restaurant week brunch and the portions of some dish options were very small, food came out staggered which is fine for tapas but at the same time, some of our friends waited over 40min before eating!
