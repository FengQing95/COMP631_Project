Smoque BBQ////The wait wasn't bad and we did get the table as promised. Now to the food. I really appreciate good BBQ and the exterior appearance of the ribs was excellent. Upon cutting the bones apart however there was no pink smoke ring at all. The meat was gray. That was pretty disappointing. Although the ribs looked good and smoked from the dark brown/black exterior, they really lacked the soul of a true BBQ rib. The meat was tender and fairly juicy so not a total disappointment.
