Art Institute of Chicago////Another special exhibit going on now until April 26 is the photography exhibit Regarding Heroes by Yousuf Karsh. Quite an extensive collection of black and white portraits, Karsh photographed everyone from Winston Churchill to Brigitte Bardot and every writer, artist, politician and composer in between. The Photographs are of incredible quality and beauty, and Karsh really shows the personality of his subjects. It might just be my own observation, but the writers looked especially beat down, with bags under their eyes and heavy expressions.
