Art Institute of Chicago////But what is here -- a terrific modern art collection and very good Impressionist collection which nearly rivals d'Orsay's -- is wonderful, and wonderfully laid out.  Too many museums keep paintings under glass and lit badly, so it becomes difficult to view the works itself; not so at this house.  It's also spacious enough that, even when crowded, the viewer can still actually see the works without jostling for position.
