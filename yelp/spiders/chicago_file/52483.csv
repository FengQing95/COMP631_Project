Smoque BBQ////I have no issue with the food at Smoque, it's perfectly passable when compared to other Chicago BBQ. However, having been to several BBQ places in Tennessee and Texas I wouldn't really rave about anything they make either. Although I haven't been in a while and certainly not since a Texas BBQ road trip last year. I'll give them another try soon and see how they stack up
