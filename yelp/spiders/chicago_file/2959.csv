The Purple Pig////Hype smype. I was a tourist. I went to check it out. Staff is pleasant and kind- even to a single diner at the bar such as myself. Alcohol list (or book) was impressive with a section (!!) for gin and tonics. I was alone, unfortunately, so didn't get to try a ton of stuff. But I did get the octopus, which was SO GOOD. Also, tried the broccoli- which was good (rich, umami, salty, goodness), BUT- I wouldn't recommend ordering if you're dining alone. It's just way too much of one single thing/flavor, whereas something like the octopus had octopus+veg+carb, so was perfect to eat alone.
