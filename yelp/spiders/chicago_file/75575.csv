Little Goat Diner////Boyfriend had the Dark Chocolate Chip Crunch Pancakes (the Bull's Eye French Toast ran out) and for me not having a sweet tooth, this was very nice. Not too sweet at all but much chocolate flavor. The texture of the pancakes overall really did it for me. The crunch definitely was there as they seemed to have used cocoa nibs and something like "rice krispies." The pancakes itself were very light in tasting.
