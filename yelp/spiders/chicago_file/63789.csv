Smoque BBQ////I've been hooked on Smoque ever since I tried it for the first time a few years back. When asked what my favorite type of food is, it's always been barbeque and Smoque definitely makes some of the best bbq I've had. Frankly, this Smoque is probably my favorite joint to eat at. Period.
