Smoque BBQ////Best BBQ in Chicago. Not even a question. LIGHT YEARS ahead of the competition. Pulled pork is insanely good. So is the beef brisket. Even the cole slaw is good and I usually hate cole slaw. Theirs is not creamy cole slaw, it's more of a fresh/vinaigrette type slaw and it is delicious. The cornbread is good too, and it's BYOB. There is almost always a line out the door, but it's well worth the wait. Closed on Mondays.
