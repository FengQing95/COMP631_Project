Little Goat Diner////This is high-end diner food: a trendy mix of French, American, with Asian accents. Their "sammiches" are popular, especially the ginormous "Los Drowned." I had the Tuna Melt, which was not really a tuna melt but more like tuna and salad slathered on two slices of bread. There was so much tuna and salad that you could barely see the bread, which became soggy. It was delicious though. And my friend enjoyed her Pork Belly Pancake.
