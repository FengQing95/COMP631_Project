Smoque BBQ////The BBQ at Smoque was good, but nothing extraordinary. Â On the weekday afternoon I went, it wasn't overly crowded and took about 20 minutes from the time we stepped inside to the time we received our food (I was expecting an hour+ so I was pleasantly surprised). The pulled pork is soft and well bbqed and the meat from the ribs just fell off the bone.
