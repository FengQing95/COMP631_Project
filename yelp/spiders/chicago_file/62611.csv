Smoque BBQ////very runny. not thick at all. quite a thin texture. have to soak components in sauce when dipping in order for sauce to stick on food before it makes the short trip from dipping sauce cup to lips. perhaps it would be best if they served the sauce on the food, instead of in small cups. that way, the experience with utilizing the sauce would be much more convenient.
