The Purple Pig////Food: all of their dishes are going extreme. They're great creative and tasty ones, don't take me wrong. But their spice use and flavor level is very extreme. Like the Chilled Calamari, the calamari itself was so salty that your tongue would go numb for a few seconds if you have 3 bites in a row. So does the Eggplant Caponata, the mixture of sourness and sweetness is the only thing you can taste of the bite. You can't even tell there are eggplants there. Roasted Bone Marrow, same thing. It's like eating warm fat. It's like, the cooks punch you with the pure flavors in the face. I'd appreciate if I can taste some of the textures of food more with lighter flavors.
