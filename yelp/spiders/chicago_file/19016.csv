Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For dessert we were served their Chocolate Chip Pizza (a cookie freshly baked up in the individual-sized pan, topped with vanilla bean ice cream, whipped cream, and a cherry).  Do ya see how I said earlier "get the 'Individual'-size pizza"? ....this is why.  You want this cookie pizza after your cheesy pizza.  You just do.  Gooey melted buttery cookie with ice cream - it's fun for kids AND adults alike.
