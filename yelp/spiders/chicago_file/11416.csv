Art Institute of Chicago////Not just for art connoisseurs, but for anyone who is visiting Chicago. With all of the landmarks, monuments, restaurants, famous streets and parks that Chicago has to offer I cannot say that is any sort of must-visit attraction in Chitown, however in the pantheon of art museums, this is probably one of THE art museums to visit if you're going to visit one in your lifetime.
