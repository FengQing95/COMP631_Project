Little Goat Diner////I would give Little Goat 4.5 stars if I could. Incredibly creative, delicious food and great service in a really fun space. It's diner-esque, but really well done. We ended up going twice in 24 hours--the first time while killing two hours between drinks at The Aviary and a late dinner at Girl and the Goat, and then again the next night for dinner.
