Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Sitting at the bar upstairs is a nightmare with what seemed like an endless number of lawyers or city officials just getting drunk.  The bar downstairs was awesome though.  It was more intimate and the bartenders were very friendly with the locals.  They even started joking about "recreational drugs," which kind of blew my mind that they would talk about that so openly at the bar but I'm there for the food and not for my drunken druggie neighbor at the bar.  However, it did make the night more entertaining.
