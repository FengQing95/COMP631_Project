Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our server got our drink and appetizer order right away. We got the cheesy spinach bread appetizer which was absolutely delicious. It was a great way to start the meal. Our pizza didn't take too long after that, and our server made sure our order was right before bringing it to use since we wanted half to be vegetarian. We got a small deep dish (9 inches) which was the perfect amount for 2 people, especially considering we already had an appetizer.
