Little Goat Diner////The place is cute AND it has valet parking which is great for mornings like yesterday.  We had no trouble finding parking on the street but it's nice to know they have valet, as I use them often.  Lil' Goat is certainly family friendly and popular.  Babies and kids are scattered throughout the happy interior and there is a nice energy in there.  We were seated as soon as we walked into the door and were pleased with a huge booth for us two.  Everyone working there had a smile on their face and the kitchen was exposed so you get that authentic diner experience.  We had the cutest ginger waiter who was very helpful with helping me choose my breakfast.  I went with the Bull's Eye French Toast. My brunch date decided to try the Shrimp & Grits but we were informed that they were all out of grits.  This presented a problem for me because I wanted a side of those cheesy grits.  He had been here many times before so he decided to order what I ordered.  We also both had bottomless mugs of coffee.
