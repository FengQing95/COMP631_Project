Smoque BBQ////The clincher?  SWEET TEA.  Yeah, sure, this is probably the least exciting part of the menu to most people, but for me it is a mandatory to have either sweet tea or beer with bbq.  They had both on the menu.  Thank goodness I can count on this place for a bit of back-home goodness between trips to Dallas.
