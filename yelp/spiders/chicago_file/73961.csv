Little Goat Diner////We went on a Sunday... got there around 1:00. They told us it would be a 45 minute wait. We walked around (thank goodness they have the "texting system" so we didn't have to stand there in the restaurant forever). Luckily, after 20 minutes, we got a text and got a table! By the time we sat down for another 20 minutes, there were a ton of tables open, so I'd recommend holding your hunger until 1:30ish so you don't have to wait a long time outside.
