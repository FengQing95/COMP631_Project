Little Goat Diner////Am just sorry it's taken me so long to write this Incredibly revealing review of how small minded Chicago and at Little Goat staff really are. Suggestion to the Human resources team qt Little Goat: Maybe Incorporate some DIVERSITY TRAINING into the onboarding process? People of intelligence and affluence come in all shapes colors and sizes, and countries may I add - So maybe it's time your staff should be aware of it now too????
