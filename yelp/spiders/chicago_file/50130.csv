Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service from beginning to end and from hostess to server was friendly and attentive. Our server gave us her honest opinion with our questions and her dining suggestions were spot on--we really enjoyed our whole experience. We started with a 1/2 pitcher of sangria--which was just enough for the two of us. Fruity and refreshing with lots of bits of fruit throughout. I didn't need more ice, but I noticed there was one server that all he did was add ice to sangria glasses for the folks that wanted/needed more ice.
