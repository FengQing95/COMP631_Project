Little Goat Diner////Both the staff in little goat bakery and restaurant are very nice and willing to give advice. As to food, I tried their scone and conchas, they are good but not outstanding. I also tried the brunch in their restaurant. I ordered BRANDADE AND BELLY, though the combination of these ingredients are pretty weird to me, I found it taste good actually. I love the creamy biscuits especially.
