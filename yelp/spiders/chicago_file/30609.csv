Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Service however was very slow and took a while to get waited on. Although they have both deep dish and their Malnati's specials we decided to go with thin crust since we were pretty much worn out. Our waiter said it would take 45 minutes to prepare but since we ordered thin crust he said he would check on it and we would probably have it sooner.
