Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was the first time my wife an I had deep dish pizza.  We decided to go with the Classic pizza, because if it's their classic it must be good, right?  Yep, it was and we were not disappointed.  We ordered the medium, which feeds 2-3 people, but it was too much for us.  No problem, it just meant we had some leftovers to hobble on later.
