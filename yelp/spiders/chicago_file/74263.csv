Little Goat Diner////I had the pork/chocolate shake and fat club. I'm in love with everything about this place. EVERYTHING! The ambiance, decor, concept, mood, staff, food....oh goodness I could go on and on with the adjectives. Gosh, you know it's an amazing place when I can't even properly type a coherent review. My heart is here. Glad I was a tourist in my hometown. New favorite must visit place whenever I go home!
