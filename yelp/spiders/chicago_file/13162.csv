Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Let's get to the point... Lou's is the best pizza in town. Its better than Uno's, Giardano's and is leagues better than Gino's East (which sucks). What makes Lou's so great is that they don't skimp on the cheese, which can often be the case with Chicago-style pizza. Just remember... always go one size down when ordering if you're used to traditional pizza. Chicago-style pizza is super filling.
