Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Overall, this place might just be the one. The one we celebrate anything congratulatory, romantic, or even just having a classy night out. I will come back, and I will order similar foods, and I will try to get an early reservation because I wouldn't have made it to 10:30, especially now knowing what their food is like. For a glass of Champagne, a glass of Malbec, Oysters, two Steaks, Mashed Potatoes, Brussels Sprouts, and a Chocolate Cream Pie, $240 wasn't that bad; especially since the service was great, we were never rushed, and the night was all too great.
