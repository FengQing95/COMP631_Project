Smoque BBQ////The sides and peripheral items (chicken, sausage) are all excellent but get the ribs (both types if possible)--they are better than I ever thought ribs could be.  The sauce is also excellent but have a few with none at all, as the rub has plenty of flavor and is again just fantastic.  Every time I have been here--many, now--the preparation was flawless.
