Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Entrees: My wife got the 6oz filet and ordered it medium, and it was super tender and cooked perfectly. I ordered the 16oz strip steak (not on the menu) and although it was cooked a perfect medium rare, the steak itself was too tough. With a strip you don't expect the tenderness of a filet, but I order strips a lot at restaurants and this was definitely too tough.
