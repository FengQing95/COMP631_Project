Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had eaten pizza in NYC and other places throughout the US, but I had not experienced real Chicago pizza up until I visited Chicago in mid-October.  A colleague and I ended up trying 3 pizza places during our visit, Giordano's, Pizzeria Uno, and Lou Malnati's.  They were all delicious.  Lou Malnati's and Giordano's were very similar, yet Malnati's was a tad better according to my t-buds.  Two things caught my attention, the sauce and the crust.  Malnati's sauce tasted really fresh and had a slightly spicy kick to it.  The "butter crust" was a little crunchier than Giordano's.  Giordano's crust has a pie-like, flakier crust.  Don't get me wrong, Giordano's is the bomb as well, I just liked Malnati's a tiny bit more.  If you're planning to dine-in, I wouldn't recommend going during peak times.  Seating is pretty limited and the restaurant has tight quarters.
