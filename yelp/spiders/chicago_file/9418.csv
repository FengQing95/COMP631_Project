Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is like a house that kept building and kept adding on so the museum is a bit hard to navigate but luckily the security guards, proctors and volunteers are helpful and know their way around.  Take it at your own pace.  Getting lost in art isn't so horrible either.
