Smoque BBQ////I'm having a hard time knowing where to start. Their ribs are excellent. I RARELY eat a whole rack, but I've done it here. They also smoke their brisket to perfection. The cornbread is just awesome. The right amount of moisture (most cornbread is too dry), and slightly crumbly. Peach cobbler is probably the 2nd best I've tried, and really, really good. My son is a picky eater but he loved their mac and cheese.
