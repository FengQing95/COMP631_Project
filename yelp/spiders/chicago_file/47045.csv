Smoque BBQ////My FAVORITE BBQ joint around!! Delicious pulled pork and chopped brisket!! Ask for a side of rib sauce with your brisket tastes great that way!! And when ordering a brisket meal or any for that matter... Be sure to order a large sized mac and cheese!!!(which is pretty much a double order.) Â Soooooooo YUMMY!
