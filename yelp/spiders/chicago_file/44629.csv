Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I can't say enough of about this place, nor can I stop eating/drinking there! Their sangria is so yummy! Some of the best in the city I've had. I have tried various items on their menu, but I highly recommend the brussels sprout salad, the spicy potatoes with tomato aioli, fried calamari,and Â chorizo wrapped date, and butterscotch pudding!!
