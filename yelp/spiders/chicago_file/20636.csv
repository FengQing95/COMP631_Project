Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Average pizza, long wait, okay service.  I'm definitely not a fan after having to wait this long for a pizza that wasn't too good.  Thankfully I found better pizza after a few more visits to Chicago.  Only eaten here once, so take the review as a one time experience review.
