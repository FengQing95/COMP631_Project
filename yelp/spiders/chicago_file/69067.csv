Little Goat Diner////The bulls-eye french toast was just A-OK. I thought that it left something to be desired. It was tasty, but it wasn't extremely good. The burger was really good, but it was kind of salty. Lastly the drink itself was not too good. Personally, I don't like the taste of goat Â or lamb because it has a certain taste and smell. I should have known that goat milk would have that taste. HOWEVER, thankfully the server came and noticed that my friend and I didn't touch our drinks at all. She gladly switched it for regular lattes, thank you!
