Smoque BBQ////I came on a Saturday at around 3pm, and only had to wait about 5 minutes to place my order. The two of us were seated inside immediately, and the food was prepared within 10 minutes. The chopped brisket platter with sides of cole slaw, mac & cheese, and beans that I ordered was thoroughly amazing. The mac & cheese was literally the best that I've ever had and the beans had the perfect amount of 'sweetness' to them. Though, I am not a fan of the particular type of cole slaw that was served here, which involves coarsely cut cabbage and not enough of the mayo-based sauce. My friend had a side of peach cobbler, which you are allowed to have as a side as part of a meal, and it was absolutely delicious. We even ordered a couple more of the cobblers to go afterwards. A full platter, including 3 sides, will run you about $10. I will absolutely come back here.
