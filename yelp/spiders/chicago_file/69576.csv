Little Goat Diner////A few Saturdays ago we decided to check out Little Goat.  We figured that a late lunch (2:30) would ease the wait.  We were wrong.  We arrived and there was supposedly an hour wait for a table.  However, Little Goat also has communal seating that we were able to snag right away.
