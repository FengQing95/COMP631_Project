Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Sauce: I actually prefer the flavor of the sauce at Lou's compared to Giordano's, but much prefer the consistency of Giordano's(which just seems fresher with larger chunks of tomato). The sauce at Lou's is a bit sweeter while still being spiced similarly(I'm a fan), but for the most part seemed like a paste rather than a more natural and made-to-order tomato sauce.
