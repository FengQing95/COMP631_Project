Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////On the menu there's a ton to pick from - the baked goat cheese in sauce, buttermilk chicken, dates, and beef with blue cheese are some of my favorites. The paella is also good, granted I've only tried the seafood one - but they're a bit more of a commitment (30 min wait, minimum two serving order per table). Also, I tried the calamari on the most recent visit and was kind of disappointed, it wasn't bad by any means but it wasn't anything special. In the seafood section - either of the scallop empanada or the garlic, red pepper, oil shrimp are very good.
