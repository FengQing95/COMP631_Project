Little Goat Diner////We enjoyed a great, leisurely Sunday afternoon brunch here today.  Loved the decor, service was great, food was uniformly delicious and so generously portioned that 3 of us took half home for lunch!  All 4 of us enjoyed our meals - goat burger, pork belly pancake, BBQ pork sandwich and fat club. We somehow managed to eat dessert too. The choco taco sundae daughter ordered was an interesting combination of sour cream icecream, hard shell chocolate and chocolate covered "taco shells". We also enjoyed the chocolate turtle tart with cashews and the pumpkin tart with pecans.
