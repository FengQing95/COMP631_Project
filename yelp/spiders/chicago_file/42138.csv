Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I am from Spain, which means I am very picky when it comes to tapas. This is not food just like in Spain, but you're never going to find that here just because the ingredients you buy in the states are not exactly the same. However, this was good! I always get very excited when I find a spanish restaurant that actually makes me feel almost like home :)
