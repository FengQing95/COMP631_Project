Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The smell right when you come in the door was of fresh baked bread and marinara.  The waitress was very friendly and we did not wait long to be seated.  We were told that pizzas would take 30-35 minutes so we put our order in right away.  The waitress got us to add the butter crust to our cheese pizza which I did not overly enjoy.  The place was good and the staff was friendly but it was nothing to write home about.  The atmosphere was warm and nicely decorated but I probably would not return because there are just way too many good pizza places in the world.
