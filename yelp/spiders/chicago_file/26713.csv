Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the Classic and The Lou.  I was only interested in the Classic, but my wife wanted something with some vegetables on it so we ordered a personal size Lou.  The Classic was awesome on every detail.  The buttery crust, fennel sausage, and chunky sweet sauce were perfect.  I could eat this everyday.  The Lou was kind of plain in comparison, but I believe the fewer toppings on a pizza are better.
