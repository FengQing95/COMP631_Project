Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The paella was a little too soggy for my taste but it wasnt bad either. I was really impressed with the chicken and ham croquetas esp the white sauce it came Roast dates were just ok and the calamari I had better from other places. The spicy potato didnt do much for me, it tasted like potato drenched with sazon. The bill came to about 85 dollars with tip.
