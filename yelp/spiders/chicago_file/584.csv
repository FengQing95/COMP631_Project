Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I was recently in Chicago for a work conference and staying at a hotel nearby.  I was immediately on the prowl for a breakfast place with decent prices and good food where I could fuel up for the long day of sitting ahead of me.  I was also 5 months pregnant and had an aversion to eggs (the standard breakfast fare).  Wildberry fit the bill perfectly!  Their non-egg menu is extensive and delicious.  I didn't have the same thing twice and was more than satisfied with everything I got.  Most especially, the staff was warm and friendly but not overbearing (which I'm sensitive to and hate).  I'll definitely be coming back whenever I'm in town.
