Little Goat Diner////I'm fan of Bloody Mary's, especially on a Sunday morning. However, I am also a big fan of a Moscow Mule. When I saw a Moscow Goat on their cocktail menu, I knew it was meant to be. Their Moscow Goat is Bombay Dry Gin, Ginger Beer and Grapefruit with lime garnish. Oh, so refreshing. If only we could start every morning with one of these.
