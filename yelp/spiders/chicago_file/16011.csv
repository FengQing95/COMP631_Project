Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I would certainly go back to Lou's for deep dish. I would like to try Uno and Due and Giordanos and Ginos. But given the "bad food" and "exacerbating waits" described for those places, I was happy being able to walk into Lou's unannounced and be able to enjoy a great deep dish pizza within 30 minutes of reaching the restaurant.
