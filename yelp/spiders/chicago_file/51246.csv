Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great place for brunch! I got the Mango Sangria half pitcher and split it with one person. DELICIOUS. As my meal I got the sampler and it was filling with 6 different items. I also got to taste test some items around the table - including the bacon mac and cheese. It was all superb. On top of that, the service was great and so were the prices.
