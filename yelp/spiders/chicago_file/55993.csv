Smoque BBQ////The staff was very helpful in making sure our group of 6 was seated together, no mean feat, considering how busy the place was. The staff also does a good job keeping things moving, without trying to rush one out of the place. As for ambiance, well, it's a BBQ joint. I saw families and people from every walk of life. It can be a bit loud in there, with everyone talking. (Which kinda surprised me. The food is so great, you'd think you'd only hear moans of ecstasy, but yeah, some people actually manage to talk!)
