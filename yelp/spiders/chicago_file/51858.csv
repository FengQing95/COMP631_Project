Smoque BBQ////I absolutely loves the food.  The pulled pork was better than I have ever had at any Texas Style BBQ and let me tell you that is a whole genre' in the South.  The beans where fresh and plump and their sauce was tangy.  For somebody that rarely likes coleslaw I gotta say that it was fresh, light, and without mystery sauces that give me the heebie-geebies.  The staff was friendly and curt.
