Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I used to stay away from tapas restaurants when I was younger because of my pickiness.  Ba-Ba-Reeba changed my mind instantly upon my first visit.  Reservations are essential, but should you have to wait, grab a half pitcher of sangria before your table's ready.  I tried the Cava sangria for the first time and the sparkling wine really wasn't for me.  Only try it if you're not a fan of sweet sangria.  The bar where you can wait has ample seating and is not in the way of the traffic at the entrance.
