The Purple Pig////I started my meal off with the calamari, fregola, radishes, cucumbers, and pistachios dish. This dish was a good start but it just didn't pack the out of this world flavor I was expecting. For my second course at my waitress's recommendation I went with the lamb ribs with harissa, treviso marmalade, Isreali couscous, and orange. Now this dish definitely had that out of this world flavor I was searching for. I quickly added it to my list of top five greatest things I've ever eaten. According to the waitress that is their most popular dish. To finish my meal I went with the squid stuffed with prosciutto and bread crumbs with santorini fava puree and charmoula. This dish was excellent and very flavorful as well and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
