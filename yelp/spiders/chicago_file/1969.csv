Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Verdict: Amazing. Gravy had a bit of sweetness to it which was different but not too sweet. Very yummy. Bacon was high quality and actually worth the money you pay for it for a change. Crazy when you pay $3.50 for bacon and it's thin and nastified. This stuff was thick and not too fatty.
