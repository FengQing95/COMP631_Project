Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Have never left a review before but my experience at Bavette's has compelled me to do so.  From the moment we walked in the door we were greeted by the friendly and professional host staff.  We waited for moment and was walked to the downstairs area.  The decor and ambiance of the entire restaurant was fantastic!
