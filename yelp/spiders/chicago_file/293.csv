Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We went to Wildberry's TWICE on our recent trip to Chicago for Lollapalooza. While we had to wait on both occasions being that it was super busy, it was well worth the wait. The pancake selection was tremendous ( we ordered every kind between us) and the hash browns were super tasty. The prices were very reasonable, they had a barista/coffee bar on site and the service was spot on, especially with all the special requests/substitutions that our group had with every meal. Also, even though they had people waiting for tables, they let us sit and chat with our coffees after we had had our meal. It was a great place for breakfast/brunch.
