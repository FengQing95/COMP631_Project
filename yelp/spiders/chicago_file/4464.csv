The Purple Pig////What a wonderful meal we had at The Purple Pig.  We waited at the bar and managed to get a couple of seats in about 20 minutes.  The service was outstanding, even as we were waiting a couple of servers took our drink orders and gave us some olives to munch on.   The menu is so interesting and each item has a recommended wine to go with the meal.  The wine list is so large, I heard over 500 types of wine and very interesting and fairly price.  Congrats to the Beverage Manager.  While we were ordering, we met the Alan the Beverage Manager and received some great ideas on wine to have with our order.  What did we eat?  We had the Salt-Roasted Beet that come with Whipped Goat Cheese + Pistachio Butter and the Lamb Ribs.  Both were terrific in taste, presentation and combination of flavors.  Don't miss desert.  We had the Sicilian Iris that I was told they are know for; a roll full of ricotta cheese and dark chocolate that is baked and melts in you mouth.
