Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Don't get the appetizers.  Just go straight for the pizza.  Get the Lou (spinach, romano cheese, and other veggie stuff) which automatically comes with the butter crust or get the Sausage/Pepperoni with the butter crust.  The crust is soft and buttery (duh) and incredible.  The cheese is thick and perfect.  You will be in heaven (which may end up sooner than you wanted given how much your cholesterol is about to go up after eating one of these pies).
