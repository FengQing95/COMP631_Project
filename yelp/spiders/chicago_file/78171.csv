Little Goat Diner////By the time our entrees came out we were stuffed! We all especially loved the crumpets! Not sure if I've even had one before but they were crunchy on the outside yet soft and airy on the inside! Amazing. I also liked the this little piggy went to China. It was a szechuanese flavored sausage biscuit essentially. We left extremely stuffed! Great place for brunch!
