Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is a fresh review, I still have the left overs with me lol. Â Is it the best pizza in Chicago? No, I mean it is nice but for me, nothing to rave about there are other smaller pizza places that I have tried, that have blown my mind. I just went because every one goes on about it and I guess it's mainly because of the tourists. It is a very touristy restaurant. I still prefer Pizano's over Lou Malnati's and Giordano's. The service is great and the waiter was very attentive, so no worries. It was good that I went and got it out of the way, now I have the experience lol, on to the next. It is safe to say that I won't be going back
