Smoque BBQ////the ribs were tinted with smoke tho lacked spices and the good ol porkiness of other ribs from the side south. yes, the fries are good, but if i wanted good fries, i'd just move back to LA and eat in-n-out everyday. go for a cheap beef brisket sandwich and avoid the rest of the menu. A slightly sweet, slighty tangy, barely spicy, not-to-thick/not-to-think sauce was the saving grace. Alas, the sauce is not the boss.
