Little Goat Diner////It was a Sunday morning when I went to Little Goat Diner. This place is really popular, so the wait on Sunday is pretty long. In order to get my table, I had to wait about 45 minutes. After that, the waiter was awesome and the breakfast was amazing. I ordered an Indian flavored breakfast plate and I thought the blend of flavors just melted in your mouth. I also sampled some crab cakes. Those were really good too. The price wasn't too bad, so I feel like going here is worth it. I recommend going at random hours in the day though; the wait is horrible, especially if you're hungry.
