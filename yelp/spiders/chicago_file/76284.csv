Little Goat Diner////The French toast was out, as there was no way to beat yesterday. A tie is like kissing your sister. So I opted for the little  piggy Asian breakfast sandwich at Anna's recommendation. The first bite was a flavor explosion. An inconceivable blend of flavors, which somehow make a perfect combination of flavor, texture and spiciness.  Szechuan sausage, two eggs, on the world's best biscuit in a  red chili sauce with just the right kick. Halfway through, my taste buds were doing jumping jacks. A marvelously psychadelicious experience. Anna's service was A+ today as Cameron's was yesterday. Mega stars.
