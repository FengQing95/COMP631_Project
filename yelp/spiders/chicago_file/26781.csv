Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great pizza, as advertised. The only knock is the wait and nothing done about it. I didn't order an app because it's freaking deep dish pizza (c'mon, I'm about to ingest 3.5 million calories already!) Perhaps give table games or something to keep people busy for 45 min while they wait. Good food takes some time, yes, but it'd be nice to kill that time somehow.
