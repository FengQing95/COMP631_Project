Little Goat Diner////Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! I wanted to try The Girl & The Goat, but didn't want to spend that much. My friend told me that this place was a little more casual, and run by the same chef. It did not disappoint. We started off with the goat chili cheese fries and they were delicious, fresh, and flavorful. I got the most epic fish tostadas, my friend got the delicious fat club sandwich, and my other friend got los drowned. Everything was Â absolutely amazing. Our food got to the table right away, our server was great, and our cups were never empty. Highly recommend!!
