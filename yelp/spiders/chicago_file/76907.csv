Little Goat Diner////I got the fish tostadas which has pretty good flavor. My fiancée got the los drowned which was supposed to have braised beef but it was super chewy and inedible. The fries with the goat chili were actually very good though.  The worst thing in the menu is the little goat latte. It uses goat milk, which sounds interesting but tastes terrible. I love goat cheese but goats milk is not my cup of tea. If you like goats milk, maybe you'll love it. I just feel goats milk is more savory and didn't work in a sweet latte. My friend also got the chocolate milk (which was $5) and that was super watered down (again, adding the goats milk didn't help.)
