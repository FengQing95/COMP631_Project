Art Institute of Chicago////Absolutely breathtaking. Wide vareity of art. Japanese, Indian, American folk art, Chinese, modern, weapons, etc. Also tons of space. Depending on when you go within the year there might also be special exhibitions there temporarily. If you go Thursday night from 5 to 8 and have proof you're an Illinois resident you get in free! My favorite sections are impressionism and American art before 1950.
