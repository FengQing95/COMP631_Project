Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't usually like deep dish pizza but I guess I just hadn't had a good one until trying Lou Malnati's! We ordered the Malnati Classic and the Lou and both were SO GOOD!! The Lou is vegetarian, and the mix of flavors was amazing!! Seriously, the garlic, cheese, fresh tomatoes, pizza sauce, basil...all of it just melts together into one perfect slice of heavenly, cheesy, goodness. We came here twice in one weekend, that is how good it was! And the crust to topping ratio is perfect, the butter crust is crispy and not too thick. The center is perfectly cooked and the pizza toppings stay on the pizza...they dont fall off in a gooey mess. It really is the perfect slice of deep dish pizza!
