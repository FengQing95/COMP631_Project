Smoque BBQ////Smoque fixes that by doing it right!  Long/slow smoking of the meat infuses wonderful taste, plus a nice spice rub and all I need is a little of their homemade sauce to finish what is by far the best BBQ I've had in the city.  I seriously burp smokey goodness for a couple hours after pigging out here!  And I end up with extra/unused sauce!?!
