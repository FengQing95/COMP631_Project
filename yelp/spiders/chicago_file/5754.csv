The Purple Pig////The multitude of pork products we ordered was the crispy pig ear salad, pork liver pate, pork tongue, pork sausage orecchiette, milk braised pork Â shoulder. These weren't the only dishes we ordered, which also included the bone barrow, whipped feta, and three desserts. All the savory dishes were excellent I had no real complaints of them as I feel they were executed well and had a multitude of textures and seasonings that felt great on the palette.
