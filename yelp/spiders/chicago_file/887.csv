Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Love this place, not the wait though. Waited a good hour and a half on a Saturday morning, but I guess that it's expected. Had their wildberry pancakes which were AMAZING and also their chorizo skillet which was a bit on the oily side, but it was so tasteful. Amazing service. You must try it out if you're visiting Chicago!
