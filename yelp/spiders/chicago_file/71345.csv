Little Goat Diner////It's always a treat to eat in Chicago and Little Goat did not disappoint. I found the atmosphere pleasantly casual, much like the food. Good selection of beers, and the fried stuff really hit the mark for me. I tried the veggie burger, which was one of the best I've ever had, albeit a bit messy. The fries were decent, but a bit thin for my taste. I like them slightly thicker, but to each his own.
