Little Goat Diner////In a word "flavor" describes the food here. Been a fan of SI for years and have met her several times in the early days at Girl and the Goat. Her food is bursting with flavor and this is a must try for breakfast or lunch when in the west loop. When ordering trust your gut and go for something different and surprise yourself! Â Servers are also super helpful and always ready to make suggestions. Enjoy!
