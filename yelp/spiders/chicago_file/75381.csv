Little Goat Diner////The club was a club, not sure why our friend ordered it, nothing special there.  The smoked fries are good but again 6 bucks for a bowl of fries with no house sauces or aiolis which is pretty pathetic.  I don't think fries at Pommes Frites in NYC were this expensive and they had a myriad of inventive sauces.
