Smoque BBQ////I've been here a few times and have never been disappointed. I am a huge fan of their brisket. Don't leave without trying the cobbler. Normally, I am not fond of coleslaw, but theirs has changed my opinion with it's balance of crispness, light dressing and tanginess. The portions are perfect enough to leave full, but not having to take anything home.
