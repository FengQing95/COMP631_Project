Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////      Being a big eater I don't do Tapas much as I usually need to order about 10 to get full (which can be quite costly).  They had a decent selection of Tapas; my personal favorites were the Crab & Shrimp Dip & the Chicken Empanada.  The dishes were decent, but judging by the crowd you would think these were the best Tapas on earth.
