Little Goat Diner////50 mins later, I got a text saying our table was ready. We went in and were to be seated at a communal diner style table. Since we were visiting our niece and wanted a real table for some conversation, we declined that seating. The hostess graciously put us back on the list and said we should not have gone on the "any available seating" list. You can sit at a table, outside table, a diner counter or the diner tables. Now we know. We went back outside for 15 minutes and the hostess came out to find us.
