Art Institute of Chicago////From what I hear, as far as domestic/U.S. museums go, the Art Institute of Chicago has an impressively comprehensive collection of art spanning centuries and genres; classic, gothic, impressionist, modern, etc etc. Â To finally be exposed to some of the renowned works of art that are on display here, I'm in awe!
