Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went to Ba-Ba-Reeba only once, and I can't wait to go back again. Their sangria is SO GOOD, and their tapas even better. It's a great setting to go with a group of 5 or more, wouldn't recommend it for tables of 2. I had bacon wrapped dates, goat cheese dip, squid, calamari, among others, and I don't have a complaint. Our server was super friendly and helpful with recommendations -- and my water was never empty. I remember the restaurant being a little loud, but that was just because it was so busy.
