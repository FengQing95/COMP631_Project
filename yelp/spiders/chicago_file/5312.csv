The Purple Pig////The Purple Pig was our first lunch spot in Chicago; we were visiting from LA. We didn't have a reservation, but stopped by during lunchtime on July 4th. Surprisingly, we only had to wait 20-25 minutes for a table. I was definitely excited for this restaurant after reading so many great reviews on Yelp. However, both my partner and I didn't really enjoyed our meal.
