Smoque BBQ////I always drive past this place and see a huge line out the door. So I decided to try this place out being that i love bbq ribs. I ordered ribs and was not impressed. The ribs were very dry and didnt have much flavor to them. There was no room to sit and enjoy your meal. Glad this place is out of my bucket list.
