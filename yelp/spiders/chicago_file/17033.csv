Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This pizza may have been different, but it was still awesome.  I ordered a large with pepperoni.  This pizza was loaded with sauce and cheese.  The cheese was absolutely delicious, while the sauce was very fresh and had great flavor, despite what others on yelp think.  The buttered crust had a good flavor and texture.
