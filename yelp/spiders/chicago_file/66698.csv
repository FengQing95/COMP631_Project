Little Goat Diner////First time here with a couple cousins and what can I say. It all started when I walked in the host was very kind sat us down our waiter was awesome described the menus for us and answered all our questions. The all American burger was awesome. Macho nachos were awesome good appetizer. Also the lamb ribs were delicious with the touch of strawberries. Definitely would come back soon
