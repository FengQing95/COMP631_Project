Little Goat Diner////I get that the french toast is a favorite and everyone loves a diner, but a lot of it seemed over the top. They did have some simpler options for breakfast diners that might not want a fancy dish, things such as bagels and fruit cups. The entrees were great and a huge portion, but really no side was considerable or pushed by the wait staff. I like variety in my meal, so this wasn't something I was all that excited about. The food seemed very well prepared, but not something you would take home to reheat, if you know what I mean.
