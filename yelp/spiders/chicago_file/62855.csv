Smoque BBQ////I came here with my husband and parents, so I got to sample a LOT more of their other food.  The St. Louis ribs were just okay (again, a little dry), but I'm not a rib person.  Okay, stop cursing me out, I don't like ribs.  Anyway, I also tried the Texas sausage.  I didn't know what to expect, but it had a nice snap and wasn't too spicy.
