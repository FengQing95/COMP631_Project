Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Loved our dinner at Bavettes last weekend!  It was like stepping back into the mad men era!  We sat at the bar when we waited for our table and had a drink.  When we were seated we started with the goat cheese appetizer which was very good, then we spilt the wedge sad which is huge and definitely big enough to share before your meal.  We were stuffed at this point and split the bone in filet which was cooked perfectly.  The steak was good, but I have had better.  Next time I will try something else.  The ambience was awesome and we will definitely be back!
