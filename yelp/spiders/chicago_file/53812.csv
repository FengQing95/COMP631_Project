Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The deviled eggs and bacon wrapped dates were amazing! I also enjoyed the spicy potatoes and melted goat cheese in tomato sauce. The meatballs were okay but I didn't like the beef empanada. We all enjoyed the sangria. Just a heads up-we had three dishes brought to our table that we didn't order. They took them off the bill in the end.
