Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Food wise, I love the seared scallops. Cooked to perfection! The date wrapped with bacon tapas was excellent too. I initially didn't think I'll like it because I don't really eat dates, but it was a good combination - bacon and dates. I love the mango sangria they had as a special last night.
