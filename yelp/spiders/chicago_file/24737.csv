Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We decided to try this pizza joint because they offered gluten free.  Reviews sounded fairly stellar so we took a gamble.  How disappointing!  After a 1 hour wait, we were finally shown to a table.  With pizza preordered we figured it would arrive promptly.  Nope.  Server came to take any additions to our order so we opted for a spinach salad.  It arrived AFTER the pizza.  My gluten free pizza was lukewarm to even cool and very dry.  Come on!!!! Many pizza places out there.  No.way should this be top 5 for gluten free!
