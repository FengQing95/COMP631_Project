Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's was good but the service lacked a little. The proportions need to be accurately depicted by the wait staff. Also, the pizza was good but slightly overrated. Left feeling unfulfilled. However, I am aware that other locations could have been a more fulfilling experience.
