Art Institute of Chicago////I can't even begin to tell you the types of work collected inside but I will tell you that you will not walk away without some sort of appreciation and awe factor from some of the art. Â While I'm no art major, I can appreciate a Dali, PIcasso, etc just like the next person and this place has that and so much more.
