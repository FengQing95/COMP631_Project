Smoque BBQ////Service...they know how to run a place. This place rests on its food and not its ambiance, it is simply a store front operation with a bunch of wooden tables and chairs...the walls are painted and there aren't any drapes or mood lighting (just good BBQ). Get in line when you arrive and work your way up to the counter (no taking a seat until you have some food). The check in check out is easy. Pay for your order at the cashier (the kitchen streams off behind her) and one of the staff directs you to a seat...this way people not eating don't hog the seats to early...this is well thought out. Service was always in the background...they don't hurry you at all, but when your done the table is cleaned in a second. They have enough staff to take care of the room size...probably more staff than they need. Friendly and efficient. They also have a big carryout clientele...you have a stream of people just picking up...so don't be afraid of the line...it is worth it also.
