Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////After two pitchers of sangria, 11 small plates and small paella were all very full.  Surprisingly the bill did not turn out to be as expensive as I expected for all of the food that we had. We paid about $30/per person.  Overall it was a much better experience than I expected service was great and fast and the food, although kind of greasy, was tasty and good. I do not know if I will go back but it not for bad food or bad service  , because I would rather explore other Chicago tapas restaurants.
