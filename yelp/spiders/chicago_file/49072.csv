Smoque BBQ////I'm not a big BBQ eater but after trying Smoque I'm going to try as many BBQ restaurants in the city that I can.  I got the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich plate which consisted of a pulled pork  and a brisket sandwich.  Both were phenomenal.  The meat was melt in your mouth goodness.  The cornbread was fantastic as well as the baked beans.
