The Purple Pig////Came here for dinner at our bachelorette party outing. I wish my group did not attend Ribfest the day before as we were still stuffed from that event. The food is very nicely presented and my favorite dish for the whole evening was the pig ears. I am used to the Chinese style braised pig ears and having it shredded and fried left quite the impression.
