Art Institute of Chicago////My quarrel now is with the services there. I can't bring food in? Do I want a $6 personal pizza that looks like bread and tomato sauce? Not really, I prefer the sandwiches and or the raw nature of my own creations. I'm not asking to bring a cooler full of stuff in, but I would like to sit in their beautiful and sun filled patio to enjoy my lunch.
