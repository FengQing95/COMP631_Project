Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were soooo excited to eat here based on other reviews, but we were disappointed.  The pizza was decent, but we probably wouldn't come back.  The wait was too long, and the pizza was not as good as Giordano's. We also ordered calimari, which was just ok. The tiramisu was decent, but we've had better.
