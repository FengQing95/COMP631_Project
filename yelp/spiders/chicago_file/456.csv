Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This place is soooo good!!!!!! I went for breakfast here with my boyfriend, and we both loved it.  It was really busy but there are a lot of tables so it didn't take long to get seated.  The omelets were huge and so delicious!  I also had a caramel latte and it was probably the best latte I have ever had.  The fresh OJ was amazing too.  Can 't say enough good things about this place!! I will definitely go back the next time in in Chicago.
