Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Moving on to the entree, supposedly the highlight of the night, but my most disappointed part as well. I order petite fillet mignon, cooked to be medium rare. And my boyfriend asks for ribeye cooked to be medium well. The first thing I notice is that the plate is NOT HOT... at most Luke-warm, which is defiant something I expect to see at a restaurant of this price range. And then the steak... I don't even know where to begin. Even under the dim light, I can tell that my steak is over-cooked, resulting in a nearly rubbery taste. And the steak is really blaaaaaaaaaaand. Yes, they do offer steak seasoning, but I thought they would add salt when cooking the steak.
