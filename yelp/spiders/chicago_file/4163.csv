The Purple Pig////The calamari wasn't as my friends expected (fried calamari). Instead, the calamari was more like a cold pasta dish with lots of fregola (small pasta balls, similar to couscous) and thin, tart, vinegary radish and cucumber slices. Out of the dishes we ordered, we left the most of this one behind.
