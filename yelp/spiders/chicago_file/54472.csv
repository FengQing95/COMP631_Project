Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Seriously one of my very favorite fun dinner/happy hour/brunch/any meal spots in the city.  I was first introduced to Cafe Babs by a friend about 4 years ago and have been back many many times.  It's a great place for groups, out of town guests, special occasions, or just a fun meal.
