Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place was recommended to me from someone who grew up in Chicago.  He nailed it, this pizza is unbelievable delicious.  I have celiac and was not sure, but the gluten free, thin crust pizza was amazing and I had no side effects.  The wait was ridiculous long-but worth, check in, provide your cell number and preorder your pizza.  Don't forget to check out the Malnati's salad- delicious!  None of the desserts are gluten free, but you won't have room for it anyways.
