Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Classic and Lou's pizza was very good but filling.  Most of us thought we could eat 2 pieces and could only eat 1.  Service was slow but to be fair they were short staffed.  The waiters were good for as many people they were waiting on.  The Caesar salad was fresh and tasty.  Overall, I would recommend for a good Chicago style pizza!!!
