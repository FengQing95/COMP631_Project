Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is definitely a fork and knife kind of pizza. My husband really enjoyed the pizza (he is a total pizza fan) but I, on the other hand didn't really like it too much. The cheese, once 10 minutes or so passed, had a super rubbery texture and it was hard to chew. The crust/dough was also not good at all! Way too hard and flavorless. The pizza is also VERY filling since it's so thick. The small is definitely more than enough for 2 people to share. Overall, this pizza was just A-OK in my opinion. Not something I would crave or want again, but you have to try it at least once if you're in Chicago!
