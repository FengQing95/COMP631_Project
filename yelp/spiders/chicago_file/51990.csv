Smoque BBQ////Stopped by on a Saturday night after scouting my new 'hood.  First impression is this is an slightly upscale adaptation of a neighborhood BBQ joint.  Parking is tight, and since I wasn't really planning on stopping in I wasn't prepared with my BYOB.  Also, the fact that it was 7:30 on a Saturday didn't help, but they were out of pretty much everything but ribs.  I had the St. Louis style, which were meaty, smoky, moist, and had a nice coating of charred rub which added a lot of flavor.  Sauce came on the side, a sure sign of a joint confident in their 'que, and had a nice spicy kick that accented the smoky meat nicely.  Not the best BBQ I've ever had, but definitely in my top 10, and I'm moving down the street so I'm sure I'll be back.
