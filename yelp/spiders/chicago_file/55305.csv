Smoque BBQ////I'm not sure what all the hype is about.  Actually I do, Midwesterners don't know shiieettt about quality BBQ.  Smoque has good BBQ for Chicago, but compared to good BBQ in the South, it's not up to par.  The sides are small, and the menu is over priced.  My friend and I ordered a full rack of ribs and a side order of brisket.  The baby back ribs were relatively dry and while the brisket was pretty good, you barely get any.  $6 for 4 slices.  The ribs and brisket came out to over $30 dollars, not terrible but left hungry.  Expect to spend $20 to get a full belly.
