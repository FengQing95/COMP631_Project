Little Goat Diner////1600+ Reviews - 4 stars? I don't think I've ever been more disappointed. Just spent way too much money on bad food. Waited over an hour for the worst meal we've had on our vacation so far. Tonkatsu was super dry and tasteless. Slaw on the sandwich was so vinegary it was all I could taste. Bread was soggy from the sauce. Braised beef sandwich husband had was also dry and tasteless. Both our daughters ordered patty melts. Mediocre at best but mediocre was better than our meals so we ended up sharing theirs instead of eating ours. $5 side of broccoli was super small and honestly tasted like blanched florets (maybe a scant 1 cup?) tossed in rice vinegar and soy sauce with sesame seeds. Do overs??? :(
