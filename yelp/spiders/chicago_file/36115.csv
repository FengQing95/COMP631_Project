Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////the ambience of this place was amazing.  it's a beautiful space upstairs with a lot of chandeliers.  we sat downstairs, which was like a speakeasy w/ plush red seats.  we stayed for some drinks after dinner and closed the place down at 1:30.  why can't any place in SF open this late?
