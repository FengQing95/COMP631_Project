Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came to the restaurant right when it opened on a Saturday for lunch and there was a line out the door. This was our first time visiting Chicago, and we wanted to try Chicago deep dish pizza. We shared a small order of "the lou". It took 45 minutes which the waitress warned us about. The pizza was really good. good service, good atmosphere. Would recommend.
