Smoque BBQ////Once we got inside we cracked a beer and anxiously debated what to order when we got up front. Half slab of baby back ribs, Texas sausage, and the brisket with corn bread, mac n' cheese, and baked beans. About 10 minutes after we put our order in it was time. Hot damn everything was good but the brisket was great and is worth the drive back. I enjoyed the beans best of the sides. Around 30 bucks for two to eat and it was a perfect helping.
