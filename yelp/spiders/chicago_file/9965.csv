Art Institute of Chicago////Incredible museum. So much beautiful artwork and so well spread out and organized. We could have spent a whole 8 hours in here if we had the time to. Museum staff was decently friendly, but do not go anywhere near the paintings, lean against ANY wall (even a plain white one without a single piece of artwork on it) or sit on anything that is not explicitly designated for seating or staff will scold you.
