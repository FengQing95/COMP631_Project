Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The steak to get here is the crown jewel- 24 ounce bone-in prime dry aged ribeye. Every steak lover knows that bone-in is the best. Ribeye is the most marbleized and therefore the fattiest and tastiest cut of beef. So what set this one so high? For one, it is just simply season with high quality salt and pepper and definitely basted in copious amounts of butter. All means for success. Secondly, they know how to cook a bloody rare steak and still get a nice crust on the outside. Something even the best steakhouses cannot achieve. Third, comes the accoutrements that just add to the gluttony and pleasure of eating such an incredible buttery, bloody, funky bone-in ribeye. You have your choice for a few additions- but do yourself a favor and get these two: herb maitre'd butter and bone marrow. Yes, both on top of your already wonderful butter basted ribeye. Butter and steak are natural companions. Taking a page out of Minetta Tavern's book, the bone marrow was a great addition. When you combined everything on one forkful, it was like dynamite exploding in the mouth! It was heaven in a word.
