Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Overall: It was pretty much a solid dinner. It was on the pricier side, but you sort of expect that from a steakhouse. Being a fan of both Au Cheval and Sodikoff's other places, I knew I'd love the food. Just some real flavorful, rich, meat and potatoes style cuisine. None of the dishes were super unique or something I haven't tried before, but I can't deny that everything was damn tasty.
