Little Goat Diner////We each decided to try a lunch menu item and then split them - to make sure we tried as much as we could. My mom and I are huge Top Chef fans and were more than ecstatic to try some of Stephanie's foods. I ordered the Asian slaw, scallion pancake and pork belly. This was the lightest out of the three we ordered and was probably my favorite although it was really difficult to decide. The portions of everything that we ordered were huge! We had leftovers even after splitting everything. My friend ordered the Avocado BLT which was very good. My mom had the Lo's Drowned with braised beef, avocado, spicy mayo, and au jus sauce - which was basically an amazing version of a French Dip. This dish was so heavy and would have been my absolute favorite if it weren't for that reason. Â Overall the food was amazing - particularly for a diner setup but I left stuffed and in need on a nap. This only encourages me to want to try Girl and The Goat.
