Little Goat Diner////I had the razzle chai latte which was beautifully spicy and large and this little piggy went to china. The dish was awesome. The combo of strawberries and chili blended together surprisingly well and I would definitely order it again. My vegetarian boyfriend had the veggie patty melt and fries and was very satisfied. It's great to finally find a brunch place that has a couple different options for eggless vegetarians. Can't wait to go back!
