Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////seafood paella with squid and squid ink-Our entire party's favorite dish, this is a special that should be made into a regular offering. Instead of rice, this dish contained vermicelli noodles, with a generous seafood portion. Highly recommend ordering this before its no longer offered!
