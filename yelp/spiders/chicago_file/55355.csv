Smoque BBQ////I had a pulled-pork sandwich and it was DELICIOUS, so tender and succulent.  Wish I'd ordered the half portion though, because they give you a stupid amount of food.  Seriously, I've been known to put away my share of BBQ, but those portions are ridiculously huge.  Their sauce is sweet but very good.
