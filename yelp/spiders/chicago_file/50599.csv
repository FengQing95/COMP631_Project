Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I live in the neighborhood and there are so many good restaurants but this one may be my favorite. There are probably 30 items on the menu and I've had probably 20 of them. Every single item is so good! You can't go wrong! The classic red sangria is a must. Always the Brussel salad- other favorites are the meatballs, the steak with blue cheese, the spicy potatoes, and well everything. Love the Carmel and the Banana desserts a lot too. The service is also great. They once gave us a free dessert platter with every dessert on the menu only because we had to wait longer than they told us initially. Love this place!
