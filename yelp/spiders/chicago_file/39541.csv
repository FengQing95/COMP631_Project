Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I got the petit filet, he got the traditional filet and we shared the truffle mac and the broccoli. Our server was good at explaining the menu as it was our first time here and she regularly stopped by. However, when my boo ordered a beer to have it come out with the steaks, she brought it out about 15-20 minutes earlier. Granted she did not anticipate the food taking longer than expected and apologized, but she could have definitely checked with the kitchen and figured that out better? For this type of lauded establishment, I will nitpick, so my only other gripe is with the broccoli. While perfectly cooked as it was tender but not so much so, a part of the stem was not trimmed properly, so there was that 'strawy-ness.'
