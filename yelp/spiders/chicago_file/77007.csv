Little Goat Diner////I liked it, I didn't love it. We waited over an hour for a table after being told the wait was 30-40 minutes. No big deal - it was the weekend brunch rush so a wait was to be expected. My party of 2 was seated at the end of the counter and we waited a bit to put in our drink order - a chai latte and Arnold Palmer, no booze on this trip.
