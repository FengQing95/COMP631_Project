Little Goat Diner////We arrived and they have a neat system where they text your cell phone when your table is ready.  The service was slow, but I would expect it to be slow when there is a wait and every table is taken.  I did notice that they had a busboy refilling the water glasses, but only the waitress refilled the coffee.  The waitresses, though among the nicest you will ever meet, are also among the most busy you will ever know.  But they did well by us.  Every request I made was satisfied to perfection.
