Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As for the food- WOW. We routinely share when we eat so, as it was his birthday, I let the boy take the lead on the ordering. Not everything was what I would have ordered but I was still very impressed. The shrimp de jonghe is not to be missed. I was loving the bread and butter service but when that garlicky shrimp showed up, all bets were off. We also had the smoked salmon Caesar (fine but we agreed it was the weakest thing we ordered), pommes frites, roasted Brussels sprouts, elote corn and the 22 oz ribeye with bone marrow accompaniment. We made a dent in everything but left with a bag of leftovers including half a steak. The bernaise sauce and steak salt served alongside the ribeye really elevated it to the next level.
