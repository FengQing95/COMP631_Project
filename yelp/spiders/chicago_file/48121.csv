Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great date or large group spot too! My girlfriend and I are vegetarian and we can always try something new and come up with a new combination of small plates. If you leave without drinking one of the sangria or eating the patatas bravas, you're doing it wrong. The paella is delicious too, but there's lots of it so if you go that route don't fill up on tapas! I'm already looking forward to my next visit. Don't miss it.
