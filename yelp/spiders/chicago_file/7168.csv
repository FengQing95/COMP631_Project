Art Institute of Chicago////Maybe it was the weather as it was a wintry, windy day and I just wanted to "get lost" for a couple hours in the big city. I chose to go stare at my favorite Monet. I think of those little dots and brush strokes, and I find it meditating. Makes all the little things in life kind of meld away. If that makes any sense at all. Â Best $12 I spent all weekend for admission in to have a little therapy and Lisa Time.
