Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Absolutely stunning dining floor with that 1920s French parlor vibe. Our server was friendly, engaging and overall Â a great sport. We really enjoyed their bread service, spicy chicken, burger, aged bone in steak, crab cakes, and chocolate cake! Definitely one of the most solid restaurant in River North! Can't wait to come back for more.
