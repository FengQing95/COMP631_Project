Smoque BBQ////You have to try it......We went for the first time on March 8th. 2012 and it was a possitive experience.... First of all the staff is Very polite and helpful. Place is clean. A little small but the food makes up for that. Mac and cheese, beans , cornbread are to die for.... Best brisket .....Ribs too.... Must try you will agree....
