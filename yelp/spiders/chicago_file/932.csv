Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////{Espanola omelette} - was so excited about this. Every ingredient sounded so good. I mean seriously - Chorizo, Jalape√±o Peppers, Avocado, Onions, Cilantro, Mushrooms & Chihuahua Cheese, plus tortilla - how can that not be good?! For some reason, it was just what the combination of those ingredients would taste like, but not more. The salsa was not my favorite.
