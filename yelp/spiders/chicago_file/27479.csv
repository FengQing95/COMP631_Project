Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////WAIT: I called around 6:30 pm and asked how long the wait was for 7 people and they said 30 minutes.  We come back around 8:00 pm and find that the wait has tripled to being 1 hour and 45 minutes! You give them your phone number and they add you to an app that tells you what your number is in line.  Since the wait was too long we decided to get the pizza to go and eat at our hotel.
