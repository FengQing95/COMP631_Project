Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Who has the best Chicago deep dish pizza?  It's like asking if you prefer Aruba or Martinique.  It's a fierce battle for the right to say "We are the best."  After trying many other locations over the years, it was my first time to Lou Malnati's.  There is a first for everything and a simple joy of being 43 years old is that there are not a lot of "first's" left to experience in life so I was particularly looking forward to experiencing my first Lou Malnati's pizza.  And for the kids, their first Chicago deep dish ever.  I think the words out of our 9 year olds mouth sum it up: "Yum and a Yum, and a YUM!"
