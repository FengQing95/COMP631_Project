The Purple Pig////We ordered the Crispy Pig's Ears, Grilled Broccoli with Anchovy Vinaigrette, Pork Belly, Octopus a la Plancha, and Sicilian Iris. We LOVED the broccoli and octopus the most. It's a perfect balance of flavors: salty, tangy, full of umami. We really want to know how to make those broccoli ;) The Pig's ears dish was admittedly a bit underwhelming because it was the most hyped dish based on other reviews. It was still unique nevertheless and I would highly recommend trying it anyways. The pork belly was melt in your mouth good. Finally, the desert (Sicilian iris) was really unique and rich. Overall, very satisfied with the food we got.
