Little Goat Diner////The first time I went to Little Goat I ordered the "breakfast burrito" BIG mistake!  It is definitely nothing like a breakfast burrito.  It probably took me about 2 months before giving it another shot.  But man... I am sure glad I did.  The French Toast is out of this world.  Patty Melt is now a go-to of mine.  Nachos...... Their Macho Nachos are some of the best nachos I have ever had.  Oh yeah and their coffee is great as well (better then Starbucks).
