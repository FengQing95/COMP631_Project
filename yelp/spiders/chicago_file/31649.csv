Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a medium Classic and a medium Lou's. Firstly, too much food (never thought I would say that) for 4 people even though we were all pretty hungry. The taste of the pizza was good, but not great. I felt like both lacked flavor and (don't reprimand me!) had way too much cheese. At one point, my crust was about an inch thick and sauce was only about 1/8". That just didn't sit right with me.
