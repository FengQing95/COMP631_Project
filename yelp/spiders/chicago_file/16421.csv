Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I eat at Lou's only if I'm in the mood for the deep dish chocolate chip cookie dessert. The pizza just lacks the sauce and taste of the other two places (Gino's and Uno's). Did you know Lou was a cook for Uno's who stole, I mean borrowed the recipe with a few alterations and opened up his own place?
