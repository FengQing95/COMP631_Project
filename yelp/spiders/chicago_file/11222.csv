Art Institute of Chicago////One of the best art museum in the US...maybe the world. Many great masters are displayed here! I come back every time I visit Chicago. Prices are reasonable,and staff helpful...especially when you get lost in a huge place like this! The time I went wasn't too crowded but plan ahead if it's around the holidays or special events. I got here when they opened and spent practically the whole day here.
