Little Goat Diner////I've been here twice so far. The first time was to simply pick up pastries from the Bakery.  The sour dough bread, scones and muffins were to die for! Talk about a savory breakfast packed into a pastry, you can taste each ingredient in the scone and it was baked to scone perfection!  The sour dough bread was crunchy on the outside and so moist on the inside, as a great sour dough should be!
