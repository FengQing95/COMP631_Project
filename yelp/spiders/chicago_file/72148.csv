Little Goat Diner////Came to Little Goat with a coworker for lunch. I wasn't sure how packed it'd be, but glad we made reservations because it was a full house that day. I ordered off of the secret vegan menu and got vegetable tostadas and a side of mac and cheese. The food came out fast and the portions were huge. I fell in love with the mac and cheese! So creamy and delicious. The perfect pairing for the crummy weather we were having outside. The tostadas were good, but a little hard to eat and the shells were pretty oily, but the vegetable mix and seasoning was on point and I packed up my leftovers to eat later. Love the variety in their menu and will definitely be coming back.
