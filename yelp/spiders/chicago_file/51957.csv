Smoque BBQ////This is the best bbq in the city hands down. The brisket is fall apart tender. Coleslaw is light in a mustard seed vinaigrette. Mac and cheese baked individually in their own ramekins. Call ahead for pick up and skip the line of squares dining in. On a operational note, they offer exceptional customer service, I feel that they genuinely appreciate my business, make sure I have the correct order and that I'm taken care of in expedient manner (which is great because I'm normally parked illegally).
