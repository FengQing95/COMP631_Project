Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The restaurant did comp the GF pizza (right thing to do) and offered a free dessert for the table (which I unfortunately could not enjoy due to ingredients).  I could most likely just chalk this up and not mention it, other than the fact that the server says 'this happens all the time with the GF pizza."  Sounds like an operational opportunity for Lou's! and word to the wise for other GF pizza fans.
