Smoque BBQ////Actually managed to park in their lot (watch the posted hours, though).  Ten-minute line (inside, not out the door, likely due to the downpour).  Lots of happy diners.  Efficient and refreshingly friendly staff.  I liked watching the kitchen tackle all the dine-in, take-out, and call-ahead orders, both from my spot in line and while chowing down.  Makes me feel like they've got nothing to hide.
