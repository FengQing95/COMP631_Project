Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////By the time you sit down your food arrives in almost no time. We came from California so naturally we ordered way too much food. We got the brushetta (would not recommend) the variety of chips and dips (was a fun one for the group) and then one large pizza with multiple toppings. The pizza was freaking delicious but be prepared to eat with a fork and knife!
