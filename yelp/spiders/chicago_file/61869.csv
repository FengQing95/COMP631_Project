Smoque BBQ////There is totally a reason that this place has almost 2,500 reviews and manages 4.5 stars!! I can't think of another restaurant I've *ever* seen on Yelp that has that many reviews at that high a star ranking. The food is incredible. Arguably the best BBQ in the city, rivaling true Southern barbecue. The only thing I'd warn about is the limited seating and the lines--this is a better place to get weekday meals and take them home. That said, they usually still manage to move the line along pretty quickly.
