Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Somewhere between perfect and heavenly!  Rice based GF pancakes were fluffy with light crumb, not gummy/stretchy like they are frequently served elsewhere.  Plentiful fresh fruit garnish.  Fig and brie omelette was a wonderful experience!  Accepts reservations via Yelp! App; otherwise expect 2+ hour wait time Sundays.
