Little Goat Diner////We sat and sat and sat, maybe 10 minutes went by, then I asked the bus boy to let someone know we are here and haven't been greeted. He finished cleaning his table, the told someone. The waiter was scatterbrained, didn't mention the specials until we asked about them, there was no soup because "the chefs didn't like the way it turned out".
