Smoque BBQ////Came here on a Friday night and thankfully we beat the dinner time rush.  Line was fast and efficient. This is definitely a take out joint and not a place to enjoy a nice dinner, but if you must dine in, you will find a decent place to sit and the bus boys are friendly and attentive.  Now on to the food..The star of the show was definitely the brisket, it had to be the best I've ever tasted. The cole slaw was great and I usually do not care for cole slaw, they make it with vinegar and no mayo which is a plus  I was not crazy about the St Louis ribs and the baby backs were slightly better as the meat was too tough for me.  The mac and cheese was okay and the baked beans were too runny, but they did pack a good flavor.
