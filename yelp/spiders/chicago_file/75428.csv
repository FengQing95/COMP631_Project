Little Goat Diner////I've been here twice -- once for brunch, which was amaaazing, and again for dinner...which left something to be desired. Between my friends and I, we've ordered the Little Piggy Went To China, the Kimchi-Stir-Fry-Pancake-Thing, the Pork Belly Okonomiyaki, the Tempura Mashed Potatoes, and the hash browns.
