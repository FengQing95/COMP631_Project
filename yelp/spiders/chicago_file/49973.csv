Smoque BBQ////Saying that you don't like Smoque is like saying that you don't like Radiohead or The Beatles. It's just lame. These dudes are BBQ scientists, and they've uncovered the secrets of perfect BBQ, and they make it the same way, every time. Good gracious, I recommend going with a group of four and splitting 4 different entrees so that you can sample all of the meats. And listen to Paranoid Android on the way there.
