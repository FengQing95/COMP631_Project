Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Had the Malnati Classic and a beer. Solid deep dish. To confess I am not a huge fan of the deep dish style because I find it more bland than a thinner crust pizza. I would have preferred more seasoning in the sausage and in the sauce to offset the plainness of the butter crust. But as deep dish go a solid pie.
