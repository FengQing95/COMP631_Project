Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Brandon has done it again.  I went to Bavette's both nights this weekend.  Friday night just for drinks and loved the space so much we came back on Saturday for dinner.  The chandeliers, dark word and lighting, and leather banquettes made me feel like I was in a different era and was perfect for a chilly fall night.  We tried a number of he specialty cocktails which were delicious.
