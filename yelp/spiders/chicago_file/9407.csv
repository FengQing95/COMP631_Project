Art Institute of Chicago////If you live in Chicago, I'm jealous because I would get a membership and regularly check out the art at my leisure. For visitors like me, give yourself plenty of time to view the art. I would say at least 4 hours. You can even eat on-site at one of the dining options they have. The $1 bag check was also a big help to me.
