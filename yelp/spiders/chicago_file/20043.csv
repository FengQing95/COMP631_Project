Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////But before we get to the pizza, which is making me drool just thinking about, we also ordered 2 orders of mozzarella sticks and a large Malnati salad to munch on while waiting for the pizzas. The mozzarella sticks were just normal apps that you can get anywhere, nothing special, but someone at the table really wanted them. But the salad ... oh the salad. It was delicious! Normally I don't like sweet Italian dressings, but it balances out the saltiness of the salami, olives, and cheese very well. I had to stop eating the salad knowing the pizza was coming.
