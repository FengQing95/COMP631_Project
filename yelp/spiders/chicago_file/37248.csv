Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place is fine but isn't worth it given superior, comparably priced alternatives in Chicago. I was at a table of 3. We split a bottle of pinot noir, the salmon tartare, sides of mac & cheese and elote-style corn and a piece of chocolate cream pie. I had the bone-in ribeye. Total for my share with tax and tip was $175. The highlights of the meal were the mac & cheese and the pie, with the pie probably being the single best thing I had. The steak was fine but forgettable. Also, I had to send it back because it was overcooked. In fairness, they fired a new one right away, but it still sucks because you're sitting there waiting while everyone else has their full meal.
