Little Goat Diner////From what the waitress was describing things, this place is "Girl and the Goat" for poor people. Aint no shame in my game, call me po'! The place was pretty busy as expected so we sat at the "communal table". This was the table that the hostess offered to us after we sulked our faces when informed that the waiting time was 45-minutes. There were several people already on the table, but there were seats at the end of it, which we parked our behinds in. The ambience and energy of the place was awesome and I was super-excited to try out the place for the first time.
