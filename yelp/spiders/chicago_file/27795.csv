Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You have to kind of keep in mind that some of these places can get pretty busy with lines and when you do get seated you have to be prepared for a wait depending on the type of pizza you order.  Some of the larger pies can take upwards of 45 minutes to prepare before they are brought over to your table.  In fact, your server will probably warn you so you are aware that preparing made to order pies take a while.
