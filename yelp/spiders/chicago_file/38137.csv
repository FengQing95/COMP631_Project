Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Outstanding all around! Read positive reviews on Yelp and its on the Eater 38 list so I made reservation during a recent trip to Chicago. We went at 10pm on a Friday, the place was packed but we were seated right away. We had a big booth for the 2 of us across from the bar. The place was gorgeous, dimly lit, perfect for a date.
