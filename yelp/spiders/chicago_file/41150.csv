Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is by far the best tapas place in the city.  I love the food and their variety of Sangria.  It is definitely worth the wait, otherwise I would consider making a reservation because it is very popular and busy quite often.  I have been here for numerous birthday occasions, and every time the service is great, and I have a great time.
