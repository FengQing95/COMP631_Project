Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My tastebuds are overwhelmed with joy. There are not enough stars to insert on this review. Food was off the chart, and service was superb! My family and I shared a 16 ounce ribeye, a bone in New York, truffle Mac and cheese, button mushrooms, and silky potatoes. Drinkwise, littlel ros√© martini, the French 75 were both incredible drinks that I HIGHLY recommend. We did not order any dessert because we were stuffed with all of the delicious food we eat, but I am sure that it would be as amazing as the rest of the food. I cannot wait to visit Bavette's restaurant again.
