Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We sat at the bar and were warmly greeted by Nathan, bartender extraordinaire, who wowed us with his martini making expertise and who instantly set out to make our evening just that much more delightful!  He was quick not only with the drink- but with commentary to answer all the many questions that I usually have when I enter a new establishment.  He was so delightful that we almost gave up our reservation to eat at his lovely bar (lead topped with cushy stools) but we wanted the full experience so off we went to our booth.
