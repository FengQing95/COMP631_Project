The Purple Pig////I ordered takeout through the Tock app and it's one of the best deals I've ever taken advantage of in Chicago. The order came with a salad (greens, beets, and asparagus), pasta with meat gravy, and chicken cacciatore. The flavors were all good but the real shocking part was just how much food we got for $20. It was literally enough for 6 comfortable meals (the two of us ate 3 separate times). It was a great opportunity to try Purple Pig food at very reasonable prices. I would definitely suggest you check out some of their to-go options if you get a chance!
