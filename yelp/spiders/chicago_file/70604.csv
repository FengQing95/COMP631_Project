Little Goat Diner////Little Goat Diner is the ultimate comfort food spot. In the heart of the West Loop, Little Goat Diner is a change of pace from the other restaurants nearby. I got the Fat Club "sammich", as they would put it, and it was great. Bring your appetite because there "sammiches" are triple layered and fulfilling.
