Art Institute of Chicago////Give yourself at least 5 hours here - if they have a 2 day pass I would go with this. Staff is friendly and the collection is AMAZING! I have never felt so happy to take a selfie than with some of these works! Talk about role model, after enjoying these paintings (Degas, Van Gogh, Okeefe, Cassat, Renoir, etc) I felt more than emotional. They had everything - impressionist and crazy old religious stuff to Native American, Muslim and Modern. Impressive and quirky miniature and paperweight collection. Do your research and come prepared. The cafes inside are expensive so bring a snack or grab a Chicago dog from the stand outside. And don't forget the outdoor gardens as well!!
