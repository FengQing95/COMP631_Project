Smoque BBQ////Meat lovers unite! The brisket is so tender and juicy, it will not disappoint. You can get a smaller portion of brisket on a roll (which is super soft by the way), or you have can a bigger portion without the bread on a platter. So what did I get? The platter, of course! Then you can eat it with mac and cheese, coleslaw, cornbread, and candied jalape√±os - and the meal is instantly off the chain. They give you different sauces, like Memphis style or Carolina style, but it doesn't really need it.
