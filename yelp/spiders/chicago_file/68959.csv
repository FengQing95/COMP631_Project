Little Goat Diner////Our coffee was piping hot, and our water ice cold. My boyfriend and I were so excited upon gazing at the menu we could hardly keep the smiles off of our faces. We wanted to try everything, but in the end he ordered the "Brandade & Belly Benedict" and I had the infamous "Bulls Eye French Toast." (Side note: We're total nerds and take pictures of our food. It's was sooo photo worthy. . )
