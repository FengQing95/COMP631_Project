Smoque BBQ////This place will probably always have a line.  I'm not sure where else you can get this Texas style bbq in the city.  We ordered the 1/2 baby back ribs and 1/2 St. Louis ribs with the cole slaw and 2 sides in which we chose the baked beans and the mac and cheese.  We also ordered a snack size of the chopped pork.  The meat is tender, but it didn't fall off the bone.  There are 2 sauce options one that is vinegar based and one that is ketchup based.  Both had a good tang, but disappointingly no spicy!  I love how the baked beans had some chopped up meat in there as well.  I don't usually care for mac and cheese, but I liked it here.  The cole slaw emphasized the vinegar flavor in the sauce and was hoping it would be more different.  It felt more like a salad than cole slaw.  The prices are average from other rib joints.  I may just come here to order the ribs again and just get sauce elsewhere....
