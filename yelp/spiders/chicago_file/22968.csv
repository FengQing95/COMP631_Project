Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So called "the best" Chicago pizza in CHICAGO. We sat and waited 25-30 minutes (after pre-ordering) and another table that got here 10 minutes after we got here just got their pizza. That's just plain RUDE. I brought it up to the waitress and she didn't have anything to say. We only came here because friends told us to. This place is hyped up and is not what it is expected to be. Bad service and a long wait is what you're getting yourself into. Sorry, not worth it.
