Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I wonder if getting the personal size pizza impacted the overall quality of the pizzas. I kind of wish we came in a bigger group to have tried a bigger size pizza. That being said I probably won't give it another chance since there's plenty of other deep dish pizzas to try the next time I'm in Chicago.
