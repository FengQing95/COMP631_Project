Smoque BBQ////I'm not going to say that I'm a bbq expert, but I do feel that I've had my fair share....we did have a hog roasting at my high school graduation party after all! Anywho, smoque impressed me quite a bit! I enjoyed the ribs and they were deeelicious! Fall off the bone and melt in your mouth delicious! Not a lot of money for a whole lot of food
