Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The atmosphere is very unabrasive and although there is a general low din, there isn't anything that that feels prickly.  Very comfortable as far as music which seems to be along the chill sort of genre and pretty hip.  The light level is lower which again provides a little bit more of a relaxing atmosphere.
