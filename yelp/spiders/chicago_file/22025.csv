Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The problem with hype lies within itself. In dating I equate it to this: you fancy the pants off somebody (because, presumably, they are awesome) but they kinda know they're awesome, so they make you an deep dish pizza that is... pizza. That might seem harsh (non-sequitur), especially since my expectations is what's at fault here. I had heard great things about Lou's pizza, flew in from LA to try a classic Chicago Deep Dish staple, and once I got in, staff were friendly enough, I sat down, and ordered.
