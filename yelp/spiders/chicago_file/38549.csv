Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Nothing short of incredible. Possibly the best cocktails I've ever had and certainly one of the best meals I've had since living in the Midwest...great ambiance and service too. Just a heads up, you will need to make dinner reservations very far in advance- like a month out!
