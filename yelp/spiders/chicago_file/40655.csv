Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I could go on and on about my favorite items on the menu but to name a few...bacon wrapped dates, garlic potato salad, chicken empanadas. This place is perfect for any occasion - date night, birthday, anniversary, or just because. I love the atmosphere and their sangria is delicious!
