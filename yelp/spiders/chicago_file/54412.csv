Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Overall a fun place to go with big groups so you can try more items. Also a great place for (first) dates! Go without a reservation and you will be forced to hang out at the bar until your table is ready, not a bad thing if you're trying to get to know someone. I've recommended this place as a date spot to many friends.
