The Purple Pig////Ambiance: This place seemed to be foodie central. You would see random flashes of light from different parts of the room as people would be taking pictures of each dish that came out. Inside the restaurant it was super packed. We sat at one of the communal tables near the front and were pretty shoulder to shoulder with the parties next to us. Â
