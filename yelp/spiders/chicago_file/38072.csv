Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I had the CLASSIC RIBEYE - CHICAGO CUT, which I've had at least three times before. Cooked perfectly, but pretty meager for (now) $58.95. Plus, while I like a good amount of fat in a well-marbled steak, I don't think I've ever had a steak that was so fatty, not at the sides but within the (otherwise) meaty inside of the steak. All I'm saying, inexpertly, is that a lot of my too-meager steak was comprised of big chunks of fat. That made the price even less appealing to me--and almost offensive--though it was a delicious steak, and I like the bearnaise and sea salt.
