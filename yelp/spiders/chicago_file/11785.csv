Art Institute of Chicago//// Â  The general admission is $25, so a bit of a pricey attraction, but you get A LOT for what you pay for. I don't even think we hit every room and we were there for over an hour. It's easy to get lost in here, but even easier to get lost in its beauty. There are multiple floors that are categorized by whatever art you may be interested in.
