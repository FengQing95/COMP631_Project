The Purple Pig////Overall, the food was amazing. The presentation of the food is so colorful, and the flavors and textures were contrasting and balanced. The only downside is that the tables in the restaurant are very close to each other, and the restaurant can be loud when it's busy... but hey to some people this might be not be a downside
