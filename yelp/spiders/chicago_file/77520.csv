Little Goat Diner////We had the best sandwiches we've ever had at Little Goat Diner.  The service was fantastic, too.  Plus the place just looks groovy.  All their items are a la carte, however.  If a side was included with the sandwich or had their fries not cost an additional $6 (for just enough fries that would normally come with 1 sandwich elsewhere), then I would have given them a 5th star. A tad picky? Yes.  But 4 stars is nothin' to sneeze about.
