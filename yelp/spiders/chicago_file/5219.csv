The Purple Pig////First time there, we ordered summer squash ($16), the grilled sardines ($15), and the english muffin/truffle sausage ($16).  The sardines and the muffin sausage were super excellent, but sadly the summer squash was a bit bland and pededstrian. Smaller portions, btw.  The wine selection seemed pretty good, but i was in no mood to drink, I wanted to focus on the food.  Wait staff were super helpful and professional.  For sure would return.
