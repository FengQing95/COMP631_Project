Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I didn't want to go here, but my good friend Jamie C. was visiting from Miami and she wanted some tapas.  The very first complaint was the sangria is really really weak, they use taps to dispense.  I think we consumed 12 pitchers between six people and I couldn't even get a buzz.  I think Jamie C. was drunk on something else if she thought the paella was good, sadly it was a mushy excuse for good paella.  The one positive dish was bacon wrapped dates, they were fantastic.  Service can rapid fire with 6 dishes at once, then no dishes for 20 minutes.
