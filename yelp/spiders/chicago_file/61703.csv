Smoque BBQ////So I have kind of avoided this place just because I figured Smoque was just a lot of hype. I was wrong. I had the pulled pork sandwich, which was buttery, and flavorful, and delicious. The Memphis sauce that came on the side was amazing as well. The fries were great, and the mac and cheese was otherworldly. I wish you could order larger portions of the mac and cheese, though. I had to take a star off for the wait, though. We waited in line for over 45 minutes just to ORDER. That's kind of ridiculous. They should really consider having more than one register. But they're BYOB, so I'll definitely be back with a 6 pack during a not-so-busy time!
