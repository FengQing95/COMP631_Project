Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The moment of truth had finally arrived right on our table. Lou's renowned butter crust has been a staple of the deep dish circuit over the better part of the past thirty years and this was the place to be. Picking up my knife and carving into the piece of pie, I could hear the crispiness of the crust as I cut into it. Starving, the pizza was worth the salt and the extra pepperoni added some additional flavor. Lou's deep dish also has an entire layer of sausage cooked underneath the top and the tomato sauce mixed with the sausage flavor and butter crisp to make the fiercest version of Chicago Deep Dish. You may beg to differ but I am always open to try more awesome deep dish spots.
