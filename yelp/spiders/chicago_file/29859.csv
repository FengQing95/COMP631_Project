Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friend put our name down, so we got there right when were getting seated. Lou Malnati's was my first deep dish pizza experience and it's equal to or better than regular pizza. I could see myself getting tired of it really quick. But I loved the crust! I NEVER eat crust because its always so bland and not worth the extra calories, but it was so soft and butter here, I couldn't resist.
