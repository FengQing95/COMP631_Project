Little Goat Diner////The food here was really good but overall, I was a bit disappointed.  The atmosphere was nice but seemed a bit run down to be honest.  The hostess was really shy but nice but the host seemed to have an attitude and was pretty off-putting.  The food didn't come out all once which resulted in my father almost being done with his food before mine arrived.  We got a short stack of sourdough pancakes, the paratha burrito, and the biscuits and gravy.  All was good but for my money, I would choose the paratha burrito over the other two.  It was familiar but completely foreign to me but it was also so good.
