Little Goat Diner////Little Goat definitely achieves an elevated diner feel, with squishy bench seats but modern bare bulb lighting. The 90's pop music brought me back and got my head bobbing. Everything, including glasses, plates, and paper utensil wraps, was customized with the Little Goat logo which not only ups the brand but makes the customer feel like they are going through a whole experience. Three of us shared the crab dip and and goat chili cheese fries appetizers. The crab dip has little filler and comes with good ol' Ritz crackers, which might portray kitchen laziness but are at the same time comforting. The dip was a bit salty for my taste. The fries are thin and best eaten with a fork due to chunky chili topping. For my entree, I ordered the This Little Piggy Went To China, which consists of a cheddar biscuit with sausage and sunny side up eggs surrounded by gooseberry sauce. I had never had gooseberries before, and they tasted like sweeter tomatoes. As much as I wanted to love my dinner, I didn't for the simple reason that the tart sauce overpowered all of the actual food it enveloped. The portions are large and very filling, though. Honestly, I would rate Little Goat three stars if it weren't for the fun breakfast-for-dinner options and the restaurant's overall fun vibe. However, I would totally come back to try other dishes as well as their shakes.
