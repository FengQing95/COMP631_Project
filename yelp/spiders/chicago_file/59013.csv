Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This Tapas place was a fun experience while visiting Chi with some friends! We all picked our own appetizer and agreed on some additional ones to get a wide variety of things to try. It really was a gamble when ordering because we had never heard of most of the stuff on the menu, but we ended we up loving it all! They brought out appetizers 1-2 at a time so it was fun because the table could really enjoy each individual dish on its own! I think my personal favorites that we tried were the goat cheese in tomato sauce (mainly because I love goat cheese and it was cooked great). The Paella was also very tasty and flavorful. The sangria was great but almost $30 a pitcher is pricy when the pitcher is so small in my opinion. Also the bill can add up quickly so it was nice to split it between the table! The waiter we had was also very nice and helpful! Overall, it was a good experience.
