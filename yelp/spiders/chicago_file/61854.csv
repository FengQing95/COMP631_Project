Smoque BBQ////I had their brisket and pork BBQ.  Their brisket was disappointing.  It was a bit hard.  The pork BBQ was very soft and much better.  Because the brisket was so dry and a bit tough, it wasn't too flavorful.  The pork BBQ was significantly better.  I wasn't in love with the sauce.  Neither had a really "smoky" flavor, which I love in BBQ.
