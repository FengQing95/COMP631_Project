Art Institute of Chicago////I confess: I fell HARD for this museum.  The flow of the space makes it a breeze to see permanent collections and special exhibits pretty easily even on busy days. (By the way when will some people get a better sense of personal space!). Excellent Van Gogh pieces.  DO NOT MISS the Serats which are a WONDER to behold.  One must actually see them in person to fully appreciate the artist's precise and triumphant mastery of technique in service of his art.   The contemporary wing has some very well known works along with several extraordinary but lesser known artist's.  And may I say to a person everyone was SO helpful and knowledgeable too.  Their talented staff is one of their greatest assets. It has something special I have never experienced in the scores of museums I have visited.   Can't wait to go back!
