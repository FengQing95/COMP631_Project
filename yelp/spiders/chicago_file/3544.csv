The Purple Pig////I definitely recommend the calamari, octopus, milk braised pork shoulder and the truffle gnocchi!  The calamari dish was super fresh and light.  The octopus was grilled and cooked to perfection.  It wasn't too chewy but tender and it was seasoned perfectly.  The milk braised pork shoulder is a popular item for a reason.  The meat falls apart easily and literally melts in your mouth!  So tender and flavorful, it also paired very well with the creamy mashed potatoes it came with.  The truffle gnocchi... wow just wow.  I think this was my favorite dish and I would HIGHLY recommend you order this.  Bites of heaven.  The pig ears was interesting but not something I would order again or recommend.  We actually got two of these because my friend took a bite and pulled out the longest piece of hair from her mouth from the first dish.  We flagged down the waiter and told him quietly because we didn't want to cause a scene so he took it away and brought out a new one for us.  I kind of expected them to waive that dish but they didn't.. no big deal although it would've been nice.
