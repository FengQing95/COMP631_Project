Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I think this one of the best Deep dish Pizzas I have ever eaten. My wife only likes thin and crispy pizzas she only wanted to try it and once she did she ate 2 slices which is a lot. The Pizza does take at least 45-50 to make but it is well worth it. I highly recommend this restaurant!!!!
