Smoque BBQ////Ribs: If you are a fan of getting messy when you eat BBQ, don't miss this treat. The meat literally melts off the bone. It has a Memphis style dry rub that really makes the ribs very savory with just a little bit of sweetness from the BBQ sauce. I did not want to use the wet naps afterwards, because i wanted to lick all the sauce off my fingers.
