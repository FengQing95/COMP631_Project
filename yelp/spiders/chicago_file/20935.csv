Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Filling is the first word that comes to mind.  Fresh tomato base sauce and a thinner crust than I thought came on my sausage and black olive pizza.  The sausage can only be explained as an entire layer of mild Italian sausage covered with the sauce.  The cheese sits on the bottom next to the crust.  New York or Chicago style, have to vote NY style.  Good quality Chicago style, just like the flavor of well cooked thin style crust.
