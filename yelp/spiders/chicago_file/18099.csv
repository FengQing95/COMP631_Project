Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I treated myself to a pint of Blue Moon lager, and sized up the menu. Obviously without question we ordered the pizza, but the trick was what size? After conferring with our server who STRONGLY advised us that for 2 people we not go larger than a small... we scoffed but took him at his word. I must say now to him "thank you for the kind warning on how filling this stuff is - we barely made it through...."
