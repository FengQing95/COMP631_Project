Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were excited to try Bavette's because of the great reviews. I was neutral on the decor when we first arrived (dark, clubby, retro). So excited to see foie gras as an appetizer...and it was great. The Lyonnaise salad was exceptional, the best part of our meal. Then the entrees. My husband ordered a ribeye and I ordered a pork chop. Both of us thought that our meat was on the dry & tough side. As far as the pork goes, the cut was so thick that it was probably difficult to get the inside done w/o overcooking the outer meat. I'm not sure what happened with the steak. Anyway, it was mostly good (and, oh yeah, the corn was really good).
