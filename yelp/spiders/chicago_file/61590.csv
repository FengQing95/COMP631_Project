Smoque BBQ////I really wanted to like this place, but was unfortunately underwhelmed.  The service was quick and fast which I definitely liked, the owner was friendly and gave up his table when all others were taken.  I got the brisket and it was good but not phenom.  I guess my main complaint was the sauce.  I hump sauce in general so when they give it to you in a little container and the consistency is watery, it just doesn't scream BBQ.
