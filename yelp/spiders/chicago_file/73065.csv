Little Goat Diner////Los Drowned & Goat Chili were my favs. It's been awhile since I've been here, but I would try to go back to Chiacgo if only to eat at Little Goat again. Personally, I enjoyed it more than Stephanie's place across the street (Girl & the Goat). But I'm more into the casual dining and well done home cooked meals with bold flavors and no frills lately.
