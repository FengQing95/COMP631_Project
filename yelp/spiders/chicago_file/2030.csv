Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////So Wildberry is nothing special, unless you're a visitor in town and staying in the loop/millenium park vicinity and looking for a good brunch place. They have a large seating area and maybe a bit of a wait, but not too long. 20-30 minutes is pretty standard in the city. More than 45 minutes is a waste of time.
