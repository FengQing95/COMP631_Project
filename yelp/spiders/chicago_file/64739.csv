Smoque BBQ////The best brisket I have had anywhere period.  Sliced or chopped, it has the right amount of smokiness, fat, and is the most tender brisket I have ever had.  Yes, it does melt in your mouth and leave you wanting more.  First time here came with a group of 7 and we must have been very lucky arriving on a weekend around 5pm with a short line.  Line was pretty fast paced and yes you do have to scope out a table when walking in, however I was really impressed with the staff assisting us in landing a table & making sure we were taken care of.  This place gets busy, busy, busy...you come, you stuff your face and you leave.  If you think Q's has great brisket, try it here.
