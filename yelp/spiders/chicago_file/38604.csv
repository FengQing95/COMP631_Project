Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It's always a good time here! Â Food is always on point. Love love love dining downstairs. Cozy and intimate. Went with two other guys but that didn't stop us from enjoying the ambiance. Only problem was that I felt like the bartender upstairs under-poured my Anejo tequila. I always order rocks, and that was by far the least amount I've gotten from a place like this. Especially when we're paying $18 a pop. I wish I had a picture. Next time I'll just order my old fashioned. They have yet to butcher that drink there. But I do have a picture of my wonderful steak!
