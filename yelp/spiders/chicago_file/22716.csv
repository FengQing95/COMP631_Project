Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Finally had this pizza and ..... Â not all it's cracked up to be. Don't get me wrong it was good for sure but I'm more of a thin crust kinda guy. The restaurant is awesome though. Covered with great sports decorations from wall to wall you can find some cool things to look at. The pizza is heart and rich with flavor and pairs well with a nice cold brew. That buttery crust is pretty damn good and great for dipping. This is just a classic joint that you have to try once!
