Art Institute of Chicago////After thinking about it for a while, we decided not to go in. Just took couple of pictures outside the Museum/ Institute with the south pedestal lion. ;) Â It looked very grand from outside. We went into the gift/ souvenir shop. The tickets were very expensive. Since I am not very interested in Artsy stuff, it was a waste of time and money for me. They had couple of options for the tickets- City pass, all-year pass, day-pass. I would have put in more efforts to try and go inside, if there was any motivation. But I am pretty sure Art lovers would enjoy this huge museum. The website has a lot of information on the different galleries and paintings. It's in the middle of Chicago downtown, on Michigan Avenue. Good hot spot, perfect Chicago landmark.
