Smoque BBQ////I worked from home yesterday and decided to take a field trip over to Smoque with my manfriend.  I made a huge mistake by not taking the expressway.  We drove through God's country to get there...45 minutes later we finally arrived.  The wonderful aroma of, well, smoke, hit me as we walked in the door.  I went with the pulled pork, and B had the St. Louis ribs.  Both of us had mac and cheese on the side and B also got fries.  Everything was delicious, but the real winners were the pulled pork and the mac and cheese.
