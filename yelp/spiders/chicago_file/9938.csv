Art Institute of Chicago////This is a well rounded western art museum. It has a little of everything, from post modern to 16th century European. Make sure to give yourself three hours to digest and enjoy everything. The museum is layed out like a maze, so make sure to have a map on hand. The collection of Surrealism is wonderful. Im not going to gush about every wonderful picture I saw, but I will say this is a place worth going out of your way for. Keep in mind they charge you to "check in" items Â like bags or loose items you dont want to carry.
