Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Last night, the service we received from the female bartender in the basement of Bavette's (or lack thereof) was abhorrent. She was training another female or had a stage following her for the duration of our experience. I chose Bavette's because I wanted to have my husband feel wined and dined at a nice establishment after working a long week. This experience was anything but that and left a sour taste in my mouth. Never was there any offer of food or any attempt to sell us their product offerings - simply order taking.
