The Purple Pig////Fried cheese - not sure which cheese it was but I wasn't too impressed by this dish maybe because I'm not much of a cheese fan to begin with or maybe the cheese didn't melt as much as I would've liked. The dish came with a jam like dip but the whole salty/sweet thing didn't mesh well for me. Tip: As with all fried things, it tastes best fresh out. After 15 minutes you lose the taste.
