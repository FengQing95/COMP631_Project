Art Institute of Chicago////Before posting this I read a lot of the comments, and didn't find what I wanted to see. There is a lack of sincerity and I guess originality; we know the museum is huge but why does that matter this isn't a mall to window shop from and run to the next display of disposable one time use goods. We know the museum has beautiful works of art but so what??? There is art all over the city, and don't correct me because art can be found in anything you draw inspiration from.
