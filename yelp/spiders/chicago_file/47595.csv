Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is too fun!  I love bringing out of town guests here.  They have an excellent Spanish wine selection, and knowledgeable staff.  They are prompt with service... and also the drinks? Did I mention the drinks... they have great Sangria.  The blood orange was fantastic.  Also, definitely have the bacon wrapped dates.
