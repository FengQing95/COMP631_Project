Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////While I have been here a few times in the past and always had a good experience, I was blown away this past weekend when a friend of mine had their wedding ceremony/reception at Ba-Ba-Reeba.  As I'm sure goes without saying, the food was fantastic and the sangria was amazing.  What really made my experience over-the-top-oh-my-goodness-gracious-incredible was the level of service we received.  The venue itself is great in both flavor in ambiance, but we literally could not have had better service or a more accommodating staff, which really made the experience all the more beautiful.  I was so impressed that I demanded names of the people working in our section.  That being said, I would like to give a HUGE thank you to Ryan Davis, Johnny Jarra, Hector Saucedo, Marcos Mendoza, and Tomas Jimenez.  Give these fellas a raise!  They truly went out of their way to ensure we had a special (verging on magical) evening, and I'll be recommending Ba-Ba-Reeba to anyone I know looking to celebrate such a special occasion.  Thank you again, and I will see you next time!
