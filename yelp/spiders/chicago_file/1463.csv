Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We waited three hours because he reviews were so terrific. Our pancakes were dry. They didn't have any fruit cooked into them, just a little dumped on top. The "fruit tray" was unripe cheap fruit. It was awful. We really felt like we wasted a lot of our time on this restaurant.
