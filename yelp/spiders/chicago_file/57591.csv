Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So why 3 stars? I just really think there are better places to eat. I never leave here without a stomach ache. The food is all heavy and very oily. My parents LOVE this place (mostly because I think they are fans of the tapas style in particular) but coming here for me is preparing to indulge in food that I would not otherwise choose to indulge.
