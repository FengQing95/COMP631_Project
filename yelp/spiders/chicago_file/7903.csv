Art Institute of Chicago////When I go to Chicago I always make sure to be there on a free day at the art institute. I'm not an art historian or anything like that but I know what a great museum is when I see and this is it. Spending a day here reminds you of the power of beauty on earth and how amazing art can be. The collection of impressionist paintings isn't matched anywhere on earth outside of France.
