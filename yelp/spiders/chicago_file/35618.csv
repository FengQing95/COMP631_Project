Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////GLORIOUS ribeye.  Way too big for me (but I wanted the ribeye, not the petit filet), so I took the leftovers home, cut it up into steak tips and used it in my arugula salads for the rest of the week.  So worth it.  Also, you can add bone marrow to your steak for cheaper than the actual bone marrow dish.  Hooray!
