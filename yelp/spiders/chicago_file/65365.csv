Smoque BBQ////I called the store amd was told on a automated message that only takes a few seconds to change that the hours were till 10:00 pm on Friday and Saturday. I am currently here and they have been closed for some time now. No would not have driven across the city if some lazy people would change the message. This has been happening to me over amd over throughout COVID and no body want to update any hours to reflect the current situation. Very poorly operated if this is what happens during a pandemic and you can't even change your hours on Yelp and other platforms. Very disappointed!! Easy fix and now I am going to McDonald's. Thanks smoque!!!
