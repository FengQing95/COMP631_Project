Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I am fairly certain our menu was picked for us as we had little cards with our group and the food choices on it, and I have no problems with that. I am notorious for taking my time ordering so having someone choose for me is just the bee's knee's (or spider's elbow?). The endive salad was light and fruity, the chicken skewers and mayo-y dipping sauce were awesome, but the best of all was the spicy potato dish. On their own, those potatoes are great, but with the orange sauce that comes on the side they are about 10 times better.
