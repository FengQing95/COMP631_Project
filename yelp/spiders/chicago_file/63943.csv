Smoque BBQ////I chose the chopped brisket based on Meghan H's review that it was basically burnt ends- my favorite, and oh my, I'm glad I did. They were juicy, succulent, full of flavor and just outstanding. It really does compare well to burnt ends. Great tip Meghan, otherwise I might have waited til another time to try. It is making me salivate right now, actually. :-)~ The sausage we had was good, but I felt it tasted better the next day.
