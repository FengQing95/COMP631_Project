Art Institute of Chicago//// I asked an old-timer guard, "How can you do it?" He was baffled, so I explained that I have been there for a short time and was already stunned and overwhelmed. He replied, "You get used to it." I respect my elders, but doubt I could get used to it (and an envious digression, the guards must have a sweet gig simply standing there, gazing at beautiful art, making sure nobody disturbs anything, and meeting new people every day).
