Little Goat Diner////Food wise, this place is decent. The menu is creative. I had the pork belly pancake. It was a slab of pork belly on top of a crispy scallion pancake then covered with an Asian slaw. My husband had the Bull's eye French toast. It was two pieces of bread with a sunny side up fried egg inside the bread. Then it was covered with pieces of fried chicken fingers in a pool of bacon maple syrup. They were going for the salty sweet thing but it was overpowered by the sweet. The chicken breading needed to be saltier to balance out the syrup.
