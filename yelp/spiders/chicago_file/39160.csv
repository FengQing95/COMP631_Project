Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We split the steak because I usually don't eat more than 6 oz of a steak if I had other things to eat and my boyfriend ate the rest. This steak melts in your mouth it's so good. I kind of wish I had more room in my stomach to eat it all. If you come to Bavettes you have to order the steak! It's completely necessary and you will have no regrets. For the sides the truffle mac and cheese was the best. It was a truffle explosion it was so good! The waiter said that the mac and cheese was his favorite and I think it's the best side we had. The brussel sprouts were alright and I'm not the biggest fan of thick cut bacon because it's so greasy but my boyfriend really enjoyed it.
