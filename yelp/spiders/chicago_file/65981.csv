Smoque BBQ////I ordered their ribs again, while my wife ordered their brisket sandwich and my son ordered his kids meal brisket sandwich. Both sandwiches were packed full of meat. My wife ordered their bbq beans while I ordered their brisket chilli. I would have to say their bbq beans tasted a lot better. They were sweeter and completed the rest of the meal a lot better. The brisket was so tender and perfeclty smoked. The meat just literally fell apart. The ribs were also perfect smoked and seasoned. Only thing I'm really not a big fan of is their cole slaw. Needs more flavor.
