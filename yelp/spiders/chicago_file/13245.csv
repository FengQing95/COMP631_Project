Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I love Lou Malnati's in general, but this location in particular is fantastic.  Every time I've been here, the pizza has been perfect.  The only drawbacks are the long lines and packs of tourists, but I also am happy to see out-of-towners get to appreciate the best we have to offer!  The crust is phenomenal, the cheese is amazing, and the tomatoes add the perfect tang to the combination.  This is a favorite for me and my boyfriend.  We always fight over the leftovers!
