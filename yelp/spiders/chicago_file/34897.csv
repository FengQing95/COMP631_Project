Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The space is dimly lit with chandeliers, filled with plush leather seating and dark woods throughout.  I dug the decor and I could see myself hanging out here a lot more, especially with some drinks.  I'm usually a beer kind of guy, but I think I'll stick to cocktails here.  I tried the Weller's 107 Old Fashioned and a Lion's Tail - both were really well made and were recommended by our server.
