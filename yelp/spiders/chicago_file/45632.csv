Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My eyes immediately went to number 68 on the menu--roasted dates with bacon and apple vinagrette. Oh how I lament going semi-vegitarian in moments like these (health reasons only). Last time we ate here, they were SO amazing. But this time we went for the seafood and veggies. Our adventure began with the spinach and artichoke crepes from the brunch menu. Not bad. Not bad.
