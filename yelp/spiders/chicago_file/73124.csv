Little Goat Diner////It was about this time that I noticed that Chef was working in the kitchen right across from me!  Out come my waffles, followed shortly by the hash browns.  They were piping hot and the butter melted perfectly all over my waffles.  Bacon in maple syrup may just be the best way to have bacon.  Not like there is a bad way.  I wanted some hot sauce for the hash browns and my server brought out two house made sauces.  House. Made. Hot. Sauce.  You'll want to be skipping the ketchup and use those instead.  To my surprise, I liked the milder one more.  The goat cheese was a delicious touch to the potatoes and I loved them.
