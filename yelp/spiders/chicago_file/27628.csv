Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered the Lou Malnati's special which is a large piece of sausage instead of chunks. It was fantastic, and also filling (personal size). I felt it could have maybe used a bit more sauce, and it really didn't feel like extra cheese but I think that was just perception vs. reality. As everyone mentions it takes 30-40 minutes so get an app if you're hungry. I enjoyed the service and the food and if I was back in the Windy City I'd probably come here first for my deep dish craving.
