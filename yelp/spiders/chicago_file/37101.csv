Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We shared a crab cake, a Caesar salad with smoked fish (a great alternative to sardines) and a fois gras.  Everything was delicious. We all had either the ribeye or the filet.  As perfectly prepared as you can find anywhere.  Simply delicious.  Sides included a blue cheese topped creamed spinach and butternut squash.  Good sized portions so no one left hungry.  Dessert was a berry topped cheesecake and a scoop of peppermint ice cream with hot fudge.
