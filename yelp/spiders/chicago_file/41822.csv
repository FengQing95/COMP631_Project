Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had never been to a Spanish tapas restaurant before Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, but I was immediately blown away. The food was spectacular, the service was fantastic, and the atmosphere there was wonderful. I loved eating my food with my family while listening to great Spanish music. It was a ton of fun sharing dinner with the entire family! It's a little pricey, but so worth it.
