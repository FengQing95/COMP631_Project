Smoque BBQ////I do admire their BBQ Manifesto, I'm glad to see a place take a stand on food that, as they say, inspires much debate.  It's also a good addition to the neighborhood.  I'll probably come back to check out another dish, but only because the options are more limited on this side of town.
