Little Goat Diner////Little Goat features 5 star dishes (i.e. Bulls Eye French Toast, Goat Almighty & Los Drowned) and 2 star dishes (i.e. Boo Boo Baise & Crisp Shrimp Cocktail). The shakes sound better than they taste and aren't worth the $8. The fries are solid, but not worth $7. Service can range from shoddy to stellar. The host booth also lacks consistency.
