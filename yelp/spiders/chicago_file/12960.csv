Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's has a reputation for being the best or one of the best deep dish pizza spots in Chicago. After waiting an hour in the bar area with a hectic but fun crowd, also waiting, I think it definitely lived up to the hype. The couple we went with are locals and they did the ordering for us. We had an appetizer that the four of us shared and a sausage and other meats deep dish. Clean it off with a few beers and it was perfect. We were full and satisfied. Great for a cheat day (low carb diet here). The only thing that kept it from a five star was our server. Service is a big deal for me as you can see in my other reviews and our server, an older gentleman, wasn't good. It was a freezing cold day, we're not from Chicago, so during our table conversation he proceeded to chime in and start bashing a particular political party over climate change? It wasn't cool. Other than that this place rocks! I'd go back every time (if I ever) go back to Chicago. Good news, they ship their pizzas across the country!
