Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered the spinach one and my boyfriend ordered the classic one. I preferred the classic one with sausage compared to the spinach one. They were both good and the crust was my favorite part, it tasted like butter! So yummy! We ordered the personal size that way we could try each other's and still finish everything, which we did.
