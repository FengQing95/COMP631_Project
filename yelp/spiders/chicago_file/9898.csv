Art Institute of Chicago////Many great works reside in these smoothly flowing corridors. We stopped in at "The Museum Cafe" which is cafeteria style the food is decent and they have a small bar. The whole complex is as nice as you would expect. I would suggest not taking small kids because the ones I saw were miserable.
