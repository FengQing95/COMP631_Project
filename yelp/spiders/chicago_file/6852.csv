Art Institute of Chicago////A child in Chicago is steeped in art and architecture from early on. Growing up I thought everyone lived in a city where you could play on a giant Picasso sculpture or see Monet on a school field trip. And the gift of the Chagall Windows transfixed me with their blue glow, even as a second grader.
