Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ate at the one on Wells once dine in and once for take out during our 5 day stay. We had always eaten at Giordano cause everyone always told us it was the best, well I don't believe so after eating at Lous. The crust is much better and the flavor is 10 times better. We will definitely be eating at Lous from now on.
