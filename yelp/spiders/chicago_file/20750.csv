Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////LOVED this place, great vibes and great hospitality. The food takes quite a while to prepare so definitely make a reservation if you can, to avoid waiting for a table. I got a personal deep dish pizza which may look small, but it is actually SO filling and even hard to finish! Will definitely want to come back here one day - it's a true Chicago treat!
