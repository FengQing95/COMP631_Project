Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had a fun dinner before catching a show.  Really loved the grilled calamari and the short ribs.  The egg and potato Tortilla dish is classic but the sauce was a perfect touch.  Made a classic dish that much more enjoyable.  The stuffed mushrooms were good, but predictable.  The Paella was flavorfull, but a bit dry.  The service was attentive.  Always a good spot and fun to share plates.
