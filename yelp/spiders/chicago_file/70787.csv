Little Goat Diner////As if this place needs another review! I made a lunch reservation a few days in advance (no problem getting an 11:30 on a Friday) and came in with my boss. We loved the diner feel and were happy to have one of the small tables rather than sitting at a communal table (call us anti-social, whatever). It wasn't long before we were watching a crowd accumulate at the door!
