The Purple Pig////This place is a Chicago staple and one of the BEST tapas restaurants I've ever been to... I had the summer squash and the turkey leg confit. The portions are much bigger than any other tapas bar I've visited. The atmosphere is great and lends itself to friendly conversation. The wait staff is very friendly and informative with recommended pairings. Don't leave without trying one of their house made cheeses or meats. This is truly a wonderful experience while visiting Chicago!
