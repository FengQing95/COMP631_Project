Little Goat Diner////We did make one mistake--when we walked in they offered us a seat at the counter instead of waiting for a table. We took the counter seat and it was a little awkward. It felt super cramped and we were sitting next to where all the staff were going in to grab food. I felt like I was in the way! I wish I would have waited for a table.
