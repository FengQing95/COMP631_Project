Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was good, but pricey for what you get.  My filet was cooked well, but nothing mind-blowing.  Hubby's bone-in prime rib was delish!!  We killed our entrees.  (the other couple had leftovers - whaaat!).  The crabcake to start left much to be desired - especially since I compare all crab cakes to delfrescos.  Crab and avocado salad was good and fresh.  Dessert was ice cream with a hard fudge shell over - pretty cool with presentation and pretty standard with taste. Cocktails were great tho!
