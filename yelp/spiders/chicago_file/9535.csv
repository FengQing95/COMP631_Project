Art Institute of Chicago////This is the best Museum!  The first time I came here, I kind of was like, "Really, all of this in the MidWest?!"  Terrible, but true!  If you get the City Pass, which is supposed to give you a a Fast Pass for entry here and other venues, it actually works here!  We got there early before it opened on a busy holiday weekend (Memorial Day) and there was a line on the left for people that were buying tickets or had printed tickets.  We got to stand in the 3 person line in front of the Middle doors.  The right side was for membership entry, I think.  It was so cool to walk in an empty Amazing museum!  The City Pass covers you for the audio self tour.  Go and see this place, it is so lovely. We got to see the special Ireland Exhibit, some of it is boring, but I loved the old Irish harps.
