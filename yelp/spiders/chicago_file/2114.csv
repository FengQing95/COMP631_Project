Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The hype is well worth it :) went with a friend and got tiramisu pancakes and oh my god were they delicious. To be honest the 2 hour wait is probably not worth it, but it does make wild berry and experience and you definitely want those pancakes once they call your name. A must see Chicago brunch spot!
