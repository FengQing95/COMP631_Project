Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I can't say enough about this place. Went with a group of six and started with Cava Sangria. It was light, refreshing, and not too sweet but was still strong. I tried a taste of my friend's peach sangria and that was far too sweet for me but still tasted nice. I also tasted the classic red sangria Â which tasted like your typical solid red sangria.
