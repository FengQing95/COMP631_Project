Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The staff is GREAT! The restaurant is pretty nice inside, but the tables are too close. The couple in the table next to ours could hear our convo( they made awkward pauses and seemed to be listening) and we could hear theirs. Now,that's not a bad thing if you're in a place where it's totally fine to talk to everyone around you(I'm used to this), but in the US, it's not common practice....which makes it wierd. The food is OKAY....I've tasted way better Spanish food, but it's good enough.
