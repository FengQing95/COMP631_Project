Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a kids cheese pizza and a Deep dish pizza.  I understand that a deep dish or stuffed crust pizza make take 30-40 minutes to cook, but a small cheese pizza takes just as long?  Luckily my son liked the calamari we ordered for the appetizer even though it was over cooked and very chewy.
