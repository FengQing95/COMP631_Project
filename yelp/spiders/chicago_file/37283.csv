Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We can never get a reservation here, so we decided to make one about two months in advance. I wish I'd gotten the chance to write this review sooner, it's been a couple of weeks, but I'll try to be detailed. We started with the mixed green and apple salad, which was very good, especially the candied pecans. The bread and butter were both unique and delicious. I got the bone-in filet, which was AMAZING. It was the best steak I have ever had--seriously. The seasoning, the temperature, everything was perfect. All of the sides we tried were wonderful. The broccoli wasn't boring like you would expect, it was the right crispness and seasoned well. The corn was luscious and delicious with a little bit of heat. The sweet potato was creamy and flavorful.
