Little Goat Diner////The portions are generous. I saw many couples splitting food. The two of us got a goat burger (no bun, nice lettuce) fried chicken (surprisingly good! Recommended by wine spectator they said?) and a bowl of goat chili and took home 2 small meals worth.  I got their drink special of cinnamon and masala, one only, and it was small but potent. My son said he could still smell the spice on me the next morning!  The food was just really, really good. Definitely would be happy to go again.
