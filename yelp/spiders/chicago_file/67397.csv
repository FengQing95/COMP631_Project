Little Goat Diner////It's a small dish of crab dip, and then bordered by a single layer of Ritz crackers. Problem is, the amount of crab dip you get is pretty good, but you get like 8 Ritz crackers, which is hardly enough to have half. You pretty much have to mound it on the cracker if you want to use it all up. We didn't, so I used the rest to flavorize my tempura mashed potato. The crab dip is good. It's cheesy, seafoody, and salty enough. Wasn't spectacular, but it was good. I might consider getting it again if I ever came back.
