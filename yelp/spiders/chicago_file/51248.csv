Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Just a bit confused about the overall brunch concept. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba claims to be Spanish tapas but I'm not sure if anything they offer is truly Spanish (except for the paella?), the overall meal felt like something you would get at TGIFriday's or Applebees - everything felt like food from a chain restaurant.
