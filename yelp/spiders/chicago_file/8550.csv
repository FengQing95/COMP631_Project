Art Institute of Chicago////There were two photography exhibits I found to be remarkable; one Japanese in the modern wing with some incredibly beautiful and jarring images of mostly people at the time of the Hiroshima/Nagasaki bombings. The other photo exhibit is in the main area in the lower level and is covering generally people, varying in strength and vulnerability.
