The Purple Pig////- Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder: SUPER TENDER! Literally fall apart at the prodding of a fork. And the combination with the mashed potatoes and gravy? An elevated Thanksgiving dinner experience -- consider an alternate universe where this was the household meat of choice for the holidays, instead of turkey. Revolutionary. Peak cuisine.
