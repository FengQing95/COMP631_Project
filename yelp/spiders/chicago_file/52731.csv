Smoque BBQ////Summary: I looked around as I was eating my ribs and it seemed like a lot of people were getting the briskets (what they are known for). And they looked pretty damn good! It wasn't dry looking like the most briskets I've seen. I love bbq and meat- and I can't stop thinking about their mac n cheese. Â Price is decent and the turnover rate for tables are quite fast. Would recommend to drop by if you are in the area
