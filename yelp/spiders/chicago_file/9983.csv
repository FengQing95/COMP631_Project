Art Institute of Chicago////It was magical....from the triptych windows that Chicago's very own Frank Lloyd Wright designed, to all of this geometric Prairie school window designs, to the masterpieces of Louis Sullivan, to the provincial life in Suffolk of John Constable, to Renoit and Degas....Caravaggio and his religious subjects and wonderful play on light and depth.
