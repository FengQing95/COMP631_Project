Smoque BBQ////My Dad, his girlfriend, the little sis, and I hoped in my Dad's Jeep one evening and came here for dinner. It was around 6:30pm on a weeknight, and line was out the door. We nearly left and went somewhere else, but my Dad's girlfriend insisted that the food would be worth the wait. Finally we got inside and noticed that a guy was taking orders so that the line would move a little smoother and quicker. He was also nice enough to see to it that we would get a table(all of them were full) and get me a paper menu because my eyes were not allowing me to read the chalkboard menu.
