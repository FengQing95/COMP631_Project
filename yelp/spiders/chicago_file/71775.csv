Little Goat Diner////This place is a great lunch spot! I have been to girl and the goat and was excited for this concept. We sat at the bar while everything looked amazing ordered the Patty Melt, Hot crab dip, fried pickles and onion rings. Everything was on point and delicious. I actually couldn't get enough of the crab dip - I think I could eat that often with a side salad and be in my happy place.
