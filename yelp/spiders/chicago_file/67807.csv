Little Goat Diner////Both times when I have gone there has been a wait, but their system is wonderful. You give your name, they quote you a time, ask for your number, and you can actually check how much longer you have to wait from your phone. You can also see how many parties are ahead of you. Also, while waiting you are more than welcome to go wait in the Little Goat Bread section for a drink, or a browsing of all of the little goat items.
