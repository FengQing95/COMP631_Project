Little Goat Diner////The meal ended up being sort of expensive - $16 for the breakfast and $9 each for the mimosas.  I happily paid it.   I also tipped well since the server was excellent.  Bright and bubbly and attentive without being obnoxious - exactly what I would have imagined from an upscale diner.
