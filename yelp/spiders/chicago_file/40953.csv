Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Terrible food. The ambient is great, service is good too but the food is terrible. The best thing I had there was the glass of water I had. I believe I ordered tortilla espanola not hashbrowns, patatas bravas were potato wedges with Cajun spices not bravas, octopus was salty, calamari was salty, salmon was very fishy. Will never return
