Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The Berkshire pork chop was perfectly prepared. Our pork chop had some marbling to it which definitely added to the moist piece of meat. The beef tongue was also delicious. The salt cod brandade was also a great starter-- liked the fact that we could actually taste actual cod meat in the brandade instead of being all mushed up.
