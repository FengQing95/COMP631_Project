Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Food is fabulous, but service is awful. We visited twice this weekend. The first time they mixed up our order twice in a row. We left a comment card, and they gave us a $10 coupon. So we gave it a second shot today, and ended up waiting 15 minutes for a server to visit, another 15 for our drinks, then another 15 for our food!
