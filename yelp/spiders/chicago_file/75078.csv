Little Goat Diner////-Boo boo baise (bouillabaisse) - I liked this a lot because of the quality of seafood that came with the mashed potatoes. I don't like mashed potatoes, but because the broth was tasty and the seafood was perfectly cooked, it all worked well together. I'm kind of tempted to make my own now!
