Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This has to be the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. We ordered a medium spinach mix and mushroom deep dish pizza with the butter crust as well as the Malnati salad. Both were absolutely delicious. This was more than enough food for 2 people but we managed to finish it all with no room to spare purely on not wanting to waste any of the deliciousness.
