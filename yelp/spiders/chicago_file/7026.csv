Art Institute of Chicago////Amazing art. Great atmosphere. You can take pictures. Easy to get to from public transportation. And it's FREE to get in on thursdays b/w 5-8pm. Great, cheap way to get some culture. And its proximity to the park makes it a go-to day drip in the warmer weather. Fulfill your inner Ferris Beuler and go!
