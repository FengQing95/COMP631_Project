Smoque BBQ////Pro's - it's BYOB which everyone loves.  Mac and Cheese was pretty tasty and I'm not a huge fan of baked mac & cheese with crumb topping. BBQ beans weren't bad either.  I enjoyed them the most of all the things I had.  I had the sliced brisket platter with two sides and I wasn't able to finish my last couple of slices of brisket and I was starving when I arrived.
