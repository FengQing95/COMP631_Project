Little Goat Diner////My friend and I came here for lunch on a trip to Chicago this summer.  As an avid fan of Top Chef, I couldn't visit Chicago without seeing one of Stephanie Izard's restaurants! There was a little bit of a wait so we headed to the Little Goat Rooftop to grab a drink in the meantime.  I thought it was cool that on the way to the bar you pass by an open work station where chefs are busy prepping.  When our table was ready they let us take our drinks from the bar into the diner, which was very nice.
