Art Institute of Chicago////Here's a review from a different perspective... I helped coordinate a wedding that was held here in the stock exchange room.  It was quite lovely.  The food was great and the staff was fantastic.  Everyone working for the building and catering company was more than helpful.  When we needed to move the bridal portrait upstairs, no problem.  When someone broke a glass I just had to make eye contact with the head waiter and it was taken care of.  The couple also paid to have the galleries open for the guests, but most people just wanted to go straight to cocktails in the courtyard.  But it was a nice atmosphere and made for fantastic photographs of the bridal party.  The guests all had a great time too.  Totally contact them if you're looking for a totally artsy wedding!
