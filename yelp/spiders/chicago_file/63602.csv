Smoque BBQ////The food here is pretty delicious.  I really enjoyed the BBQ beans.  It has a delicious smoky flavor.  YUMMO!  The Baby Back Ribs were also scrumptious.  If you like a meatier cut, get the St. Louis.  The Brisket was just okay.  To me, it looked more appetizing that how it tasted.  The BBQ sauce had too much of a vinegar flavor for my taste.
