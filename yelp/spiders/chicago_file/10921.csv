Art Institute of Chicago////This is one of Chicago's most iconic landmarks! Admission here comes at a steep price, but they offer multiple discounts as well as free days. You really get what you pay for here, as the museum is absolutely gorgeous, and the art is created by the most talented artists in the world. To my knowledge, the modern wing changes every few weeks, but some exhibits stay constant. My personal favorite, White Crucifix, has been there every time I visited. I can go on and on about this place, plan to spend an entire afternoon here!
