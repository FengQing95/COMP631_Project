Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is one of the best steakhouses I've ever been to. The service was top notch from the moment I walked in. I made a reservation a few days in advance, so I was able to snag a high top bar table for one. I ordered a whiskey sour with egg white, and the cocktail was great. I normally don't get too excited over bread, but the housemade sourdough and salted butter is divine. "Don't fill up on it though" is what I had to remind myself over and over again. For my main course, I ordered the 22 ounce 42-day dry aged bone-in ribeye and a side of buttery mashed potatoes. The steak came out cooked perfectly. The charred outside gave way to the most tender, soft medium rare deliciousness. The mashed potatoes were heavenly. If I had to pick my last meal, this would be it. The ambience of the restaurant is so swanky and cool. The dimly lit steakhouse feels more like a speakeasy. While I dined alone, this would be the perfect date night spot that would certainly impress.
