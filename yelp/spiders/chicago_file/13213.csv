Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My husband and I enjoyed the pizza, but we wish it had a little bit more cheese to it. Â The place was a bit crowded and at one point I wanted to scold a little girl who you could tell would be "high maintenance" when puberty hit. I would definitely eat here again, but I prefer Giordano's.
