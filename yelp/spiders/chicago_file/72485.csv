Little Goat Diner////Came here on a Saturday around 1PM. The hostess said the wait would be around 40-45 minutes or we could sit at the bar (first come, first serve). We decided to just wait since the bar was full and it didn't seem like anyone was leaving soon. While waiting, we tried to order a drink at the bar but the bartender just ignored us for a good 10 minutes. I understand that it was pretty busy, but a simple acknowledgement would have gone a long way so we wouldn't just be awkwardly standing there trying to make eye contact with him. Someone else finally gave us the drink menus. I tried the Eastwood's ride and it was pretty good and refreshing.
