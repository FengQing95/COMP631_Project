Little Goat Diner////Not being a meat-eater, I asked the waitress for some non-meat options that were popular. She suggested a variety, and told me the Fish Tostadas were her favorite, so that's what I ordered. When they arrived they looked so fancy I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to eat them without making a mess, but actually it went fairly well. The vinaigrette they used on the tostadas was fantastic! I'm not hugely into fish, but these were great!
