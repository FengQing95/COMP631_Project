Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's knocked it out of the park with their classic deep dish pizza. The crust was crisp and tasted great.  The sauce was light, which let the rest of the pizza ingredients shine.   The sausage was really flavorful & the cheese was thick and stringy. And it wasn't "heavy", which is shows they really know how to provide a flavorful dish.
