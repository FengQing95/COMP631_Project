Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////they do make a very good pizza..  i would say give it a go but for instance.. 2 medium pizza and a really really good garbage salad ( try that out ) 60 bucks.. Chicago is a big city and such but man it would  feel great if that was 48 bucks .. I guess ya just get over it.. it's a must stop regardless .. the pizza did feed 5 people light eaters  so I suppose 12 per person is pretty good.. it's one of the best for sure
