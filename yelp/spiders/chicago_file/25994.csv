Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Wrong Pizza comes not cold but not too far from it, with an explanation that waitress didn't hear us well, Â we had to take it due to wait time or wait another 45 min for a different pizza. Asked for forks for a different dish I ordered since pizza came with things I don't eat and waitress forgot about it so we shared forks.
