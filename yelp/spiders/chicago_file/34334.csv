Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Upon, seating, our server Eric was great.  He had the timing and personality that exuded comedian, knew the menu very well, was forthcoming with key information about kitchen closings, and treated us well.  He should be applauded and rewarded for turning our experience around.
