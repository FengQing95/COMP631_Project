Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our waiter was very very attentive, unfortunately, I can't remember his name but he had a foreign accent. Â We placed our order, and I told my boyfriend to get the Brussels sprouts because I wanted to try them, but he opted into getting broccoli instead, which was fine. I was a little bummed, but got over it. After all, I did have a whole rib eye coming with mashed potatoes :)
