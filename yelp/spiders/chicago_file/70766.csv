Little Goat Diner////Came on here after a night of drinking to grab some food. Ordered the chili cheese fries as an appetizer for the table and people liked it. It was pretty good, no complaints with it. I settled on the pork belly pancake. It was good, but it had way too much slaw and not enough pork belly for my liking. One of my friends got the fat elvis which was pretty good, and thankfully I was able to eat some of hers. I finished up with the choco taco which was pretty disappointing. It was a deconstructed dish, the chocolate fudge was frozen on the bottom of the dish and hard to get up. Then it was topped with 3 or so homemade frito's essentially. Not bad, but nothing I'd get again.. I'd really give this place 3.5 but thought it was better than 3 so it gets the 4, but not by much.
