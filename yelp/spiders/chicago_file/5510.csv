The Purple Pig////Their menu is expansive and rotates. But I usually start the meal with a satisfying cheese plate. Their dips are surprisingly largely portioned, accompanied with big pieces of buttery toast. But save room for their inventive dishes like fried pig's ear, sweetbreads, and house-made pasta with ground fish. Yes, those sound like totally random and possibly unappealing words but I assure you the dishes are packed with close-your-eyes-and-shake-your-head heavenly flavor. If you catch their meatballs on the menu, give those a shot too. I'm so sad those balls aren't in my mouth right now!!
