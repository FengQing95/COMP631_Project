Little Goat Diner////I am embarrassed to say we "settled" on this place as a backup plan because there was nothing  to second guess about it.  At the height of the lunch rush, our hostess was pleasant without being bothered by the same old questions.  It was at least a 30 minute wait but that was to be expected.  We lucked out and  scored a bar seat when ordering drinks.  The bartenders were so nice to talk to about baseball, beer, you name it, they engaged in conversation and I liked that!  The Vandermill cider was so delicious-clear, crisp and not too sweet.
