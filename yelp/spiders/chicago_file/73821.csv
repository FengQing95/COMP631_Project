Little Goat Diner////They text us when our table was ready and we had our choice of inside or outside, bonus! Server was able to speak to the menu options and give us some recommendations. We started with the fried pickles and onion rings. These were really more like tempura than fried pickles and I mean that in the very best way possible. The curry mustard dipping sauce was nothing less than inspired! Off to a great start....then I ordered the pork belly pancake and went splitsies with my friend who ordered the Los Drowned.
