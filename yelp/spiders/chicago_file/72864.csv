Little Goat Diner////Goat Almighty: 3.5/5 -- A tall goat burger with beef, onion rings, cheese, and more. Definitely never had anything like this before. I understand that I should expect fattiness and richness when it comes to an order called the "Goat Almighty," but I nevertheless expected more flavorful and appetizing ingredients.
