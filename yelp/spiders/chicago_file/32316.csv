Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had a The Lou as a deep dish pizza. It took about 30 minutes for the pizza to arrive at our table since they claim to make their pizzas from scratch. The pizza itself was over hyped: A ton of dough, small amount of meat, and an excess of tomato sauce. The chicken wings we ordered were better than the actual pizza. But that and the sauces were too salty.
