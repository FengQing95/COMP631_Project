Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went to Bavette's and it was my first time there. Very hard to get a reservation, but worth waiting for availability. We ordered the baked crab cake, bone marrow, ribeye Chicago cut, beef stroganoff, truffle Mac and cheese and creamer spinach. I love majority of we ordered, and we ordered a lot so we can try different things on the menu. Service was excellent; friendly server and someone was always paying attention to our table. The only reason I took one star is because I didn't like everything we ate. Bone marrow was incredible, they give you 4 of them and so delicious. Crab cake was great as well, it had lots of crab meat and moist. The steak was perfect in temperature and the Mac and cheese was great as well. The ones I didn't like were the creamer spinach, it was very salty for my taste, and my entree beef stroganoff. I didn't like the flavor at all, I don't even know how to describe it. It had a bitter flavor to it. I took 2 bites of it and I couldn't eat anymore. Good thing I enjoyed everything else we ate. I still highly recommend this restaurant and I would go back to try other things in the menu.
