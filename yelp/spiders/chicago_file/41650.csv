Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I really loved the tapas at Ba Ba Reeba.  I thought the salmon and escargot were the best.  Good place if you love seafood and paella.  I've had the chicken kebob type thing too and that was really good but I thought the way it was served was interesting and weird but oh well.  I would definitely recommend it to people who want to go somewhere trendy for Spanish style food and that neighborhood has some good bars too for late night if you want to go out and have some drinks after dinner.  The waiter was friendly and it didn't take too long to get a table and I didn't think they were overly pricey either.  Love it!
