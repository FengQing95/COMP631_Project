Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had two of the chicken empanadas, mushroom empanadas, spicy potatoes, goat cheese, octopus, short rib, market vegetables (from the specials menu)... and some other meat I don't remember. Everything was fantastic. The flavor was right, the portions were right. It was incredible.
