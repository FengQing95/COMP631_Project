Smoque BBQ////I ordered the sliced brisket platter with fries and mac n cheese. AMAZING. The brisket just absolutely melts in your mouth, easily the best brisket I've had in Chicago. They give you a Carolina style sauce and Memphis style sauce with the brisket. Both were really, really good. Their version of Carolina style isn't as vinegar-y as I've had in the past. Mac n cheese was like a little baked casserole...delicious. Fries were very tasty too and they give you a huge bag of them.
