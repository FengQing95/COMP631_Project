Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I think Lou malnati's is the best deep dish pizza in chicago.  The crust is buttery and melts in your mouth.  The classic pizza with sausage, mushroom, and pepperoni was very good--the salad with the house dressing was very good as well.  This is not the meal to have if you are watching your calorie intake, but every now and then it is an excellent choice for pizza.  Oh, and if you need gluten free or a lighter veggie pizza, they have that too.
