Smoque BBQ////I make it a point to try brisket at every bbq restaurant I go to.  When I heard brisket was a must-have at Smoque, I was excited but cautious.  Would it live up to expectation?  That's a lot of pressure for a meat to have.  But it definitely lived up to the hype.  Amazing, melt-in-your mouth, delicious sliced brisket.
