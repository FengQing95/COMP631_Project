Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Great place! Just went there today for some carryout. We had the blueberry pancakes, strawberry crepes, and eggs/hashbrowns plate. The fruit was very fresh and everything was delicious!! Reasonably priced too, especially considering the area. I'm so excited about this place now and will definitely be going back.
