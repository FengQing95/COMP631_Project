Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love this place!  Took my family here when they visited, and our waiter was super friendly and attentive.  After mentioning that we were first-time guests, the waiter brought us a few complimentary dessert tapas to try.  I've been back one time since the initial visit, and it was again very delicious.  There are great-tasting tapas for both the adventurous and non-adventurous.  I recommend this restaurant to any size group for an affordable and classy meal.
