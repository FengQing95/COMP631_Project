Art Institute of Chicago////Wonderful art museum right on Michigan Avenue. Very convenient to get to, lots of floors and exhibits that could take someone a week if they wanted to truly appreciate all it has to offer. I would say it's like a maze in there with multiple floors, twists and turns, but that's part of the fun.
