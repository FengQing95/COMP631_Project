Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Going off of that, we placed our order (a simple large deep dish cheese pizza) and decided to go for a short walk in the immediate vicinity since it was our first night in town, it maybe took us about ten minutes. We hadn't received a text yet but decided to head back anyway. We got back and waited an additional twenty. At this point we figured it wouldn't hurt to ask if the wait time had increased. They said they called us for our table already. Huh!? They told us they would *text* us. Not too big a deal, they sat us at the next table for two, but if we hadn't asked we probably would have been waiting in the dark for a lot longer. Poor communication on their part.
