Little Goat Diner////This restaurant is one of my top brunch spots in West Loop and even downtown Chicago. The menu is overwhelming with options. Always difficult to choose breakfast or lunch, so I recommend ordering a few plates for the table to share. You can't go wrong with any of the options - there is something for everyone at this restaurant. Make sure to save room for the cake of the day. Enjoy!
