The Purple Pig////- Half duck: WOW, this was SO good. You get a little bit of the gamey duck taste but it is so mellow and fits so well with the greek yogurt, it's kind of sinful. Makes you almost think you can never eat chicken again because this is the superior poultry. I would highly recommend getting this! Side note: this came with brioche buns but honestly if this came with soft baozi it would truly elevate this dish. However, this is not an Asian restaurant -- I get it. But think about it, will you, Purple Pig?
