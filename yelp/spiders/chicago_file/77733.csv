Little Goat Diner////There's also lots of sliced strawberries.  Okay now doesn't all that sound good?! Now it would have if it wasn't all mashed up together.  So here we have a thick cut of brioche that is French toast but I also has an egg in it like Eggy in a Basket.  Sounds good right? However since everything in this dish is drenched in Maple Syrup (didn't really taste any BBQ flavor), the egg tasted like weird solid custard.  Nope. The pieces of crispy chicken (white meat) was good but it was just so drowned in syrup that it made it overly sweet and not crunchy any longer. I was only able to have a few bites and had to call it quites. This dish was overkill.
