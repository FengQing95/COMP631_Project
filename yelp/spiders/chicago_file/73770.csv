Little Goat Diner////Unfortunately there was a hair in my scallion pancake... the server took it away but somehow I still ended up paying for it. I didn't order a replacement or any more food for that matter. I sat there with the rest of my party and just drank a cocktail. My server was sweet and the drink was balanced. Such a shame about the food. Guess they want to really live up to that diner reputation.
