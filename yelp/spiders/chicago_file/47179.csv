Smoque BBQ////As a Native of Austin, Texas, and granddaughter of a Texas Cattle Rancher, I shed a tear following the my first bite into a Smoque BBQ sandwich.  It was love at first bite.  The love fest continued with the mac & cheese, fries, cole slaw, chili and cobbler.  Going here always reminds me of home.
