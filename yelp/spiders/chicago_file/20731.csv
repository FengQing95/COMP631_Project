Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza took about 30 minutes to arrive which is normal since it's a deep dish pizza and they are PACKED! I wasn't that hungry when I went but hell I had to have more than one slice -- the first bite sold me and I kept going. My friends and I got the Lou pizza which is the most original I guess, but there nothing simple about it! The cheese melted in my mouth so perfectly and it wasn't so hot (like you usually get) that you can't eat it right away.
