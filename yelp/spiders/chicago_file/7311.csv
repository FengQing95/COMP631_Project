Art Institute of Chicago////World class, something new to discover every time you go back! It's a place to explore, get lost, learn, and get immersed in beauty. I would love to see them update their audio device technology. It would be really cool if the institute could put the audio on one of it's apps and you could purchase them through your phone. It seems a little archaic to use the old germ ridden listening devices.
