Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Drink: we stuck to the cocktail list and for $12-13 a pop, I was impressed with the tastiness, size, and strength of the drink.  If you are anyway inclined to have a drink here, do it, you will not be disappointed.  I had a French 75 and another champagne cocktail and hubby had two whiskey ones.
