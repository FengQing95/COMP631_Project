Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bone in filet with an add on bone marrow - steak was PERFECT! Cooked just right and so tender. The steak was seasoned perfectly and did not need any additional sauces. The bone marrow was also pretty good and I'm not the type to eat this. My wife killed it and only gave me a small bite.
