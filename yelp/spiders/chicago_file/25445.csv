Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////4. Finally - just understand that cardboard likes buttercrust and because of that you will not have that firm crust as crispy as if you have it in the restaurant. Â But on those cold winter nights - if you invest a little "rehabilitation" and some safe harbor by taking your UNCUT pizza out of the box and giving it some PCR (Pizza Crust Recrisping)...it doesn't get any better than Lou's for deep dish.
