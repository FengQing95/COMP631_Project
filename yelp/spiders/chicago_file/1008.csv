Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wildberry was a great place.  I went here with a friend when I was visiting Chicago.  We went on a Wednesday morning at 10 am.  It was so busy that we had to wait for 30 minutes for a table.  The food was very good.  I will be back.  I am not normally a pancake fan but the pancakes were great.
