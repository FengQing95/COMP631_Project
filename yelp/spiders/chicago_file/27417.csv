Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They've got their service mostly figured out.  Don't be deterred by the long line up front.  You can put your name in and order your pizza immediately.  Lou's will text you when your table is ready.  Just don't be farther than 5 minutes away.  We smashed some margaritas and chips with salsas at Pink Taco next door.  Don't judge us, we were on a foodie weekend.  We got the call and dashed to get our seat.
