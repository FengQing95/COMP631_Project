Little Goat Diner////After looking forward to eating here for quite some time, we left pretty disappointed. We had our two children with us and opted for the Little Goat over Girl & the Goat...and should have just opted for something else all together. We had reservations and did not have to wait for a table, which was nice. Our waitress was a bit impatient, asking us for a drink order before she shared the drink menu with us and later asking for our dinner order long before anyone would have had a chance to review the menu (and before she even brought the then-ordered drinks.) For our entire meal, we got the very distinct impression that she was ready to turn our table and get another one in...which is understandable, but few meals are enjoyed when you are being rushed.
