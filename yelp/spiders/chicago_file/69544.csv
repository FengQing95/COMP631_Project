Little Goat Diner////Our server was very pleasant, but straight to the point.  He made no bones about what he recommended... and he said it with such authority, that it was hard not to order much of what he suggested.  We started with the pickled onion rings, which were fantastic.  We then moved to the Boo Boo Baise (mussels, shrimp and whitefish). This was decent, but not sure I would get it again.  We then had the hot crab dip with ritz crackers. We loved this!  We had the goat sloppy joe as well, which tasted like the goat and girl and the goat.  Tasty!  We also had the trout, which was fine.  We ended it with a meringue pie, which was a perfect cap!
