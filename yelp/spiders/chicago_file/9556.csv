Art Institute of Chicago////On top of everything else that they do, what a great service that is.  Among the array of everything which they have to offer, that's really just another feather in their cap, but I am impressed nevertheless.  I strenuously recommend the Art Institute to visitors as the #1 museum or attraction to see during their stay.  A true Chicago treasure.
