Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////But yeah, the food is fine. I'm not slamming it, it's just hard for me to think of it as an actual restaurant option when the only times I've been there have been for bachelorette parties, birthday parties, entertaining family, etc. and everyone else appears to be in the same boat.
