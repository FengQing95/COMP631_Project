Smoque BBQ////There's something about their secret BBQ sauce or cooking style that makes everything here so good. I was a little afraid of bringing a vegetarian friend along, but they do have some veggie options. It would be nice to see more though. Their mac & cheese is delicious... And the peach cobbler is to die for, yum. :) I've been going here forever, since it's right around the block from where I live. It never disappoints. So glad they decided to open in Old Irving. I'd like to check out their patio sometime.
