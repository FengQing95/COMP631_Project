Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My boyfriend and I came here for our 3 year anniversary, and I highly recommend it for a special occasion. Absolutely everything we ordered was delicious, the service was very good, and the overall experience and ambiance were also very nice. Specifically, I recommend the champagne smash cocktail: probably one of my favorite cocktails I've had. It was very refreshing and had good flavor, while not being overly sweet. I'm not a big steak person, and so we had the baked crab cake for appetizer and I ordered the salmon au poivre, which were both amazing. My boyfriend got a steak and loved it, also. We got brussels sprouts and fries for sides, and the chocolate cream pie for dessert - all really great, probably not one thing bad I could say about any of them, to be honest. This was probably one of our favorite meals we've had!
