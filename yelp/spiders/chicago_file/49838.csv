Smoque BBQ////I had high hopes for this place. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't impressed either. The baked beans where awesome and the mac N' cheese was great too. I tried the beef brisket and it was tender (burnt on the outside, but didn't taste burnt), but just lacked flavor. The BBQ it came with was weak and just about any famous dave's sauce would beat it (not saying Famous Dave's sauce is that amazing either, but it's at least something to compare too). The sauce was sweet but that's it. I also had the Texas sausage, which was good and had decent flavor. Prices were very reasonable and the environment is great. Everyone was friendly and it seems like a well oiled machine. I would definitely eat here again, but it I wouldn't go out of my way and would probably try different meats.
