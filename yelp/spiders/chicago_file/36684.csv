Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I ordered a glass of red wine and he ordered a Manhattan, both of which were great. To start, we had the crab cake. It was meaty without a ton of bread filling and had a wonderful crab flavor. For dinner, I ordered the filet mignon and my husband ordered the dry-aged ribeye (hey, we were celebrating). The time between our appetizer and steaks was unfortunately very long. Our steaks arrived, and mine was completely overdone, but luckily the ribeye was cooked perfectly. A manager actually came over right after we got them to apologize for the wait, and we told her about mine being overcooked. She apologized and took it back immediately. I ran to use the bathroom quickly and by the time I got back a new, perfectly cooked filet mignon was waiting for me. And it was delicious. Our waiter was very apologetic despite them providing me with a perfect new steak, and came over with another glass of wine on the house. We didn't have any room for dessert, but our waiter came over again with a complimentary slice of their chocolate cream pie, and I'm so glad he did. It. Was. Amazing. It was perfectly chocolatey and not too sweet with a dollop of fresh whipped cream. We thought it was so nice of him to offer the free wine and dessert, but when we got our check, he comped my entire steak as well. This was completely unnecessary but is a reflection of the wonderful service at Bavette's. Is it possible to have a crush on a restaurant? Because I had butterflies when I left. I can't wait to visit Bavette's again soon.
