Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were seated quickly which was nice considering how busy they were. The waitress was polite but entirely helpful when explaining dishes. We had personal deep dish pizzas, and they were good. The crust is interesting--not a typical dough. It is a boisterous atmosphere, so don't expect a quiet meal.
