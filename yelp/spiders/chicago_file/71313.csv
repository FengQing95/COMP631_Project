Little Goat Diner////Fantastic food and even better service.  The mixologists know what they're doing--so some of the mixed drinks are really stellar.  But more importantly, they know what they're talking about on the different boozes.  The food is outstanding and worth the trip.  The pork in green sauce, the short rib in asian slaw, and the white fish were all highlights.
