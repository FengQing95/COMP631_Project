Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Price for this blowout? About $250 and worth every penny. I never spend that kind of dough but in this case, no regrets. We didn't get dessert or coffee because we were literally too stuffed. We told our waiter it was one of the best meals we'd had. (By coincidence, he went to school in Boston so we chatted about that). Anyway - GO!
