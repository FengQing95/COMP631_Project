Smoque BBQ////I came here yesterday, in the mood for barbecue. I read reviews about it and thought since I was nearby it would be a good place to stop by. I picked up a friend and even with the weather the place was really busy-I think there was a large party so it threw off the usual tuesday night place. Anyways, my friend and I ordered-she had already eaten but humored me and ordered the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich (pulled pork and brisket) and I got the platter with 1/2 chopped brisket and 1/2 sliced brisket mac and cheese and corn bread. I have to say I wasn't too impressed with the place. The meat was good enough but I thought it weak sauce-literally. The extra they provided wasn't enough. I thought the portion size was pretty small too-we sat next to a small Asian woman who had two plates in front of her and she almost finished both. Not only was I still hungry but still in the mood for barbecue so I asked my friend if she wanted to go to Smoke daddy. Which we did, flip over to Smoke Daddy's page for a continuation of my adventures in Barbecue
