Little Goat Diner////Kimchee + reuben + cheesy hash browns + great service = one happy Korean customer.  This is the first restaurant kimchee that I've had and truly enjoyed!  It was busy but the service was great; we were seated with no wait, the food arrived in a timely fashion and everything we tried was delicious!  Only complaint was the noise level, which seems to be a design flaw.  Otherwise, great experience!
