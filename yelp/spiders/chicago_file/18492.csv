Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They don't take reservations, you just show up and they put your name on the waiting list (average wait was 1hr and 15 mins) and order your pizza ahead of time. Â  We ordered a small sausage deep dish. I thought they had more toppings but nope just pepperoni, sausage or veggie.
