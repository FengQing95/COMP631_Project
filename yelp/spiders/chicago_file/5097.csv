The Purple Pig////The food here was absolutely amazing. We ordered the crispy pig ears, pork shoulder, manchego cheese, cuttlefish, and the recommended ricotta/chocolate stuffed dessert. Everything was great, but the cuttlefish and manchego definitely stood out with unique flavors that just came together so well.
