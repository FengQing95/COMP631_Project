Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Black Label Meat Loaf with Mushroom Jus, Mashed Potatoes:  Erika's main course - or at least half of it as the rest went home to her roommate - this blend of beef and porkbelly certainly isn't mom's meatloaf, but no matter what nostalgia you have for childhood memories this is a damned good meatloaf, particularly when paired with chunky Yukon gold mash, whole roasted mushrooms, and a gravy of pan jus, woodsy mushrooms, and balsamic vinegar adding just enough sweetness to temper the fat.  Listed as a meatloaf but very low on filler and more like the sorts of terrines served on French bistro menus this was another hefty dish that could most certainly be shared as an entrée by most couples.
