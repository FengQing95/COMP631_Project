Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We liked this place so much we went twice this past week. Delicious warm sourdough bread served with perfectly spreadable sweet butter is placed on the table soon after you are seated. The steaks are perfectly prepared, flavorful-no sauce required. The side dishes are stellar, particularly the caramelized sweet potatoes, charred  brusselsprouts and the sautéed mushrooms. And don't miss the shrimp cold platter-fresh, sweet with a dollop of the horseradish infused home made cocktail sauce. Servings are huge, so sharing family style is the best option.
