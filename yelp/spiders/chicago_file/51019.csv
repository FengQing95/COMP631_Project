Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Service was friendly, fast and knowledgeable. Our server recommended the Juan Gil red wine for me and I absolutely fell in love with it. The hostesses were also very helpful, and speaking of that - get a reservation or call-ahead! Â The waitlist is often two hours long, but you can get your name in early; they start making their list at 6pm.
