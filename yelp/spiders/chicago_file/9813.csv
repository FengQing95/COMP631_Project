Art Institute of Chicago////Couldn't take an earlier flight home, so I enjoyed a beautiful summer day walking Michigan Ave playing in the park and going to the museum. Completely spontaneous day of fun! Too bad I could only spend about 1.5 hrs touring the museum. Had to rush to see about half of the exhibits but it was sooo worth it!
