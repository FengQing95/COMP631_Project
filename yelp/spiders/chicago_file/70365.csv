Little Goat Diner////We were at the restaurant Monday evening - October 17th.  Everything we ordered was salty.  I sent back the smoked fries, the top part was ok, the bottom half of the bowl was still salty.  We ordered the pork belly pancake, the smoked corned beef hash, goat burger, brussel sprouts and biscuit and gravy.  All four of us in the party agree all were on the salty side.  My husband had the bibimbop which was ok.  My son had been here before and he agreed he had better food from last time.
