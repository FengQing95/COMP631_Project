Little Goat Diner////I want to start by saying I've eaten at Little Goat Diner a lot. The food always wows and it is, by far, my favorite brunch place. The staff is always so courteous. It really feels like they all enjoy working there which adds so much to a dining experience. I really enjoy the Bloody Marys because the kimchi adds an extra little kick that is always so refreshing! Today, we came for brunch and our experience food wise was no different. The sweet/tang in This Little Piggy Went to China is such a different and wonderful take on traditional biscuits and gravy.
