Little Goat Diner////I went here looking for a fairly ordinary breakfast, and that was probably my mistake.  This is an upscale "diner" that operates differently than a regular breakfast place.  The food was interesting and delicious, but a little more pretentious than I needed at that hour. For later in the day, I'll bet it's wonderful.
