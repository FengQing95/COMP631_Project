Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////That out of the way, Lou Malnati's is pretty good. Nice location in River North, a little bar combined with a modestly sized dining room complete with wood paneling and booths on the first floor, and make sure you show up early. We aimed for only a modestly early dinner and had only a few minutes' wait for our group, which was good because we were able to put our order in ahead of time.
