Art Institute of Chicago////One thing that I did like was how the map showed us the most important art pieces to see if we only had a short amount of time, which was what I had. I got to find all the important things. Also, there were a lot of speakers on hand that day to talk to the visitors and the children about certain art pieces. It was really nice to listen and hear all this extra information you can't find on the placard. I also liked the staircase with the lighted text. It was the first time I ever saw anything like that.
