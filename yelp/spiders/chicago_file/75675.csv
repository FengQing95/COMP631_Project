Little Goat Diner////I was really looking forward to dining here after reading all of the wonderful reviews, but was sadly disappointed by the quality of the food here. We came here since the wait time for Au Cheval was so long and the wait time here wasn't too bad at all. I put my name in and only had to wait for around 45 minutes for a table on a Monday night. We ended up getting a table outside since we didn't have a reservation for a table inside which was fine. Our waiter quickly came to get our drink order and went over the menu with us. They pride themselves on their breakfast/brunch items which is served all day.
