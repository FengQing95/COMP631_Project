Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! catered for our wedding reception. The food was so delicious that the guests are still talking about it, and the staff was very professional, personable, helpful and prompt. But what truly stood out was Alison, who was the event planner. She went above and beyond to provide any special request we had, and was always quick to respond to all our questions. We truly appreciate all of her efforts in making our vision for the wedding become reality.
