Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If you're planning to go for brunch, I'd definitely recommend making a reservation in advance. We popped in on a whim to discover that the only tables that they keep available for walk-ins are around the bar. We were lucky to snag a small table soon after we arrived, but it definitely fills up fast.
