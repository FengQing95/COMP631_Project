Little Goat Diner////I really enjoyed my first experience eating a wonderful breakfast bat Little Billy Goat! The staff was gracious to this new customer. I needed a good meal after fasting for over 12 hours for an appointment. The food was tasty, filling, and good. If I would have had my coffee refilled consistently, then there would be 5-stars on the board. Anyway, I know that I'll be returning for another good experience!
