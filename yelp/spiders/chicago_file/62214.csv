Smoque BBQ////BBQ is one of my favorite activities and foods--I try it all over the country (frequently in the deep South, but also Texas, Nashville, etc.), so I I wonder if people over rate this place because of it's hole-in-the-wall appeal (under a train track, by the highway, $9.95 spent on the interior decor, etc.)? Â I tried the brisket and the pulled pork and was underwhelmed by both.
