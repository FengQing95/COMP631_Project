Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After seeing Lou Malnati's "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" with Chef Ann, my husband and I had to try when we came to Chicago.  We ordered a large pepperoni, mushroom and sausage, thin crust and the first surprise was the price.  We thought, well, must be Chicago prices...$36.  Since it was going to take about 30 minutes, we had a drink at the bar.  First impression was the place was not very clean.  The servers seemed more into their personal conversations than helping the guests.  We finally got our pizza after 50 minutes and the restaurant was not that busy.  For $36, we were extremely disappointed.  Sauce was bland and crust tasted frozen.  There are much better places in Chicago than Lou Malnati's.  We will not be back.
