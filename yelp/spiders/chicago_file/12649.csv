Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had really high hopes because Lou Malnati's came highly recommended by quite a few folks who've lived in Chicago for quite some time. We were not impressed. There was nothing spectacular about it and lets say it was forgettable. The pizza was "deep dish" because it was cooked in a deep dish but the bottom was a mushy mess. The tomatoes, sausage, and cheese were just tomatoes, sausage, and cheese nothing special about the ingredients. I think i can make this at home in a deep dish too.
