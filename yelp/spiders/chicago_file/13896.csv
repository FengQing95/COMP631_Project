Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I took my brother and his girlfriend to Lou's and I expected more. The wait went on forever...first to get a table - 15 minutes longer than quoted - then to get the pizza that was preordered - 40 minutes after being seated - and lastly to get the check. Apparently the restaurant was having issues with the credit card machine and the waiter kept stopping by to say, "still working on it". Finally I asked to speak to the manager, but I was told he's busy. Eventually we said we are leaving (we arrived around 7pm and it was 10:30 at this point) and he asked if he could write down my credit card to run it later. I agreed and headed out frustrated that I had to give my personal information (on a napkin) to someone I didn't know. This morning I woke up to see that the charge to my card included a 20% tip...hummmm...apparently they just tip themselves for the inconvenience they caused. I expected the manager to comp the entire meal initially, but agreed to pay when I left. I did NOT, however agree to tip the waiter for what I felt was a poor dining experience (whether it was his fault or not).
