Art Institute of Chicago////Since I have seen much of the main collection before, and Sunday afternoons are especially teeming with tourists, I chose to check out the great collection of paper weights in the lower level. It's easy to find, it's in gallery 69, dudes! The art of the paper weight predates to the Egyptians and was perfected by the French. Mais, oui! There's a nice little case showing each step of the process. Who uses paper weights these days? Who even uses paper? I liked the colorful depictions of flowers and snakes. It's kind of like the coral reef of the Art Institute, deep below the surface lie beautiful things!
