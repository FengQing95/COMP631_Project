Smoque BBQ////The food arrived, by one of the most helpful guys ever. The food tasted and looked great (the guests loved it) but I can't tell you how much food was wasted. We had two and half extra pans of pulled pork that went uneaten. We had three bags of buns that were never opened. And we had one extra container of slaw. I'd say, about $150 worth of extra food that didn't need to be there. Peggy upsold me and I wished she would have just respected my original order instead of using my uncertainty to bring in more revenue.
