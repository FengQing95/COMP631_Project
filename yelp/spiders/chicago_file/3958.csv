The Purple Pig////Food: The service was a bit rushed, but understandably so since they were literally closing in 25 minutes haha. My goal was to not order anything that we already ordered the last time we were here, which was difficult since we damn near ordered the entire menu last time. Under pressure, we just shot from the hip and ordered some random items, which turned out to be great.
