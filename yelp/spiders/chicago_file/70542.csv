Little Goat Diner////Never thought I'd write anything negative about one of my favourites, and I will always love you Stephanie - for your non-pretentious culinary genius, because I always see you walking around your restaurant/s like a mortal, for always surprising me with something I've never tasted before, for injecting a sense of true euphoria into the ritual of food with friends - so please don't be bummed if you (actually) read this review. Everyone has a bad day, even those who are truly great.
