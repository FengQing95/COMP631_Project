Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For our main dishes we decided to get 3 more items and share them as well. We got the prime beef sandwich with a side of Au jus which was one of the best I've ever had, the meatball with linguini. This meatball was a mixture of 3 meats and was out of this world tasty. Lastly we had the fried chicken which was great as well.
