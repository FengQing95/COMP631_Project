Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Why this restaurant doesn't have all 5 stars with 800+ reviews is beyond me.  The BEST STEAK RESTAURANT I have ever eaten.  I have made it a point to eat at every steak restaurant in and around downtown Chicago and I go to new ones as they pop up.  I have also eaten at many top steak restaurants around the country.  Bavette's stands far above the rest.
