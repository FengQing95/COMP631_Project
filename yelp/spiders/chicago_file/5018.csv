The Purple Pig////After switching to glasses of wine we ordered the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder. Dear sweet baby Jesus is this fantastic. The pork was preposterously tender - we barely touched it and it fell apart. Had it been more socially acceptable, I would have licked the plate. Utter perfection.
