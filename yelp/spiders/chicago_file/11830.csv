Art Institute of Chicago////My husband and I luckily had the city pass on us so went into the museum instead of waiting in the purchase line and queued for a much shorter line to get our passes scanned. If you decide to do coat check, it will cost $1 per item. They do not allow any bags in the museum so will make you check any bags.
