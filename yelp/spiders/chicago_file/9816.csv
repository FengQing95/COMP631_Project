Art Institute of Chicago////i was so bored. That is on me, i am not a museum person. However, the lack of stars here is not because of that. The lack of stars if because the staff is just plain rude. SO MUCH ATTITUDE. First ticketing booth, YOU ARE NOT THAT SPECIAL TO CHOOSE TO IGNORE MY QUESTIONS AND JUST SHOUT "NEXT" TO MY FACE. Two coat check........yes, my umbrella is wet...BECAUSE IT IS F*CKING RAINING OUTSIDE YOU TW*P. :) that is how i feel about this place. i hope you guys revamp you mean staff. security guards were ok so i gave another star to the one i originally gave.
