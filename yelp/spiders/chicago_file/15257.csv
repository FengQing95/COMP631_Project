Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Over the many years visiting Chicago for biz, etc. , I have always tried different pizza joints. But this is definitely one of my favorites. Their deep dish pizza is superior in quality over others I have tried. The service was very good compared to others. They rave about the sausage which I believe is one of their claims to fame. I agree it was very delectable.
