Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Stopped by yesterday around 530 for a quick bite. Surprisingly there was no wait time. Out server was super awesome. He kept checking on us and made jokes here and there. I asked for two oranges in my blue moon and that was the running joke for the night. It made dinner just a little more interesting.
