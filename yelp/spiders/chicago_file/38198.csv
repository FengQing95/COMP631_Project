Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Easily my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Service is 5 star - I've never felt rushed and the meals are perfectly paced. We always get the shrimp cocktail or the sizzling scampi for an appetizer. For my main i usually get the bone in filet, which is the best steak I've ever had. All sides are good esp the Brussel sprouts and the Mac and cheese. The Bread is hot and homemade. My only (small) complaint is that it is a bit salty.
