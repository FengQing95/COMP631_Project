The Purple Pig////Wasn't sure if this place was a tourist trap or actually had legit food! Stopped in on a Monday afternoon around 3 pm. It was bustling with tourists but we were able to be seated right away with a party of two. We went for a few of the yelp highlights: bone marrow, octopus and pork shoulder. The food did not disappoint!! The bone marrow was a generous portion with a side of perfectly toasted bread, herbs and capers and salt. They even provided us with extra bread after we ran out!
