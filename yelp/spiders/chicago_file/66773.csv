Little Goat Diner////Nom Nom Nom. Little Goat is just my style.  It's a laid-back atmosphere, and prices are pretty darn reasonable for such a highly rated restaurant right in the middle of Restaurant Row.  And not to mention, the food is phenomenal.  I come here every chance I get, although I will say if you're trying to get a large party of people in, good luck..
