Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Solid brunch spot and a well-oiled machine when it comes to service, so I understand why people are willing to wait so long for this place. We waited about 30 minutes and our server was super nice and on top of things.  They seem very used to handling a constant flow of people.  I got the Butcher Block skillet which is basically just a lot of meat and 2 eggs in a skillet with some hashbrowns at the bottom.  People I know rave about the portions, which I think is for the pancakes.  The skillet was well portioned but not an "oh my god that's so much brunch going on!" kind of portion.  The skillet was fine, but actually nothing special in terms of flavor.  A friend was gluten-free and got a kick out of eating specialty gluten-free pancakes, so it made the trip worth it for her dietary restriction, but my food was "just fine."
