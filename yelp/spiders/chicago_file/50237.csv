Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The check comes and the number really smacks you in the face - $300. But then you realize that halfway through the meal you were about ready to burst. (I still don't understand why the majority of women there are wearing skinny jeans. I strongly urge you to wear a stretchy dress or pants with lots of elastic.) We had 11 people and picked up the slack on the birthday girl. They automatically added 18% gratuity, which saves me money since I typically do 20% but only do 18% to spite them when they hit me with mandatory gratuity. It came to exactly $30 per person. If I'd gone anywhere else I probably would have expected to pay that much for the sangria alone, so I think I got a great deal. I'm definitely coming here for my birthday!
