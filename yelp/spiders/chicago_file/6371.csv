The Purple Pig////I've waited a along time to come here, it's never seemed to work out with my schedule when i have been in chicago.  I was definitely not disappointed.  the staff was attentive but not overbearing.  I ordered several of the recommendations of the waiter.  the squid ink pasta was very good, the hanger steak was excellent, and i'd absolutely recommend the beets.  Can't wait to return here.
