Little Goat Diner////Have you ever been so hungry but actually stopped to smell your food before you ate it?  I never had but at the Little goat did it before every bite.  It smelled so good and tasted even better.   The cross between a dinner and a high end restaurant is genius. The prices for the quality of food is a steal.  The staff was super friendly.  Recommendations on food: Ruben, Sloppy Goat, and Fries (seriously you will just love smelling them).  Go with a friend and split a shake for dessert, recommend the apple caramel.  I am drooling about going back but I live out of town.
