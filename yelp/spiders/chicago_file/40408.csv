Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Amazing!!  Celebrated my anniversary here recently and I must say I think this is by far the best food I have ever had in my life! My husband reserved seating in the Parlour and it was nothing short of amazing.  The Parlour is the lower level, intimate seating, lowered lights and nice music. Totally contrast to the upper level. Everything from start to finish was just wonderful.  Our waiter was very attentive and offered great suggestions. We had so much food and nothing fell short. Definitely a very special place for a special occasion.
