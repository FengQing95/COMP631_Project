Little Goat Diner////On Saturday, my friend and I were famished from early morning volunteer work and we decided to go to Little Goat. I've trying to dine here on a weekend for the past two months but there was always a line outside AND I understand why. The food was mouth watering: Bullseye French Toast and Cornbeef Hash were THE BEST! The cocktails were great too, especially "smoke on the water" (if you're not a drinker -beware) lol......Conclusion, I love the place and will recommend to all.
