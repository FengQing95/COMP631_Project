Smoque BBQ////I ordered the sliced brisket platter, which comes with color slaw and 2 sides, as well as 2 dipping sauces. The brisket was extremely tender and had a nice smoky flavor to it. It is also extremely fatty, so if you're not a fan of that you may want to go for the chopped brisket. I liked the dipping sauces it came with and I thought they enhanced the flavor.
