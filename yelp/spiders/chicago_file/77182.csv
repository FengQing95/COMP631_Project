Little Goat Diner////Their menu offers traditional breakfast items like pancakes, but their most popular dishes are more unique. I ordered the two most popular items, This Little Piggy Went to China ($14) and the Bull's Eye French Toast ($16). The flavors were definitely a lot more pronounced than most brunch places I've been to. The Little Piggy had an Asian influence, and I could definitely taste it. The combo of the bread, eggs, sausage was brought together by the chili garlic chive sauce. Not the most typical brunch dish, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The Bull's Eye French Toast was a little less appealing. The chicken was crisp to perfection, but the overall syrup was too sweet. I wasn't a fan of the soggy bread or the eggs in the middle. It was hard finishing the dish because of the sweetness.
