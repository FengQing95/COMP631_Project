Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Haven't had many chances to try REAL deep dish pizza living in S Florida but I've had it a few times in my travels and let me just say that Lou Malnati's is the best I've had! I was working in Chicago with a group and on our last night in town, we decided to have a few Lou Malnati's pizzas delivered to the hotel right before they closed for the evening. We ordered 3 large pizzas for a group of 12 hungry people. I had no idea how big they would be and how HEAVY The boxes were!! When I met the guy In the lobby, he handed me the boxes and I had to take the elevator to the top floor and walk to the end of the hall and I literally had to stop partway because the boxes were so heavy! We ordered two all veggie pizza's and a sausage and pepperoni and I was starving. After devouring 1 slice, I tried to get another but was so full off of my first slice that I could barely get two bites from the second slice. Everyone LOVED it and all we could do was bite, chew, and say Mmmmm. The room was silent aside from the Mmmmm sounds being made. The pizza was cheesy, saucy, and flavorful and absolutely PERFECT! I didn't taste the meat pizza but the veggie pizza has to be the best pizza...not just deep dish pizza but overall, the best I've had in life and yes, I've eaten plenty of NYC pizza. Still don't understand what all the hype is about there. Chicago style deep dish pizza is FANTASTIC at Lou Malnati's!
