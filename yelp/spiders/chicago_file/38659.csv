Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For our meal we decided to split the Chicago Cut Ribeye with Maitre d' Butter, Truffle Mac and Cheese, and Brussels Sprouts. The ribeye was honestly amazing and they even took the care to cut up for us because they knew we were splitting. The addition of the butter was well worth it and I'd highly recommend elevating one of these steaks, the butter took a great meal and made it outstanding. The same went for the mac and cheese and the sprouts. The sprouts had the perfect balance of char, dijon, and vinegar while the mac was perfectly decadent. Â
