Art Institute of Chicago////My brother visiting from Cal. Was ever so kind and purchased a membership. So along with Mark and Phil S and Joji S. We went in our merry way and explored this magnificent world class art intituite it's very large and we spent around 4 hours on the first floor and had coffee in the members lounge before we explored the Greek and Roman sculptures followed by Chagall and the Asian art. .
