Smoque BBQ////Pulled pork: Delicious and moist. Unlike most BBQ places, they actually serve you pork with the smoke ring. Most BBQ places we've been to (most of them highly-rated in Yelp), do not serve you any meat with the smoke ring. The smoke ring is a sign that the meat has been smoked properly. Also, most BBQ places do not inject their pulled pork. So, if the BBQ restaurant is not smoking the pulled pork for 6-14 hours, do not add additional rub to the pulled pork, and/or do not inject their pulled pork with marinade, you will end up with bland pork. My husband & I have just smoked pork during July 4th...we will eventually become BBQ Smoking ninjas. :)
