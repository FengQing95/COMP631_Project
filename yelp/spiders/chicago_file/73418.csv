Little Goat Diner////We ordered so many dishes here. The PB&J waffes, fried chicken french toast, mac and cheese, Sloppy Joe Goat, and Biscuits and gravy. Everything had a new taste to it. A definite mind f*ck. Going to the Little Goat you should try a little bit of everything. I haven't had breakfast like this before and glad I made it here. Any restaurant that Stephanie opens.. I'll be there!
