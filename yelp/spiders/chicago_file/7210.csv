Art Institute of Chicago////So we went there on Saturday night to view the exhibit "Impressionism, Fashion and Modernity." The event included a theme, "Dressed to the Nines" which gave us a chance to dress up! This was a pricey event, but there is a discount if you have a membership, which I suggest that anyone in the surrounding Chicago area purchase. This museum displays several iconic art pieces such as "American Gothic."
