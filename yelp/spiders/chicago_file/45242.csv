Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////After getting my food and trying the tuna dish all I could do was laugh..the tuna, no lie or exaggeration tasted like it had come from the can into my plate, the tomato was good, but the tuna, seriously, from the can. The grilled squid wasn't bad, it was a little tough, but not bad. Â
