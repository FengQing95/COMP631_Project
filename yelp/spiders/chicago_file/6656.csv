The Purple Pig////The half duck tho? The half duck tho bro?! I know this place is called the purple PIG but that duck is a hitter. That texture is unlike I've ever experienced in duck. It was melt in your mouth and that citrusy glaze paired amazing with the Greek yogurt sauce. The portion was on the large side for two considering we had already powered through the first 4 dishes. I guess I should've realized when ordering that half a duck is half a duck. Indulgent, satisfying, tender, just pure poultry heaven.
