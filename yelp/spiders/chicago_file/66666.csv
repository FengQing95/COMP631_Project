Little Goat Diner////I am a bit suprised to see people knocking the food for being "a la carte".  Yeah, I understand it's a $12 sandwich with no sides, but I can tell you that my Tonkatsu sandwich was HUGE and definately worth $12 (it was AWESOME!).  In fact, I ordered a side of garlic mashed potatoes (which were delicious), but I didn't even need them.  I ended up taking half the sandwich and half the potatoes home.  Granted, I also had a cup of the soup of the day (amazing) and some of the pickled onion rings (the curried mayo served with these is the BOMB.  I could eat it every day).
