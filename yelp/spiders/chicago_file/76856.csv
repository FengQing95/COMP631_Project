Little Goat Diner////I ordered the Reuben sandwich since I have never had a Reuben before and wanted to give it a try. The corned beef was good but I don't really like the kimchi and kraut that was also in the sandwich. It made it very sour and tangy. It was a good portion for a sandwich, I was pretty full after eating half of the sandwich.
