Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was our 2nd night out and we just had an AMAZING first experience w/ deep dish pizza the night before at Pizzaria Uno (the crust was garlic-buttery crisp, not too thick, and the fillings - sausage, marinara, mozz - was absolutely to die for). It was so great we wanted deep dish pizza again.
