Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!//// The best dishes we had? Octopus, burrata, and nope, those were the best two  I'm in no hurry to go back. I don't discourage people, especially if they're tapas (or sangria) fans --  but if you're just looking for something that lives up to the hype for a special event? This isn't it..
