Smoque BBQ////I had heard about Smoque as being the best BBQ place in town, but given it's offbeat location, I never actually landed up going there until now. I ventured out there for lunch today and tried their brisket platter with a side of corn bread and slaw. Everything was fantastic, and I can see why this place h as 4.5 stars on Yelp with almost 2800 reviews. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because I've had better BBQ elsewhere, but may be I'll change my change once I try a few more things on their menu.
