Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's was unbelievable, I made an Opentable reservation nearly 3 months in advance for my mom's birthday. This was my second time dining here. The food, drinks and service are all phenomenal. We started with 3 pickle back shots; unfortunately 2 of the 3 shot glasses were severely chipped. In addition we ordered 2 bottles of wine. For appetizers we had oysters and baked goat cheese; both were amazing. My sister and I both do not eat meat so we were offered a vegetarian menu (the first time I was here I was not offered one even though the waiter knew I did not eat meat.) My sister ordered the vegetarian stroganoff (she said it was one of the best things she had ever ate.) My dad ordered the chicken. My mom ordered the short rib stroganoff (also said one of the best things she had ever ate.) I ordered the wedge salad, it was good but not great; but again I had the bacon on the side so my dad could eat it. For sides we choose the fries, brussel sprouts, and the corn; all excellent. Dessert we had the chocolate cake and raspberry cheesecake; very good but not outstanding. The service was wonderful did forget to give us bread though. Overall we had an amazing time at Bavette's and are dying to go back!!
