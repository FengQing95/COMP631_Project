Smoque BBQ////I'm from the South, and Smoque is as good as anywhere I've eaten, from trendy restaurant to BBQ shack on the road to the MS Delta. True, Smoque lacks the atmosphere of a Yazoo juke joint, but who cares??? Also, you ribs and brisket afficionados, don't miss the chicken - I finally ordered the chicken after several brisket and ribs only visits, and realized what I'd been missing - makes you lick yo fingas! I've stood in line in the snow, twice, to get into Smoque, and I would do it again and again.
