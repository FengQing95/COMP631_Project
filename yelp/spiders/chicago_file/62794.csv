Smoque BBQ////I didn't understand why so many large groups had shown up to eat.  In a packed zoo like Smoque, bringing the entire Von Trapp family doesn't make sense.  And while it's nice to have a good post-meal conversation, maybe you want to skip it when there is a teeming swarm of people who wish they could sit down.
