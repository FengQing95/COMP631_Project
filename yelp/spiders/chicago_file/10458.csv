Art Institute of Chicago////The art was amazing! I loved it. The hospitality of the gift store was unacceptable. I wanted some finger puppets so I could play with them with my imaginary friends, but they only had white ones. I asked if they had any black ones and she said no. I am of the black background and i have a very strong relationship with my heritage. the fact that this gift shop only sold one skin color is very rude. Not only did they not sell me what i was looking for, after i BOUGHT IT, they were talking about me and looking at me and it was very disrespectful. I am super dissapointed. They had great art though. If you want to come to be blown away, you should defidently come.
