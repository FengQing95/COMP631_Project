Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I love searching for new and exciting breakfast places! This place was everything I Â hoped for and more! I went with a friend and we were able to get a table right away. The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and offered good insight on what to order. I ended up getting the Espanola omelet and spent a dollar more to get a specialty pancake. It was more than worth the extra! The food took a little longer to arrive than most restaurants, but it was definitely worth the wait! This was the best breakfast I have had in a very long while!
