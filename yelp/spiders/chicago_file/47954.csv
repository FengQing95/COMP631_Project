Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was overwhelmingly impressed by everything that I tried. Nothing I tasted was BAD and I tasted a good portion of the menu. Our bill for food, dessert, tax and tip was around $70 which included 2 desserts, 4 tapas, and 3 pintxos. Drinks were separate as we purchased those at the bar before dinner.
