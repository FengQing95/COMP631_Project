Little Goat Diner////Because everything we ordered for dinner was perfect. My grilled cheese was the perfect blend of meat, cheese, and tomato, and his pancake was fantastic. The chili tasted like it had hints of cinnamon to it, and the mashed potato tempura was light while also giving us that comfort food feel of mashed potato. The pork belly pancake felt like it was lacking on the amount of actual meat for the portion; Â (even I, the fake vegetarian thought there should have been more pork) you had to hunt under the vegetables on top to find the meaty goodness.
