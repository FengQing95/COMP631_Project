Little Goat Diner////I did not care for the Los Drowned. The braised beef had a thick line of fat through it. I didn't find it all that tender. It was a little messy to eat and I couldn't taste much of the avocado, but I did get a lot of the roasted pepper flavor. Might have to say, maybe too much.
