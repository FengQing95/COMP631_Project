The Purple Pig////Roasted Bone Marrow- This dish was my favorite dish of the night. It came with herbs, capers and onions with a side of Maldonado sea salt. You spread the bone marrow on the toast, grab some of the salt and sprinkle it on top, and then you top it off with the greens. A perfect bite every time. I would order this dish again and again.
