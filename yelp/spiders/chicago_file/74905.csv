Little Goat Diner////Stopped in for breakfast on a lazy Saturday. I think I may have hyped this placed too much in my mind, but ultimately the food was good, but not mind blowing. I tried the crab-rangoon omelette which was definitely unique and tasted a lot more like a crab Rangoon than I expected, but overly sauced (the sauce is fairly potent). My wife ordered the "this little piggy went to China" which while suffered a similar fate. Overall, it all felt a little unbalanced. Â The hash browns however, were different from any other hash brown I've had, which from flavor and texture standpoint was closer to a latke, which I thought was super tasty. While slightly underwhelmed by the main dishes, the cappuccino was one of the best I've ever had! The cinnamon roll was also super delicious!! Would recommend making a reservation, even for breakfast to avoid a wait.
