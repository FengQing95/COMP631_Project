Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I made a reservation over a week in advance for Friday, May 12, 2017 for 8 at 8:30 p.m., this was a special occasion, my daughter had graduated from Loyola earlier in the day.  We arrived and was told they did not have my reservation.  This was extremely disappointing because of our special occasion.  I was then told they could probably get us seated in an hour.  I expressed that an hour wait was really not going to work (we did have elderly grandparents in our party) and even they were busy, they were the ones who lost the reservation.  The manager Brian came over and said he would see what he could do.  He did get us seated within 15 minutes and we enjoyed a incredible meal, our waiter was incredible, the overall experience was incredible.  it did work out for us.  It was frustrating that my reservation was lost, but they (Brian) made it right with little inconvenience.  Thank you Brian
