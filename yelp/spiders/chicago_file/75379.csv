Little Goat Diner////The shrimp and grits were better, the grits were excellent and the shrimp was really fresh and tasty.  My only qualm is the sauce which is similar to a sauce piquant is one note.  There's no body to the sauce it doesn't have the richness you expect from shrimp and grits.  Again traditionally this is made with Tasso or andouille and those ingredients and smoky flavor profiles were missing.
