Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They have personal deep dish and some lunch specials. We both got personals just because I wanted my own and my own toppings. I got a pepperoni deep dish (no butter crust) and my BF got a sausage, olives with a butter crust and a side of those pickled peppers. We split half and switched it so we can try both. I just thought the deep dish was ok. The tomato sauce was too sour- like it wasn't cooked down enough, and cheese was pounded on (not completely melted- so you get big chunks) and not enough pepperoni. Few slices... Also the crust was super hard. Was not too big on their deep dish. Or maybe we ordered the wrong size and it was made differently?
