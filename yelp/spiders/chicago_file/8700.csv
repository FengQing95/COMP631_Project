Art Institute of Chicago////One of the best art museums I've been to. Museum is a manageable size that doesn't overwhelm and there is something for everyone. You can get a great taste of major eras in art form several different cultures. Not to mention a lot Â of the western works of art in text books are actually here in person. The kids would love the tiny rooms exhibit in the basement! truly amazing dedicated craftsmanship in those to scale little models of rooms from different times and in different styles.
