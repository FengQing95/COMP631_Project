Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////When the bill arrived I noticed our server had forgotten to include our desserts. When I called him back he sheepishly explained that since it was our first time there and we had been such wonderful guests, he was picking up our desserts - that is beyond customer service, it is simply class at its best.
