Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Best meal I've had all year hands down!! I went o celebrate my 30th birthday and THIS is the ultimate birthday meal! My fianc√© ordered the fried chicken which was HUGE, deliciously spiced and came with delicious gravy and mashed potatoes. I ordered the ribeye steak frites and these are 100% the best steak frites I've had ever. We split the button mushrooms and creamed spinach as sides, and nothing against the creamed spinach, but the button mushrooms were the best bites of the night. We ended the night with the ice cream sundae which was ridiculously expensive but probably worth every Penny. Can't wait to come back for every special occasion!
