Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I split the Steak Frites and unlike most restaurants, it was one great slab of steak. Cooked medium like requested, juicy and perfect. Service at the bar was incredible. Our waitress knew the menu well, was great at recommending her favorites and popular dishes and knew the details of all the cocktails. We Â also split the Elote Style Corn. Just those two items, and we were stuffed. You start off with bread and service is quick.
