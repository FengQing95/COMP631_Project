Little Goat Diner////Another person in my party had the Bull's Eye French Toast - holy wow, you need to google it so you can see what it actually looks like (forgot to get a pic). Another had the veggie burger, she said she really liked it and the other had blueberry pancakes and said they were excellent! I wanted to get dessert but we were all too full. The reason I gave this place 3 stars is because although I had a 6:15pm reservation we weren't seated until close to 7pm. Someone in my party had to go up to the hostess stand to ask about our server as we didn't even get any water. And even after asking it took a while. The food did come out pretty quick, but our drink order took a long time. And we had to ask for the hostess for our bill. While the food was great, the service could us some improvements.
