Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is my favorite place for tapas, even despite the fact they switched their menus from Spanish to English (rather lame if you ask me).  The food is great and the sangria is the best I've had outside of Spain.  I've been going here since 1993 yo.  You think I'd still be going if it sucked?
