Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The staff was friendly and the ambiance was homey. The food was heinous. The cheese tastes like rubber. I got the gluten free option, it tasted like alcohol from the yeast and was doughy, undercooked. The sauce was flavorful and the only redeeming part of the pizza. The cannoli dip was bland and inauthentic, tasted like whip cream. The tortillas tasted burnt and were bland as well. Never coming back. Not worth the money.
