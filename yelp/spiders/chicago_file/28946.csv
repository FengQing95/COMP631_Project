Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Their deep dish might be the best in the city for its style, but easily top 3. The Lou has something special about it - just add pepperoni for that meat craving. What makes it even better is their Malnati salad is sooooo good and makes you feel not quite as guilty for indulging in their amazing deep dish!
