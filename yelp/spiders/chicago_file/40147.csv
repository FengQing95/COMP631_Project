Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our favorite place to go hands down in the city (or anywhere for that matter). Even with the awkwardness of COVID and finding that balance of mask etiquette Bavettes somehow mastered that to! Went back for first time in a year for our first dinner out after our son was born and for my wife's birthday. Our Waitress Erika was phenomenal! She explained the mask expectations and made it seamless. The old fashioneds are always spot on, west cost oysters were fresh and paired perfectly with sauces. The bone marrow is a must, dry aged ribeye cooked perfectly with a flavorful char. Paired with elotes corn, Brussel sprouts and the truffled Mac. Can't wait to go back!
