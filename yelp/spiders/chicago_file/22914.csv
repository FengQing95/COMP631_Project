Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Typically, I'd think 45 minutes is a ridiculous wait time for pizza. Let me tell you, Lou Malnati's was worth the wait. The pizza was cheesy and saucy with the perfect cheese to meat ratio. ALSO, the crust was both crispy and soft, and coupled with the cheesiness and sauciness of the pizza ... OMG. Heaven in my mouth. I devoured my personal pizza. I swear I did not even look up from my place 'til I was finished.
