Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What prompted me to review was the fact that I begrudgingly ordered delivery recently. Â I say begrudgingly because while I love their food, I questioned if tapas would deliver well. The way they pack their food and the containers they use, coupled with a QUICK delivery worked super well!
