Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We took the time to review their online menu prior to our visit, and based on reviews, we opted to share a crab cake, short rib stroganoff, and 22oz 42 day dry aged bone-in ribeye with a side of buttery garlic mashed potatoes. Let me just say that the only part of our meal that we were able to finish was the ribeye (and the bottle of wine, of course). Don't get me wrong, the food was all unbelievably flavorful, steak was cooked to perfection and was absolutely melt in your mouth amazing! Having tried the dry aged steak for the first time, I'm afraid I can no longer have my steak any other way! Portion size is what knocked us out early, and the fact that they provide complimentary sour dough bread on top, we just did not have any space to pack all this food in, delicious as it may be. Â To finish off our meal, Benjamin gave us a complimentary chocolate cream pie in lieu of our anniversary. The gesture was greatly appreciated, and the pie was just heavenly - a perfect way to end the perfect dinner!
