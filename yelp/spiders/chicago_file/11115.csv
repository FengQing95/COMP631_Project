Art Institute of Chicago////Had such an amazing day off work celebrating Martin Luther King Junior's birthday me and my daughters had a amazing time. Are used to go to the art institute maybe twice a week for homework I had not been in years and my daughter is five and my other daughter was 12 they enjoyed themselves
