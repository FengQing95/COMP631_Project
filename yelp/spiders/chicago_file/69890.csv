Little Goat Diner////Ezra, I'd like the side of potatoes burned to a crisp.  In fact I want them so crisp that your tip depends on crispness.  Little did I know that the "corned beef hash" was really greasily prepared corned beef with (the same as the side) hash brown potatoes layered on top, not mixed with the corned beef.  Portion size?  Meh.
