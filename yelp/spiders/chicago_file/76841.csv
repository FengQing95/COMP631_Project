Little Goat Diner////Being a fan of Stephanie Izard, I couldn't wait to come to Chicago and try both Little Goat Diner and Girl and the Goat. So, for the first restaurant, I ordered the Bahn Mi Burger with goat patty ($17). The goat was great because it did not have the gamey after taste. Pickled vegetables of bean sprouts, carrots, and onions added sweet and tartness flavors. Fresh mint leaves added a pop of refreshing taste. I ate everything but the top bun of my brioche because there's too much bread. Breakfast items are served all day. Since the name of both of her restaurants included the word "goat," I thought it was only fitting that I choose a goat entree. Decor of the restaurant was pretty whimsical and not your typical diner feel. Out of the 2 restaurants, this is more casual and easier to visit because we had to make reservations for Girl and the Goat months in advance. I enjoyed the ambiance and overall experience of Little Goat Diner. Who doesn't want access to breakfast for dinner?
