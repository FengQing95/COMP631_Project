Little Goat Diner////Point blank, our server was very bad. It took her forever to greet our table, took her forever to get our drinks, our drinks came in all random orders, our food came out of order when we specifically asked for certain things to be appetizers, and some things that we ordered never showed up. All the while, the waitress walked around with the haste of a slug. It was very frustrating to be sitting there, waiting on service or food, to see her walk without any urgency. I say this having been a former server myself and having served during peak hours (similar to when we visited Little Goat).
