Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ok being in Chicago for the first time we were like let's eat pizza one of the nights, so we used Yelp to google gluten free pizza and Lou Malnati's popped up and said 0.4 miles let's go! Now we didn't realize we were embarking on one of the best pizza journeys of a life time. We arrived and there were about 50 people standing outside, I said darn, let's go somewhere else. The lady however asked a lady why she was sitting down she said you go inside and place your order and then you wait outside for a text a message when your tables ready.
