Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was recommended to go here from a friend. He said it was his favorite pizza in Chicago. They do pizza very differently. The cheese almost felt like a cheese stick in terms of consistency. It made for a very unique experience. The pizza was great and the service was fantastic. They really have a great system to get people in and ordered.
