Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now to the important stuff: the pizza. It came out hot and the person sliced and played it at the table. The crust was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. But the real winner was the sauce. The tomatoes were sweet and so flavorful. It is not something I will forget. There was plenty of cheese but not so much that you couldn't take a bit without an extendo arm.
