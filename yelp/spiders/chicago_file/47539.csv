Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What can I say about this place? The food, ambiance, and service is amazing. The moment you walk in you can smell the amazing spices and food. We made reservations the day of for 10pm, but we were able to be seated at 9:30. We got a half pitcher of sangria (delicious), 4 tapas, and 3 desserts for $75. I highly recommend the garlic shrimp and the fried chicken. The desserts are fantastic as well. This place is great for date night or enjoying with friends-so you can try everything on the menu. Definitely worth it for the price and the quality of food!
