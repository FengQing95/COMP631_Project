Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Mark, the manager, was less than professional when we asked to speak with him.  His excuse was that "the menu is discounted tonight".  REALLY?!  You sent ME the text offering the deal!  If you want people to come in, then don't treat them like trailer trash when they take you up on the deal.
