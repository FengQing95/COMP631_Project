Little Goat Diner////Be prepared to wait! I highly recommend the goat chili it was delicious! The kimchee burger was just "meh" the burger itself was very well done even though we ordered medium. The biscuits and gravy were also very good! I will definitely be going back and trying some other items on the menu
