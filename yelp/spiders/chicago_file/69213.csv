Little Goat Diner////Prepare to wait especially on the weekends. They don't take reservations either. But overall the food was good, I was with a few friends and we wanted to try a few things and share it. It's definitely a fusion style restaurant so we were all over the place with our selections. I would say just order for yourself so your tongue is not all over the place with flavors. But generally everything we ordered was very good!
