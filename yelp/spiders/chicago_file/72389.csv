Little Goat Diner////Amy F. and I shared the Sloppy Goat and the Wing Style Burger. Both were fantastic and very messy. The bun on the Sloppy Goat was especially delicious. Rachel D.'s meal somehow didn't make it out when the rest of ours did. About thirty seconds later, our waitress was over to apologize. A minute after that, the manager came over to ask if she wanted anything while she waited and that her meal had been comped. A minute after that...her food arrived. No devastating wait but her meal was comped? Again, they really have the service portion of the restaurant down. We consumed a lot of food and everyone only paid about $20. Definitely will be back!
