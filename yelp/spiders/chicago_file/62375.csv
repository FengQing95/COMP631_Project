Smoque BBQ////The Brisket and The Ribs do get 5 stars..the place, not so much...The long lines are a drag, the way the push you around in there is something else. They will tell you where and when to be seated. It is one thing when the place is busy perhaps, but they always do this. It is VERY ANNOYING.
