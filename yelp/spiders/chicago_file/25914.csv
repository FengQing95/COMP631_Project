Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you want to come here during the summer at a normal dinner time, good luck having to wait less than an hour. You put your name in their system and then they text you when your table is ready. While you're waiting, you can order your pizza beforehand, because they take a while to make, and have it come quicker to your table. So usually when you get to your table, you don't have to wait too long to eat, but then it makes it feel like a factory, you sit, you eat, you get out. It's definitely not my favorite restaurant environment.
