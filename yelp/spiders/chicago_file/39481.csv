Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Mixed Greens & Apple Salad - very light but pretty flavorful. It was a nice mixture of salty, sweet, and sour. Loved the explosion of flavors in my mouth. The apples are sliced extremely thin so it blended right in and made the salad a lot easier to eat (instead of biting huge chunks of apples).
