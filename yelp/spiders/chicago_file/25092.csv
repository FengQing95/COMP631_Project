Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I always heard great things about this place and it's pizza and was really looking forward to it after a full day of Chicago siteseeing. I was a tad disappointed in the food. I wanted and expected more. I could of had better tasting pizza back home in Florida. But because even the worst pizza is still good, I'm not rating this a 1 star.
