Art Institute of Chicago////Overall a top-notch art museum that makes me proud to live in Chicago. I just paid my second visit in a year or so and was pleasantly surprised to discover that so many of the exhibits had been changed or updated. Lots to see whether you're into modern or 'vintage' art. I certainly consider myself an art novice and found that this museum was as well-endowed as any I've seen in America or abroad. I might add that the building itself is as gorgeous as the art found within.
