Little Goat Diner////The paratha with avocado salad is absolutely delicious. The paratha was amazing, perfectly cooked with an authentic taste, and this is coming from someone who is from the land of parathas. I was very skeptical about it trying it, but boy am I glad I did. The dish blew me away. The eggs and salad that came with it meshed perfectly in flavor. I've found my go-to healthy paratha fix!!
