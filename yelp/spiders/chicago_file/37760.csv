Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bone in Rib Eye - The best steak I've ever had in my life. I honestly got a tear in my eye. It was so tender (rare, by the way), so rich, perfectly seasoned.  My mouth waters thinking of it now, and I'm not being hyperbolic.  Frankly, I'm scared to go back because I'm scared of being disappointed. Also, take the bone home to your dog....Oh, I had a glass of cab with this, I have no idea what. I consider it requisite.
