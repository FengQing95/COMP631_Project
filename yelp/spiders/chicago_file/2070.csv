Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Every time I visit Chicago I try to eat here.  The wait is long but this time I decided to hold out for a table.   It was worth the wait!  The portions are large and the wait staff very accommodating!   My omelette came out overdone and they promptly remade.  It was great!   Instead of pancakes I opted for the crepe. It was perfect!  Sit outside if you can.... it's great for people watching.  Best of all the price!  16.00 for omelette crepe and hash browns!  Wait staff plus good portions makes its worth the wait!!!!!
