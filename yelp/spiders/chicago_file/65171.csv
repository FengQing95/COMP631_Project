Smoque BBQ////I have yet to stop by at a time where there hasn't been at least a 30 minute wait, but the staff have things down to a science and are friendly. If you're not planning to dine in call your order in ahead of time and skip the line - seeing people walk in then back out with boxes of BBQ in minutes always makes me jealous while I stand in line like a sucker.
