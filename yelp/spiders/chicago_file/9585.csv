Art Institute of Chicago////Best story I have about shows- in the crowded show, I and 8 college friends (all of us were from a college language floor at the same school - most of my friends spoke French as their language _ I German.)   went.  We are surrounded by people with head phone docent tours- listening and just walking in rote manner with much of the crowd.  There is a rhythm for sheeple to  look at art, beep, move on so the headphones also play an important part in the amount of money the Art Inst can draw in from people paying extra for walking in and out of the show.  The headphones are also designed for a 5 year old or an 105 yr old.  I don't have a problem with the head phones - I just wish they would not be worn in the show itself- ever.  OK.  I knew about the art, I would say this or that about different painting.
