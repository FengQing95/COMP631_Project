Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////For Sunday morning brunch in downtown Chicago (the weekend of the marathon, no less) a 45 minute wait isn't so bad, and at Wildberry it is definitely worth it. Our server (can't remember his name) was amazing and not even the slightest bit stressed at how busy it was. He made great recommendations, and was really knowledgeable about the menu items. The portions are huge, and the food came to the table pretty quickly, especially given how busy they were. I ordered pancakes, my sister ordered an omelet, my sisters-in-law had french toast and crepes. All of us left completely stuffed and happy. I will definitely back the next time I'm in Chicago!
