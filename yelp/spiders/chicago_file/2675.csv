The Purple Pig////So I came from out of town to this place Sunday December 8th. Upon arriving, the ambiance resembled somewhat of a "hotel-esque restaurant".  We were promptly seated - probably the best part of the whole experience. Upon being seated, our server took our order for a bottle of wine - this is when the nightmare  began. Our wine took over 30 minutes to arrive to the Table, 20 minutes AFTER our cheese board. in the meantime my girlfriend's sister was cut by random shards of glass on her side of the table, which by the way, made her bleed quite a bit. When management was informed of the issue, they came by and apologized and bragged to us of their continued mass volume and how this has never occurred  and offered to buy our bottle of wine (which they did). However, they did not have the bottle we wanted (disappointing). For our entrees we ordered orecchiette, and pig ears (without egg) - which came with egg. All in all the food was quite bland and uninspiring, management was HORRENDOUS. We spoke to management about everything and the manager on duty was indifferent! I do not recommend this place, nor will I ever visit again. I suggest avoiding  this place if you're in town!!!
