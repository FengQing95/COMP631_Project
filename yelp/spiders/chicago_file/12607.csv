Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our first trip to Chicago and we wanted a great pizza experience. We got there early since we read it takes about 30 min for the pizza to bake. We were seated right away and the service was great. The place filled up fast, so I'm glad we got there early ( about 5:30). We ordered the small Lou pizza and the medium Â Malnatis salad. It just enough food for my husband and I. Both were delicious; and I would recommend this place!
