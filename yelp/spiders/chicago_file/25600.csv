Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We called ahead to see if there was a wait because we had baseball tickets. The hostess (who answered) said there was not. I explained that we needed to eat and head right out in order to get to the stadium. We walked from our hotel and were seated right away. The waiter came over and asked if we had pre ordered our pizza. He then explained that it would take a minimum of 45 minutes to get our food and that we might make it for the end of the first inning. We were never told that pre ordering was an option. We had to leave and quickly find another restaurant. Very disappointing.
