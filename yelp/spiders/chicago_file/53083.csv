Smoque BBQ////Yes, the weekend lines are long and the prices are just a little higher than you wish they were, but you are getting one of the three best bbq meals I've found in this city.  Just go there.  You'll be so happy you did!  God, I wish they delivered; I'd be eating their food once or twice a week without fail.
