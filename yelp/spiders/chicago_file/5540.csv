The Purple Pig////I was in Chicago over the weekend and looking for a good place to eat around 9 p.m.  I went on yelp and found the Purple Pig - with four stars and over 6,000 reviews, it looked promising!  I was not disappointed, and this is why I love Yelp!  I can always count on fellow yelpers when I'm in a different city.
