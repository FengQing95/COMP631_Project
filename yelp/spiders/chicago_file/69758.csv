Little Goat Diner////Of course this all would have been much less of an issue if i didn't have to wait 15 minutes for my sandwich.  That's inexcusable considering the staffing level, the lack of customers, the simplicity of the dish, and the fact that this is essentially a fast-food counter.  When I finally received my sandwich, it was delicious but contained about 2 oz. of meat, which is kinda sad when they're charging $8 to $10 each with no sides.
