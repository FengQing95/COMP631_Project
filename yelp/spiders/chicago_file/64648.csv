Smoque BBQ////// Added Sliced Brisket - $5 - This brisket was pretty good but it was a little bit dry. Then there was a time I went back to smoque and the brisket was delicious. So I think it depends on the day, so I would maybe steer you away from getting this due to its inconsistency. I mean if you are hungry, then get it! ha.
