Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////5 stars deep dish pizza. Not recommended to try their thin pizza. The thin pizza is signature of NYC and should only be eaten in the city (smile). Also try their signature malnati salad (non veg). It was the greatest salad I ever tried, even my mom who doesn't like salad, loved it
