Little Goat Diner////This place is right across the street from my internship so I go there often for lunch. They have the best chicken tenders I have had in my life, I also am a huge fan of their mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. I've been on the rooftop patio once which is also a great place to sit and eat. If you're looking for a nice spot with great food and reasonable prices this is a great place to go.
