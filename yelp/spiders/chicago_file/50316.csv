Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was my second trip to this wonderful place! We went on valentines night and obviously they were running 30mins behind for people who already had appointments. That caused for a lot of impatient couples, but we were fine! After 30mins we were seated and this wonderful server came to take our orders.
