Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Anyway, on to the food! First the bacon-wrapped dates. Gross. Burnt and greasy. I've had much better at other tapas restaurants. This is a hard one to mess up but they managed. Second, chicken and ham croquettas. Meh. Tasted like nothing in particular and the dipping sauces didn't complement the dish. Third, the shortrib with mashed potatoes. The most decent dish of the night but the mashed potatoes tasted like they came from a box. Last was the chicken and chorizo sausage skewers. Wow, undercooked chicken and the worst tasting chorizo sausage I have ever had the misfortune of putting in my mouth. I love chorizo sausage so that was the final straw for me. After bad service and poor quality food we left there smelling like the stench of grease that overpowers the entire restaurant. You are better off at any other tapas restaurant in the city. Bye bye Ba-Ba-Reeba, never again.
