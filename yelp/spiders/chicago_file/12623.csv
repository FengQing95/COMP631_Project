Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After hearing so many good things about Malnati's and being in Chicago this week I decided to try Malnati's personal deep dish pizza. My only complaint was that is was lacking in cheese for s deep dish pizza. The crust was phenomenal and the sauce was over the top great. I would definitely go back and just ask for more cheese.
