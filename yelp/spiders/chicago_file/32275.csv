Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Overall I've concluded the California deep dish pizza is trash. I'm sorry for ever doubting that it could actually be good. That being said, is it better than NY pizza? Not for me at least. Between the price and the wait time and general ratios, I'd still go for a slice of NY pizza anyday but I do enjoy the more calm, sit-down experience of deep dish too and Lou Malnati's is a solid spot (big surprise there...)
