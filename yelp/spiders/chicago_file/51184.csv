Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Everything was amazing that we tried. We were able to pick the selections to our liking and the menu was put together very well so i was able to know if I was going to like something right away from reading the menu as I was unfamiliar with the menu or the cuisine. It has been over 15 years since I have been to a Tapas place.
