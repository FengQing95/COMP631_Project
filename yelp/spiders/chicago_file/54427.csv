Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Sangrias were great I must say. Every other tapas was so underwhelming it was just sad. A pitcher of Sangria couldn't make food better....Potatoes were served to us within a minute or two, obviously not prepared fresh. They looked/tasted like they were laying under a hot lamp for a few hours. Bread and mushroom tapas were so unoriginal, they didn't even try...i will include photos, do your own judgement.
