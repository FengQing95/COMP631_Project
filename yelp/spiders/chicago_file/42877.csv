Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have always loved Cafe Babareeba, but recently went this weekend and had an amazing experience. You cannot go wrong with what you order. The bacon wraped dates (stuffed with cheese) are insanely good. I also love the calamari and potatos with the spicy aoli sauce. Service was amazing AND we had to wait past our reservation so the manager comped our pitcher of sangria. That is great customer service. Will always be one of my favorite spots!
