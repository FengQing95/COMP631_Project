Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Bomb pizza! The staff was great, my wife is pregnant and only seating they had was outside but the host came and got us a table on the inside which we appreciated! This place is a must if you want to get that Chicago feel and get that authentic deep dish taste. I will be back.
