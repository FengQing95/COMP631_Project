Art Institute of Chicago////Acclaimed art museum and a must-do for tourists and locals alike. Came here with a friend on Friday after lunch and bought tickets at the box office insider. The coat room is currently closed due to covid. You are allowed to carry backpacks and have water bottles; I love that there are water bottle refilling stations by the bathrooms so you can stay hydrated. The cafe was closed when we went (Aug 2021). Entrance is $25 and there are discounts for Chicago residents/students/members. Credit cards are accepted.
