Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started with the Apple and Mixed Greens salad, the candied pecans and manchego cheese made this perfect. It was a nice light starter without getting to full before your main. Â Then I had the 10 oz filet, this was the best steak I've had in Chicago. Crust was amazing, still medium rare inside. He had the Dry Aged Bone-in Ribeye, flavor was again, amazing, so juicy! Very well rested, the juice was inside the steak, not running out. Then we had the Elote Corn, what in the world?! Crazy. Creamy, cheesy, cilantro, lime, chili... The best Mexican style corn I've ever had. Lastly, the Mashed Potatoes with garlic and gravy. Simple and wonderful, no Italian can complain about garlic cloves on their food.
