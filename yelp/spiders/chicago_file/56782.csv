Smoque BBQ////Okay the truth now. You probably want to go here early. Okay for you readers sans wee ones early likely means 7PM. You will be in for a long wait. Think Seinfeld's Soup Nazi without the insults. So yeah fair warning. We were there early by our standards and by the time we left at 5PM the line was already wrapping out the restaurant on a freezing day.
