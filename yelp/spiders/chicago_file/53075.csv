Smoque BBQ////Absolutely no complaints! The best BBQ I've had in quite sometime (other than my fathers).  The baked beans and mac n cheese are decent but what keeps bringing me back is definitely the half chicken A+++.  My advice is to either get there early (because its always packed standing room only) or order take out unless you like waiting an hour to eat. Its definitely worth it!
