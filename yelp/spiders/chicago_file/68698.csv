Little Goat Diner////This place was just meh for me.  I liked the idea of upscale-diner and it definitely feels like a diner with the large menu and the counter area and booths, but it also feels trendy and hip.  We go here on a Friday around 7:30 pm and we had to wait a few minutes for a booth.  The host was very nice.  The menu is huge with all diner favorites.  Of course a lot of dishes included goat, but surprisingly a lot of dishes were korean-inspired or korean fusion.  We ordered a cheesy-crab dip to start, and that was a big disappointment.  It was just cheese dip w/ what seemed like a tiny crab flavor.  There was no crab chunks or anything.  We asked the server and he said it comes like that.  My korean goat burger was subpar.  It just lacked flavor.  You could taste the kimchi and there was a lot of it, but it was americanized version of kimchi and it was too weak to stand up to the patty and bun.  The patty/bacon/egg was thick but too bland.  I usually complain about bacon being too salty, but this time everything was bland.  I've never had a goat burger, and the meat was not as good and a bit dryer than beef.  We got fries to share, and it was just potato crumbs.  I thought it might just be like that, but I looked at other tables, and they got long stringy fries.
