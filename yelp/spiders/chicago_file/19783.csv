Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Then, we ordered the Lou, which was a veggie deep dish with the butter crust (YUM!), roma tomatoes, cheese, spinach, mushrooms, and other toppings. The slices are huge and thick, so between the three of us, we could only eat three slices. We ordered a medium, so we had half a pie leftover (and that was only three slices!). The pizza was so gooey, soft on the bottom, and the veggies tasted fresh (despite being baked!). There wasn't an overly large amount of watery tomato (which I personally disliked about Zachary's and assumed all deep dish consisted of watery tomato - till now!). In fact, there was no watery tomato at all.
