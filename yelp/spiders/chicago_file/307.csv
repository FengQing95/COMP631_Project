Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I am a food snob, I admit that.  This was not a quant little place to grab a wonderful brunch.  This was a tourist destination right in prime tourist area.  Food was definitely good/okay, but nothing really memorable.  Had belgian waffles and they were cooked quite nicely.
