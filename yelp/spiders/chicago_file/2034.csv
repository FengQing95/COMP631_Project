Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////My favorite breakfast spot in Chicago. Whenever my boyfriend comes to visit, it is always our first stop as it is his favorite breakfast spot as well. We always recommend it to our friends and family because no other breakfast/brunch restaurant compares. The food is unparalleled as is the service. We absolutely love Wildberry and HIGHLY recommend it. Although the wait time can sometimes be intimidating, it is worth it. Go early in the morning or shortly before closing time for a shorter wait. On the rare occasion that we had a problem with the food or service, it was addressed by the manager and resolved promptly.
