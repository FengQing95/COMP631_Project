Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place could get 5 stars but even when you make a reservation you wait. I had booked a private party the first time I went there and the lady couldn't find my name and wasn't even going to ask anyone else. The other hostess happened to walk up and knew about our party. The second time I made reservations on lettuce entertain you and we still waited twenty minutes to be seated. If I want to wait I would just walk in. But the food is amazing. And you must get the sangria. The chicken paella is the best. The bacon wrapped dates are incredible too. The best way to have a great experience is for everyone in your party to order two or three plates and share it all. I'm always stuffed when I leave.
