Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We also got a free dessert for being first-timers (so I got to save my check-in dessert for later!!!). After the richness of the meal, I probably should've opted for a lighter dessert choice, but I couldn't resist the chocolate truffle cake. It was deeeeelicious. Definitely super rich and maybe not the best choice after such a rich meal, but it was amazing. I would for sure order this again.
