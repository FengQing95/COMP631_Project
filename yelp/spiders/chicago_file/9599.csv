Art Institute of Chicago////Absolutely love the Art Institute of Chicago.  I am a Chicagoan but always make time to visit at least twice a year.  I highly recommend the Magritte exhibit, there is quite a line but very worth it.  Also, we recently went on a rainy day and there was a long line to get into the Institute. Do not be intimidated by the long line, I hate waiting in line but the line went by quite quickly.  If you are visiting Chicago, a visit to the Art Institute is a must!
