Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came as they opened at 11am on a Friday. I would definitely recommend coming on off hours because they get very busy very quickly and tables do not flip quickly because of how long it takes the pizza to come out. They bake each pizza fresh and it takes about 40 min. We got the Lou Malnati special with buttercrust and added sausage. Also got bruschetta as a starter. Service was very nice.
