Art Institute of Chicago//// I found a painting that I had seen in a many parodies called "The people at the diner" by Dennis Hopper.  Also, there was a Van Gogh painting of the water lillies. There was also a vomit painting by Keven Pollack the actor which was huge but made me queasy again.  There was also this painting made entirely of dots! This one also made me feel pretty woozy.  I tried to see the Scream painting from the courtney cox horror movies but they wouldn't let me because I didn't have the ticket even though I paid twelve bucks! I couldn't believe it the complications of the ticket.  It's like if I paid for a cubs ticket and couldn't watch this seventh inning or something.
