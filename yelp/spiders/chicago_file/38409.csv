Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food - 5/5 I will be dreaming about this food for weeks to come. We started with the crab cake. I have never had a crab cake with so much crab in it. The flavours were divine it almost didn't need the sauce it came with but that was delicious also. We got the bone in filet mignon and truffle mac and cheese for our mains. My partner usually gets his steak medium well but had this filet medium rare as per my request and raved about how melt in your mouth it was. Cooked to perfection. The mac and cheese was good but not as outstanding as the other two dishes. We got the chocolate cream pie to finish. The vanilla bean whipped cream is divine and loved the crunchy crust of the pie. Would recommend.
