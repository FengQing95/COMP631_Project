Smoque BBQ////We've never had to wait for a table, and my boyfriend basically lives to eat here whenever possible. It honestly took a little while to grow on me. The brisket and pulled pork are quite good, but they just offer the one signature sauce. I continue to be unimpressed by their sides - tiny little cups for a little too much money, the mac and cheese especially just isn't anything special. That said, it's a good place to grab a bite, you'll always get a table, and odds are any bbq fanatics you bring will like it.
