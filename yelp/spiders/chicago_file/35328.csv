Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As opposed to Girl and the Goat, which was hardly any food for a lot of money, while this place is upscale, you at least get your money's worth, and it's all so good, I had the cheeseburger with sides of creamed spinach and corn and fries, I loved it all, I got the chocolate pie for dessert which was good too, I tried my friend's fried chicken and bacon which were both really good too, full bar too
