Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This has become our favorite place for brunch.  The food is a bit more upscale than most other breakfast venues.  They servce real maple syrup but do charge an additional cost.  Everything is fresh and the service has been excellent.  Try the pecan waffle or the berry bliss pancakes.  Yum!
