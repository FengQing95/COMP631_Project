Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Amazing experience! I was visiting Chicago for a weekend and decided to make a reservation here even though a location just opened up in my hometown of Las Vegas. We started out by waiting at the bar for a martini which was made perfectly!! As we were having a drink the hostess came and found us to seat us to our table. Our waitress was extremely friendly and very helpful in making our perfect menu choices.
