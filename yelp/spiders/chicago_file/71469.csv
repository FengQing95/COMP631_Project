Little Goat Diner////We chose Little Goat as our dining spot for a pre-theatre dinner.  The place upon entrance gave off a good vibe and we liked the decor.  Definitely trendy and nicely decorated.  We were seated at a booth for our party of 6 near the window which allowed for good people watching out the window.  The staff were friendly and referred to their menu  as a "traditional diner menu".  Well, being that I am from the northeast which is a haven for diners I would disagree with the "traditional" part.  It is more of a trendy diner-inspired menu.  I ordered a signature drink ( smoking cherry bomb?) that I had to return because it was not drinkable.  I opted for a sauvignon blanc instead.  Wine is served in a juice glass... I found that odd.
