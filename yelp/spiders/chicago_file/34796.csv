Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Maude's is better- go there! But this place is worth checking out too. Went here with a girlfriend without reservations and was able to snag two seats at the bar immediately- they do serve their whole menu at the bar which is nice. Got the reisling wine- decently priced for such a swanky steakhouse. Ambience was great, but definitely more sit down and relax for dinner instead of dinner/drinks before going out (like gilt bar/Maude's). The salmon tartare was better at Maude's- I hated the tortilla type chips it was served with at bavettes. The avocado stuffed crab was AMAZING.
