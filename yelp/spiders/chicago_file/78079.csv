Little Goat Diner////I've been here every time I visit Chicago and this place never fails.  Sorry, I forgot to take pictures of the food because I was too hungry.  The pancakes are a must try.  It's always fluffy and delicious.  I also recommend the grilled cheese sandwich.  It's my personal favorite.  Service is always great.  Of course, the Bloody Mary is a must for brunch.
