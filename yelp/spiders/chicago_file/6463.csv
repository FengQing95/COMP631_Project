The Purple Pig////We started off with the crispy pigs ears, which were amazing! This dish was very different than anything I'be had at other restaurants, and the kale and pickled banana peppers balanced out the crunchy and salty pigs ears perfectly. Texture, flavor, and creativity were all there in this dish.
