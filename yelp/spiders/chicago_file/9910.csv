Art Institute of Chicago////They have great exhibits.  The food concessions need to be a little cheaper.  Even their snack bar that just serves drinks and chips was over $10 for 1 soda, 1 bottle water and a package of chips.  This also included a discount for members. Sad to see families walk away cause they can't afford snacks and drinks for their kids
