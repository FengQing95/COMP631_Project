Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My boss had been raving about this place forever. With all the incredible restaurants in Chicago, it's easy to get stuck among the "bests." But Bavettes is just a tad more special than just another best. I have to say, they were pretty shady about the reservation originally, which I made over a month in advance. I called and tried to make a reso for a Friday eve, which happened to be my birthday. Â At first all they had was a 5pm and a 10pm. When I said it was my bday, I got, "Oh! You're in luck. A 730 for 2 JUST opened up!" Haha, whatever. I'll take it however I can get it!
