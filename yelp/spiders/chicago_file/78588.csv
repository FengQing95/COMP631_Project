Little Goat Diner////My husband and I have been traveling for two weeks along the East Coast (Boston, Portland, Maine) with a midway stop for several days in Chicago. When we travel ... we EAT. As native Californians with access so some of the best dining on earth, we look for top-notch food. From questionably legal food trucks to Michelin stars, if it gets raves, we'll try it.
