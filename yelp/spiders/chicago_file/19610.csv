Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had so much left over and it was our last meal here, we decided to box up the rest, stuff it in our backpacks, somehow make it through airport security, and smuggle authentic Chicago deep dish pizza to Dallas. We shared it with our family and friends back home and they were in love with the taste as well.
