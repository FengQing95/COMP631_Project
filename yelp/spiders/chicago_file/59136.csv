Smoque BBQ////Smoque is one of if not the best bbq place in Chicago. From the minute you walk inside, the place smells delicious! The place is every welcoming and the employees make you feel very welcome. But on to the food, I had the combo rib platter with the brisket platter that came with bbq bean, beans were bomb by the way!! Also got coleslaw and chili. Everything was delicious and can't wait to go back!!
