Little Goat Diner////The burgers and home fries were really good, but by the time the food came out, I was in a pretty bad mood.  It wasn't that busy, but they still took a really long time to take our order. Water wasn't served until right before the meal came out.  If you're going to let your patrons sit and wait, especially outside in the heat, at least apologize for the wait and tell them you'll be right with us. That goes a long way with me.
