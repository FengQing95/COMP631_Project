Little Goat Diner////Lives up to its hype! This is a mix of modern and 50s-themed diner. I came here with a party of 4 on a Sunday night. We had the choice of immediately sitting at the open table or waiting 30 minutes for our own table. We were all hungry, so we opted for the open table! Our server came soon after we were seated. He recommended a few dishes and was overall extremely helpful in navigating the enormous menu for me. It was a hard decision, but I finally chose the pork belly pancake because pork belly and scallion pancakes are my favsies! :) It didn't take long for the food to arrive (~15 minutes). I was really surprised by the ginormous amount of food that came on my plate! There was one scallion pancake on the bottom topped with 2 slices of pork belly and a freakin MOUNTAIN of cole slaw. The cole slow was lightly flavored and perfect to taste. The pork belly, unfortunately, was a bit too salty for me :( But it was still tender and yummy! The scallion pancake is just like how my mama makes it! It has multiple layers of crispiness :)
