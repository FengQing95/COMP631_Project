Little Goat Diner////After lots of going back and forth, I finally decided to save the breakfast menu for a future Little Goat visit. I figured a burger would be a safe way to go, so I ordered one of the many options. I don't remember now which one it was, but it had a fried egg on the top. It was excellent. Not overly salty or overly anything. I would want to try something else next time, though. I was a bit disappointed by the brussels sprouts because they were very strong-tasting. I think it was some kind of oil or vinegar they were bathed in, but the taste was overwhelmingly salty. This is coming from someone who adds salt to things that were already salted, so you know I'm being serious when I say it was way too salty.
