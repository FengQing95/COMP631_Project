Smoque BBQ////My wife and I ordered two full racks of ribs, enough for dinner plus a ton of leftovers. Both of us agreed that the St. Louis style ribs were way better than the baby backs. It wasn't even close. The St. Louis ribs still had a good meaty bite to them, and the smokey crust on the outside was amazing. The baby backs had the same great taste on the outside, but they were actually a little bit TOO tender. They fell apart a little bit too much and you lost a lot of the great meaty flavor. All you got was the crust.
