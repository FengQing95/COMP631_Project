The Purple Pig////Overall, I had a great time! The waiter and the staffs were very nice and came by several time to ask if we needed anything throughout the night. I ordered the Milk-Braised Pork Shoulder for dinner. I was expecting a small portion since the waiter told us that two entr√©es will fill up one person. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the size of the pork. It was juicy and melted in your mouth! I loved every bit of it. However, I do wish there was a bit more potatoes and less salt on the pork. For dessert, I ordered their chocolate cake and it was very rich and the sauce that came with it was a bit sour. If are thinking about getting this for dessert, I highly recommend some coffee, tea, or red wine to go along with it.
