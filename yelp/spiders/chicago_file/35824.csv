Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Simply amazing!! The ambience brings you back to another time- old Hollywood glamour- and the delicious cocktails only enhance the experience. My husband had the best steak he had ever eaten and my lamb chops were on another level. Our waitress Emily was fantastic and had a super friendly and helpful vibe when it came to recommendations on dishes. She also gave us a dessert course on the house, thank you! Labeling myself as somewhat of a food snob, the overall hype about Bavette's delivered. We WILL be coming back to enjoy more.
