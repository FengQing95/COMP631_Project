The Purple Pig////Part of the experience is waiting for a table at The Purple Pig. They don't take reservations and you have to go in accepting that they don't and you will have to wait. On the positive side, there is seating outside while you wait and someone came around to take drink orders for us. Thanks to that the 90 minute wait was completely tolerable. Important to note though that they quoted us 45-60 minutes so the timing was way off.
