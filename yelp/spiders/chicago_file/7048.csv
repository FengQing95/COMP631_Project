Art Institute of Chicago////I remember trips to the Art Institute during high school and taking advantage of the free admission on Thursdays during college and med school (it looks like they've scaled back to just 5p-8p on Thursdays). I loved slowly exploring the museum, gallery by gallery in peace and quiet. The entrance is an iconic piece of Loop architecture. Another piece of Chicago that I miss.
