Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Regardless, great tapas restaurant. The menu is set up so each plate is put into a category. For example, beef, fish/seafood, salads, etc. I loved this layout because I could easily get each genre of meat. Scallops, patatas fritas, salmon are all great choices. The service was great. My guest and I were able to get a table within 15 minutes on a Saturday night on the patio, and in that time, we waited at the bar. Great thing about this place is they announce your table over a loud speaker - no way you can miss your table.
