Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Took some family members to Lou Malnati's as they had been wanting to try "Chicago Style" pizza. We started off with a family style sized portion of the chicken Caesar salad.  This can easily feed 6-7. Great value for the price. We then split a large Chicago style pizza that feeds 4.  Which is perfect as we were a party of 4. The pizza looked great, but lacked taste that day. I've been coming to Lou Malnati's for a while and this pie just lacked that "it" factor today. I feel bad as this was my family's first trip to LM's and they didn't leave with the best impression. The highlight was our salad and when coming to a pizza landmark, is not the best thing to remember.
