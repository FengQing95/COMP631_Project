Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This joint is located in the busy streets of downtown Chicago. They have various sitting arrangements from outdoors to inside dining along with bar section. That day I ordered "The Lou" which is a veggie deep dish pizza and has Spinach mix (enhanced with garlic, basil & onion), mushrooms and sliced Roma tomatoes covered with three cheeses, on a garlic Buttercrust. The pizza took around 45mins to arrive but it was definitely worth the wait. Lots of melted cheese and tomato flavours which was enticing to taste buds.
