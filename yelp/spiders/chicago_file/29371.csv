Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first time trying deep dish pizza, and boy was I surprised! The pizza was not as heavy as I expected it to be. We ordered the "Lou" vegetarian pizza, and it was really tasty - not too cheesy, and the crust was nice and not overly doughy/filling. It's definitely a different style of pizza to a traditional pizza, but it's worth the try! I'll be back one day.
