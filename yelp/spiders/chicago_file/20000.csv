Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ill be honest, I am not a big fan of Chicago style pizza, but if you're going to try it for the first time, then I definitely recommend this place. I went with some friends to get pizza here and the line is really long. expect to wait at least an hour. the good thing they let you order the pizza and call you, so when you finally get your table the pizza is already pretty much done.
