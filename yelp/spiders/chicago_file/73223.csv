Little Goat Diner////I ordered the apple pie dessert only to find myself disappointed. The outside crust was thick and hard, which i sometimes find ok if the apple pie inside is warm and gooey. But I was shocked to find the apples inside were so dry, almost like they were dehydrated. The only thing good about the dessert was the ice cream on top of it. I cut the roof of my mouth with the hard crust on the first bite..sort of like when you bite into a hard toasted sandwich. Now my mouth is sore and stings whenever I eat certain foods because of the cut. I had high expectations for this place. Â
