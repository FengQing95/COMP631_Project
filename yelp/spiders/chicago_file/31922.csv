Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've been eating Lou's since I was a kid. Â My go-to pizza is a deep dish with pepperoni.. and I love to dip it in the creamy garlic dressing.. it is like a better version of ranch! I have only ever had good experiences here and would have to rank Lou's as my favorite pizza of all time.
