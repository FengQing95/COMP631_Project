Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here for a date and it was amazing. I pass by this place on my commute all the time, but it wasnt until i went for dinner that i saw why its always busy. Expect a decent wait time, but its sooo worth it. I had the brisket with mashed potatoes and one of their rices with pork belly, pork skin, etc. OMFG it was amazing. The rice is definitely for 2 peopel at least. I had it for a few days afterwards with tortillas and siracha. Great food, great drinks, great scenery. The staff is always tryna make sure you are cared for. I would highly recommend.
