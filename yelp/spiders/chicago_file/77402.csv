Little Goat Diner////We love chef Izard! We've been to her Girl and the goat restaurant a couple of times. So since we will be in Chicago over the weekend we decided to try one of her other restaurants. I was so happy that I was able to place a reservation, we got their early and we just waited for 10minutes to be seated.
