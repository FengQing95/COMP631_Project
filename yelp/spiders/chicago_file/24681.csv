Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were waiting outside (over an hour) and as someone was walking out, he saw the line and told us "it's worth the wait". And you know what, it really was. The pizza - a classic deep dish - was cooked to crispy perfection and was topped with great toppings. The server was really nice too.
