Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been to Ba-Ba-Reeba a couple times after work with friends for the bar specials and the food is decent. If you make it to the bar and order before 6 p.m., it's $3 per selection off of the bar menu although the selection is very limited. Good choices still abound. At our recent visit, we enjoyed the patatas bravas (seasoned crispy potato cubes with a side of sweet and spicy tomato alioli), calamares a la romana (fried calamari), empanada de pollo (the crust was delightfully flaky) and datiles con tocino (dates individually wrapped in crispy bacon). Other notable main menu items were champinones rellenos (stuffed mushroom caps), and the solomillo con queso de cabrales (moist pices of beef tenderloin dressed with warmed blue cheese and pom frites). The sangrias (red and peach) need a little work (not nearly as flavorful as Cafe Iberico's). Service is friendly although infrequent. The restaurant tends to get crowded and smokey very quickly around 8 p.m. regardless of which night it is, but it has a fun atmosphere.
