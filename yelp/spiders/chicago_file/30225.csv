Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My first deep dish experience wasn't great, I didn't eat at Lou Malnati's and now wish i had. The 40min wait went by quick with the ability to grab some drinks and enjoy a nice evening outside on the sidewalk. We elected to not pre order our pies as suggested, and figured we could enjoy some more drinks while we waited after we sat down and ordered. All 3 of us got a small pie (feeds 2 according to the menu). All were very tasty and renewed my faith in deep dish pizza. Definitely took some back the hotel. We asked to split the bill and the server was even able to split the appetizer 3 ways which was massively convenient to us. Overall a very pleasant experience, recommended if you have the time and patience to wait. We had both, would definitely come back.
