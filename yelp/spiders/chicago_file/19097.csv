Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////we walked in on a wednesday at 4pm with a party of 3, because we heard the line and wait gets pretty bad later on. we went with a Chicago native who comes to Lou's pretty often, and says it's one of his favorite places! we got seated right away, and there were already a few parties inside enjoying their deep dish, and it looked thick and delicious!!! Â the decor makes it appear much less like a family establishment than Girodano's, and more like where middle aged Chicagoans come to play poker or enjoy cigars. but there were quite a few families inside.
