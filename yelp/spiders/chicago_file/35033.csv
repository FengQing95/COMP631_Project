Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food:  This was the only highlight.  And I'm not talking life changing.  I would say it is average. The shrimp cocktail was a nice portion that actually should've been called prawns because they were so large.  Many people raved about the goat cheese and tomato app but I thought it was average.  Steaks (24 oz dry aged and petite filet) were average.  Dessert (peppermint ice cream with hot fudge) tasted like a dentist office.  The true show stealer?  The table bread and butter.  Came out soft and piping hot.  Very good.
