The Purple Pig////We ordered three items: crispy pig ear, pork shoulder w/ the mashed potatoes, and the chicken thigh kebab. Now, I thought all three things were pretty delicious but I also didn't think they were phenomenal. We paid good money and received a good meal; I am glad we tried it but this isn't something I'd go back and eat again.
