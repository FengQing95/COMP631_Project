Smoque BBQ////Best BBQ I've had in Chicago. I'm typically not a fan of tangy BBQ sauce but the glazing on the ribs complimented the sauce to perfection. Both the ribs and half chicken were as succulent as it gets. The beans and brisket chili were average but the cornbread was delicious and not dry like typical cornbread. Lastly, the fries were bountiful and comparable to five guys fries which I am quite a fan of. Anyone look for a top notch bbq BYOB should check out Smoque.
