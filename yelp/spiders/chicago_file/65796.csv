Smoque BBQ////So I was very excited to try Smoque because, like everyone else around here, I had heard very good things about this place. I ended up trying the brisket, the ribs, and the chicken. While I thought the meat was cooked nicely, I felt like there was something missing on the seasoning front. I thought that the BBQ itself was missing more of a salty char taste. I feel like I've had much better seasoned BBQ from other places around the city, including my family's backyard.
