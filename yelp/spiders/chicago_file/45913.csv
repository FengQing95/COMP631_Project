Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////3 things keep me drooling for BabaReeba: the sangria, the stuffed mushrooms and the halibut.  However a few months ago, I found out that the halibut is no longer on the menu.  =(  But that's ok because so many other tapa dishes are fantastic.  Try the eggplant salad and the Spanish omelet to start.  They get the stuffed mushrooms, hanger steak, meatballs, escargot, chicken/sausage skewer...the list just keeps going.  Wash it down with some sangria and enjoy the rowdy crowd.
