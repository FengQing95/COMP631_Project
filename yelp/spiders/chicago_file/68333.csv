Little Goat Diner////Everything was delicious. I saved half of my savory dish for home. There were thick chunks of bacon. The pancakes and eggs mixed together w the crunchy bites of kimchi. It came w a vinegar sauce on the side, which I used sparingly. The tartness and acidity cut the richness if the dish. Like the dipping sauce to a potsticker. Or simple distilled vinegar and garlic to longanisa. Mmmm. The hubs spaghetti was coated in egg w fresh clams. Very rich. Very unlike a usual breakfast. Unless you ate a Filipino house (where sometimes last nights left over chicken adobo sauce gets blended in a fried rice w an egg on top).
