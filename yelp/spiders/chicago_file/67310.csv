Little Goat Diner////with all they hype around this place, I thought the food would have been better. Our bloody Mary's were too spicy ( and I like spicy) where I had to clear my throat and drink water between sips and too thick. I got "This little piggy went to China" and it was just too salty, the cheddar biscuit is mostly what I ate off that dish. My boyfriend ordered the "KIMCHEE & BACON & EGGS & PANCAKES ASIAN STYLE BREAKFAST TASTY THING" and again, too salty. We didn't finish our meals or drinks. Maybe it was just the items we ordered, but pretty disappointed to pay over $50 for a breakfast that we didn't enjoy.
