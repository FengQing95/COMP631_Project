Art Institute of Chicago////The renovation was not handled well, e.g. they shipped off most of the impressionist collection to Fort Worth last fall; the Chagall Window has been off display for so long that only old timers remember it; the doors in the modern wing swing awkwardly and invite a tort suit. What happened to the hall of arms? the African collection? Why is the African collection currently housed in a small basement Â corner while the sunlight filled modern wing is largely full of European and U.S. artists? Why did the current first floor modern exhibition make me feel like I was in another dumbed down Field Museum exhibit?
