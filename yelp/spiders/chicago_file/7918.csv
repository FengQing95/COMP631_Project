Art Institute of Chicago////The rest of the collection is very good as well, although the museum has some very obvious weaknesses; it's really not encyclopedic the way the Met is, but then, few museums are. But fiddle-faddle. This place is full of iconic works. The huge El Grecos are probably the high point of the old master collection; some of the American paintings here are among the most famous ever painted. And, although the collections of ancient art are small, the objects in those collections are of high quality (and, when you consider that the Oriental Institute is just a short drive away, you really can't fault the museum for focusing its efforts elswhere). But the impressionists and post-impressionists really steal the show.
