Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Wow. I hadn't been to Chicago in over 20 years and I was excited to have some good deep dish pizza again. Unfortunately the pizza was very thin and dry, nothing like what a Chicago deep dish pizza should be. The service was pretty awful as well. Maybe it was a bad night, but I sure did expect a lot more from them.
