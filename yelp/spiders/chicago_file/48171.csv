Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A favorite spot with my friends, we've had many birthday dinners here. I usually get the empanadas with the beef being my favorite. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very fitting but the location can be hard to get to by public transportation; involves some walking and we usually opt for an uber. My biggest grievance with the place is that they don't split the bill when you go with a group of friend so you end up having to split everything equally.
