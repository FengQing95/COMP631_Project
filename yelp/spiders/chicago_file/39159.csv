Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Let me start with the appetizers. The baked crab cake is a must! I wish I ordered 2 of them honestly they were so good. It was also a healthy serving. The baked crab cake was blue crab, romoulade , and lemon. It was probably the best crab cake I ever had. The steak tartare was also delicious with dijonnaise, a slow cooked egg on top, and a good helping of bread. There was also bread for the table if you needed more. This was a solid tartare.
