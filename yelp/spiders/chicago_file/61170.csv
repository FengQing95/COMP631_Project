Smoque BBQ////I love this place. I think their pulled pork and ribs are just outstanding. So why a one star review ? After loving the food, I decided to take home a bottle of sauce. Bored and for no apparent reason I decided to read the ingredient label- probably wanted to see if I could duplicate it and maybe tweak it. And there it was High Fructose Corn Syrup ! Â Really? Totally disappointed in such a seemingly well thought out highly researched business. Barbecue ain't health food but this stuff is pure poison and completely unnecessary. There are tons of barbecue joints and sauces that don't use it. I'm flabbergasted.
