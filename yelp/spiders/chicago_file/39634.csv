Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Incredible dining experience! The atmosphere is unlike any other and gives off a real cool vibe. We've been here a few times now and we continue to have amazing experiences. We decided to bring our own wine this time and the options were a $50 corkage fee or the fee was waived if you chose to share a glass with another table. We were more than happy to share (plus the server didn't pour a whole lot in the third glass) so we opted to share with another table. Our service was impeccable and the food was out of this world. We ordered the petite duchess filet (6 oz.) and the short rib stroganoff...which was out of this world. We also ordered the truffle Mac and cheese and broccoli, which were both insanely tasty! We didn't save much room for dessert but this was by far one of the best meals/experiences we've had! Can't wait to come back again!
