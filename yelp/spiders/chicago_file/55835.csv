Smoque BBQ////My preferred sides are the corn bread and fries -- you get more fries than you know what to do with and they're a nice-thickness of fresh cut potato.  Cobbler is good, as are the beans and mac & cheese.  Cole slaw comes standard with just about every selection and is amazing -- it's vinegar based with red onions in it; and one day I'm going to re-create it in my kitchen, I swear!
