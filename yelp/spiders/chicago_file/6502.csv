The Purple Pig////The first highlight of the evening for me, was the meat and cheese trays! They always feel fancy and you just can't go wrong! They totally delivered! But I'm pretty sure that basically everyone else was the most excited about the tuna tartare appetizer. I have to say that the presentation was quite exquisite! Although the bone marrow felt particularly fancy as well! It was served with thick slices of bread that were quite toasted and crispy on the outside, but very fluffy and light on the inside. It tasted delicious with the capers and cilantro provided!
