Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Was very disappointed however with the experience leading up to the pizza. We went in FULLY expecting a long wait. When we got there, the hostess told us it would be an hour and a half wait. Fine. Totally anticipated that. We left to go get some drinks next door and hang out and watch some sports. We did not come back to Lou Malnati's for another THREE HOURS because the wait was so long. We anticipated a wait, as I said, but when the wait ends up being DOUBLE what you were told, there seems to be a problem. We were in town and dead set on trying the restaurant so we still would have waited if they told us originally that the wait was 3 hours. But I got the feeling that they were just telling people less time in an attempt to not turn them away. Bad customer service.
