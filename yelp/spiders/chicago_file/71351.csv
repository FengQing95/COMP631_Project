Little Goat Diner////Biggest down side was service...place was pretty empty and yet server wanted entree order when we placed appetizer order and managed to deliver first round of drinks after appetizers arrived. Still practically a ghost town at 6 pm when server wanted us to place dessert order-despite recent arrival of second round of drinks(after half table had finished eating).
