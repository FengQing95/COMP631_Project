Little Goat Diner////Super yummy and quick fast food spot! It's extremely easy to order through their outside window and there's plenty of spots around for high tables, picnic tables, and cute lawn chairs. They also have big connect 4 and cute greenery in their outdoor space located on the street. I ordered sourdough pancakes with the peachy Daly & mimosa. It was all delicious and super fast service! The employees were extremely friendly. Would love to come back!
