Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great ambience. There may be a wait, but the cocktails, which are really good, will shorten that. The Foie gras and berry jam were delicious. Also had the Crab-cake, which totally recommend. Had the bone-in steak, which was cooked exactly as requested, was juicy and tender. would recommended to dine here without reservations. most certainly a great addition to Chicago's already awesome dining scene.
