Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The deep dish: This was my first time having real "deep dish" pizza and I loved it! I was expecting it to be loaded with bread, but it was the total opposite. The crust is thin, crisp and loaded with toppings (a little too much toppings for me) but it's delicious! I was with a party of 5 and we split 2 mediums with about 3 slices left over.
