Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Its ok. I think the crust is too brittle and I have only had the sausage pizza. But the sausage that is a flat circle on top of the dough, so it covers the entire pizza, is a good idea, but too much for me. We tried the sausage with bits of sausage spread around the pizza, Â and it was way too sparse. We took it back it was so sparse. So.... happy medium?
