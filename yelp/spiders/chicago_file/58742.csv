Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here to catch up with some out of town friends. Hadn't been here in 6 years and I think the food has gotten better. The place is also spacious. I will note that they space their reservations 90 minutes apart and will ask you to leave to seat other patrons. Overall, food, service, and ambiance were great. Desserts didn't really shine. I want to come back for the paella. Sadly wasn't drinking this time, but their drink selection and sangria is great!
