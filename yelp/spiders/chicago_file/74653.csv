Little Goat Diner////Walked in to a super cute, hip, clean diner and a welcoming staff.  Sat right at the counter which is A-OK with me and watched the kitchen energy and banter (made me miss working in a restaurant....just a little).  Amanda my waitress was super cute and friendly and overly animated but I liked it.  Ordered the cold brew iced (I heart cold brew) and this did not disappoint.  Also ordered the Kimchi bloody mary.  it was tart and spicy with yummy little garnishes.
