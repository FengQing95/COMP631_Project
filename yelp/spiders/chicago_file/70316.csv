Little Goat Diner////I did enjoy watching the girl next to me pick all the onions out of her grilled cheese, when asked if she would like anything else she said "no, this is fine" in such a defeated voice. Â I imagine like many of the five star reviews here on Yelp after dropping $60 of breakfast refuse to admit they have been food raped. Between all the hype and all the mediocrity who can blame them.
