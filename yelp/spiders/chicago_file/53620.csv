Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It's hard to hate tapas and this place does them great. Everything we had was wonderful. The peri peri chicken is fantastic, the blue cheese fillet is incredible and bacon wrapped dates were on point. Also I try to have goat cheese and marinara everywhere that serves it and this was some of the best as the bread was fantastic.
