Little Goat Diner////I really wanted to love this place since we loved our Girl & the Goat experience. The crab dip was nothing special which was a bummer. My husband got the fried chicken and I got the pork cemitas sandwich. Both entrees were perfectly cooked, but both lacked some serious flavor. Our waitress talked up the seasonings on the pork and none of them came through. We will not return.
