Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Hands down one of the best pizza places in the city! Every time I order, whether its just for my self or the whole family, everything gets devoured. Ingredients always taste fresh and the sauce is the right kind of zesty and the thickness of their pan pizzas is just superb. This is the kinda pizza that just wants to make you do a song and dance!
