Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We arrived at 8:30 for our reservation and our table was not ready for us.  We were instructed to wait at the bar and have a drink, which was fine because I wanted so much to try some of the cocktails that had received good press in Time Out Chicago.  Except my friend and I waited 10 minutes without a bartender acknowledging us or taking our drink order.  It's fine, I told myself: I'm not a lush (seriously, I swear) and can order a drink when we are seated.  We were seated downstairs, which has much more of a lounge vibe than the upstairs jazz-era bar.  Needless to say, the atmosphere at Bavette's is a much-welcome departure from the stuffy "boys club" feel that many prestigious steak houses have.
