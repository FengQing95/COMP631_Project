Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////THE LOU is the best pizza I've ever had. However, at this location, do not sit in John S's area. It took him 20 minutes just to welcome my friend and I (I was in the bathroom), and he never once acknowledged me during the visit. I would hope it's because he felt guilty for the pathetic service he provided.
