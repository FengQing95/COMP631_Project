Little Goat Diner////We had 4 people in our party & we all tried a different entree. My boyfriend had the beef ravioli (it was pretty good), one friend had a mushroom burger that looked unbelievable & she loved it. It was topped with plenty of cheese & meat & definitely sharable! Our other friend had a goat burger and added an egg. He loved it! I had the pork belly pancake because of all of the wonderful reviews about it and it was SO SO GOOD! It has a bit of an Asian flare to it. It was like nothing I had ever tasted before & that was exactly what I was looking for at Little Goat!
