Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////          The place is large, crowded, and pretty loud. Moreover, the server had so many tables, service suffered a bit, it wasn't horrible but if you're the type that likes being waited on hand and foot you won't be pleased.  We did order a pitcher of Sangria, but $90 for a party of four is still a lot for me.
