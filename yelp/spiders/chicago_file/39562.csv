Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Update: STILL FIVE STARS!!!! My husband and I went to the Bavette's in Las Vegas and we had a horrible experience. Corrine T was kindly enough to reach out and make up for the horrible experience we had in Vegas. When we went back to Bavette's in Chicago, EVERYONE was aware of the incident we had. We were given champagne on the house right away. Everyone REALLY cared to hear about how completely different our experience at each location was! The food was great as always. Bavette's Chicago is one of the reasons we are so sad to be leaving Chicago! My husband and I will always be more than happy to pay the prices at Bavette's Chicago because  of the caring  staff and their willingness to go above and beyond for their customer's happiness and satisfaction! There is just not enough wonderful things that I can say about Bavette's Chicago! Thank you for taking great care of us, every time!!
