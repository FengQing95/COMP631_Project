Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Arrogant.  Please do not go here.  They do not need your business.  Their hostess and manager can figure out how to reign people in on their own.   Made us wait for an hour because our friend's flight was delayed.  Still sat us at the table that did not need the seat anyway - was too small.   There are other places in Chicago.  Go to a place that better understands what it takes to please a group of people that will not bat an eye on good food and drinks.  So not only did they displease 6 different people, but now they have spoiled it for their friends and everyone else we will tell not to go there.  Food was good - the chef should find a new place to work!  There are better people out there to manage his/her talent.
