Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I adore this place...it's one of my favorites in the city!  The atmosphere is gorgeous--big booths, crystal chandeliers, and a beautiful bar.  And the food lives up to the decor.  My go-to is a Manhattan, the beef bourguignon, and the malted-whiskey ice cream dessert.  Nothing quite like it!
