Little Goat Diner////the goat almighty burger is amazeballs. goat pattie alone would have made a fine burger (of which is available for an extra $2 on any burger) but the braised beef was the winner in the meat race. the triple threat burger of braised beef, bbq pulled pork, goat pattie mountain hugged in brioche is even better paired w/the hash and biscuits + gravy.
