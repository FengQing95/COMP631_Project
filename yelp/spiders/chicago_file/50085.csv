Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went here for lunch one afterdnoon during my vacation to Chicago, after all that I've heard about their Spanish tapas. First thing that caught my eye on the menu was a little note stating that all charcuterie, cheese, olive oil, rice and spices are imported directly from Spain. Pretty neat!
