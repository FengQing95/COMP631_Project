Smoque BBQ////The first time I had baklava was in Istanbul.  Not only was it authentic baklava in the most beautiful city in Turkey, but it was from the chef that's renowned from making the best baklava in the world.  It was amazing.  UHMAZING.  The result?  All other baklava tastes like shit to me.
