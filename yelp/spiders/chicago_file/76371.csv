Little Goat Diner////On a Friday around 11AM, this place was PACKED. I was dining alone and sat at the counter, the typical spot at a diner for a loner. The food was delicious, the service was superb, and the drinks were wonderful. My server was so pleasant and offered great suggestions. I would love to go here again and I could take a bath in the BBQ Maple Syrup!
