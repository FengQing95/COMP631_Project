Art Institute of Chicago////Amazing. No matter how many times you've been here, you feel like you haven't seen everything. There's a great range of art mediums and movements, and even if you're not especially familiar with art history, you'll be able to see plenty of famous things you'll recognize. My only complaints would be that occasionally the place gets a bit too busy with tourists, that it closes a lot earlier than I would like and that a few of the visiting exhibits have been lackluster. But overall, it's one of my favorite museums and a must-see if you're a visitor to Chicago.
