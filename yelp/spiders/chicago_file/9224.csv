Art Institute of Chicago////You can spend hours in this museum! It's huge! Definitely worth checking out if you're in Chicago. All the paintings were amazing and you'll find yourself sitting there in awe. This is definitely a dream place for artists. I think the Impressionism was the best, in my opinion. All the exhibits were really interesting to read/learn about.
