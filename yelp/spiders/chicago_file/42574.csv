Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is the best tapas place I've tried! Every thing on the menu is great! Peach Sangria so good! Gotta get the baked goat cheese, shrimp, meatballs, spicy Potatoes and banana dessert. Perfect place for girl friends or a date to meet up. Tapas is perfect for sharing and you can order a lot to try!
