Little Goat Diner////Little Goat, a walk away from Girl and the Goat, is a little less fancy, but you can go here without making a reservation(huge plus)! The first thing I noticed is that the place the cutest inside! Someone once told me that Chicago restaurants have the best decor, and I do believe it. It reminds me of a diner, but a little more modern with dainty chandeliers and lights and adorable patterned wallpaper. The service here is especially great! Our server was very happy to be there for us as it was our first time.
