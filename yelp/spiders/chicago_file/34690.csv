Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Hands down the best crab cakes I've eaten in Chicago. Also, the truffle Mac n Cheese was beyond divine. The service was great and when the steak was a little undercooked, the server was extremely apologetic and brought out a new one right away. The ambience is very 1950s classic--velvet couches, candle-stands, etc.
