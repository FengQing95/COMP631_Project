Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////An absolute gem of a restaurant!  The atmosphere is fantastic and the service is impeccable.  Angela (Angie) was an incredible server.  She was so nice and made sure I have everything I needed.  The food was five star.  Had the petite duchess cut filet, side of bone marrow, and half baked potato.  Everything was delicious.  The sourdough bread is truthfully the best bread I have ever had and the mixed greens and apple salad was fresh and creative.  I will definitely be back the next time I am in Chicago.
