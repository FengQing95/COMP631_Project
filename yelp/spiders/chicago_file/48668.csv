Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was so awesome! The bacon wrapped dates, grilled asparagus, garden salad, and meat skewers was enough for one person or if you are forced to share that is fine too. I also recommend the white wine sangria if they have it! I may have to find a recipe to recreate it. Overall for 9 people it was around $37 per person when we split the bill up.
