Little Goat Diner////I came here with my husband for brunch at about 11 a.m. on a Saturday.  We were informed that there would be a 45 to 60 minute wait.  They took my phone number and said they would text when it was time to come back for a table.  We were able to walk up to Publican Quality Meats and browse around before they texted us to come back.  I really like this texting feature and I hope more restaurants start doing this.  We were seated at the counter.  Our server was very nice and attentive and our water was always refilled before we drank more than half of it.
