Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I can't say enough about this place!  I was tasked with planning a dinner for a large group staying in Chicago for a few days, and found this place through Yelp and other sources.  I was in touch with the restaurant about 2 weeks before our trip to Chicago.  They responded to my reservation request within hours, then assisted me with reserving a table even though I adjusted the number of guests and the time of the reservation in the next couple of days.
