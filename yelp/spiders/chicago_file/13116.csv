Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Anyway. A group of my friends and I went around closing time of Lou Malnati's and luckily got a table. We ordered a plain deep dish pizza and a sausage deep dish pizza. The plain was delicious and I thought it was actually better than Gino's East, which I had had only a few days earlier. I wish I could say the same thing for the sausage deep dish though. The sausage seemed to cover the entire pizza and was completely overwhelming. I really did not enjoy it very much.
