Art Institute of Chicago////Well, jokes on me cause they were so so so right. One can easily devote a whole day here (significant others willing). I like to think I am a quick museum tourer (e.g, quick walking with little interest in pottery or furniture), but even my darting through rooms we couldn't get out under 3 hours and I certainly didn't see everything I'd liked.
