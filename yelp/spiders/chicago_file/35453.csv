Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////And I haven't even begun to rave about the food. We weren't crazy hungry, so we each got a steak, a 6oz filet mignon and the 24oz prime bone in rib-eye, and shared a side of elote style corn as per our waitress' recommendation. While the side dish was a bit underwhelming, the filet mignon was cooked to perfection and had a wonderful taste, while the rib-eye was really juicy, with just the right amount of saltiness. By far two of the best steaks I have ever tasted.
