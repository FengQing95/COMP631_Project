Lou Malnati's Pizzeria//// We asked the three employees standing around the hostess stand for a box, and they said they would let our server know, obviously they never did because he didn't come back with a box. We laid our credit card on the table to let him know we were ready to pay, too bad the attentiveness to customer's is so lacking at such a well known pizza resteraunt.
