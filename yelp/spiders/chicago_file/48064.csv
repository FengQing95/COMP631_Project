Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was an awesome experience. We came here for my father's birthday and it was great. Everything we tried was delicious. My sister is vegan and a few of us are vegetarian and there were plenty of options. They were very accommodating and we received our food really quickly. We even brought our own cake and they cut it and served it to us. The atmosphere was great. It wasn't too loud or too crowded. Music was lovely. I highly recommend. My only issue was that our waitress would disappear for extended periods of time, especially towards the end of our meal, and it made our leave awkward and far more lengthy than it needed to be. I'm sure she just got busy. Overall, it was a really good and fun meal for us.
