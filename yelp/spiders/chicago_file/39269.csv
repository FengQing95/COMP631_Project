Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The vibe is super cool, which is why we picked it--low lighting, exposed brick, and a 20's speakeasy vibe with jazzy music playing. It definitely felt like a romantic date spot, and you wouldn't feel out of place in a dress or a suit. We had heard about the BYO wine policy and tried it out. It worked just like we'd heard: you can bring in a bottle of wine per every 2 people, and they will serve it to you as long as you share a glass with someone else in the place. We asked for our shared glass to go to someone else celebrating a special occasion, but no one celebrating wanted white wine, so they matched us up with another table who was participating in the BYO so we each sent a glass to the other, which was nice. The service was also great--our waiter was polite and attentive, but also gave us uninterrupted time.
