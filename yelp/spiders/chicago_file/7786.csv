Art Institute of Chicago////Even if you don't know any of the artists or pieces I mentioned, or you may not be an art-lover, don't pass up the chance to visit this museum.  You may find something you enjoy here.  It's also a great way to study art: the museum provides personal audio tours that give great insights into the major works displayed here.
