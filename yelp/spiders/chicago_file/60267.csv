Smoque BBQ////So let me tell you, watching the food network before bed is a bad idea.  Catching an episode that involves BBQ is probably the worst you can do for yourself and to top it off they cover a place in Chicago.  All day I dream about BBQ!  I had BBQ on the brain all day at work and when the time finally came to head to SMOQUE I was so excited.
