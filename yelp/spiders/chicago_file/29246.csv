Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I went back on the keto diet and wanted to try the crustless pizza. I thought it was really good! My friend didn't care for the grayish color of the sausage, even though I told him it can happen when cooking sausage. Sometimes, biting into it could get frustrating because the cheese wants to come all the way off, but the taste was just like a pizza and I would definitely order it again. It's nice to have another ketogenic option and not have to cook.
