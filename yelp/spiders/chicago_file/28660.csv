Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Absolutely the best pizza I've ever had in my life. Once you get one whiff of their food, you don't mind the long wait. They restaurant's app shows you how far down the wait list you are which makes the wait go faster. The original Lou Malnati's deep dish was cheesy perfection. The service was also phenomenal!  We appreciated Zach's patience with us!  I recommend you ask for him as your server!  Lou Malnati's is a must during any visit to Chicago!
