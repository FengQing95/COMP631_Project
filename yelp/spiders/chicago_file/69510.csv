Little Goat Diner////We are from out of town and this made our list of places to try. I loved the food here and would definitely come back. I had the chickpea salad with grilled chicken (it was awesome - oversized salad with crunchy kale, cool and creamy tzatziki dressing, and several delicious falafel arranged around the bowl). For some reason the grilled chicken was the best I'd had in a long time - not sure what they did to make it is so good but they did. I tried a taste of my daughter's crumpets (Delish!); I'm a bread lover and this can make any bread lover happy. Â I tried the smoked fries - just ok - nothing special to me? I couldn't figure out the "smoked" part. They came highly recommended by the waiter but they were just shoestring style french fries. But the accompanying sauces with the fries were very interesting - I preferred the thicker, hotter orange-colored sauce. We also had a side/appetizer of the not chinese broccoli. It was very tasty.
