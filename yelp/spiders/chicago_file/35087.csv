Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So, the waiter finally takes our order. I order the Classic Ribeye - Chicago Cut, medium rare, with a side of creamed spinach. This was the first time in my dining history that I received a steak that had fat on the sides of it. I could not believe it; I am sure that the look on my face demonstrated my unhappiness because we only saw our waiter again once in the next hour and a half. Now, notice that I said an hour and a half. That's how slow these people were. We did not get out of there until 11 PM. I never got another drink because, again, the waiter disappeared on us.
