Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Yum! So glad we went here for deep dish. I got the personal cheese and it was the perfect size for one person. The pizza takes a really long to come out and we came at a pretty busy time and weren't seated right away (2pm on a Friday) but they had a great system in place where you could put your pizza order in while you were still waiting to be seated so you can be in and out a little quicker. It still took a good 40 minutes after being seated to get the pizzas but it was definitely well worth it. The beer is a great price and they have a lot of appetizers to choose from while you wait. The desserts also looked really good but we were both too full after the deep dish. I would definitely recommend Lou's to anyone looking for good pizza in the city, especially deep dish!
