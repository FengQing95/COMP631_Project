Little Goat Diner////I had every intention of having breakfast, since they serve it all day. However, since it was nearly 1 PM and the girls had recommended the sprouts, I had to change to my lunch plan. I was going to try their Ruben, I wanted to add a new entry to my list here on Yelp. Â Then as I was talking to my hispster waiter, I had a sudden piffany. I'm at the Little Goat DIner, so I should eat goat. I selected the Kilgus Goat Burger as my sandwich. For those of you have not tried goat before, don't be scared, give it a try.
