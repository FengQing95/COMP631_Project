Smoque BBQ////As we ate, my friend remarked that he felt like a cow.  I thought perhaps this was related to his meal (though in retrospect that made no sense since the portions are what I think is being called "sensible" these days).  It turns out that he was referring to the process of ordering and getting seated.  You slowly mosey up to the counter, place your order, go to the seating police, who then directs you to a table.  You then get to rub elbows w/ other patrons -- yes, I mean physically -- while you eat.  And that's if the table police is not too busy spraying the table right next to yours to turn it over for new neighbors.  (My arm actually got misted a bit.)
