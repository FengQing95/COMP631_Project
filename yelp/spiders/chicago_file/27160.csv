Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Awesome Chicago style pizza!!! I had the pequod and Lou back to back within the two days on my Chicago trip and comparing the two pizzeria, Lou is lighter in taste, not as greasy. I wouldn't necessarily say one is better than the other, more so that they are cater to two different customer group. If you want a crunchier crust and not as heavy in taste, you would like Lou's pizza. Make sure tho to get their buttercrust, that's what they are famous for.
