Smoque BBQ////Yea, so we fell for it. It was on tv, we had to go. Well, and at the time we lived like 2 blocks away so we were shocked to have never noticed the place before. At first it was exciting. The smells were good, the place was small but wasn't packed, and the prices seemed fair. Well, the brisket is good but not the 'omg best ever'. Still better than Famous Daves. The brisket chili, however, is amazing. The mac n cheese...doesn't even hold a candle to Kumas or even my own home made. I think the breadcrumb topping tastes like burnt grated parmesan more than anything. The bbq sauce itself is fairly good, but Im not sure I get the hype on that either.
