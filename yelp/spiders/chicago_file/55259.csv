Smoque BBQ////Stopped by after seeing this place on DDD.  It was a small place with a ton of people.  They handled the crowd very efficiently.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  We tried a variety of food and it was all very good.  Sliced brisket and St. Louis Style ribs were fantastic.  I wasn't crazy about the sauce, it was more tangy...I prefer sweet.  I also thought some of the menu was slightly overpriced.
