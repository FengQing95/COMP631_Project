Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here for my birthday dinner in August, and I loved it. I heard high praise about this place from my coworker and other friends, and it had been on my list for a long time. The bacon-wrapped dates were as amazing as others have said, and they were excellent, probably the best things I had all night. I don't think I found any of the tapas disappointing, and the octopus was also really really good. The seared scallops were also great. I love how many options they have, and I wish I could remember every single thing I ate.
