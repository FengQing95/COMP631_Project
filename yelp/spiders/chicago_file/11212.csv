Art Institute of Chicago////A SF Chronicle columnist who shall remain nameless penned a column a few years back in which she asserted that San Francisco is not a world class city.  She got quite a bit of blowback from readers then wrote a second column defending her position and, were we talking solely about museums, I'd honestly concede.  San Francisco has a handful of museums but as hard as I wish, I have to admit they have no museums approaching anything like the Art Institute of Chicago.
