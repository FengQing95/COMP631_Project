Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here many times throughout the past few years and have always had a good dining experience.  Tapas and sangria are what shine here, so plan on spending at least an hour here and ordering to share!   I've gone with and without reservations, and have never had to wait long for a table to open up.  There is a really nice bar area, so it's nice to sit there and have a drink before being seated.
