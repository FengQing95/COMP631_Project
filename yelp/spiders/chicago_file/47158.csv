Smoque BBQ////You know this is real BBQ when you walk in and that smell of smoke hits you.  I was not a big brisket fan until I went here.  The brisket is one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life.  It's that good.  But you have to get the sliced (fatty) brisket.  The fat is rendered so well that it melts in your mouth.  Sauce should be used as little as possible so you can taste that smoky meat.  The pulled pork is hit or miss.  I've had it when it was smoky and delicious, and I've had it when it was bland.  Babyback ribs are great.  I only tried them, so I want to order a slab next time.  St. Louis Ribs are good too, but I liked the babybacks better.  Fries are some of the best anywhere too.  Mac N Cheese is very good too.  You can sub the cole slaw for a cornbread muffin too.  They can get busy, so expect a short wait of 10-15 minutes.  There is a patio for outside eating.  I am mystified how popular they are and there is only the one location.  I am sure it will change someday.  This is one of Chicago's new (in the last 10 years) treasures.  I had a friend from Philadelphia come in and I took him to Portillo's (Vienna hot dog, Italian Beef), Al's (Italian Beef), Malnati's (deep dish), Pequod's (deep dish), and Marie's (Chicago thin crust pizza) and he felt Smoque was the best meal overall (though he loved everywhere we went of course!).  I don't even know why you are reading this.  You can see by how many stars this place gets that most people love it.  Expect to pay about $15-20 if you really want to experience this place right and get a couple of meats.
