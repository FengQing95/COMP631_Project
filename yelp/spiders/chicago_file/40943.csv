Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Meh.  Went on a Friday after thinking about it for a few years.    It was overcrowded, loud, and we were lucky enough to be seated in Siberia near a table of 22.  Our waiter was ok, but I am guessing the drunk cougar table next to us was sucking down his time and patience.  The one thing I did like is they have Pintxos, so it gave us a chance to do a little sampling before settling in on dishes.    For the amount of food you get, the prices are ok, but the quality was nowhere near what I had at Meze or that I am used to at Emilios.    So for our Pintxos, we had the chorizo-wrapped medjool date & cheese, and the chorizo was really greasy, the dates not super soft.  Next!  ahi tuna poached in olive oil on avocado toast.  This was good.   Next: mushroom & rice croqueta, pretty bland.  I then switched over to butternut squash & cheese toast, kale & apple salad .  It was really good.   My dinner companions had albondigas al jeréz, meatballs in tomato sauce, which they said were good but bland. Higher on the list of my fellow dinner goers were: citrus-cured salmon, cucumber, crema & toast, spiced lamb kebabs with lemon, mint & tomato, goat cheese baked in tomato sauce and paella con pollo y verduras.   It was restaurant week, so they all got desserts with their restaurant week menu.  The highest rated were the carmelized banana, and the dulce de leche.    Honestly, although I am complaining about the table next to us, we all hedged bets on the bill, which was for 21 women and one guy.   We guessed the guy in the suit picked up the check for.....$1700.  We asked our waiter.  I think he was so glad when they left he wanted to sit down with us.
