Little Goat Diner////I loved Girl and the Goat so I was pumped for Little Goat Diner since breakfast food is my jam. I had a really tiring night and was half asleep at arrival but the food invigorated my soul. We ordered the this little piggy went to China, the bullseye French toast, pork belly Home fries, and the fatoush salad. The waitress was very nice and helpful in giving us the most popular dishes which we then ordered.
