Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I only gave it 3 stars because the servers were friendly, but their pizza was subpar.  Maybe because I had high expectations from their reviews. I came in at 11am. The place was pretty empty. Ordered a small pizza with sausage and onions.  Waited about 40 minutes for the pizza arrive from my order (as expected). So now here goes my pizza critic: the pizza was not hot, so my cheese wasn't stretching. It was lacking sauce, as there was more cheese than sauce. The crust was hard and bland. Maybe because I didn't order the butter crust, but the it was dry and hard. Tasted like cardboard. Glad we didn't order a larger size.
