Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite restaurants to enjoy some delicious tapas or paella. A group of us came in yesterday & enjoyed our time. Our server had a few mishaps but he was so friendly & attentive it didn't bother us. I was looking over our receipt & noticed we were charged for the plate that our server accidentally brought out. This has happened to me twice now at ba ba reeba...I partially blame myself & the sangria for not double checking the bill.
