Smoque BBQ////While we waited outside the owner appeared and taped an apology on the door for running out of brisket. Ten minutes later he replaced that sign with an out of pulled pork/out of brisket sign. None of this looked good, and some other peeps in line began to scuttle away to their safe little plan B Thai places. Fail.
