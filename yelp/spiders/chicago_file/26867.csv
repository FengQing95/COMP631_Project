Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This review is strictly on the quality of the food that we had delivered to us (it's about half a mile away). Originally we planned to dine-in but when we got there, the place was crowded and they said the wait time would be nearly an hour (and this was on a Monday night). We opted instead to have the pizza delivered to our hotel and relax with a movie since we weren't up to deal with the noise and figured the pizza would get cold on the walk back if we got it to go. We ordered "The Lou" and the combination platter and it took about 45min which was fine.
