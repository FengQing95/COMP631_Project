Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our only quibble was receiving salad-size plates to share our entrée and side.  Apart from that, attention to detail was impeccable.  We were celebrating our anniversary and the server brought us each a complimentary glass of champagne; our desserts arrived amid a blaze of sparklers.  It was great fun to observe diners at nearby tables gaping in awe at their supersized seafood towers.  The contemporary smooth jazz soundtrack was elegant and did not intrude on conversation.  We can't wait to return.
