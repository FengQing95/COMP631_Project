Little Goat Diner////We had an early Â dinner there last night before going to the theater. We were 6 people and sat at a big booth next to the window. The hostess was very nice and sat us right away. Our waiter was very attentive. We started with crab dip and bread sticks. We had chicken pie, fish tostadas, all American hamburger, patty burger and the goat hamburger. Everybody enjoyed their dinners. The food was delicious. The kids drunk chocolate milkshake and they enjoyed them very much. We'll be back!
