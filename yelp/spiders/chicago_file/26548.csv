Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We stopped by this location as it was in the area close by the Doughnut Vault to pick up a small 9" pizza for two, which consisted of 4 slices of pizza.  It took 30 minutes to make from the moment you place the order, so we were lucky to have one person in the car (street parking is $2 per 30 minutes or so) and the other person waiting for the food.We chose to sample their Chicago's Classic Small Pan deep dish with butter crust for ~$16 and thought the toppings were just A-OK.  The crust definitely won us over, but the presentation and toppings did not blow us out of the water. We picked to have lunch at the Millennium Park close by, so maybe if we dined in next time our opinion will change.
