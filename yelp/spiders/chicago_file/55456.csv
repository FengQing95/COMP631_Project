Smoque BBQ////This is the best BBQ joint I have come across north of 35th Street.  The St. Louis Ribs have an excellent dry rub that blend a number of spices well.  The brisket is awesome with the right amount of moisture and flavor.  I haven't had a chance to try the other selections but  I have made it my personal mission to try every menu item at least once.  The sides are well prepared and compliment the meat.
