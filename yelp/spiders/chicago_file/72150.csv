Little Goat Diner////Stopped in with a friend on a Saturday and got a table outside.  Ordered cinnamon rolls to start (which were MASSIVE!) and then the little piggy went to China for my entree. My friends main dish came out and the runner noted that mine would be out momentarily.  Unfortunately, this turned into about a 20 minute waiting period (chili sauce ran out?) Server and two managers were very apologetic and ended up hooking us both up with a cocktail (vodka soda for me and a bloody for my friend)
