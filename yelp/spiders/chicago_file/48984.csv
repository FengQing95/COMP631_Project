Smoque BBQ////I'm just throwing my hat into the big love (smoke) ring of Smoque.  Barry is a fantastic host, the counter help are so friendly and man... the food... it's my new destination spot for out of town friends just looking for an easy start to the night.  The parking can stink, but it's so close to the Irving Blue Line that it's not a deterrent, especially with the lot in the back and the street parking in the neighborhood behind it at night.  I love the southeastern-style vinegar sauce, both kinds of ribs are so fantastically meaty and juicy (and you can get a half slab of both to try), the pulled pork is pretty standard but still great, and the slaw is done perfectly.  I love the baked beans, the mac & cheese - I have yet to try the brisket, but I fully plan to. It's BYO, and while I've done both wine and beer, I think that a Goose Island 312 goes perfectly.  It doesn't compete with the flavor of the food and is easy to come by.  I can't praise them enough, they are doing everything right!
