Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best pizza in Chicago. I have lived here my whole life and I always read sites listing top 10 pizza, etc - this one is my favorite. The butter crust is a must and make sure it's uncut and extra sauce. Then again this is like asking someone their favorite movie. Super personal and ratios of bread, cheese and sauce are different for everyone - Add it to the mix and judge for yourself.
