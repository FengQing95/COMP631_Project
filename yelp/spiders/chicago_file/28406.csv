Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Everyone else got one of the deep dish pizzas. I wasn't optimistic when I was told I MUST try a bite because it's "soooo gooood!" - but again I was wrong! It was soooo goooood! Definitely changed my opinion of deep-dish pizza. I guess I just hadn't ever had a good one prior!
