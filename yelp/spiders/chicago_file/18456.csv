Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have been the biggest fan for years. However in the past few weeks I have had nothing but issue with this location. It all started several weeks ago when I had placed a very large order. When it showed up it was late cold and incorrect. I called the restaurant to let them know I was very disappointed. At the time I call the woman I spoke with told me they were so sorry and would credit my account. In fact that is not what happened at all. Instead of crediting me they charged me twice. I have spoken with several different managers at the restaurant . They have told me that they can't access that one single day on there company records. They can see every day of the year just not October 7th. With that being said I have tried to be understanding. One of the managers was very nice  and for all the inconvenience offered me a free meal this past weekend. We were having people over and I took him up on the offer. Unfortunately when the order arrived It was not hot and incorrect. Fast forward 3 days and I called to see if we had found any resolution to the overcharging issue I also wanted them to know the the order they had sent me was less then satisfactory. I was put on the phone w a "manager ' that was rude basically implied I was making this all up. When I told him I was simply trying to resolve an issue that has been ongoing for over  a month. I have still not been credited $180 zero communication from the restaurant. If the owner of this local happens to see this review please reply. I'm really trying to resolve this issue however I will not just sweep this under the rug and except thus as a loss.
