Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The steak, a Chicago cut, was incredible. Perfectly cooked and so tasty! I sat at the bar, as I'd flown in for work meetings the next morning and didn't have a reservation. The bartenders were so nice and made some great drinks. Will definitely come back on my next trip to Chicago. I'll be sure to make a reservation next time.
