Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////During our visit, we put our name in for two.  Enjoyed a drink at the bar and sampled a little pizza at the hostess stand.  We were seated about after 30 minutes, which was the quoted wait time, and were promptly greeted by our friendly, helpful server Matt.  We enjoyed the family size starter house salad and a deep dish peperoni.  Delicious!
