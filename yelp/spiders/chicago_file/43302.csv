Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////That being said. Cafe Babareeba used to be much better. I went here in 2004 right after I moved to Chicago and it was phenomenal. Since then, it's become part of the Lettuce-Entertain-You chain and in my humble opinion lost a lot of it's charm. It's not that it's not good. It's just not unique.
