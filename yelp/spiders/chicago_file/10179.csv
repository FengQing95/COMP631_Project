Art Institute of Chicago////The reason I am giving them a 4 stars instead of a 5 is because I was a little shocked at some of the conversations the employees were having. It wasn't inappropriate, but the museum is so quite it was distracting.  This type of incident happened in several rooms with different sets of employees.  It's aboring job, I understand, but I came to look at art.
