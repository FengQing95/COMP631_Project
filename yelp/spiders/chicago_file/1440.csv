Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Incredible. Saw the reviews & looked super good & it did not disappoint! I got the Venetian scramble, with a side of cinnamon pancakes with roasted pecans. The scramble was cooked to perfection with a nice crisp top of cheese, two great eggs, & loads of flavor with some of the tastiest sausage I've had. There are no words to describe the pancakes, just order & enjoy!!
