Little Goat Diner////Not cheap but hopefully worth it! I like the creativity, freshness and homemadeness. Nice modern restaurant, clean and bustling, pleasant atmosphere, good service, good coffee, good food. Recommended if you want to drop some cash on breakfast! Next time I go I'll try to be more hungry!
