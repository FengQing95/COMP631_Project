Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This evening there was a snafu with our reservation (this has NEVER happened in three years) and we had to wait just a bit. They were very honest and helpful with updates and in the end comped our entire meal. That was completely unexpected on our end and we now love this place even more. We're already booked for Sunday brunch :D
