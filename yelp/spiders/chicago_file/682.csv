Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We waited an hour to eat breakfast in the blistering cold along with 50 other ppl. I only hoped the food was Â worth the wait and sure enough it was! Our server though was the best part of breakfast because she was not only efficient but so energetic. And I think because of her our food came out in seconds! I ordered the California Napa Fig Omelet and the GF honeycakes. One word...Uh-MAZING! I never thought to put figs in my omelet or drizzle honey over my GF pancakes but Wildberry did!!! People, this place is not just a hype...make it a point to eat here. You won't regret it.
