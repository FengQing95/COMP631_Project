Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Pretty spot on with how they do it in Spain! I lived in Northern Spain where pintxos are a big deal and I loved everything about this place. We tried the patatas bravas, the pork paella, the grilled hanger steak, and the passion fruit sangria and everything was so incredibly good. Impressed. Definitely would recommend and plan on telling everyone to check this place out!
