Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////While the place is pretty packed and loud (I wouldn't suggest this place for an intimate date or anything), it's a great place for a group of friends to hang out and get some great food at good prices. I can't say that the service was exceptional, as the waiter constantly spilled water on our table while refilling our glasses, but it certainly didn't detract from the experience.
