Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We couldn't wait to get to Chicago for a deep dish pizza.  Although takeout, this one was really good. I lighten the expectation because delivery. You kinda expect some mishaps.  We were right.  Apparently, you have to be specific and request the pizza be cut!  We received a whole uncut pizza! I'm literally still trying to figure out why?!! They made up for it, the pizza was awesome.  Loaded with meat, cheese and the sauce was really good.  Not messy or too much sauce just perfect!  The salad was so fresh, well stocked with all the salad goodies.  I like the fact they had the sense to give you Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes!  There is nothing like a delivery of a pizza and they don't bring it!  Good job on the pizza.  I'd be back but I would ask for well done, the top crust was a little too hard and crunchy.  It was really good nevertheless!
