Little Goat Diner////Was not impressed with food or service. We went there for a business lunch and had a few issues. First off, one person in our party ordered pork belly pancakes and requested no mayo. The waitress told us that it was made differently and that most people don't mind the mayo, but our table insisted that no mayo would be best. Although he requested no mayo, the plate was brought out with mayo. We had to return the plate and order something else. We were still charged for the plate even though it was their mistake. The pork belly appetizers were not very good and I wasn't too impressed by the goat burger.
