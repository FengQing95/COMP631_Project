Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service was horrendous. Everyone got their food at different times - there was at least a 10 minute lapse between the first dish that was dropped off and the last. The servers continuously dropped food off at one end of the table and expected us to pass the plates around - they had no interest and giving the correct person their plate. They wouldn't even announce the dishes, so we had to try and figure out each dish. They seemed completely oblivious to the concept of good service. And the biggest annoyance was that the place was not extremely crowded. There were at least 15 open tables around us, so I'm not sure why service was bad when it wasn't busy .
