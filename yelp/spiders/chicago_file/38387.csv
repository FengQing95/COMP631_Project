Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I have been wanting to go to Bavette's for over a year now, but it is such a popular spot (for good reason!) we could never find a reservation before 10pm. After reading more about the ambiance and seeing photos online I knew I had to get us there for our wedding anniversary to surprise my hubbie, and thankfully they had a reservation before 10pm! :)
