Smoque BBQ////If you are going to get a side though, GET THE COLESLAW. I was shocked at how amazing it was. I don't typically expect coleslaw to be the star of a meal, but this came close. It's delicious and packed with sweet flavor without having that excess of mayonnaise that most slaws have. Another winner was the fries - hand cut, crispy, and greasy in the best way. I was also a big fan of the peach cobbler. It uses canned peaches, which is a little weird, but still very delicious. The crust is super crumbly, buttery, and sugary. I really enjoyed it.
