Art Institute of Chicago////Expect to spend several hours here when visiting as there are plenty of galleries to walk through and enjoy. Â If you have a college student ID, be sure to present that to take advantage of the student price and also note prices are cheaper for both Illinois and Chicago residents. And you're under 18... it's free. Great spot to bring the kids and teens and make a learning experience of it.
