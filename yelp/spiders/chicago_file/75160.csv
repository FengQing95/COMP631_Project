Little Goat Diner////1.5 stars to the manager who tried to compensate for her rude hostess. She personally took us to our (communal) table (oops, all other tables were taken...because oops, sorry, they sat three other parties before us. Oops, did I mention that again?) She offered appetizers and drinks on the house (which again, very nice, but mom/teenager/grandma don't are eager drinkers, they were just hungry). She recommended the nachos, which were very good, and we asked for the chicken fingers. By the time we got them however, it was already so late (around 8:45, 75 min after reservation) that we ate them and were not hungry anymore. Points also to the manager for asking an experienced and very attentive waitress to take care of us (we saw her talking to the waiter that was assigned to our neighbors and explain the situation). We appreciated her effort.
