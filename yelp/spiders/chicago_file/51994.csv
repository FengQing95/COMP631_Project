Smoque BBQ////There's just something about less-than-kosher Chicago restaurants operated by Jews; maybe it's true love that drives them to the forbidden fruit, or maybe it requires a necessary dealing with the devil to get into the business, but in my experience, my fellow tribal Chicagoans do excellent things with treyf. First Hot Doug's, and now Smoque. We arrived at ~7:40 PM on a Thursday, and the line was just barely out the door, which is always a good sign. Our food was ready before 8:10; despite the sea of humanity in this establishment, you still probably eat quicker after entry than at a sit-down BBQ restaurant.
