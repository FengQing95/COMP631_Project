Art Institute of Chicago////I love going to the Art Institute, and it's a great way to spend an afternoon or a morning.  There is so much to see and I find a new favorite piece every time I go there.  Out of all the museums in Chicago, I pick the Art Institute first because I find it so interesting and the more you go the more you enjoy it.
