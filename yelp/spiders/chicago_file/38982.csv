Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This my all time favorite steakhouse. PERFECT DATE NIGHT SPOT! The lighting is dimly lit and dark so if your old and cant see menus or dark lighting creeps you out then go somewhere else. They have great selection of napa, burgundy and italian wines. For solo diners you can sit at the bar. They oysters I had were shucked perfectly. Wedge salad was yummy & huge. Steak was cooked perfectly and they let me top my steak with bone marrow which is every carnivores dream. Also the ice cream and sauce is way above average. I cant wait to go back!
