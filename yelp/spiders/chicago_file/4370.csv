The Purple Pig////The second time I visited was a Sunday around 3 pm so my friend and I didn't have to wait at all. Between the 2 of us, we ordered 3 dishes which was the perfect amount of food for us both. During both of these visits, the waiters were so helpful with their recommendations as well. I'm hoping to visit again soon.
