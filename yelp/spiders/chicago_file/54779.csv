Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Very good ambiance with amazing food. I's recommend that you call them for reservation and try to get a good spot, while waiting for your table, hanging out at the bar with some snacks and good wine even worth it! This place is always packed! Â The food is really good, but small portions (tapas) little expensive. Would to back on a Friday night.
