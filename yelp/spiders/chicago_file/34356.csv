Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We went here for dinner New Yea's Eve. To start, the atmosphere is nice. There are booths and tables. The tables located through the center of the front room are not very comfortable looking. The downstairs has a wonderful charm and atmosphere. We sat at a booth. The classic ribeye was nice. A bit salty but still enjoyable. The Brussels Sprouts were delicious but they really need to add less sugar. A lot less. Other than that, the flavors were lovely. We also had the bone marrow was good. The short rib stroganoff was delisious as well but a bit skimpy on the ribs. Pasta was nice and fresh. The waiter was to bring us our second drink order with the delivery of the meal but it didn't arrive until 5-10 min into it. Other than that, the staff was kind and efficient. We would definitely go back.
