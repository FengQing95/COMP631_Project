Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We tried the thin crust pizza with pepperoni. I think my bias against pepperoni may have shifted my opinion, but there were a few fundamental problems with the offering. The pepperoni was layered underneath the cheese, stretching across the entire pizza. I think that's too much pepperoni to pizza ratio. The pizza was also brought out a bit cold. The cheese had already hardened by the time I got to it, and the crust was a bit hard. While it wasn't awful, I would definitely stay away from it next time.
