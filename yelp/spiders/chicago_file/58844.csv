Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Babareeba is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I've been here many times and always have a great meal every time. Dinner is v good of course, but my fave is def brunch bc you can order off the brunch menu and the dinner menu. The staples I always get are the goat cheese with marinara, bacon wrapped dates (duh), potatas bravas, deviled eggs, avocado burrata toast, and stuffed shrooms. Off the brunch menu, I love the potato and onion omelette, the French toast, chicken skewers, and beef tenderloin Benedict. They also have fantastic sangria. Service is always excellent, major props for that! Highly recommend making a reservation and parking is sort of rough on Halsted. Pro tip: park on Armitage, east of halsted.
