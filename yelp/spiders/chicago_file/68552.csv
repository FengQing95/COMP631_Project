Little Goat Diner////I won't give it one star, the food was okay, but I feel a lot of the customers and reviews are from jaded people, because chef Izzard won top chef and has run a successful restaurant across the street. The 7 cooks I counted on the line needed to refocus, and whomever is in charge of FOH needs to have their employees focus on the customer, not chatting up each other.
