Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Being an East Coast guy I was curious to try the authentic deep dish of Chicago.  Everyone pointed out that Lou Malnatti's was the best.  The hearty chunky sauce was really good, better than Bertucci's (only way to compare on the east coast) and the cheese was heavy.  I have a huge appetite and could only finish 2 slices.  Don't order a pizza with the spicy peppers.  Its ingrained in the sauce and was way too hot.  Good pizza is you want a real full meal but no need to order a lot.
