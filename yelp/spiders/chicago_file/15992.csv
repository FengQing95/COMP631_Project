Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Coming from out of state, this was highly recommended from friends and local Chicagoans to come here. I have to say that the hype was a waste of stomach space. The classic pizza was a classic disappointment due to the watery tomato sauce topping and the bland crust that we didn't even eat. The sausage tasted like a regular breakfast sausage layered with some cheese. Best part of the meal was the tiramisu and the service and their special Lou's salad. I would not recommend this place for deep dish pizza and would say that it does not live up to the hype.
