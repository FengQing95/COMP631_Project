Little Goat Diner////Now on to the food. Oh lord, this place delivered above and beyond. Every bite was food-gasm. My pork belly pancakes were sooo delicious, the pork tender, with just the right amount of fat, a good balance of freshness, citrus and very bold flavor. Perfect texture, some crunch in there with the slaw. The slaw was not over powering which I'd had at some wannabe restaurants. The pancake is not actually pancake, this whole dish is salty. The pancake was very think, the pancake taste a bit weird at first but heck, I am not gonna complain, it was probably just my subconscious going crazy because of the good food. I also ordered the potato tampura, sooo rich and soo good. Â The fish tostada was also very fresh and flavorful. The dessert were good, but not as good as the entree, got the cake of the day which was mexican cinnaon and the sundae. The cake has the most amazing whipped cream that is homemade to the perfection. The sundae has chocolate dipped tortilla chips, and it is very savory because there is salted caramel and nuts. Third friend ordered the veggie burger and she said everything was homemade and the presentation was definitely wow.
