Art Institute of Chicago////Caveat: I hate art museums. It's not the art that bothers me, it's the anxiety over how long I have to stand in front of it in order to convey the appropriate level of contemplation. It's the standing I hate. I just want to walk. I'm a quick study, I don't need to stand in front of a painting, a glance will do.
