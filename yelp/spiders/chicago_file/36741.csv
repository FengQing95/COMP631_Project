Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Overall, the food, service, and atmosphere at Bavette's combined is what makes it one of my favorite restaurants ever. Everything was worth the price and I left extremely content with my meal. It was one of my favorite dining experiences I've had. As an excellent spot for celebratory dinners and dates, I am already looking forward to my next fantastic meal at Bavette's.
