Little Goat Diner////Not your typical diner, though they do have the diner staples and seem to do them well. I arrived nice and early, around 7:30am on a Sunday. The place wasn't full but there were already a few groups there, and within an hour or so it was pretty busy. Every other order I saw come out was for the corned beef hash, which looked really good -- corned beef hash is one of my usual favorite dishes, but after looking over the menu I had to try the "breakfast spaghetti 'n clams 'n crab." There was spaghetti and egg, in a white clam broth with bits of crab and guanciale and bok choy mixed in for a very tasty--if not very breakfast-y, though I didn't mind!--flavor combination.
