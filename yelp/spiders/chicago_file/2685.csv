The Purple Pig////We are from out of town, based on word of mouth and Yelp review we chose this one for lunch. We ordered 5 dishes/entries for 5 people. But quantity is less than expected for all dishes. So we ended up with ordering additional 3 dishes. Pig ear is so so, bone marrow is good too, smoked pig tongue is very tasty, I also like the octopus which normally tastes like rubber, finally the turkey leg confit with good quantity is very tender. Overall, it's bit on salty side, my wife thinks Â that all the dishes are too salty. Our Waiter was very helpful, he knew all the popular menu choices. So we spent $190 including tip for 5 people for lunch. Because of its prime location close to well known Chicago Tribune building, if you want a quality food, there's not much choice.
