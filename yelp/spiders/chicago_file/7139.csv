Art Institute of Chicago////Overall, I love this place. It's serene, exciting, heartbreaking, love inspiring, mischievous, piercing, and way too many others to begin to mention. I recommend you go and experience these great feeling and be inspired. Visit the Art institute because you want to see greatness or because you want to contribute to someone else's Â life, just go. Oh yeah, and visit the new Modern Wing.
