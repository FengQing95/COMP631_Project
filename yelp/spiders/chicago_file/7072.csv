Art Institute of Chicago////Definitely a must-visit.  It's worth having a plan when you make a visit, unless you've got all day to kill.  If that's the case, it's a great place to take a meandering walk through a multitude of time periods and forms of art.  The Impressionist galleries are my favorite, along with the miniatures, and while I'm not a huge fan of most modern art, the collection is worth seeing.  Great location, very helpful staff, and remember no flash photography!
