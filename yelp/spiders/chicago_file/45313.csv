Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went out to dinner here with 4 friends and everything was delicious! The mango sangria was awesome, and we really enjoyed the chicken paella, bacon wrapped dates, and baked goat cheese with tomato sauce (among like 7 other items we got, it was all great). The service was great too, very prompt and attentive!
