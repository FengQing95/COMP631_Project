Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Oh my my I love Bavette's. There is nothing negative I can say about this place. I always choose to eat in the basement because of the ambiance. The food is to die for and the service is unmatched. I usually get a filet and we always start with the goat cheese. Although at our last dinner my mother got the fried chicken.... A MUST HAVE. An item I had over looked because of its basic-ness but instantly regretted never ordering. I could honestly go on and on about how much I love Bavette's so instead of listening to me try it yourself. Highly recommend.
