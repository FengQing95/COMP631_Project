Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I wish I had one of these at home in Wisconsin.  I seriously have loved everything  I've gotten from this place so far!!!   The eggs, amazing, turkey bacon?  Spectacular!  Pancakes??  Don't even get me started...FANTASTIC!!!   Today I tried the banana cream pie pancakes and let me tell you: tasted like REAL bananas, real everything--so flavorful!!!   I don't even want to try any other breakfast place!  Robert, our waiter today, is ridiculously nice!  Great recommendations and an all around cheerful guy.  The ladies at the front are super friendly and they look like they love their job.  I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars.  Will come back here every time I'm in Chicago!
