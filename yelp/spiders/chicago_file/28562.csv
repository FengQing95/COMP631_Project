Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Okay it seems weird to write a review for Lou's because I've ordered from here for years- far too many years to count. But this is the only pizza I ever order. I LOVE their sauce and the thin crust. I always order extra sauce, baked well and not cut. The only thing I would say is the make sure when the customer says baked well that it is baked well (especially if you order extra sauce) . But overall I love Lou's and it is my go to pizza place.
