Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I came here alone while visiting Chicago, but the bill was covered by job, so I figured I would give it a try. It's kind of a darker, intimate place with a earlier 1900's bar kind of vibe. So, a little awkward being by myself, but whatever. I started with the mixed greens apple salad and then had the shortrib stroganoff. Both were excellent. But, to me, even more impressive than the food was the service. This place seems to be run like a well oiled machine. My server was awesome and the rest of the support staff were just as nice and efficient. Oh, and I love their BYOB wine rule - You can bring your own bottle, but then you have to share a glass with another table! Definitely will try to come back here next time in Chicago!
