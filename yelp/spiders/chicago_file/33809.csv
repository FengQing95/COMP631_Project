Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Ventured into Bavette's last night with a fellow chef/colleague. Atmosphere was great, although I assumed it would feel more like a traditional steakhouse. Seating in the restaurant is very mixed.  The booths are few and far between and the tables are very close together  We sat at a 2-top banquette sandwiched between 4 women on a "gals night affair" and two divorced men who wished they had our table.
