The Purple Pig////We ordered the bone marrow and the pig shoulder. The bone marrow was flavorful and had an interesting texture to it, a tad slimy. I read one of the reviews about the pig shoulder that said the meat melted in their mouth so I was super excited....to the point where I forgot to take a picture of it before eating it, but I'm sure someone else posted/will post a picture of it. While the meat didn't quite melt in my mouth it was absolutely delicious. I was already impressed with the bone marrow, but this pig shoulder. So. Freaking. Good. Paired extremely well with the mashed potatoes. Would go back solely for the pig shoulder.
