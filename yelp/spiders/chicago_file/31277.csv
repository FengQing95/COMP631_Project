Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We arrived around 6:30pm on a weekday, and already there was a massive line. We put our name down along with our order, and were told to come back after we got a message saying we would be seated soon. We walked around, came back, and then got seated upstairs. We were so hyped for the pizza - we couldn't contain our excitement. We had both had deep dish pizza before in another restaurant in Chicago as well as also other places, but none of those had left any impression on us. When the pizza finally arrived, our server cut the pizza into 6 slices, and served us each a piece.
