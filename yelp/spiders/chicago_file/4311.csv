The Purple Pig////If you like pork and anything related to edible pig parts, go here asap. This restaurant is deserving of such a prime location in Chicago, and even of its foodie status. There will be a line but do not let it intimidate you - it will move quickly. Wait staff are incredibly efficient while courteous. Everything on the menu will be absolutely delicious. Most things will be tasty right off the bat, despite of the menu descriptions that might sound off-putting at first. The items will come to you SLIGHTLY larger than tapas. Don't expect to get so full, though. It's a 1-2 plates per person sort of restaurant. Price will be premium, again given its location and cuisine. Oh, and get the bone marrow.
