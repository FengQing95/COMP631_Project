Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Clean, sleek, bartender was cool, they say us in 20 minutes even though they said 30 minutes. The staff were very nice. We sat on the first floor. The bartender was very cool and helpful with drinks. When we were seated our waitress was fine, nothing spectacular about the refills and such.
