Little Goat Diner////We went there around brunch, and so I had the Brandade and Belly -- which is essentially an eggs benedict "inspired" dish: sunny-side up eggs, pork belly, kimchi on a flaky biscuit. Although that might sound very precious, it was delicious. And normally I put the disclaimer that pork belly is cheating... but frankly the dish was lick-the-plate good before I even hit a bit of the pork.
