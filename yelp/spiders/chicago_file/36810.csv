Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food is so ridiculous. I had to be vegetarian this evening but Jesus, the food is superb. The guy sitting next to me had the steak and thoroughly enjoyed it. He ordered a second one and boxed it for home....The corn is insanely yum. I would come back for the corn. Omg. And the cocktails.... And great for dining solo.
