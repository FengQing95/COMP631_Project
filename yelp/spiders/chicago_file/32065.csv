Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza comes in four sizes: personal (for 1 person), small (for 2), medium (for 3), and large (for 4). The small size was more than big enough for the two of us. This was our first time having Chicago deep dish pizza, so we ended up being pleasantly surprised. With the pizza being deep, I had always assumed it would be mostly crust. It ended up being mostly cheese and sauce, which made the pizza extremely juicy and moist!
