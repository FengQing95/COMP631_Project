Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For the main course, we went with the house specialty, Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. The Malnati Chicago Classic was made with Lou's lean sausage, tasty tomato sauce, and some serious load of cheese. They did not mess around with their cheese, it was awesome! We ordered small but it came in 4 good size slices. We also ordered a small Pepperoni deep dish pizza and between the three of us we couldn't even finish. One of my friends had food coma after we were done.
