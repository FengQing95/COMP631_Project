Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Was in Chicago for 4 days and tried 4 different places and this one was number one. The hostess was nice, the other two guys a bit on the snotty side, even felt like we should leave since they seemed snotty, but our waitress made us forget all of that very quickly she was nice and very attentive. Loved their selection of breakfast! You have to try for sure, walking distance from Cloudgate/Bean!
