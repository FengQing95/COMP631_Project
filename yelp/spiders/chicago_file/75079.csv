Little Goat Diner////Service was good and friendly. ONE thing to note is that if you go to the bathrooms (whether it's guy or girl), be prepared to get jizzed on by their soap dispenser. I thought it was just me being clumsy and awkward, but when I walked out of the bathroom, the boy had a stain on his shirt from the bathroom soap as well. It's kind of funny. Not a cute "twinsies" moment.
