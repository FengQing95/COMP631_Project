Smoque BBQ////Since my last review here was four years ago and I visited again tonight, I thought I would provide an update. The St. Louis ribs are so worth it. They're meatier than baby backs and they indeed fall off the bone. The spice blend is enough to wake the meat up, but is by no means overpowering. I also wanted to mention I tried their new dessert: the pecan bread pudding. I have to admit it surpasses the peach cobbler, which I was already a fan of. Toasted pecans, caramel, a moist cake. For less than $2.50? This dessert is a must-get! Smoque is still the best BBQ I have found in Chicagoland and I can't imagine anything taking its place.
