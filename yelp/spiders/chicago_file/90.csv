Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I'm reading some of the reviews posted and wondering if I ate at the same place as others.  Went this morning on the recommendation of the concierge at the hotel where I am staying.  Definitely had to wait (was told 20 minutes but it was more like 35 minutes).  Sat outside, walked around, drank my iced tea that I had bought at the 7/11.  Was seated outside under the umbrella.  My waitress was fantastic!  Nothing was a problem, she recommended things when I asked questions, she was friendly and nice.  They definitely need some more staff to help out though (just as a recommendation).  The bus boy was also excellent.  My food was fantastic!  I built my own omelette.  It came with hash browns and French Toast.  Everything was very tasty.  I had the iced tea as well and it was very refreshing.  I loved everything about the place and will definitely return.  Would recommend that people realize that it is a small place, they do seem a bit understaffed, and people linger over brunch which is why there is a wait.
