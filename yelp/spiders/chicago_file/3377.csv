The Purple Pig////-Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese + Pistachio Butter: My favorite dish here. I'm a huge fan of beets in general. They are clean, colorful, and really well complimented by the goat cheese and pistachio butter. Wait, backup.. pistachio butter. Who knew that was a thing? But it is a very, very good thing. I was the girl licking the plate clean of it.
