Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I lived in NYC for 5 years and I experienced some of the best steakhouses in the world out there. I was pretty skeptical of eating steak in Chicago, giving the great experiences I had in NYC. But this place far exceeded my expectations. I got the 22 oz. Bone in Dry Aged Rib Eye. It was perfectly cooked. The meat was savory. Melted in my mouth. I have been to a couple of steakhouses in Chicago already and expect to go to more but this place is far by the best steak in Chicago. We were lucky enough to get seats at the bar on a Friday night. Also the Elote Style corn was to die for. A unique twist to your typical. I can't explain the taste of it, you just have to try it and thank me later. It's a bit pricey but what steakhouse isn't pricey? It's well worth your buck.
