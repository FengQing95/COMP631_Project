Art Institute of Chicago////Walking in the museum is an experience, as there's lions on either side and a beautiful staircase leading in.  I checked in at the ticket counter and checked my coat for $1.  Also, you can upgrade and get a thing that tells you all about the art you are looking at.  I got a free upgrade but passed since I wasn't really interested.
