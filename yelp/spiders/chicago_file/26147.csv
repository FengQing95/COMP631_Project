Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I will keep this review relatively short. In my opinion, this is the best Chicago style deep-dish pizza. We ordered the small sized Malnati's classic pizza. Small size should be absolutely sufficient for the average couple to finish. My issues with the restaurant are more with the staff than the food. The hostess was very rude and did not seem to care to explain the way the restaurant works to us. Once checked in, you can order your pizza at the counter, and wait for your table. Once seated, the pizza will be brought out to you. We were seated within 10 minutes of arriving, but it seems like our pizza order must have been missed. Other people that came way after us had gotten their food, while we had to wait 40 minutes to get ours. We were very hungry by this time and did not even get an apology from the server. We had to ask for our water twice as our server forgot. Once he brought out the water, he left immediately and did not give us straws. We had to wait another 5 minutes for him to come by and ask for straws, at which point he pulled out some ripped straws from his pocket and gave that to us. I will definitely order from this place again since the food is so good but I would not go and eat at the restaurant itself.
