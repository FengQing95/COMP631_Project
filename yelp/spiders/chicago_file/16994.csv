Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you want to wait an hour for mediocre pizza, this is your place. We ordered their signature pizza (the chicago classic). The butter crust was very good. But the rest of the pizza was severely lacking. It had way too much cheese, not enough sauce, and the sausage was pretty bland compared to what I expect on a pizza.
