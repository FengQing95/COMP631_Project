Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As for the ribeye- A slight funk in the background, the lightest tang, melt-in-your-mouth tender with the perfect amount of fat. The "grey" area was so minimal- just perfectly cooked meatiness waiting for your mouth. This cow did not die in vain. It didn't need béarnaise but the béarnaise itself was so marvelous that you can't help but to eat it too just because it's also so good and complimented the steak so well.
