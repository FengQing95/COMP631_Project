Art Institute of Chicago////We wanted to see Van Gogh's Bedroom exhibit and it did not disappoint. I wish they had done some crowd control as it was very very crowded, but they nailed the exhibit! Getting to stand in the replica of the house where he lived with Gauguin gave me chills. I know it's not the same as the actual house, but the depiction showed how primitive the space was and what close proximity two of my favorite artists lived in. I loved seeing the variances between his bedroom paintings too. Seeing the other Van Gogh's was just the icing on the cake for that exhibit.
