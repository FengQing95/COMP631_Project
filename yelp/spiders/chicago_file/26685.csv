Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was in the area to pick up some donuts. I noticed Lous was around the corner so I felt the need to eat here. Come on guys who doesn't love pizza. It was around 9:45 pm it was not crowded at all. As a result we got seated promptly. I ordered small deep dish pepperoni pizza my usual. Our pizza took about 40 minutes I didn't care because as always it was absolutely delicious. The crust and dough was extra crispy yum. I have been to other Lous this location was cool not to mention the conversations I overheard. I heard a woman trying to figure whether she was a millennial. Pretty interesting. But that is why I love Chicago the diversity of people you encounter.
