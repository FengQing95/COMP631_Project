Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was my first tapas experience, that part isn't bad. If this place were a third cheaper than what it is I would have been okay. Still not a place I would regularly want to go but I wouldn't dread it. However at it's current prices without good Sangria I don't want to go back.
