Smoque BBQ////1 year ago, I would've given this place 2 stars based on the chicken and pulled pork - both were mediocre.  I also had a tasting of the brisket, which is the ONLY reason I agreed to go back recently- it was the MOST TENDER, SOFTEST brisket I've ever had!  I normally hate brisket but I turned into a fan at Smoque.
