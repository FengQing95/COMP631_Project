Little Goat Diner////What "service with a smile!"  We went here as a lunch break from work.  It was me about four other of my co-workers.  We enjoyed it!  It was someon'es birthday and it's the perfect place for a coworker brithday, or just having a nice lunch out.  Our service worker was so friendly and even smiled to hear it was my co-worker'sbirthday!
