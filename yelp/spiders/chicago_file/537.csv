Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Solid Brunch place, my favorites are the skillets they have which is pretty much a layer of hashbrowns on the bottom mixed in with various meats depending on which skillet you get and eggs on top of that in a good sized skillet.  You definitely know it was good when you get the meat sweats after eating one of these.  Also it comes with either toast or pancakes, so obviously I had to get the much raved about pancakes.  They werent the most fluffy ive had, but the oreo smores pancake i had was pretty damn good.  It was on the sweeter side, so eat it as your dessert.  All in all a good place, thats affordable.  Sat AM wait time about 40 min, they are attached to a large building so you can wait indoors nearby and your transponder during the wait should pick up the signal when your table is ready.  I'd recommend this place to anyone.
