Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////How about this for you -- Whenever I have to change planes at Midway I try to give myself a 4-6 hour transfer delay window . Just enough time to get out of the airport, go to Lou's, scarf down as much Deep Dish as humanly possible and get back to the airport and catch my connecting flight.
