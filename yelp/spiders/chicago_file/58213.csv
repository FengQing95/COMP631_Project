Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I got to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba early for our 9:30PM reservation, and was told that my party would be seated soon. My boyfriend and I made our way to the bar to get some blackberry sangria while we waited, which was incredible. We decided to get the half pitcher, which ended up being about a glass and a half of sangria per person.
