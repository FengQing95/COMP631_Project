Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I like their distinctive cracker-crisp butter crust and their pies that hold an ungodly amount of cheese.  So if you don't like a typical pan/deep thick  crust you'll like this pie.  For a lactose intolerant person, I sure can plunge into a cheese  laden pizza like this without blinking. The flavors are solid, the sauce distinctly Malnati, not sweet but bold.
