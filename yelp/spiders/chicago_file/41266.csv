Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The Ba ba Reeba was one of the first places I tried when I moved to Chicago over a Â year ago. It is always a good time. The baked goat is out of this world. And I can put away almost a whole pitcher of their red wine Sangria. (not sure if that is because it is delicious or because I have a wine problem!) I always have fun here and I recommend it for big groups.
