Little Goat Diner////Yet another restaurant in Chicago that allegedly serves incredible food...at least that's the buzz that the media creates and the followers believe.  I've been there three times (including today), and have been completely dissatisfied with my meal.  I've been a guest all three times in case you are wondering why I've returned.  Did not like the sloppy joe at all, but shame on me for giving it a try.  Today I had the jerk chicken sandwich.  Nothing jerk about it, way too much mayo trio going on, which wilts the plantain chips.  Creativity can destroy your food, this place is a classic example.  Haven't glanced at any other reviews, but I'm sure the words amazing and fabulous are used throughout.  Peace.
