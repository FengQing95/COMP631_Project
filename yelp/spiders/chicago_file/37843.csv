Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had the bone marrow appetizer and I had the ribeye. My husband had the porterhouse? I don't recall what HE ate because I was all too focused on my food and drink. It was all fabulous. The entire experience was amazing! We can't wait to try it again next time we're in Chicago.
