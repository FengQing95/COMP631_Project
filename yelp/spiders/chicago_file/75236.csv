Little Goat Diner////Loved it! I've wanted to go to Girl and the Goat for a while because I loved Stephanie on Top Chef. This was a great substitute. Its her food in a more casual atmosphere. The decor was 60s daytime sleek, and was light and airy. I had the bullseye French toast. It had poached egg in the center of each bread slice, sliced strawberries, Â and perfect fried chicken chopped into smaller pieces. Everyone loved what they ordered. We also got dessert--the fat Elvis cake was to die for : moist banana with peanut butter bacon frosting. Deslicious!
