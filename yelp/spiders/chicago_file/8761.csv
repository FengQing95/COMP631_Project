Art Institute of Chicago////Come here to wander the modern areas, check out the special exhibits, visit one of the restaurants or cafes.  Visit the seurat, monet's, pollack etc.  I had about 2 1/2 hours, I'd recommend more time...but I was paranoid about catching my flight after meeting my friend for lunch at her place of employ that was like 2 blocks away.
