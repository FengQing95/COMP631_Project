Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There were micro-bites that cost $1 a piece. We started with one of each. They were all delicious. We then started ordering regular tapas. Blue Cheese steak was one of the stand-outs, we ordered some ceviche dish that was great. Honestly all of the tapas were crafted with care and tasted awesome.
