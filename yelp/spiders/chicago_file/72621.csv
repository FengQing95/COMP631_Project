Little Goat Diner////This Little Piggy Went To China - this is an absolute must order! My absolute favorite dish, the cheddar biscuits are like those from Red Lobster with eggs and pork sausage. It's topped off with a splendid sauce that you will be kicking off your plate! Even the blackberries seem right at home on this plate
