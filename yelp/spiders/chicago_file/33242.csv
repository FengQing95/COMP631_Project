Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Outstanding experience! Perfect date-night atmosphere. Our dinner was delicious - steak perfectly seasoned and cooked to temp. Corn side dish out of this world! Wonderful cocktails. Best part of the night? Our server Ryan (I think that was his name). Completely on point, charming and gracious even though we looked up and realized we were the absolute last table in the dining room. Well done Bavette's! I can't wait to return
