Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Might be my favorite steak house in the city bc I just love the vibe and decor of the place. Has a great old-school touch to it and feels like a place you'd see mobsters eating steaks. Great lamb chops and a tasty ribeye cooked to medium perfection. Enjoyed the seafood tower immensely!
