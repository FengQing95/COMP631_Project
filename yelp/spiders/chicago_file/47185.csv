Smoque BBQ////If you enjoy Texas style BBQ then this is the place for you. I'm a fan of Memphis & KC style BBQ. I like the Brisket sandwiches and they're baked beans are great. Service is very good and there's usually a line but it's moving, so don't let the line scare you away. It's a clean place, BYOB and right off the Irving park & Pulaski Blue line exit (1/4 block south of the exit). Give it a go.
