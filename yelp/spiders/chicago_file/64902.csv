Smoque BBQ////Believe the hype, the best BBQ in Chicago and most likely the Midwest. It's kinda off the beaten path and apparently it's BYOB. The Brisket is killer, so was the Mac and Cheese and the Cornbread. I do wish they offered a sampler platter so I could have tried the ribs and sausage as well but they both looked amazing. Can't wait to go back!
