Smoque BBQ////Service is somewhat inconsistent here, they make mistakes in orders too often.  The ribs and other barbecue dishes are good, not the best in town, but the best in the neighborhood. The tables and seating here isn't all that comfortable and at peak times it's too crowded.  Order ahead and take it home.
