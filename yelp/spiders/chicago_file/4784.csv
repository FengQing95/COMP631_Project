The Purple Pig////The Purple Pig restaurant is reason enough on its own to visit Chicago. We're from Los Angeles but find ourselves in Chicago once a year for a couple nights ahead of a nearby conference we attend. We discovered the Purple Pig by accident during our first visit when we attempted to visit a wine, cheese and chocolate restaurant across the street that happened to be closed for remodeling. "The Purple Pig" sign across the street was inviting..."Let's see what's over there" I said to my wife after it became a reality that we wouldn't be eating at a wine, cheese and chocolate restaurant. We have returned every year and The Purple Pig has become the one given thing that we will do on every visit to Chicago.
