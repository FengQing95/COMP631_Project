Little Goat Diner////Hi.. I don't believe I've ever submitted a one star review and it saddens me a bit to feel the need to do so, but never the less I feel somewhat obligated to do so based on, what I believe to be, potential health implications. I think that the picture I included says it all, but I'll add some written details.  I basically was served raw fried chicken.  My wife and I went to the Little Goat for dinner on what I believe was a Thursday evening. We were excited about it because we heard such good things about The Girl and the Goat as well as the Little Goat. The menu was basically glorified diner food which I was fine with as I haven't been known to discriminate against any food. I ordered the fried chicken as I was interested to see their take on this southern classic. The meal arrived at the table and it consisted of a leg, breast and thigh.  I began to pick at the leg.  It seemed a bit pink so I called the waiter over and showed him. He explained that the preparation involves par-boiling the chicken, breading it and then frying it and because of this the meat sometimes appears to be slightly pink but is indeed fully cooked.  First of all, in my opinion, par-boiled fried chicken sounds and tastes disgusting. It involves partially cooking the chicken in boiling water then breading it and frying it to finish cooking.  The result is watery tasteless chicken meat under what could be a decently seasoned breading, but that really never adheres well to the chicken meat.  It's not my favorite preparation and I suppose I was expecting something better.  Regardless, I would have been fine if I could actually eat the chicken. I gave up on the leg as I wasn't convinced that my waiter was accurate in telling me that this particular piece of chicken was fully cooked, so I moved on to the breast.  Chicken breast is supposed to cook faster so I was hopeful that this piece would be safe to eat.  As you can see from the picture, I was absolutely wrong. I then called the waiter back and asked him if he really wanted to stick to his original story.  He finally acknowledged that the chicken was indeed raw. He took it back to the kitchen and showed it to their manager. I was offered a new chicken meal but wasn't eager to take them up on it.  We weren't charged for our meal and the staff and management were all nice enough but serving a customer raw chicken seems like a big no no to me and suggests that there is a lack of quality control.
