Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////While visiting Chicago, people kept suggesting Giordano's for authentic pizza, but I decided to venture off and try something different. Omg, was I glad I did! This pizza was seriously the BEST that I've ever had. I followed the suggestion of other yelpers and got one with butter crust and it was phenomenal. I seriously can't WAIT to go back.
