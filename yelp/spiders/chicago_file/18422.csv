Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's ....  I think their deep dish is too much dough and super heavy too much bread.  Taste wise is pretty good, I love pizza, but Lous zza is too much for me. I remember wandering streets of NYC and getting slice of peroni from street vendor, and that was so delicious.  Not here.
