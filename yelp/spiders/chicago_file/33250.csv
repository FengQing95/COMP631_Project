Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////There's not much more I can say that hasn't already been said about this great restaurant. Great steaks (shared the bone-in ribeye) and the coolest of cool ambiances. Oysters, shrimp de jonghe, elotes...just do it all. It's great for a special occasion or for meeting up with your friends for drinks to feel like the cool, sexy, grown-ups you are.
