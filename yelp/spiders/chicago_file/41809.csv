Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  It's my fave tapas place :)  The atmosphere is great,  the food is awesome and its great to go there with a group of friends.  I'm in San Diego, and I miss it :(  Ill have to try the one in Vegas and see how it compares!  You guys are lucky if you are in the area!!!  Try it out, you'll love it :)
