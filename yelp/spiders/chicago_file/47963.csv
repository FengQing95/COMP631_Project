Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Have I seriously never reviewed Babareeba?! This is probably one of my favorite go-to restaurants in the city. Good sangria, great bacon wrapped dates, beautiful space, and nice service. Perfect for date night or a girls' night. I have never had a bad experience here and I will continue to visit as much as possible!
