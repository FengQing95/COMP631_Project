Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have to say, I am impressed with the quality of the food given the fact that it is super busy and tapas just keep rolling out. I didn't think the sangria was that great but it was alright. We had a small dessert as well that was perfect in size and was very tasty. Great way to end the meal.
