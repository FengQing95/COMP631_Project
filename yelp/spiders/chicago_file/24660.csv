Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went here Monday night sat at the bar.   Ordered a draft beer and it was so warm it was gross.  When I told bartender (first name starts with Z) he said I "Don't know how that could happen it's in a cooler".  Just blew me off.  I felt like saying of course it's not supposed to happen.  A guy sitting down from me says same thing to me after hearing what I said.  10 minutes later Manager comes over to Z and says "86 all draft beers.  We are going to reset the system. "  They still charged me for beer.  They need better servers who actually listen to their customers and not blow them off.   Also my Caesar salad was gross with tons of tomatoes and awful dressing.  Pizza itself was decent.
