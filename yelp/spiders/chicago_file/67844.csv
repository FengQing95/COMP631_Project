Little Goat Diner////The service is top notch, never a bad time. They are friendly, and smile, and attentive. The crowd is a great mix of hipsters, business people, suburban families, and neighborhood peeps. The entire atmosphere is just amazing. Think modern, bright decor, with a throwback diner feel. It's easily one of top 5 favorite restaurants in Chicago.
