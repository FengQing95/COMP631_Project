Art Institute of Chicago////Huge collection of art. I only spent around an hour in here, which I regret a lot! (But I was only in the city for a day.) You could probably spend an entire day walking around the museum. They have something like the second largest collection of Impressionists behind the Louvre. Very impressive. And so many beautiful and diverse pieces.
