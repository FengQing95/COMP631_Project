Smoque BBQ////Came here on Valentine's day. The food was delicious. I especially loved the chopped brisket and the Mac and cheese. The meat was the tender and the sauce went very well. The Mac and cheese now was like cheese heaven. It was a perfect meal. Also the service was great. There were ppl helping to seat us and it was busy day with not much wait time and more than affordable prices.
