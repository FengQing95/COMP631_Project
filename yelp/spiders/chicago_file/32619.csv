Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I literally only eat meat and eat at high end steakhouses in NYC and Boston all the time. The meat here is the same, but costs a lot more.It's not remotely worth $40-60. I'd rather pay more to not have to chew through leather. Again, the few bites I had were great. Also, Â waitresses should know enough about their job to know when their customers are calling their BS. If your customer refers to sinew, how the steak was cut, and the temperature fat renders out at, you probably shouldn't try and BS them. I wish I had a picture of the mound of tissue I cut out of the first steak. The couple next to us even gave the waitress a piece of their mind about my steak.
