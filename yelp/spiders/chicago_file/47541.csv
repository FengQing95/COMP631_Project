Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I wanted to have a bridal shower for my future daughter in law who has been a vegy since birth . I also needed vegan gluten free options . I couldn't of asked for the perfect day. The private room we had was beautiful . The menu was perfect . Our server Hector was kind and wonderful a true professional . Alison the head of events always followed through with me and was lovely to work with . All the options where labeled . We had white sangria and an alcohol free punch that everyone loved . This is a wonderful place for showers and party's . I was able to have a wonderful time as a hostess without any concerns .
