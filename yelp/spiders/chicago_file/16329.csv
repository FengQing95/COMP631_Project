Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After we finished eating we waited around 30 mins- we just wanted to pay the bill but no one was around to help. I literally walked around the restaurant hoping to get anyone's attention. Finally we got our bill - with gratuity tacked on the bill. I doubled checked the menu and gratuity is only automatically added on for parties 8 or more - there was only 6 of us. Now after all this, I was pretty upset - never had I had this poor service before and now they messed up on our bill? I asked to speak to a manager. The manager was extremely apologetic after I told him everything that had happened - and he offered to comp our bill.
