Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We arrived at 6:25. We were told we had a 45 minute wait due to our fairly large group. We ended up having to wait for an hour. After finally sitting down at around 7:30, we were hungry. The waitress claimed she had to "pull strings" to get our appetizers, even though it took her at least 20 minutes to get them for us. What kind of business has to "pull strings" to serve their customers? After another 30 minutes of waiting, I finally asked the waitress when our pizza would be delivered to our table. We were restless because the table next to us, who arrived after us with an even larger group than our own, was served their 5 pizzas before our waitress even knew when our 3 pizzas would be ready. The pizzas was good, but unfortunately the service did not match the quality of their product. Now we are sitting and waiting for our waitress because she disappeared after serving our pizza.
