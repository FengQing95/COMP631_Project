Little Goat Diner////I used to enjoy coming to this place once upon a time and fond memories brought me back recently. However, the experience was quite mediocre. I had a gluten-free vegan burger and my fiance had the fried chicken. The food was very much "A-OK" and we decided to not return for quite some time in the future.
