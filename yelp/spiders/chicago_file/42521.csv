Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Sangria is also great!! I used to get the cava, but they changed theory recipe and I don't enjoy it as much. I have since switched to the peach which is definitely refreshing. Thank you baba reeba for giving me a taste of Spain at pretty low prices (for Chicago standards!! ) See you soon!!
