Art Institute of Chicago////This is, IMO, the premier museum in all of Chicagoland.  As a child, I took summer lessons in the junior school, so the Art Institute has been part of my life for 50 years.  The collections are amazing and vast, especially the impressionists.   I have certain pictures I have to visit every time I go, and it's like I'm visiting an old friend.
