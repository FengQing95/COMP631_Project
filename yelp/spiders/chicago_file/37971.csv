Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This being our first time to Chicago, my wife wanted to go to a steak house for our last night. We chose Bavette's and we loved it! The seafood tower was excellent, the steaks were the best we've ever had, the sides were to die for and so was the dessert. The only thing that was a disappointment was the Negroni. No orange peel and it wasn't the best Negroni either. Something about it seemed off to us. Possibly too much Campari. Other than that what an awesome experience!
