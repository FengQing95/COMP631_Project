Smoque BBQ////I decided to have a 1/2 pulled pork sandwich, fries and peach cobbler...I know..piggy me! I could barely finish the 1/2 sandwich 1/2 of my fries and the cobbler. The fries are those delicious fresh cut friends YUM! The pulled pork was to die for just absolutely yummy!! I like that it wasn't drowned in bbq, they put sauce on the side to let you choose how much you want. The peach cobbler was average but it was good. 1/2 sandwich honestly was PLENTY!
