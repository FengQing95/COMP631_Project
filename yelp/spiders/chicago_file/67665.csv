Little Goat Diner////Great atmosphere and delicious food. We had the smoked fries, nachos, tostadas, fried chicken and shrimp and grits. Way too much food for the three of us, but we pigged out. The French silk dessert pie was awesome, and huge! Get a table beforehand because the wait is immense. We booked ahead and got right in. Best decision we made.
