Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Beautiful speakeasy meets gatsby ambiance. The underground parlor room is perfect for a romantic dinner and a tad quieter than the upstairs. Service was fabulous, good wine list, and for a steak and potatoes Midwest girl their filet, broccoli, and mashed potatoes were to die. The only regret I have is not having any room left to try all the other things that looked so good on the menu. Perfect date night or anniversary dinner spot. Steakhouse meets romantic hideaway. Amazing selection of old fashioneds that cater to any flavor profile preference.
