Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////One star for the worst service! We put our name in and "pre-ordered" our deep dish. We waited about 45-50 minutes to be seated. We were under the impression that the pre-order meant the pizza was timed to go in the oven while you wait. Not the case! They don't put the pizza in until AFTER your seated. This saves virtually no time. On top of it all, they gave us the wrong pre-order ticket and got our dessert order incorrect. The table next to us had the exact same problem. As for the food, the deep dish was disappointing. Cheese was too thick and didn't love the flavor. UNOs is better and I can get that back in Boston. This was a no-go for me
