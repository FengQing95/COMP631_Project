Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love this place--lively, fun, good food, reasonable prices, but brunch is our favorite.  Can you say Bloody Mary bar?  A great place to take the kids too--they can have above-average breakfast fare and we can eat real food and hang out like grownups.  Ask for Nate.  He was terrific with our kids.  When they asked for hot chocolate, (not on the menu) he came up with a fudge/caramel/steamed milk concoction that drove them wild.  (Hello Babareeba manager:  this should be a regular item!).  Don't listen to the yelp "haters."  Look for the reviews by people who are happy and would go back again.  They are probably more reliable than the folks who use yelp to spew their personal frustration at the world.
