Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For me this is the best Chicago Deep Dish Za, it's pretty much the same as it was 20 years ago!  They have a great online ordering system & you don't have to talk to ANYONE to place your order which I love.  I always get the butter crust and their hot giardiniera baked INTO THE PIZZA is a must!  Delivery is usually prompt and DO NOT get the pizza cut or it will be soggy.  I always order from the Lincoln Park location, don't order from the North Center location.  Don't forget to tip!
