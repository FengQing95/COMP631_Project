Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've been going to Lou Malnati's with my family since I was a rugrat. Back in the original pizza house in Lincolwood. Where they had 2 sit down video games in the waiting hall, Packman and, one that I cant remember right now. Â Been the best pizza place then, still the best pizza place now.
