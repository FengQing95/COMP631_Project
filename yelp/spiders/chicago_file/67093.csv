Little Goat Diner////I've been to Little Goat for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I must say, everything I've ever had was DELICIOUS!!! Today, I enjoyed the french toast with fried chicken, UM YUM! and my family had the fish tostadas, smoked corned beef hash and the breakfast spaghetti. The service was on point and the food came out quickly, considering they were really busy. They do NOT take reservations, so expect to wait, unless you come during off peak times. The host staff was extremely friendly and kept me posted on my wait time, which I really appreciated. Usually hosts can be very obnoxious, but the ones here rock! I will definitely be back and would highly recommend to anyone looking for great food in a cool atmosphere. ENJOY!
