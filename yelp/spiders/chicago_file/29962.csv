Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Everyone recommends Lou Malnati's if you want authentic deep dish pizza that Chicago is known for. We got here just before the dinner rush so we did not experience the long lines. It takes 45 minutes for your pizza to cook, regardless if you get thin crust or deep dish. We started with the calamari which was good, but the pizza was a little underwhelming. The deep dish is so bready and filling it's hard to eat a slice without feeling sick. Service was also not the greatest. I would however give it another try next time I'm in town due to all the rave reviews, think we just got them on an off night.
