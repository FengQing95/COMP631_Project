Smoque BBQ////With the price I paid, I would've preferred eating elsewhere as Chicago has a huge HUGE selection of places to eat. Smoque will satisfy the BBQ itch, but you'll need to go elsewhere for really REALLY good BBQ. Rewards on their wall also seem to reflect this, as I don't recall seeing anything that was non-Chicago awarded.
