Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Now the waitstaff - the busboys seemed great and attentive to our ever-trashed pile of dishes. However, the queen that was serving us had a 'tude from the get-go and was not attentive at all - this was in fact, the only true-to-life portion of our experience (in Spain, they also will leave you at the table for an extended amount of time if you don't order something immediately). When we were served dishes with multiple items on it, we had to hunt our waiter down so that he could tell us what everything was (which he seemed annoyed about). Typically, in a restaurant, the waitstaff will outline what each item is (on a multi-platter) for you so that you know what you're eating. Dear Queen Waiter, Sorry for bothering you by asking you to do your job. We were actually going to order dessert, but because it literally took him 10 minutes (after we told him we were ready!), we decided we'd be better off without.
