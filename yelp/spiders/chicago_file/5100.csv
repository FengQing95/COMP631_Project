The Purple Pig////I am really amazed with this The Purple Pig Restaurant, their food is so great, and their store has an awesome ambiance. Their service was so lit! Even all of them are so busy they can still manage to treat all of their customers so well. All of them are so accommodating and nice, they all know how to serve all the customers and make them comfortable. Their place is so clean, bright, and decent. Lots of decoration around, great atmosphere, and very impressive place. They also got the perfect location, it is easy to go to, and they are near to other landmark in the city. I give this store a 5-star because of their phenomenal food, great customer service, pleasant atmosphere of their place, and such an enjoyable experience. I would highly recommend stopping by and try their foods here in Chicago. I will invite all of my friends and family for them to join me next time I visit. Thank you Purple Pig! Keep up the good work. Thumbs up!
