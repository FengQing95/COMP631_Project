The Purple Pig////Let's start with the bad. I thought the crispy pig ears were good at first, but overall had too many shreds of pig ears that were overly crispy. The pickles in the dish served well to cut through the grease, but the ratio seemed a bit off. Second, the ambiance didn't seem quite right. I remember first going to the purple pig when it was across the street and the smaller venue and outdoor area. The restaurant never seems to shake the feel of being inside the mall either.
