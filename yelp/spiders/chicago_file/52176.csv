Smoque BBQ////Before Food Network featured Smoque our experience with pulled pork, both kinds of briskets, and StL ribs had always been quite good. The fries were very good, the mac and cheese were very good, and the cobbler was very good. The slaw, in my opinion is terrible, but that's fine. That is a style thing, not a knock on the place.
