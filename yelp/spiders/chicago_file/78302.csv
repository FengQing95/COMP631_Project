Little Goat Diner////Service: Service was a little bit spotty. Our waitress wasn't particularly attentive to us and, oddly, she absentmindedly filled my water glass, leaving my boyfriend's empty, then filled his maybe 10 minutes later. We were able to flag her for the check in a reasonable amount of time, so there were no other issues.
