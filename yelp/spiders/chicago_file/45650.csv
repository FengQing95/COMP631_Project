Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////But what I love about this place is the dessert menu. They have dessert tapas, which I think is a brilliant idea, because I can't tell you how many restaurants I've been to and been unable to choose between desserts. Not only is the concept itself great, but the desserts themselves are phenominal, from the butterscotch pudding (even my butterscotch-shunning mom loved it) to the vanilla flan with blueberries (my brother doesn't eat much sweet food, and he ordered TWO of these).
