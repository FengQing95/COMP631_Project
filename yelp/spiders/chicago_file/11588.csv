Art Institute of Chicago////When I went around July 19, one of my favorite exhibits they had was this collection of miniature rooms. You can to peer into rooms made to represent different eras in United States history from different states, and there were also French, English, German, and a couple of Japanese rooms too. I don't know how to begin to describe it, but it's something you should really see because you can really get a feel of each time period, and you'd be blown away by the detail of each room and just how beautiful each looks.
