Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Dinner on Saturday was good but not great for one reason only- too much salt- on every dish. The food was still cooked perfectly- petit filet, salmon and the roasted broccoli- but I felt we needed to drink extra water to compensate for the heavy-handed seasoning. The wine selection was great as well as service.
