Little Goat Diner////Side note: I really like that restaurants text me instead of giving me one of those weird buzzers that only work so far away.  If you're gonna make me wait, let me choose where I go.  Right?  So, +1 for that and +1 for letting me reply that we're on our way back (so I know they don't give our seats away).  Woo, technology!
