Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First of all, we did not eat the Chicago Style pizza. Had the thin crust and spaghetti. Spaghetti was very good, thin crust pizza not so much. Kind of a long wait for the food, about 40 minutes. But we were told that up front so no surprise. Atmosphere is nice, quite music, lots of people talking to provide the ambient noise.
