Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Let's just start with the ambiance, dark and moody just like you would imagine if you were living in the 1920 era. The wait staff is absolutely top notch. So welcoming. We started with cocktails, they have a list of old school cocktails I had never tried. I chose the Gimlet(Gin and Lime w/simple syrup). Out of this world! Refreshing. We had their bread brought to the table. One of the best sour dough ever. Next was the wedge salad. Bacon to die for then came the main course the signature ribeye melt in your mouth. I will have dreams about this place for some time to come. If you visit Chicago I would highly suggest this amazing place
