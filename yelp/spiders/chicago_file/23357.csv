Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What is there to say that hasn't been said. The pizza is spectacular! The ambience is warm and welcoming perfect on a snowy day. And the service was incomparable. As I finished two beers and half of my personal pizza and wrapped it to go I realized I left my wallet in the hotel room. Embarrassed I offered to leave my Phone or watch while I ubered back to my hotel. The lovely girl behind the bar said not necessary I know you'll be back. Once again a warm friendly delicious place to be Â lol
