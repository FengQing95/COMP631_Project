Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Awesome! So this is my first time taking advantage of restaurant week. I am very pleased with the place we picked. The price and the amount of food we received was on point. From the prix fixe menu, you choose a pixto, 2 tapas, a paella and a dessert. I had the spanish cheese and quince for my pixto which was just two pieces of fruit and two chunks of cheese. This was my least favorite thing from the entire nite but, it didn't kill the evening. The tapas i had were DELICIOUS. I love lamb so it was a braised lamb dish with coucos, spinach and almonds. Everything in this dish were so perfect. I also had a grilled calamari tapas which was very good as well. I was super super excited about the paella, and i'm sorry to say it was not the star. In my paella was shrimp, tomato, greenbean and of course the rice. Everything in the paella was good except for the rice, it was kind of hard. This was my first time trying it so i wasn't sure if it was suppose to be like that or not. But still this was not a deal breaker. Â Finally dessert, we were so stuffed we had our dessert packed to go, but when i got home...my oh my...the Caramel - Dulce de leche, Tres Leche Cake was SO GOOODDDDD!!!!!! I have nerve had it prepared so perfectly before. I so want another piece right now!!
