Smoque BBQ////Smoque is not the best BBQ I have had, I will admit. I used to live in the Carolinas so I have a biased opinion on how BBQ should be prepared and sauced. I haven't tried the pulled pork here, but the brisket was pretty fantastic. It was flaky without being dry and the sauce gave it just enough zing to not be overwhelming.
