The Purple Pig////Entrees were served cold, plating uninspired. Got a small strip steak ($25) which arrived cool to the touch on a bed of cold caramelized onions and bell peppers. The chicken kebabs ($17) were warm-ish, but served on a cold plate of roasted potatoes. Not sure if this was the intention but it negativity impacted the experience of the dishes. Music and conversation were super loud, tables were close so you had to scoot every time someone brushed by. Frequently saw staff cluster together in bottleneck areas to avoid bumping into each other as they passed, most squeezing in between customer tables. The vibe felt rushed and cramped. Overall, wasn't pleased with the experience for the price ($112 for two, 3 plates and 2 drinks).
