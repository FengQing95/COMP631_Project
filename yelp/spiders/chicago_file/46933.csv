Smoque BBQ////The long lines outside that you'll invariably find yourself standing in are well worth standing in because the  food  is incredible and absolutely worth the wait. The first time I went to Smoque I had argued against going  because I was not a BBQ fan, but I was outnumberd by my friends so I reluctantly went along. Then I grumbled about having to stand in line to get into a place I didn't want to go to in the first place. Well, not any more! I've been a Smoque fan for almost five years now, have had everything on the menu at least twice, and have never been disappointed with anything. But my favorites are  the baby back ribs and the brisket. Cole slaw comes with every order, but I always also have the beans and the mac & cheese and the corn bread (althought there is no way I can eat all that at one sitting so, of course, what I don't eat there goes home with me) - and there is no way I'm not going to have the peach cobbler for dessert. The place is quite small and the seating is family style, you order at the counter and pick up at the counter, although sometimes the "seaters" (the guys who stay alert and seat you as soon as spaces opens up) will pick up your food for you. So don't let the long lines deter you. However, if you're in the neighborhood and don't see a line, don't think you got lucky - it'll be a Monday, and Smoque is closed on Monday.
