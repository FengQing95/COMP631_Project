Smoque BBQ////Heard so many great things about Smoque BBQ that my friends and I decided to make the trip up here to see what all the fuss was about. BELIEVE THE HYPE -- the food is simply amazing. When we arrived, we expected the line to be down the street, but to our surprise, it was very short. We parked on the street right outside the restaurant which was convenient.
