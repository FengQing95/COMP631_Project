Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great Service and super yummy in the tummy food! The pizza was to die for and people couldn't say no to second helping. Chicken sandwich was delightful and the fries were amazing. The service was attentive, helpful and went above/beyond.  Despite the smaller size of the restaurant they were able to seat our large party of 10.  I will definitely come back here when in the area. yelp you didn't let me down!
