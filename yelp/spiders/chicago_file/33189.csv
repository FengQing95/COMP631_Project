Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food is awesome.  The shellfish is all fresh and a great selection.  I have yet to conquer the $175 tower, but it is larger than life and might be a necessity during my next "client dinner".  The duck/goat cheese terrine is one of my favorites appetizer.   The wedge salad comes with the thickest, juiciest bacon that seems too good to be real (although the dill dressing wasn't up my alley, the bacon more than drowned it out for me).   Even though everything I have had there has been awesome and indulgent (philly cheesesteak, burger, fried chicken, salmon), the darkhorse has to be the flatiron steak that was part of the steak & frites.  The fries were some of the best I've had, but the flatiron (usually a cut I avoid) was right up there with a steak I've paid 3x the price for.  I want to go back and try one of their more expensive cuts to see how they could possibly improve on it or maybe I'll just stop by the bar on a random weeknight and see if they can replicate the best flatiron steak known to man or if it was a one off fluke....(I'm guessing the former over the latter).
