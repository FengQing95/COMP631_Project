Smoque BBQ////The price is not bad, my full rack with 2 sides and cole slaw was $25.99. There brisket chili is and I just added fries with that which were good. The cole slaw was really goood too. I saw a lot of ppl getting the beans and Mac and cheese but the Mac and cheese didn't look worth it as it looked like an ice cream scoop worth of Mac and cheese compared to the amount of fries they gave you, in too much of a fatty and wanted more for what I felt I was paying for. Brisket chili was a generous portion too
