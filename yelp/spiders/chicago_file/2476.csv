The Purple Pig////Of all the times I've visited Chicago, this is definitely my favorite restaurant so far. The food was delicious, service was good, and the ambiance is nice. Inside, there are large community tables and some smaller tables on the sides, which is great for groups or smaller, more intimate outings.
