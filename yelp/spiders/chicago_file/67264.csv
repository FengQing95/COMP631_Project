Little Goat Diner////Service was 5 star but I wasn't really impressed with my dish.  I order the shrimp & grits and it was not that great.  My server knew I wasn't pleased and I ordered something to replace it.  The sandwich I ordered was much better.   I think this place is more hype than excellent food.
