Little Goat Diner////As for the burger, I wasn't 'wowed,' but it certainly was not bad. The goat once again had a different taste from beef, and it was good. I wish there was something fantastic I could say about the burger, but I've had much better in the city (Bad Apple, Butcher and the Burger). It's my fault because I shouldn't order a burger at a place like this, and also I had a standard order, not one of their specialty burgers. For 14 dollars, I expected a bit more.
