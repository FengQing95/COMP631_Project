Little Goat Diner////I had a wonderful brunch here today! We were originally seated in a corner that was next to where the staff worked. I got bumped into a few times and asked to be moved. The manager, Tara Z, was so gracious and quickly moved us to another seat and apologized for the inconvenience. She then brought out a free cinnamon bun and several other complimentary dishes. She and the waitress checked in on us many times to make sure we were comfortable. The whole experience was an example of amazing service. And of course the food was amazing as well. I'd highly recommend the goat chili cheese fries! I will definitely be back!!
