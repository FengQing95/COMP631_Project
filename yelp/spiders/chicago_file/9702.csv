Art Institute of Chicago////There's a huge Impressionism collection, and like most American museums, a great deal of European and early American art. The museum is home to a lot of famous paintings (A Sunday on La Grande Jatte, Nighthawks, American Gothic, etc), so it's worth a visit just to see those.
