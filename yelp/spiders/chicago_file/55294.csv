Smoque BBQ////BBQ here is delicioius! All of the meat, especially the brisket, is tender and succulent. Though the sauce is sweet with some tang, eating the wonderful meat alone is enough for maximum pleasure. I would recommend getting the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich deal with a side of ribs... if you want to take a trip to meat heaven. Sides are also tasty but are a bit smaller. That's not a problem because you don't take a trip to a BBQ place for the sides. The place itself is also kind of small, the staff is nice, and there's an outdoor seating area when it's nice outside. There is no wait staff at this place. In my mind I thought it was a sit down and order kind of place but that didn't take away from my experience. The food is so good that I will gladly come back here again.
