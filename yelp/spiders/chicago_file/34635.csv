Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We went for Valentine's day as it's my gf's favorite place and I have to say I was not disappointed. The waiter was great, the ambiance was amazing and romantic, the ribeye was great although way pricey. The bacon was out of this world, if you haven't had it try it. Overall, I'd say this place is great!
