Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We then ordered the Dry Age Bone In Ribeye with Wild Mushrooms and a side of mashed potatoes. I had read the reviews here about the food portions and we decided to share the ribeye. Once the food arrived it was clear that we had made the correct choice and there was definitely enough food for two people. The ribeye was absolutely delicious and was cocked exactly as I had expected a medium rare ribeye should taste like. The mashed potatoes and wild mushrooms were really good too.
