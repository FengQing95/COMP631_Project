Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac & cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).
