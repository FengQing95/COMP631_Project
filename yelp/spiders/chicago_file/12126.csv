Art Institute of Chicago////There is a dinning section for those in need of a lunch break and there is adequate seating scattered about for those in need of a rest.  Or, here is a thought, one could pause and be seated to just stare at a favorite work of Art for as long as on desires.  Well, at least until closing, harrumph !
