Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I got the personal-sized Lou: Spinach mix (w/ garlic, basil, onion), mushrooms, sliced roma tomatoes covered with three cheeses on Buttercrust. My partner ordered a drink for me because he knew I'd like it: Smoky Paloma - Casamigos mezcal, grand marnier, white grapefruit juice, splash of soda, lime wedge, pinch of chile lime salt. Just my kind of drink!
