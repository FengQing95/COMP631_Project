Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The word personalization comes to mind when thinking of this place, another word is BALANCE.  It's hard to find a place with this much balance.  Amazing food! (I had the breakfast burrito and added black beans to it very yummy) I also had the cinnamon roll pancake. It was cool that I was able to sub In one pancake Instead of being forced to order a short stack.  I also had the vanilla red velvet latte (not a coffee guy but this could get me going in that direction.). Service was out of this world I tipped 30% for our waiter (can't remember his name I think it's Jeremy but he is the dude with the dread locks) his personality was awesome he fulfilled all of our needs and did with an amazing smile.  My buddy with my ordered a to go coffee and he asked "what size? And be honest". My buddy answered "large". I thought that was cool because most placed don't want you to take a large to go cup after you have paid for your meal.  Like I said personalization and balance.  I will definitely come back and tell all my friends that visit Chicago.
