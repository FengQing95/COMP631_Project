Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Personally, my favorite deep dish in Chicago (and I think most chicagoans would agree). It's deep dish but nothing too wild - perfect amount of sauce, cheese, and crust. The sauce is extremely fresh too, you can taste the ripe tomatoes. Around Valentine's Day they offer heart shaped pizzas for both in store and delivery.
