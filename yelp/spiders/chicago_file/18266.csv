Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't know what I was expecting when I walked in, but it definitely exceeded whatever expectations I did have. It was a casual joint, and not crowded like Giordanos or Uno. Sat at the bar, watched some hockey and basketball, ordered a deep dish. All was good. The wait for my food was standard, and the pizza was everything I imagined and more. The sauce and toppings were just right. The crust was delicious. I'd have Lou Malnati's over any of the other chains.
