Smoque BBQ////I had the Texas links and St. Louis ribs. Links were just slightly tough to cut into with plastic cutlery, but excellent and reasonably lean. The St. Louis ribs had an almost cinnamon like flavor with the dry rub. I also tried the chopped brisket and pulled pork--I think I'll try those next time...
