Art Institute of Chicago////One of my favorite places in Chicago was of course the Art Institute-specifically the Monet exhibit! The miniature rooms were so fun to watch and made me imagine how I can tweak my home. The collection at the Impressionists exhibit was impressive, as well as the Korean Art exhibit which was very elegant. I wished the Koryeo & Chosun dynasty were more descriptive and extensive. There were beautiful pieces, but the course was not as extensive as the Chinese or Japanese art exhibits. Instead, I stayed in the Monet exhibit alone for 3 hours, and I could stay longer if I didn't get hungry!
