Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered one small deep dish and split it half Lou and half Classic. I loved the Lou and my husband thoroughly enjoyed the meat-laden Classic. I'm glad we got a small and split because it was a LOT of pizza. Extremely filling and tasty. The server was super nice and offered suggestions for us deep dish novices.
