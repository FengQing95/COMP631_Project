Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I definitely can see what all the hype is about, their deep dish pizza is definitely a Chicagoan staple.  I was staying far from this particular location but had to check it out because the ones close to my hotel were take out only. Arrived at this location and saw a lot of people waiting to be seated. It was good and bad, obviously because I know people want to eat here and the pizza must be good and bad because I was bracing myself for probably a minimum of an hour wait. Was sunrise when I gave my name and they gave me an estimated time of 30-35 minutes. They let you pre order Pizza before seated as it takes about 45 minutes to make.  Sweet!
