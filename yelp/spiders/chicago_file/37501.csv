Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////When we asked what we had done to be offensive, both server and manager answered "nothing" and that they were "looking out for our safety". 4 out of 5 in my party are physicians and are better trained to recognize signs of over drinking than the staff at this restaurant. It seemed likely that our waiter just made a bad call and the manager was trying to stand by him, but doesn't make up for the fact that we were all wildly offended and weren't able to enjoy our time there. Won't be going back.
