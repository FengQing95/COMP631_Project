Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had not had food from here in over 20 years. I ordered delivery. Their packaging is top notch. Beef skewer is cooked perfectly and is juicy and has good beef flavor. It didn't seem there was much seasoning going on though, which is a slight disappointment, but not a deal breaker for me to not order it again. Portion size was a bit lacking, but be assured you are getting top quality beef. Garlic potato salad is of decent portion size and is garlicky enough without being overwhelming. Deviled egg is a nice addition to any meal if you order one. I have yet to eat the chocolate truffle cake, but will edit my review to update after. I can't wait to go here in person again. Top notch.
