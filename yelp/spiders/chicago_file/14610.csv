Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Since we were aware of the wait time, I ordered a beer and a fried calamari appetizer before the meal. I didn't really want either, but some time had passed since lunch, and I wanted to get started on something. It ended up that this is what we were being charged for, including my girlfriend's drink, which came to a total of an additional $25 or so. I couldn't believe they had the nerve to charge us for anything! We were in their restaurant a total of over TWO WHOLE HOURS! How could they have the nerve to try to charge us for anything.
