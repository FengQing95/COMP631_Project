Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The atmosphere is sultry and upscale with decor that complements a casual yet sophisticated experience. Our waiter Joe was relaxed and entertaining as he guided our cocktail and dinner options. The cocktails were creative and delectable. We ordered the Crab cake appetizer which was huge and loaded with fresh lumps of crab, easily enough for two people. Our entrees were the petit filet and the 22 oz bone-in ribeye, both with bearnaise sauce on the side. The steaks were cooked and seasoned to perfection. We had mashed potatoes and mushrooms on the side. The meal was a classic symphony of flavors. It was my birthday and Joe brought us a gigantic piece of lemon meringue pie. The pie was gratis and delicious. Plan on spending few hundred on your meal. My steak alone was $100, but we decided to splurge because our adult children and their husbands highly recommended Bavettes. It was a perfect evening and my wife and I will be returning for an encore soon.
