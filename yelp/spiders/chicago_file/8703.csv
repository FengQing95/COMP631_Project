Art Institute of Chicago////One of the best art museums I've been to in a while. Perhaps it is because of the helpful workers or the fact that it has a multiple range of very famous works such as American gothic and the assumption and (so much so much ) more. Although it did cost money to get in, it was 100% worth it. I would also recommend giving the art institute a whole day worth of viewing; even then, you may not even see it all.
