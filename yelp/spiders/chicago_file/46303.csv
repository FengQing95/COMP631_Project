Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ahh, I love me some Cafe Babareeba!  Yes, I know it's not considered "authentic tapas", but whatever it is they serve, it's damn good for this girl!  I've been coming here for about almost 20 years now (good lord!) and it's one of my go-to places.  Did you know that my husband's flooring company installed the interesting sun pattern in the front entryway?  Just a bit a trivia - but I was coming here long before I met him!
