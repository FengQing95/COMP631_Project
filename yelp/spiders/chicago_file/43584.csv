Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It's one of those Chi-town classics that I've ignored all these years, but I finally made it to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba last night for a Â very late dinner. That the place was teeming at that hour of the night and we had to wait for some time (seemed like eternity, since we were famished!), was evidence that my view goes against the grain of the "popular" opinion. But what the heck, I think that kitchen can survive some kvetch!
