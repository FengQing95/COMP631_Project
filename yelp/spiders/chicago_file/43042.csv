Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was awesome - a few standouts (bacon-wrapped dates, goat cheese croqueta, mushroom empanada, escargot; to name a few) and everything else was really good. Nothing sub-par. Sangria was also very solid. We first got the regular Red and the Concord Grape; the next round we just ended up getting the Red. The grape was very...grape-y.
