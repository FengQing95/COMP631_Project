Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our night started off with the expertly made Lions Tail; one of their bourbon signature cocktails. Lime and bourbon makes for a great pairing. It went down easy..so easy I had three.  Appetizers: Half order Lyonnaise, half dozen East coast oysters.  Lyonnaise was fabulous, probably the best I've ever had.  Lightly dressed with perfectly cooked poached eggs and two thick slices of pork belly. The half order is sizeable for sharing and won't leave you full like a Wedge would.  And, the best part is - you get to sample the pork belly without having to order a full appetizer portion.  For two people this kills 2 birds with one stone when you want to taste more of the menu. Oysters were excellent, but $21 for 6?  Save it for two slices of Chocolate cream pie instead.
