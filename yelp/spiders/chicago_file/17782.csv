Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Quite delicious Chicago style pizza. There was a wait, but it is Chicago and can be expected. The options felt limited, but they are good at what they do. Be prepared for a cheese overload, but who doesn't like that from time to time. The spinach cheesy bread appetizer was tasty, not at all what I was expecting when I ordered it, but the plate was clean before the pizzas came. Good service, the atmosphere is average, overall, a fairly typical Chicago pizza joint.
