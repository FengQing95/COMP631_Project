Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I ordered roasted chicken and it was cooked to perfection. Other dishes at the table included the pork chop, and I don't like pork typically but this was amazing, along with a Caesar salad. The food was outstanding, the portions are large and everything is amazing! I can't recommend this place enough.
