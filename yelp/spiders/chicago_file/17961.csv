Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I wasn't a fan of Lou Malnati's until they moved into the Oak Park community.  I have to say, I now enjoy their thin crust, one-topping pizza, as I like it simple.  I also love the ambiance of the dining area which can accommodate small or large parties. The sliding doors makes it fun to dine during the summer, especially when you want the feeling of dining al fresco. I recently discovered their "back door store" which offers half-baked and frozen pizzas.  Great addition to the Oak Park community.
