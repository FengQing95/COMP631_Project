Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////* Smoked Whitefish Ceaser salad. Really good, and they were not sparse with the whitefish. I love whitefish, and sometimes I think about the bagels with whitefish spread I used to get in college. This was solid, a very strong flavor that made me remember just how much I like it. The combination of flavors was spot-on, the salad well done, properly glazed with dressing, and a perfect amount of whitefish. This was a hit.
