Little Goat Diner////- The wait: Despite having a 7pm reservation and checking in 5 min prior, we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. It seemed like many of those around us were in the same boat. The host at the front offered to comp a drink for us each, but my friend and I did not want to drink. He offered instead to comp some appetizers for us to be ready when we finally got seated, but these never showed up. The restaurant did give us a free dessert at the end of our meal, but it was ice cream and I am lactose intolerant... Thanks.
