The Purple Pig////We had gotten the purple pig recommended to my fianc√© and I and he got a $200 gift card from work to this restaurant, so we were really excited for a nice dinner. We couldn't have been more disappointed with the flavors and quality for the price. We started with the crispy pig ear and fried mozzarella. The pig ear dish was bland and just tasted like the fried skin on a chicken wing with cut up banana peppers and crispy kale with entirely too much oil. The fried egg on top was fine but kind of an odd addition. The fried mozzarella was fine but the portion was extremely small and nothing special. I also ordered the cauliflower which was okay but there was just so much oil that it took away from the flavor. Texture was good but too salty and oily. We ordered the ole yeller cocktail and the paper planes cocktail which were actually pretty good. We then ordered the Sangiovese red wine and piquette sparkling wine. Both were absolutely awful and tasted like the wine had been watered down. We did not finish them and told our waiter that we didn't like them and would prefer a different drink. We were still charged for the wine even though we didn't drink it and didn't like it at all. Finally, we ordered the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. It was fine, meat was cooked alright but flavor was flat and gravy was bland. Tasted like something you might get at Cracker Barrel. Thank goodness we had a $200 gift card because the meal was exactly that much including tip and we would have been even more disappointed if we had paid for this meal. Our server was nice but even some of the most casual places we have been will not make us pay for a drink we don't like. We were so underwhelmed by the quality and the flavor we will absolutely not be returning. Cannot believe this was a $200 meal. There are so many other delicious restaurants in Chicago to try, save yourself the time and money!
