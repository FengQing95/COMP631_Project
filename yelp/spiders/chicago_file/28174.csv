Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The chain restaurant of Lou Malnati's has traditional dishes you'd normally find at an Italian restaurant - with the exception of the pizza. We ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer and the chicken pasta and cheese deep dish pizza for our entree. All enough to share between four people and have some leftovers. The calamari was good - not greasy or overly cooked to the point of overly chewy, just the right amount of chew and crunch. They came with a cocktail dipping sauce. The chicken marsala pasta was delicious: rigatoni pasta covered in a creamy, white sauce mixed in with chunks of chicken breast and mushrooms and topped with shavings of parmesan and slivers of basil. It felt homemade, which is what made it better. The pizza is allotted a certain amount of cooking time which it tells you on the menu, so hopefully you're not in a rush. Either way, it's worth the wait. We ordered the large pizza and only six out of the eight slices. They're thick slices of pizza. Crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside with a hefty amount of cheese and sauce; you'll be happy you waited thirty minutes. Their dessert menu did look enticing, but we were so full from dinner that we could not fathom eating a chocolate chip pizza or tiramisu. I'm sure it was fantastic.
