Little Goat Diner////I can't say enough good things about this place, I think I'm obsessed.  My boyfriend has a severe gluten intolerance, so any restaurant with an entire gluten-free menu is pretty exciting.  It's also the best new restaurant I've visited in a long time, I think every time I take my first bite of anything, my eyes roll into the back of my head.  I've had the bull's eye french toast, the fish tostadas, and Gluten-free boy has eaten the Los Drowned, Sloppy Goat, pancakes, corned beef hash, machos nachos, tomato-apple soup, and smoke fries. The GF menu is really quite extensive, a great find for us!
