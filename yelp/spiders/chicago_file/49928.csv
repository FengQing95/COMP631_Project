Smoque BBQ////3. My friend and I ordered the same thing, chopped beef brisket sandwich and it was OK. Well I think the sauce makes the meal.  They only had 2 choices of sauce to choose from for the beef brisket. They pretty much tasted the same, one was slightly more...spicy than the other. But they were pretty much the same. I prefer more of a sweeter sauce.  I've had better in Tennessee or even at Uncle Bub's here in the south suburb.
