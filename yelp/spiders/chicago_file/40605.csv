Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////They were so kind to accommodate our late arrival, which I greatly appreciate. We were running a little behind after the marathon and changing hotels, and let's face it - we walked here from our hotel which was a little under a mile away and I was probably walking a bit slower than usual after just running around the city all morning.
