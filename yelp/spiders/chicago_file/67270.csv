Little Goat Diner////Now, I could see the frustration with some of the other reviewers in that this place is the new trendy hip west Randolph restaurant and is probably packed on a Saturday or Sunday morning.  But c'mon guys...you know you have to expect that when you go to the NEW TRENDY HIP WEST RANDOLPH RESTAURANT!  I mean really, I'm not going to schlepp my three kids down there and expect to get seated right away right?
