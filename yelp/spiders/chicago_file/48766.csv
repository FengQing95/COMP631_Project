Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We also decided to order some chicken paella.....which unfortunately we did not enjoy whatsoever. The flavor was absolutely off to the point where we politely told our waiter that we did not care for it. I never send things back, but this item being the most expensive thing we ordered, we couldn't keep it (or wanted the left overs for that matter) So I told the waiter in the most apologetic fashion if he could take it away. He was SO GRACIOUS and omitted the paella from our bill. He apologized and asked if we wanted to order something else, which we did. We were so thankful for his kindness. He also provided us with two free desserts. THIS IS HOW YOU GET RETURNING CUSTOMERS. Nice job Caf√© Ba-Ba-Reeba, you know how to treat people.
