The Purple Pig////I had a mushroom raviolo with honey and truffles, which was not good - way too sweet and not balanced with the savory. Would not order again. I also had the smoked pork tongue, which was easily the best bites of the night and something I would definitely order again. But then the meal went downhill - for my entree, the server recommended the pork blade steak, which was served with nduja sausage and a small arugula salad. This was the saltiest dish I've eaten in a long while, it was unbelievable. The pork was salty, the arugula salad was saltier, and to top it off the nduja sausage was extremely salty as well. No balance whatsoever, I probably had at least 5 water refills during this course alone. And - I wasn't able to finish (I actually felt sick); anyone who knows me knows this never happens, as I usually finish everyone else's food.
