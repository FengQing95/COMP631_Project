Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////One thing that's really awesome about this place is that they let you pre-order your pizza (because they take up to 50-minutes to cook) so that it's ready to be set at the table when it's finally your turn snag some seats. With our group of five on a Thursday night, it was a 45-minute wait even around 8PM, so we enjoyed each others company while grabbing a few drinks at their bar.
