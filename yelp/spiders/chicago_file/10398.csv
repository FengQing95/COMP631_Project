Art Institute of Chicago////Simply one of the best museums I've ever been to in the world and easily rivals the other top museums in the world, including the MET, the Smithsonian Museums, the British Museum, and the Louvre. The Art Institute of Chicago has a very diverse and wide collection of art, which includes your standard collections of Asian, Indian, African, Greek, European, and Modern art, but it also has one of the best Impressionism collections this side of the pond as well as a number of very unique architecture and furniture collections.
