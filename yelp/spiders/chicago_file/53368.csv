Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Beware of the bread that sits out uncovered in the racks and at service station: Bad cross contamination ?! !! Have to say, was not happy about the busser who serves cuts and serves bread with the same dirty hands he just wiped tables and cleared dishes with. Â We didn't realize this until there were more tables. Although, He was very efficient and attentive.
