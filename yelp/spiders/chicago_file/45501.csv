Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went with a group of 8. We had a reservation and they were ready for us when we got there, always a bonus.  We ordered everything from escargot to goat cheese in marinara to paella to risotto to beef to sausages to calamari to spicey potatoes and so on and so forth. Everything was wonderful.  Another fantastic thing about Cafe Ba Ba Reba is that there are so many options even the pickiest eater can find something to munch on.
