Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place! I've been coming here for years with positive experiences, but most recently we had our wedding rehearsal dinner here and had an amazing experience. Not only was the staff team 100% professional, but the customer service that we received on the day of (and leading up to) our dinner was exceptional. Everything on our menu (calamari, shrimp, salmon, croquettes, potato salad, green salad) was cooked to perfection in terms of the flavor and the temperature. I could not provide a higher recommendation if you are looking for a yummy meal or planning an event.
