Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had the Chicago Deep Dish and it was great.  There's a solid layer of sausage on the whole pizza, plenty of cheese -- but could've used a little more sauce, in my opinion.  The crust was great.  It's crisp, buttery and thin enough to let the toppings shine.  We shared the small 9" pie between the two of us but probably could've jumped up to a medium.
