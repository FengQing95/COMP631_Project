Art Institute of Chicago////Um. What's not to love here?!!! I've been here plenty and I swear I keep finding rooms I didn't know existed and seeing new artwork every time. It's a great museum and it's in a great location. I just don't what more to say! It's awesome and I love seeing people from all over the world, young and old, enjoying artwork. It just inspires me and lets me appreciate humanity.
