Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So I had thought I have had good pizza before, I was totally wrong. Having a traditional Chicago deep dish in Chicago was an experience. Everything from the crunchy buttery crust, layers of thick mozzarella cheese interspaced with sausage and pepperoni was just superb. I was also surprised by how a small 6' pizza left us all feeling so stuffed afterwards. Can't wait to come back the next time I'm in town!
