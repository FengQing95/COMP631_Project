The Purple Pig////I think I've written a total of 2 review in my life, but I felt I needed to for this restaurant. Came here for my birthday because I heard it was a good spot. The food was tasty, but our server was unfriendly and a little rude. Didn't seem to want to answer questions about the food and hardly paid attention to our table-- which is weird because he seemed friendly and talkative enough to the table next to us.
