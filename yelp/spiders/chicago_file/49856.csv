Smoque BBQ////We parked down the street in a residential neighboorhood and as we opened the door, we could smell the smoke. The food was delicious. I really wanted to try the St Louis ribs but there was a sign at the register stating "due to quality concerns, we are currently not serving St Louis Ribs", which totally bummed me out. I had the 1/2 slab baby backs meal with came with the best slaw I ever had and 2 sides. I chose the BBQ beans and mac & cheese. Â The beans were amazing. My husband had the pulled pork meal with slaw, BBQ chili, and corn bread. I also orded a "taste" of their brisket. The brisket melted in my mouth. The sauces were on the sweeter side and the brisket sauce was thinner and I even drank it out of the cup. I can't wait to go back. Dinner with 2 sodas cost us $37, but it was worth every penny.
