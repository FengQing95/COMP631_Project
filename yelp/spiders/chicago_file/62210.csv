Smoque BBQ////All in all, I was satisfied with my meal but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there like I would at other BBQ joints in the country:  Henry's Hi-Life (San Jose,CA), Loveless Café (Nashville), Mac's Speed Shop (Charlotte,NC), Arthur Bryant's (Kansas City), Oklahoma Joe's (Kansas City) . . . off the top of my head.
