Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Butter crust is good but the pizza isn't deep enough. Not enough cheese.  It's like diet deep dish.   It is a Chicago classic and there are two deep dish camps for me I prefer a more cheesey and deeper style but others love this style.  For anyone into exploring Chicago deep dish Lou's is a must but it isn't my personal favorite.
