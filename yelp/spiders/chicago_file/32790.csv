Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So I am not a big steak eater for health reasons but my wife loves steak so I took her here for our anniversary. The food was absolutely off the charts good. Baked potato was so delicious and unusual. Steak (I tasted) was delicious by both of our accounts. I had the chicken which was very good. The ambiance is great. Romantic, warm and a bit mysterious. We had a drink at the bar and everyone was friendly and helpful. Almost all the bartenders had glasses so if you are looking to get hired here....... This is the kind of place that you can dress up or wear jeans.  Generally upscale but not too fancy.  Plus, when you eat downstairs, there is not much light for anyone to worry about what you wear.  As long as you keep you pants on when you loosen your tight belt.  All in all prices normal for upscale place and the whole experience was a wonderful experience.
