Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting Chicago and ordered takeout......my pizza was delicious beyond my wildest dreams.  OMG, the Hostess was beyond courteous, friendly and helpful, she is an positive asset to the establishment.  Keep up the great teamwork and one of the best pizzas I have eaten in a long time.  I ordered the thin crust crispy cheese pizza with basil and spinach. Yum Yum Yum!!!!!!'
