Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The frites were my favorite side.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The bacon got very cold very quickly, and I would have preferred it to have been crispier.  I thought the corn was too "busy" tasting, but my girlfriend rolled her eyes in delight at it.  It's the kind of thing I wish I could sprinkle inside a taco.  It needed some meat or something to knock the Kool-Aid factor down a few notches.
