Little Goat Diner////When we got our food, I was super excited.  My Elvis waffles were awesome, and that peanut butter butter? Amazing.  However, my sister was not quite sure her French toast was cooked thoroughly, so she asked to see her girlfriend's plate of French toast.  Where my sister's toast looked like it had two raw eggs (the whites were still mostly liquid and clear), her girlfriend's toast was cooked medium-well, which was perfect and tasted great.
