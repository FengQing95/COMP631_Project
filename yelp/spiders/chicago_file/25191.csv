Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It took us about 45 minutes to get our pizza, but it was 100% worth the wait. We opted for the traditional malnati pizza. The pizza was beyond perfect. Rich buttery crust, the sausage and sauce were delicious, and the amount of cheese was perfect. By far our favorite Chicago deep dish!
