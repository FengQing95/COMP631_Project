Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I would say, those of you true foodies would likely turn your noses at CBBR. It's part of a chain, there is no seasonal menu and there is nothing 'local' as far as I can see. But life is boring when we need things a certain way isn't it. So go here with a group. They'll be happy and you likely will too. They can't really jack anything up b/c they've been here doing this for over two decades.
