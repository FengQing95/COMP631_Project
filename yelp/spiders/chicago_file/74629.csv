Little Goat Diner////A great place for brunch or just getting a small bite to eat. I have been therefor brunch and the Fat Elvis Waffles are to die for. Most recently we went there for a quick lunch and as always the food was great. We had the Pork Porta sandwich and the Goat Chili soup. The sandwich was great and very tasty and the soup was also really good. We were there around 4 pm on a Monday and there wasn't any wait, but by the time we were leaving around 5 the place was starting to get really crowded for the happy hour specials. I would 100% recommend this place and plan to visit real soon.
