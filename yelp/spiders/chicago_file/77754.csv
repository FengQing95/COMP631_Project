Little Goat Diner////*Twenty minute wait (showed up Sunday around noon, so not bad!) and chilled in the bakery area with a coffee and a cookie. Very cute decor, kind of like a high-end Dove's vibe, and classic foods that they made their own and elevated to perfection. It's like the best version of your everyday favorites.
