Little Goat Diner////Had one of the best breakfasts I've had in my life here; ordered the Pork Belly Pancake and Smoked Corned Beef Hash with eggs.  Order these two dishes and you cannot go wrong.  Woke up my taste buds and got them ready for another day of Chicago food exploration, though every next restaurant now had a lot to live up to.  To avoid a wait at the busy diner, you can sit at the bar to the right, which was pretty much empty when we arrived.  Our bartender gave us great, on demand service.  This was a great spot to top off dinner the previous night at Girl and the Goat.
