Art Institute of Chicago////I'm sure you've already read that The Art Institute of Chicago Museum is FREE as in Free99, as in you walk right in for the whole month of February!!! I am so happy that I stumbled upon this fact, because I have not been to this museum since High School.  This is a shame on my part, but I plan on visiting the museum more frequently from now on.  This Museum truly is a marvel, and there is no way you can appreciate all the magnificent work that this Museum holds in a couple of hours.  The new Modern Wing is a sight to behold, and I'm sure it is more breathtaking during the summer, when the sunlight pours in through the floor to ceiling windows.  I am no art expert, but you have to appreciate the collection of beautiful art in this place.  One of my favorite periods of art is the Impressionism period with the likes of Monet, Van Gogh, Gauguin and Renoir just to name a few.  The impressionist art collection here is amazing!!! Bring a camera, soak in the wonderful art, have a bite to eat at the Modern Wing Café.  I truly regret that it took me this long to come back here. And now with Millennium Park across the street, this area of downtown Chicago is truly amazing!!! Appreciate it people.
