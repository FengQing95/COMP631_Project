Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////First, a comment on the menu - for a (mostly) breakfast place, they had a really extensive menu.  Of course, there were your usual suspects - egg skillets, omelets, french toast, pancakes, etc.  But, there were some crazy additions - biscuits and gravy, ham on the bone, red velvet french toast, strawberry cheesecake french toast, and lots of other tasty and ingenious options that you don't usually see on a breakfast menu.
