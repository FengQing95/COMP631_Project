Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Of course, there was a line at the famous pizzeria when a friend and I arrived starving and wanting to experience true Chicago Deep Dish pizza. We were told it would be a 20 minute wait and that we should go ahead and order the pizza. Be warned it takes about 30-40 minutes to make the pizza, so don't expect it to come out quickly.
