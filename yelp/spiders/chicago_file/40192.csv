Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I've been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them.
