Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is one of several great steakhouses in Chicago, and one visit in and you'll see why.  The meat is very flavorful, cooked to perfection, and seasoned well.  One thing not to miss when you dine here is their shrimp cocktail.  It's big enough to share, or if you want to fire down the entire thing yourself (respect) go for it.  As far as the steak goes, opt for the bone in ribeye, melts in your mouth!
