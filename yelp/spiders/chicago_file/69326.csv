Little Goat Diner////I was surprised at how fast the turnaround time was from when I ordered and when I started eating. Much like my first visit to the Girl & the Goat, Stephanie was there checking dishes and roaming the kitchen amongst the cooks. Everyone was pleasant there; from the host to the waitress Lizzie. Price-wise, it's very affordable with the quality of the food.
