Little Goat Diner////Dislikes: The Duck Confit Banh Mi while very tasty didn't deliver. The baguette was a bit tough and the filling wasn't moist enough to counter that. Also at $13 it, along with most of the food I tried, is overpriced. The smoked fries were ok but they were way over-seasoned. Also, for a place that's open until 2am they need to step their beer game up. They have a few decent beers on tap but it's mostly the same 2 Hearted/3 Floyds stuff you see everywhere else.
