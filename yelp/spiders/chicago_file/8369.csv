Art Institute of Chicago////You could literally spend all day here.  But sadly on our last trip we used our City pass here as one of our stops.  We only gave ourself 3 hrs to check this place out.  Which I had hoped to be enough but I was sadly underestimating.  However, the people here know not everyone has a whole day to enjoy the art, so they even have a quick guide if you only have a few hrs.  We hit up most of the items along with just checking out other exhibits as we walked around.
