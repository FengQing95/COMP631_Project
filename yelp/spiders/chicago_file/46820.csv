Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My favorite restaurant the city. Never had a bad meal here and no one I've brought here has disliked it. Their sangria is top notch. I've not tried the paella but all of my friends love it. The tapas are scrumptious. I love the goat cheese and tomato sauce with garlic bread; the bacon-wrapped dates; the spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms; the potato omelette; beef tenderloin; and the empanadas. The staff always is so nice and friendly. I came here for my birthday one year and our server was so kind. She absolutely made my day and everyone had a wonderful time. I tipped her an extra $20 because she was so great.
