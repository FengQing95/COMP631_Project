Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now, you might think I just don't like deep dish pizza. It's actually the exact opposite. I wanted to like deep dish pizza SO MUCH I gave it a second chance after this first failure. And thank god I did, because Giordano's deep dish was the best way to end my weekend in Chicago. It was exactly as I expected, the sauce was tastier, meats were better, and I actually ate the crust hah.
