Little Goat Diner////After waiting an hour (I completely understand they're a popular restaurant so I didn't mind the wait so much), my friend and I were finally seated. I felt so bad for the waitstaff because it was obvious they were feeling very swamped. They were so incredibly friendly and nice, but the dining experience was horrible. It was so incredibly hot in the restaurant that the hosts had to walk around and fan people with menus to keep all the patrons cool. On top of that, by the time we got our food, my friend and I were starving but we still didn't finish our food because it was mediocre at best. My meal was so salty that I felt sick eating it, especially in such a hot restaurant.
