Smoque BBQ////I think Smoque's rating here on Yelp speaks for itself. The place is not much to look at from the outside or the inside, but the food is out-of-this-world good. If you're a vegetarian, I'm not sure this place is for you, but if you're like most other people and you like meat - oh man, it's heaven. The food is simple, it's prepared quickly and IT'S SO GOOD. If I lived closer, I'm not sure I would be able to stop myself from coming back everyday.
