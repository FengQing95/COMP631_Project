The Purple Pig////The worst part was the octopus, which was so incredibly acidic that it wasn't edible. It was like eating a lemon. Every component of the dish was acidic, there was no balance in flavors. Our waitress was very nice and sent it back, giving us the option to have the beets instead, which ended up being our favorite dish. The pecan butter that came with it was honestly my favorite part of the meal.
