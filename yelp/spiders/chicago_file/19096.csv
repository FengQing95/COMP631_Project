Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////the atmosphere of this place is killer, feels like where Al Capone would do his business if he wanted to eat pizza while he was doing so. there's a bar by the entrance with a couple people watching baseball on TV, and further inside it's slightly dim with sports memorabilia all over the walls. It definitely has an old-school feel to it, which i absolutely loved!
