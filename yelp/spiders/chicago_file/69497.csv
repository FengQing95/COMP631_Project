Little Goat Diner////Let's talk about the food for a minute, mmkay?  I had, what was described to me as a blue plate special, or, what I like to call, Heaven on a plate.  Yes, it was that good.  To begin with, there was a goat hot dog.  Of course it was goat, what else would I expect at a place called Little Goat Diner?  That goat hot dog was then wrapped in a very large, fluffy, pancake.  As if it couldn't get any better, that was then topped with two eggs, cooked to perfection.  Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, the entire plate was then covered with a maple barbecue syrup.  YES. PLEASE.  It was divine.  My mouth still waters when I think about it.
