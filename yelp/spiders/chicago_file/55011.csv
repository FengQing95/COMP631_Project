Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba with a couple of friends. We got a pitcher of sangria which unfortunately I did not try (had some work to finish later that night! :( ) for our group, which serves around 6-7 drinks per $16 pitcher. I tried several of the tapas/pinxtos. Out of the pinxtos, I only got the chorizo with pepper: not bad, good flavor and texture. Out of the tapas, meatballs: only 2 per serving. tasty, but tiny portions and tasted like something you could probably make at home. Chicken/ham croquetas: DELICIOUS, great texture and the dipping sauce was great as well. Beef empanada: the flakiness of the crust was amazing. the empanada was a decent size as well. Overall, the portions are pretty small, but I guess that's to be expected for $1-$3.50 tapas. I left feeling a little less full than I expected I'd be.
