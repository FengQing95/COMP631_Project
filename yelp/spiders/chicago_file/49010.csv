Smoque BBQ////Absolutely the best! You cannot go wrong with anything you order. Brisket is of course elite. Everything else is of the highest quality, even usual side-throw-away items like the coleslaw (that tangy vinegar goes great with sweet bbq sauce) and fries are killer. If you haven't been and you are from Chicago - what is wrong with you!
