Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I ordered the berry bliss crepes & they were DELICIOUS! I'm a fan of anything w/ berries in it, but these crepes were amazing. They weren't too sweet or too bland. I feel like some crepes are too bland & just taste like... egg? Idk, but there was a perfect amount of flavor! I also got a side of hashbrowns & they were also good :)
