Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////On our hotel concierge's recommendation ordered a thin crust cheese pizza and a spinach salad. First of all I was told it would take an hour for the delivery and our hotel was around the corner! Secondly when it did arrive about an hour ten minutes later, the pizza was cold, the crust hard and dry and just plain awful! For a restaurant that boasts about it's pizza this was one of the worst pizzas we have ever had. Never again! The salad was ok.
