Smoque BBQ////Other reasons I say Smoque is getting even better: the Peach Cobbler, previously not sweet enough, changed for the better about a year ago. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of overly sweet desserts, but the cobbler did not have enough sugar to feel like a dessert; they've obviously changed the recipe slightly and it is sweeter, but balanced well without sacrificing its complexity. But perhaps the most important recent improvement at Smoque (besides greater consistency on the meat) is the addition of a second, thicker and tangier sauce, so that now you get two generous tubs of additional sauce standard with each order. Their original thinner, more vinegary, and peppery sauce is still my favorite (I'm thankful they didn't mess with it!), but it's a near toss-up, and I love having both choices and just more sauce overall.
