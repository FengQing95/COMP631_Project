Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Wow. Bavette's is one of the best places I have ever been to. I'm just going to get to the point, the best things to try. The baked goat cheese is a great way to start your meal, the east coast oysters are perfect, the truffle Mac and cheese blends is so creamy and delicious, the 20 oz Bone in Ribeye (Bottom on steak section) is one of the best steaks I've ever had, and the griddled burger with bacon is wonderful. The only thing is that the bacon is really thick so it may be too overwhelming.
