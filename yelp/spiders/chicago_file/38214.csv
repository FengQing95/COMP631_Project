Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The byob policy is controversial for some. You've heard about it--bring a bottle and a glass is then bestowed to another table. I've been here a couple times and have been dismayed when a glass of our delicious Dom Perignon was given to another table only to sit untouched all evening. Can I have that back? Too good to waste. Most other times, people have appreciated sharing in our bubbly and/or wine, and have stopped by our table to thank us. It's always gratifying when someone does that. I love the conviviality the byob policy provides, and I've not seen that elsewhere. Don't like it? Then you can always order beer, wine or cocktails off the menu and then you don't have to share.
