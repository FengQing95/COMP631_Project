Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Traveled through Chicago from Los Angeles on a cross country road trip. My friends and I were dying to get some deep dish, authentic Chicago pizza. We asked around and found a lot of people telling us to go to various places. We ended up going here (cause I remembered my old teacher, a Chicago native, recommended this place) and I was pretty happy about it. The pizza was pretty dang good. I am not sure if it was authentic Chicago--but I do know it tasted pretty dang awesome.
