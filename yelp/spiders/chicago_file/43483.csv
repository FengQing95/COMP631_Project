Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It's restaurant week and I've been going to different places in Chicago. Most of the places are high end restaurants but nevertheless not so impressive. But I felt that I have to write a review for Cafe BabaReeba. We went for brunch and had to make a last-minute time change and they gladly did it for us over the phone, even though on Open Table it was completely booked. We were seated right away. Ambience was OK , cool decor, and service was great. Several servers came by to ask how everything was, and the Â waiter patiently explained the menu to us. Food came fairly quickly, and the tapa-style brunch was really a fun experience. The portions were OK. The citrus French toast was really good but expensive ($2 for one small piece of French toast) . Towards the end, one of the tapas came a little late, and they gave it to us for free! Overall the brunch cost us $26 with 2 leftover tapa dishes. I would definitely come back.
