Smoque BBQ////Best brisket ever!  Get the platter, sliced.  Meat falls off the bone and is melt in your mouth delicious.  The slaw on the side is also pretty fantastic, and I don't really eat typical mayo-based coleslaw (pretty sure this is more of a vinegar based cabbage anyways).  Pulled pork and Texas sausage is good too, but you can get better pulled pork elsewhere in my opinion.  The brisket alone grants a 5 star review.  And the mac and cheese!
