Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We decided to go for the smaller tapas selections rather than ordering a massive pile of paella.  Our kind server was very patient with us during the ordering process, and we did go with some of her advice.  Everything was tasty, and to be honest I was surprised that we were filled up after "only" six tapas choices.  The citrus-cured salmon is a beautifully presented platter with cucumber, radish, crema, and toast.  I really liked the creamy texture of the Iberico ham croquetas, paired with a cup of sherry aioli for dipping.  We also enjoyed the garlic potato salad, mushrooms stuffed with spinach and manchego cheese, short rib with glazed carrots and mashed potatoes, and the special of the day empanada.
