Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I don't know how this place could get anything less than 5 stars! It's seriously the best tapas place I've been to in the city.  Just ate their last night and I honestly have been day dreaming about the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce and the patas bravass... YUM!  My boyfriend, who is a VERY picky eater, actually ate something off of all 10 tapas that we ordered which is literally a miracle.  Do yourself a favor and go!
