Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As for the sides, obviously can't recommend the sweet potato.  The brussel sprouts though... were incredible, very well balanced flavors, just the right amount of acidity that paired perfectly with our steaks.  The truffle mac was also pretty good, though you really don't get any truffle flavor here, generic truffle oil usage to "class up" good ol mac n cheese is my assumption here, regardless still pretty good.
