Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Late night dinner at this joint. Got there around 930 and the wait was about 40 minutes. Luckily there were two seats available at the bar so we took them and skipped the wait. Ordered the three dip appetizer and a classic deep dish pizza with butter crust. Everything tasted very good. Service was adequate at the bar. Will definitely go back.
