Art Institute of Chicago////My prime interest was in their temporary exhibit, "Modern and Contemporary Works on Paper", which was easily determined to be in Galleries 124-127 from the website.  I took an easy amble up South Michigan Avenue and enjoyed seeing the free Summer Dance lesson series (tango was featured then) in Grant Park as I made my way.
