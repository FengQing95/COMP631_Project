Little Goat Diner////I love this place!!! The food is very good and unique. I tried the paratha burrito was amazing and I also had the noodles with veggie it was amazing! They have great choices for vegetarians. We went on the weekend so there was a long wait. I waited an hour to be seated but it was worth it. By the time my turn came up the long wait was gone and people after me didn't have wait,so if you can wait to go there it would make things easier. The wait wasn't bad. I just walked around and checked out the area. There are great coffee shops around and I had some coffee. The area is nice to explore.
