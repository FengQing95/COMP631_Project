Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Positives: Bavette's is our go-to when we are celebrating or have company in town. Our guests are always so impressed. The service, food and ambiance are always exceptional. We love the baked goat cheese to start and the truffle mac. Be sure to order a few sides along with your meal and save room for pie!
