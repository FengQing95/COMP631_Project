Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had a wonderful time here, the service is excellent and the patio/outdoor seating is wonderful! We had two types of sangria, one was a fruit flavor and the other was red wine. I preferred the red wine variety as it was stronger tasting. All the food was very good, we had a lot of different dishes, if you are having trouble figuring out what to get just keep an eye on the servers and see what is coming out.
