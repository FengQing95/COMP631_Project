Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Let me start with the good.  Wow!  Deep dish isn't really my bag, but this was some seriously yummy pizza.  Crust was light and crispy, with a really nice yeasty flavor to it.  Sauce was tangy and fresh- a bit acidic- reminded me of eating a tomato.  Pepperoni was buried in there somewhere and was also good.
