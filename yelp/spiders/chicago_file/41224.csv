Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Well... tried Damn near everything and most of it was okay. It was a fun quasi fancy Spanish place that made me feel "trendy". I wasn't lifting up the table with my lap over the food, but it was different and new and I wanted to experience fine things. What was amazing was the free flan they gave us at the end. I'm a fan of their flan.
