Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Wow! This place is awesome from the second you walk through the door. It's dark!  It looks like a place Al Capone would frequent.  We did not have a reservation but got a couple stools at the bar. Sitting at the bar was like sitting at an open kitchen restaurant.  The old school bar and bartenders were great to watch and talk to. We started with the duck liver and goat cheese terrine. The terrine was great, super rich. My partner ordered the wedge salad. It was reported to be the best wedge salad ever. I had the fried chicken, which was fantastic. Desert was also to die for.  Don't pass this place up. I went back the next night! I couldn't get enough.  I had a steak and it was to die for.  This place is not only has amazing food but the atmosphere is equally delectable.  If you are in Chicago make sure that you visit.  Even if it's only for a drink, VISIT!
