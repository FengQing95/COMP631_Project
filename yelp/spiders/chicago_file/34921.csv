Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So yes, this is absolutely as good as it gets. I made reservations here for my boyfriends birthday.  They were incredibly accommodating, assuring me they would have a nice table for us.  Upon arrival we had a few minutes to wait so we headed to the bar.  Ambiance is really important to me and wow ... this place has it!  The sound of 1920's music will make you feel like you're starring in a scene from The Great Gatsby and the gold accents, chandelier and dark lighting brings about a prohibition romance that makes you want to drink whiskey :)  They have plentiful array of whiskey, scotch and bourbon, which really got me excited.  The bartender could have been a bit more attentive, but the attention to detail in our drinks made up for any confusion.
