Smoque BBQ////There is one major thing I did not like about Smoque and it was the sauce.  I am not a BBQ aficionado but typically like more of a sweet brown sugar, thick and tangy type sauce.  The sauce at Smoque is pretty thin and tastes a lot like vinegar  - just a little too much for me.   In fact, at the end of my meal I had to eat my brisket without sauce.
