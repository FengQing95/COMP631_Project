Smoque BBQ////I heard about this place from several neighbors and finally got a chance to check it out. It was a Saturday at about 6 PM. The line was out the door. We wondered if this place could be worth the 20 minute wait and almost left. Sure glad we didn't! Best brisket I have ever had, no question. I met one of the owners in line and he took me thru the kitchen. They smoke 600 lbs of brisket at a time and have 2 of these Southern Pride smokers. The ribs were good but don't stand up to the brisket or pulled pork. Peach cobbler, beans and mac/cheese are Â excellent.
