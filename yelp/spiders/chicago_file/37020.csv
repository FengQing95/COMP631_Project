Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is BYOB, but the uncorking fee is sharing a glass with a table of your choice. The pours are pretty hefty but still a fun process. The filet mignon and mashed potatoes are the best. You'll be full when you leave but take a chocolate cream pie to go and you won't regret it.
