Smoque BBQ////Fat Willy's is still my number-one, hands-down favorite in the city.  They beat out Smoque on flavor, options, portions, taste, and ambience (by a long shot).  I may be spoiled, but other places raised the bar for me and I think Smoque is only going to do well because of its relative isolation.
