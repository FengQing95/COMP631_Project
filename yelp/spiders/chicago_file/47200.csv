Smoque BBQ////I had my hopes up very high I guess after seeing this joint on Triple D. And I love bbq. My fiance hit this dive up yesterday around 7ish pm & there was a small line one the door, but it moved pretty quickly. The place is pretty snug & is like a cafeteria style with the arrangement. It really looks like a dive.The smell was driving me insane, it smelled amazing. I scanned the menu quickly & decided upon a chopped brisket sandiwch & a half slab of st. louis ribs, my fiance (who didn't know the sandwich was going to be an acutal whole sandwich) did the half and half w/sliced brisket sandwich & pulled pork. We ordered for the sides, 2 drinks, a large macaroni and cheese, a large fry, and a large cole slaw. Total price: $46 dollars. We got seated by one the guys. It was packed inside. Â We didn't wait too long for the food which was a good thing. I quickly poured the sauce over the brisket sandwich and took a bite. The brisket itself was alright, I didn't get too much flavor from it, which I was surpised because I thought the guy put like a million spices on it. I did not like the sauce at all. I know this is because I am more partial to sweet sauces more than vinegar based ones. The fries were out of this world I loved them, I think my fiance only had a handful and I had the paperbag (which by the way is a great idea because the bag soaks up the grease). The macaroni and cheese was cheesy and I love the crust on top, it just needed a little bit more salt though. The cole slaw was deliciously tangy and refreshing. The ribs were amazingly juicy, tender, full of flavor, and literally fell off the bone. Pulled pork was alright, wish it had a better kick to it and the Texas sausauge tasted like a polish sausage! The drive for us and the price was not worth it for us unfortunately. in addition, the bus boys made me feel very rushed, they kept eyeing us and asking about taking our trays, it pissed me off & made me uncomfortable, it's not my damn fault the place is small & there's a big line, WTF you want me to do!!! I couldnt enjoy my food because of it even if it did taste ok. Better keep looking for a better bbq place.
