Smoque BBQ////My mom absolutely loves this place! They have the best brisket around. I am also crazy about their corn bread and mac and cheese. Smoque is a must try if you live in Chicago, or if you have a taste for bbq and you are visiting Chicago. Next time, I visit, I would like to try their ribs.
