Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Popped into Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe for the first time today. What an experience!! I'd attempted to visit in the past, but usually with friends and the wait times were usually an hour plus, so I never made it in. Came in alone today and I now know why the waits are so long. This place awesome!! Starting with the service- my server, Dustin, was charismatic, upbeat, funny & full of great suggestions! I pretty much left things up to him. He suggested the "butcher block" with the "cinnamon roll" pancakes on the side. Butcher block was perfect and just the rite amount. The pancakes- literally the best I've had in forever!! Hadn't had the flavors of those pancakes in my mouth in years!! THANK YOU, DUSTIN!! I will be back (even if I have to wait an hour plus)!!
