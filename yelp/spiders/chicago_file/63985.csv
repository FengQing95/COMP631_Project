Smoque BBQ////I wondered how this joint could sustain 4.5 stars after so many reviews.   Then I went. I like BBQ.  Now I will always compare BBQ to Smoque.  The smoky flavor permeates the ribs, chicken and brisket- bringing them  to a heavenly level. The sides were excellent as well.  If they are making pecan bread pudding, do yourself a favor and get it.     This is a definite return visit next time I'm in Chicago.
