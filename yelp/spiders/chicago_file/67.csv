Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We've been back at least half a dozen times since the prior review and gotten take out on a couple of occasions - we have yet to be disappointed!  We did discover relatively recently that you can substitute various side items for slight upcharges - so, for instance, you can get a skillet (my favorite is the Venetian with bacon added) and for $1 or so extra get a bliss berry crepe as the side item instead of toast/English muffin/etc.  Always great service and great food!!
