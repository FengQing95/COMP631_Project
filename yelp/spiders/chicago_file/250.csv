Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Be prepared to wait if you go on a weekend. Â Both waiting areas were packed but the seemed to get people in and out quickly to keep pace. I was expecting a bit more from the pancakes. I'm not sure I will ever find pancakes as good as Clinton Street Bakery in NYC or Sabrinas in Philly so I would try something different if I ever go back.
