Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////During the first interaction with our waiter, we explained that we had one dairy allergy at the table. No, this is not someone who decided to cut out dairy, go vegan, whatever. She has a severe allergy to dairy (different to being lactose-intolerant). We explained this to our waiter. Normally at other restaurants when we explain her dairy allergy to our wait staff, they respond quite attentively. This waiter seemed to brush off our statement, and carried on taking the order.
