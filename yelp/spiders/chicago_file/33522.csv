Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I was nervous pulling up to it because you can barely spot the door from the street and there was street construction going on it so easily looks like a hole in the wall from the outside. You walk into a little hostess stand room that is separate from the restaurant so you can't see what the place looks like right away...but as soon as you open the next door it's a beautiful ambiance! There is brick wall, dim/dark lighting, and looks very classy. Our waiter was amazing and so helpful in picking out dishes. We tried the beef tongue and as gross as it might sound to describe this way, it melted in your mouth! It tasted very good and I was happy I tried it. The broccoli side was huge heads of broccoli and was also very tasty. I ordered a petite filet and while I've had better, I was still happy with it. I will try a non-steak entr√©e the time I visit. We ordered the chocolate cream pie which comes with whip cream. I added a scoop of vanilla ice cream as I think every chocolate dessert should come with that! I was glad I did.
