The Purple Pig////Now this may just be one women's opinion, but I feel as though others would agree with me if they tasted these dishes. I was pretty surprised to only see 4 and 5 stars on this page. I have also heard rave reviews about purple pig so have been excited to try it for a while. I was sorely disappointed, but perhaps my palate is simply not accustomed to these flavors/dishes.
