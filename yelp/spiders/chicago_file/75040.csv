Little Goat Diner////I love the concept and did think the recipes were creative and sounded delicious, I just thought the execution fell short, and the service was terrible. Â We were rushed in and out by an apathetic table-turning waitress who never came back to check on us (I waited to eat for nearly 20 minutes because I wanted salt and pepper shakers, finally gave up and ate eggs that were unseasoned...strange for a pretty nice place).
