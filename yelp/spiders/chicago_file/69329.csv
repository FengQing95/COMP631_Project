Little Goat Diner////We came here for a late brunch and called in ahead of time to check if there wasn't going to be a long wait out the door! Since there wasn't, we rushed out the door to head to the restaurant! I love the ambiance of this restaurant, it was very open, very lively and it felt like a nice place to have a morning chat with someone! My girlfriend and I ordered the Parathas Burrito and the Corned Beef Hash as the main and had to try their tempura mashed potatoes on the side as suggested! As hungry as we were, the tempura mashed potatoes was very different and tasty! I liked it a lot! My girlfriend loved the parathas burrito and I was absolutely stuffed from the portions of the corned beef hash! Don't forget to get a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice! Cheers
