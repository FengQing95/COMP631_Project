Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our bill was $136 including tip. That's about $30 per person (only one drink per person). Â I think you pay for the experience of trying a lot of different dishes. This is not the place for you if you want a filling meal with lots of cocktails. If you do, be prepared to pay for it.
