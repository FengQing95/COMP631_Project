Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////People have been raving about this place. I liked the ambiance very secret and chill. Server was snoody. Our wedge tasted like dill pickles and our steak had no flavor and was kind of tough! Our drinks were just okay. I like trying new cocktails and admire the art of a bartender but this place was just a big no. Especially for the price of everything was definitly not worth it!
