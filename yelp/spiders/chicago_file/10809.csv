Art Institute of Chicago////This was my first visit to the Art Institute and I was not disappointed. The museum is very large and sprawling. Get a map! Plan for at least a couple hours. I spent three. Make sure you see the heavy hitters of the collection (American Gothic, Nighthawks, Sunday Afternoon, etc) but don't buzz past the rest getting there. The AI has tons of great European and American modern art. I spent a long time with the collection of Georgia O'keeffes, many I'd never seen before even in books.
