Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have never once taken a bite out of a slice of Lou Malnati's pizza and regretted it. The cheese is all melted and there are never any uncooked parts. The meat is cooked perfectly having a juicy tone to it with every taste. The crust is never burned and is always how you ordered it. The crust has the best crunch to it and smells phenomenal.
