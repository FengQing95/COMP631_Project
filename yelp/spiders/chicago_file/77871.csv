Little Goat Diner////For food, I had the shrimp and grits - a bit salty, but flavorful. Very mild spice and it was very stew like. My husband had the bulls eye French toast which is a egg in the hole style with pre-chopped pieces of fried chicken breast (think the sized pieces like you'd get in a salad). I know it's messier, but with both our dishes I would have preferred shrimp in the shells and chicken on the bone. I feel like at what's considered an upscale diner they'd have large prawns perhaps or show you that the shrimp have been grilled or something. Do midwesterners prefer this style i wonder? We got waffles for my daughter, but she ended up mostly eating the dark chocolate chip pancakes my husband decided to splurge on for the table to share!
