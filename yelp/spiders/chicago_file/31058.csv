Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For our deep dish, we went the classic and it was better than we expected - thinking we were going to be presented a doughy pizza, instead it was the opposite, less bread and more of everything else. Each slice you cut is oozing of cheese and sauces, leaving us eager to take a bite, and it didnt stop with one bite, or one slice. This is the best pizza I have ever had.
