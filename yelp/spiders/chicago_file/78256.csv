Little Goat Diner////First of all the portion size is huge and the prices are very reasonable. The pork belly pancake I ordered was really good until I ate half of it. Perhaps this is just me who feels this way but I felt like the food overall was very heavy. Perhaps because they give too much food. It's great from the value standpoint but all 4 of us left food in the end and it made me wonder a bit about what if this place lowers the portion size and the price? But I always think about that everywhere I go.... regardless this is a great option. I heard their breakfast is great so maybe I should come back for that. I would give this place 4.5 stars if I could. It's better than 4 stars but a bit less than 5 stars
