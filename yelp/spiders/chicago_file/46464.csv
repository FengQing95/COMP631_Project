Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here a few times, with big groups and one on one. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. It's the only place I would be just as happy to go for brunch with my girlfriends, a dinner date, and a big dinner with a large group. It's affordable, filling, and delicious. The staff is courteous, fun, and charming. I absolutely love this place.
