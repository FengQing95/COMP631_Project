Art Institute of Chicago////First of, a visit to the AIC is an ineffable experience. There really is no way to describe in words the feelings, sensations, stimulation, experience, and catharsis that this place engenders. When I lived in the city I would visit almost every Thursday and take in the culture. It's amazing how each visit draws out a new emotion or way of deconstructing art. Of artwork the most I know about and relate to is painting and this place has some of the best. Where to start...Poussin, Miró, Chirico, Cézanne, Lautrec, Degas, Winslow, Goya, Bacon...the list goes on. Some of the better known works by the more esteemed painters of history can be found here. If entering from the west entrance and walking up the concrete stairs to the impressionist room you can only imagine what awaits you. A masterpiece by Caillebotte, a room full of Renoir, walking around the corner and there is a Manet, into the next room and there is Seurat calling you in to the world of pointillism, a Cassatt or two. If you can manage to pick your jaw off the floor and move into the next room you are greeted by a self-portrait from some Dutch painter who lived with Gauguin and sliced off the lobe of his ear. Some more of his impasto canvases lead into a room with some large Lautrec works that would be best to stare at on acid. Had enough yet? Then it's off to the Monet room; ever seen one of his paintings with snow? Ever seen some haystacks at different times of the day? Ever seen one of his hardly distinguishable paintings from the cataract eyes? Luckily enough there was a Rodin exhibit going on so that was a nice treat in and amongst some other impression paintings. There were large and small bronze works, a few drawings, and a rather extensive history on the artist. Then it's off to the Gauguin world of Tahiti and some 2D Cézanne still life works that make you question physics. How can he paint that table with a bowl of fruit on it where the table looks almost vertical and the bowl doesn't roll off the table? Mind blown! From here it's a tough decision to make...the modern and contemporary rooms with Pollock, de Kooning; up to the surrealists of Tanguay, Dali, Magritte, Chirico; to the cubists of Gris, Picasso, Braque; modernists of Chagall, Matisse, and Mondrian; or do we move onto a different medium? Ancient Roman marble, Greek pottery, Chagall windows, Steuben glass, Native American anthropology, Japanese block prints, an exhibit on ancient Chinese bronze, the possibilities are endless. Maybe if you're lucky they will bring back The Supper at Emmaus by Caravaggio. Maybe you need a break and want to hit the book store, or grab a bite to eat at the cafe. Or maybe you want to check out some quilts, some Islamic doors from the 13th century, or maybe you want to see hundreds of silver cutlery and dinnerware settings. Maybe it's oak furniture. Maybe it's Remington bronze work. Maybe it's time to think about the space you're in and the wonders they have in the archives. Either way I'm going back to my favorites in this place. Then off to the redline where I patiently await the next Thursday, or the next exhibit, or the next time the Blackhawks make the Stanley cup and the concrete lions who protect this kingdom are festooned with oversized hockey helmets. Or maybe I will watch Ferris Bueller's day off and realize how special this place truly is.
