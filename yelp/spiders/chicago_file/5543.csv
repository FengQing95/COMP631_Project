The Purple Pig////Love love loved my experience at The Purple Pig! I don't even know where to begin...we came to here for a spontaneous lunch on a Friday with my cousins.  I'd heard great things, but never really took the initiative to try it out.  But boy am I glad that I did!  We waited about 5 minutes for a table for our party of 6.  They expanded this new location which is conveniently right next to the old to provide more seating, that's how busy they are!
