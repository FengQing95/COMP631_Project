Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been here for both breakfast and dinner and honestly have never been disappointed. Everything is absolutely perfect and delicious. I truly loved the big breakfast paella. It's a definite would recommend for a big group. The shrimp & grits are also one of the best dishes I have had. ~4 items for 2 people is perfect!
