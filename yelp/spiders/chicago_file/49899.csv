Smoque BBQ////Now, the atmosphere isn't absolutely perfect, but it works, and wow, is that food incredible!  Their menu is the basics of barbeque.  So far I've had the brisket and the St. Louis ribs.  Both are spectacular.  I have never had ribs with better texture, they're just cooked perfectly.  The meat is excellently flavored, but it's almost a side act to the sauce.  This rib sauce is the best I've ever tasted, it is absolutely amazing.  The brisket sauce is less striking, but it's busy taking a backseat to the meat.  The brisket is almost falling apart, and can actually take a little work to eat with a fork, but is somehow not overcooked.  It's got a wonderfully slow flavor, and my girlfriend will testify that I sat there just staring off into space as each bite worked its way on through to a perfect smoky aftertaste.
