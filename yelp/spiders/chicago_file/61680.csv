Smoque BBQ////Best BBQ around. When I lived close by I ate there at least once a week. Now I enjoy bringing my friends for their first time. The meat is always so tinder and they are quick to get the orders out. You may see a line. But they are really good about getting people in and out of there. I looked forward to trying their catering menu at my next party.
