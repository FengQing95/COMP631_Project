Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered the brussels sprout salad, spicy potatoes with tomato aioli, garlic potato salad, the short run with manchego mashed potatoes, citrus cured salmon, grilled iberico pork shoulder, and the paella valenciana. I also got the mango sangria which I loved since it didn't have a strong wine taste to it.
