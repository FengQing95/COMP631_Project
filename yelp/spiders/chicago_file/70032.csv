Little Goat Diner////This place is an upscale hip diner. Fatty comfort food made with alot of effort and expertise. I couldn't stop ogling all the food passing by! After much discussion, we decided on shrimp & grits and smoked fries. We put our order in and instantly regretted it. We wanted the french toast & chicken, and the fat elvis waffles, and the biscuits and gravy....just everything. Lucky for us when our food came-- we were overjoyed at how delicious and satisfying it was! The flavor was complex in a mind blowing way. How do they make brussels spouts fit so perfectly with shrimp & grits?!
