Little Goat Diner////Not your typical brunch spot with any of your typical brunch menu items. The items on the menu are over priced for the quality and execution you're getting. This place tries a too hard to putting their own twist on classic dishes that don't need changing. We ordered the paratha burrito and the caesar salad. the caesar salad added ingredients that don't need to be in a caesar and the Romain lettuce was cut in atypical ways which resulted in me not eating it. The paratha (South Asian bread) was not really a paratha but rather flat bread and really felt like it was appropriating a culture with putting this on the menu and not doing it correctly.
