The Purple Pig////After doing a quick Yelp search, it looked like Purple Pig was closing in 33 minutes. We figured they wouldn't be seating people anymore, but F it, it was worth a shot. To our surprise, we walked right in and got a table. Quite a difference from the 2 hour wait we're used to seeing here.
