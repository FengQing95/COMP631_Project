Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba has a small plate concept.  You order a bunch of different plates for the table.  If you've ever gone to a restaurant and fretted over which dish to get, you will love that you can order multiple things. If you are someone who doesn't like to share food then I absolutely would not recommend this place because part of the experience is trying all the different things.
