Smoque BBQ////I went with the half and half. Half pulled pork, and half brisket sandwich. For my side I got the Mac and Cheese. It also came with coleslaw. The pulled pork was tasty. Though It was a tad on the bland side, somehow the smoke didn't fully come out in the meat. The sauce helped to add some zing though. It was a tasty sauce, I really liked that it was a vinegar based BBQ because it had a nice tang to it. The brisket half was a whole other story. It was moist tender super smokey. Also had a different sauce. Still tangy but it had a little bite to it as well. The brisket was the clear winner. I ate all my coleslaw, I usually am not a fan of the stuff, but it was not a mayo based slaw. It was crisp tangy, slightly sweet. Yum. The mac and cheese was done very well, it was buttery creamy and cheesy. I just wish that the side had more than three bites in it!
