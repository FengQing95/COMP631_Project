Little Goat Diner////4 stars for the grilled cheese and the waiter's awesome drink recommendations. they were really great about accommodating a larger than usual party (8ish people). a couple of the girls in the group ordered salads that ended up looking surprisingly good (but seriously who orders salad at a diner??) and the rest of the table shared a crab dip (yum) and ordered a bunch of sandwiches.
