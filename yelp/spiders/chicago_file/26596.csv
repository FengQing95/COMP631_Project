Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////(1) Medium Malnati Classic - $20.45 - 3.5 stars - Lean sausage, cheese, and tomatoes, on a butter crust. I don't understand why you'd pay extra for the butter crust when it comes out hard as a rock. I always order the same pizza and it literally has no hint of butter. The pizza, being deep dish style, is rather heavy. That's to be expected of course. I don't think the pizza here is spectacular in any way but you can't really fail at pizza, can you?
