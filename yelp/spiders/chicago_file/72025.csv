Little Goat Diner////We went for lunch, and I got a caesar salad which was in a league of its own in regards to what you typically get ordering a caesar at restaurants which amounts to some vaguely tossed romaine with some chicken slapped on top. Everyone else ordered from all over the menu ranging from breakfast-y stuff to more dinner-style entrees and everything looked great.
