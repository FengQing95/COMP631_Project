Little Goat Diner////It's a diner, but kicked up a notch and a half. There is something resembling most of your diner favorites on the menu, but it will cost more, and be... elevated. You'll also see things nothing like what you'd see in a normal diner. I've been here a few times and always tried something different, and I've never been disappointed. Some faves are the Los Drowned (very messy, and watch out for some pieces of fat), the BBQ Pork and Tonkatsu. The sandwiches are generally large, but word of warning: they are a la carte. The smoked fries are pricey at $7, but they are enough for at least two people. In true diner fashion, you can order breakfast all day.
