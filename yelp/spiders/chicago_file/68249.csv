Little Goat Diner////This place has 176 reviews not recommended. No way does Goat deserve 4 stars. Been to this place when it first opened and it was horrible. I decided to try it out for breakfast this morning. First time ever receiving breakfast with no toast. Tried the corn beef hash, it was really salty and the corn beef was not cooked right. Crispy in some parts and tender in others. Bland sums it up. Waiter was not good either. Waiter didnt ask if we needed anything. He was too busy being a hipster. These places try to hard. Breakfast is not complex.
