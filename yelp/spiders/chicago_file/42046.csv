Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I should have written this review a long, long time ago.  As far as Tapas in Chicago, Café Babareeba is my favorite place to go.  I have been to others such as Café Iberico (which is good in its own right), but this place gets the gold star!  The food is absolutely delicious, and the sangria will sneak up on you...after 3 pitchers...haha.  My all time favorite dish here is the Paella Valenciana (chicken, pork, green beans).  I can seriously eat that everyday for the rest of my life.  My other favorites are the Patatas Bravas (spicy potatos), and the beef tenderloin toro (beef skewers).  The service is always good, and the atmosphere is lively.  They have several events at the restaurant, including a Paella cooking class which I have to take.  Tapas can get expensive, especially if you order a lot of plates which range in prices from $5.50 to $11.00, but its definitely worth it.  This is one of my favorite places in Chicago to eat, and that is saying a lot since Chicago is such a great restaurant city.  I'm sorry I couldn't make this review more "funny" or "entertaining" but I just keep picturing that Paella and my mind turns to mush.  Oh, and before I end my review...you MUST order the flan for dessert. YOU MUST!!!
