Smoque BBQ////I find it remarkable that the service doesn't collapse during the dinner rush, if I had to guess I would attribute that composure to the leadership of the owner who you will typically find standing guard sporting some nifty Zuba-esque chef pants, and ushering patrons to tables. Â The small dining room, BYOB, and counter service seems to be a disaster waiting to happen, but even with the line out the door, we have typically been seated at a table with our food within 15 minutes of arrival. Now that is now you do BBQ, Chicago!
