Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Meh... I was there for dinner on a Friday night. The restaurant was packed to the capacity but I don't know what the hype is about. We were seated right away which is a huge plus. We ordered a bunch of cold and hot tapas and seafood paella for an entree. The food was mediocre, nothing really stood out. We also got a half pitcher of red sangria which I swear had zero alcohol in it. It was boring, I was glad that we didn't order a whole pitcher of it. After sangria failed to impress we switched to wine which was server's recommendation but once again, it was bland and uninteresting. I checked this place out once and will not be back.
