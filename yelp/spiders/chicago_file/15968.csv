Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I can see why we had to wait almost 1 1/2 hours to be seated. Thankfully, you can place your order when you enter your name into the system. They take your cell phone and text you when your table is available. The only downside was that it was still going to take a half hour to get the pizza. So we ordered the caprese salad. Very yummy and it hit the spot. The pizza was delicious.
