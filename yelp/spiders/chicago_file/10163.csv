Art Institute of Chicago////The day we were there they had a very big Magritte ("this is not a pipe") exhibit. The number of pieces and supporting documents were impressive, but even more so was the environment in which the pieces were shown. It was very dark, and in one section they had one work displayed on successive walls that you sort of snaked your way through. I'm not describing it well, but it really was a wonderful way to experience the pieces.
