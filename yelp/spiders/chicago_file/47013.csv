Smoque BBQ////Came all the way from Houston, Texas to check out this BBQ on the recommendation of our Chicago family. Sure... we saw it on the Food Network but who knows more about BBQ than Texans??? We were skeptical but let me tell you this is the REAL DEAL...ribs smoked to perfection, tender and delicious brisket, unforgettable sausage and even got to sample the Turkey which they will hopefully add to the menu. Excellent sides...don't miss the Mac & Cheese, just enough grease on the fries. BBQ sauces were perfect...I'd put Smoque up to any Texas BBQ in our state and we don't ever make those kind of claims. Don't tell our folks back home...but you got a great thing going Chicago. Smoque is AWESOME!!!
