Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's in middle of downtown so it was a short walk for us. At a great location and the outside patio looked amazing. We were welcomed in and they quickly got us a table. We didn't know what to get, so we were recommended the Malnati Chicago Classic Pizza and the chicken Alfredo.
