Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I went here with 5 dudes, all of whom started with Old Fashioneds. Bavette's mixes up three ($13-14) - a standard version with single barrel Four Roses, a Sazerac with VS Cognac, and an extra strong one mixed with Weller's 107 proof. All are delicious, but the latter stood out in my mind - a no-nonsense cocktail with lots of swagger. Roast duck and Goat Cheese Terrine ($11.50) is a hefty and rich appetizer; the duck and cheese are not mixed together, but served heterogeneously, with a generous portion of grilled bread. This is well-executed charcuterie to say the least. Salads are all made to share; apple and belgian endive ($11.99) is a well-executed version of an old standard, and as with all great salads, not overdressed. The star in this category, however, is the poached Whitefish Caesar ($10); maybe it's my Jewish heritage, but the perfectly poached, smoky fish adds an unexpectedly perfect complement to the classic. I really enjoyed this. Steak Frites ($21, +$4 for various and sundry extra accoutrements) is reasonably priced and cooked to perfection, served with an ample side of perfectly fried spuds (which, along with Gilt Bar's, are among Chicago's best). It's well executed, but does not really stand out. Bone-in ribeye (somewhere around $50; I don't know because my friend, but not I, could afford it), on the other hand, melts in your mouth and has great beef flavor. This is an excellent cut of meat. Lamb Chops ($35) look like they come from the Flintstones, with massive bones and enormous hunks of meat. Beef Tongue ($18) is braised with a piquant red wine sauce and horseradish - I guess this was the second time a traditionally Jewish ingredient snuck its way onto this menu, and I'm ever so glad it did.
