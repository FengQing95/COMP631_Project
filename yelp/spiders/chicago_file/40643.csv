Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////had 7:30 reservations. didnt get seated until 8:15... wasnt a big deal. apparently for everyone else that had reservations, it was a big deal. as soon as we were called, the hostess was very apologetic and polite. we sat down and within 1 minute of being sat, one of the managers came by with a free plate of appetizers for us he was very apologetic for our wait. great service, unbeatable food and drinks. cant wait to go back!
