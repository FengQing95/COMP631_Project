Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Top notch food! This place stands out from all the other pizza places in Chiago, it's one of my favorites! I love the deep dish, baked pizza a lot. Whenever I'm semi-close to the area, it's an always go to on my list. The wait can be a bit excessive at times, but again this is quality stuff so I think the wait is justified in my opinion. The people who work here are always smiling, cheerful. Good environment and great food!
