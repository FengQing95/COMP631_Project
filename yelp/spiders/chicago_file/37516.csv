Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As for me, a genuine meat lover to the core, I chose to split the dry aged bone-in ribeye with my friend, medium rare, and oh so succulent! What came out was Jesus himself on a sizzling hot plate whispering, "eat me, eat me". A very juicy, perfectly cut, perfectly cooked, and perfectly seasoned steak that made my eyes look like they had hearts popping out of them (you know, like the emoji). This was *the BEST* steak I've had in Chicago, hands freaking down.
