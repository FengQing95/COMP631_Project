Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If Ba-Ba-Reeba were located in a small town, I'd rate it higher (3 stars)... but it's located in one of the largest cities in the US, so the quality, flavor and freshness should be compared with places like Boqueria (Flatiron) and Olea (Ft. Greene) in NYC. Or even Spain? I've only lived in Andalucia (Southern Spain) and I think the comparison is similar to Chinese food in the US (babareeba) vs. Chinese food in China...
