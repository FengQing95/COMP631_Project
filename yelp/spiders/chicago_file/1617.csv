Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I went to Wildberry and did not expect much, but I was pleasantly surprised. The waiters were very friendly and checked up on me often. The food was also delicious and ready fairly quickly. The one thing I would say though is that I could see the kitchen from my seat and you can see all of the employees that would be on their phones. I didn't see a problem with this, but some may think that is unprofessional. Overall, I loved the experience and I would love to go back!
