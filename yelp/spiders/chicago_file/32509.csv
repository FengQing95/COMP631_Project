Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This pizza was absolutely delicious!!! I've had Chicago deep dish only at Giordano's and this is hands down 10 times better!! I got the Chicago classic and it was cheesy and so flavorful! I don't think I could ever go somewhere else! I got the fruity juice cocktail and it was also delicious and refreshing!
