Smoque BBQ////Smoque focuses on BBQ done right.  There menu is small by some peoples standards but they are BBQ centric.  They focus on sandwiches and platters with offerings of Brisket, pulled pork, chicken, and Texas Sausage.  These are offered by the pound as well and they also have great ribs with various rubs and sauces.   I've taken my daughter to many different southern BBQ's and she put Smoque's brisket up against them all with a dinner bet.  I took the bet and must admit I lost the bet smiling.  The brisket was very flavorful and deliciously juicy.  The pulled pork was good as was the chicken.  I also had the shredded brisket taco's as it was taco Tuesday.  Overall the food was very good and the brisket EXCELLENT.  If I have one criticism it was the side offerings.  The cole slaw was very good but the mac n cheese just ok.  Some Jalapeno grits or deep fried okra would have brought a little more excitement than fries.  Just sayin...
