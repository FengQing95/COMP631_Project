Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's in Fox Point, Wisconsin is amazing. Their manager, Manny brings customer service to a new level. You can tell he takes pride in what he does and his employees are customer service focused as well. We had to wait just a little longer for our pizza, which is no big deal, pizza takes a while to cook and it's busy. No biggie. But he was honest and accommodating coming out to us to explain and went above and beyond. Their food is delicious and it's great to see that people take pride in what they do. It truly makes a difference. If you order pizza, order from here!
