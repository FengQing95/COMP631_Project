Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////While in Chicago for a business trip, I stopped by Giordano's, Gino's and Lou Malnati's.  I have to say hands down Lou's is the best one out of those 3 famous ones that everyone talks about.  The sauce is amazing and the crust is cooked perfectly.  Wash it down with a nice cold beer and it was a perfect meal.  I'm considering ordering them online and having them shipped to California since their website says they ship anywhere in the US.
