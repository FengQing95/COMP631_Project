Smoque BBQ////My buddy had the St Louis ribs, with mac & cheese and fries for sides.  He said that the ribs were quite tasty, nice and meaty, and while not cooked so that the meat was falling off the bone, it was close to that.  He didn't care for the BBQ sauce and said he preferred Sweet Baby Ray's. His thoughts about the slaw and fries mirrored mine.
