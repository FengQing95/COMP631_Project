Art Institute of Chicago////First thing to do once inside is to buy tickets, which are pricey. I remember something around $20.   Seems to me that a public art museum entrusted with preserving the finest examples of artistic expression should not charge.  After all, when I visited notre dame cathedral, we weren't charged then.  And they could make a ton.  What a line.  But the church isn't in it for the money and takes their solemn responsibility of administering the church business, solemnly.  The library is free too.  Maybe that's a better example of a public institution for the good of all. Of course I have no problem paying $18 for the willis tower skydeck tour.  They're jerks, I know that up front.   Now, if I'm being honest I don't really know if the art institute is actually a pubic institution.  So maybe my theory on the fairness on charging at museums is off base.  Also, maybe I need to get my head out of my a$$ and just pony up.  Hard to say.
