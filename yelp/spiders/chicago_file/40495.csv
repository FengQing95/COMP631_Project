Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The ambiance is really different and reminds me of a mob movie.  Great for spot for a date night. The food however took a while to come out and we had to send our steak back because it was brought out well done when we asked for medium rare. Overall i would say the steak was mediocre at best.  Other than that everything else was pretty good. Will definitely check out again.
