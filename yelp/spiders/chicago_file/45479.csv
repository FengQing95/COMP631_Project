Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A make your own bloody mary bar? I'm SOLD! For seven bucks I concocted the most delish mix of tomato juice, ketel one, celery salt, olives, lime juice, pepper, and a few more odds and ends. I tried to slowly savor it throughout the meal, which was an arduous feat to say the least. Â Luckily, I had a lot of distractions in the way of a most excellent bevy of tapas - including the goat cheese and tomato sauce, scallops with couscous and raisins, shrimp and cheese dip, baby baked potatoes with a pumkin sauce, and the highlight of the afternoon...dates wrapped in BACON (mmmmm, bacon).
