The Purple Pig////Their speciality fried brioche with the ricotta chckcLate filling was unreal. My coworker said it was so good he wanted to cry. The peanut butter cheesecake and the cafe latte were the perfect end to a one of a kind meal. If you're visiting for a couple days just stop by early and try it. You'll regret goin to some lame deep dish place over this.
