Little Goat Diner////We had the fried pickle appetizer, which was delicious. I ordered the blueplate special, which was pig's tail. There was some mishap and we ended up waiting quite a while for the food. Our server and the manager, however, were extremely apologetic and Â we ended up leaving with an optimistic opinion of the experience.
