Little Goat Diner////If I can write one word for review for this place, it is "creative". If you read the menu, you won't know what kind of cuisine it is because each dish has some very random ingredients together. Like the quesadilla I ordered, there were chive, cheese and blueberries in it. I also sneak tasted some other dishes my colleagues order. I think the fish dish was the best of the night.
