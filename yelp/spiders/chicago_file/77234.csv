Little Goat Diner////Besides the terrible reservation set-up they have, the food is great, and our waiter was attentive (although we were 100% sure he was stoned out of his mind:)). Overall, I'm not sure if I would make another trip back to Little Goat, but if you can snag a table on time, I'd say try it.
