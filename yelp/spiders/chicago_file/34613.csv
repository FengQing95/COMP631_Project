Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I love love love love coming here for any occasion! It's a great place to dine. The food is really savory. I even think about their food when I go to sleep! A few great things I enjoy here would have to be the ribeye, garlic shrimp, lamb chops, pomme frites, and the chick au jus. Overall, id recommend this place for a lovely dinner for two or even to just have dinner alone. Great service all the time! The waiters are so attentive, they sure must love their job!
