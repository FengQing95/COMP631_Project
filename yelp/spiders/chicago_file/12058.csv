Art Institute of Chicago////This is my favorite art museum in the US.. best I've ever been to in recent years. I budgeted 2.5 hrs to be spent and it was most definitely not enough. Toward the end of my budgeted time, I was speeding through the sections hoping to squeeze in as many pieces as possible before I had to leave... I don't think I've ever done that at a museum before. I am a big Impressionist fan and was blown away by how incredible the section dedicated to it was here. And I couldn't believe how beautiful this space overall! 1st floor galleries, 3rd floor modern art section, Chicago skyline you can see through the glass windows... even the museum store is fantastic. The only thing I didn't like was how I had to cross the gallery cafe to get to another side of the building, but it is not a big deal.
