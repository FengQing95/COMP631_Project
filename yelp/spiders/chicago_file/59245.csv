Smoque BBQ////Going early on a Sunday was great idea! No wait at all :) Best bbq in town hands down. I like the sliced brisket, hubby likes the pulled pork. Sometimes I have a sandwich and sometimes I do the platter. You really can't go wrong either way, probably just depends on how hungry you are. This last trip we tried a cheddar jalapeno sausage link that was AWESOME!  Really tasty, little spicy, great real cheese flavor. Their coleslaw is amazing- vinegar based, no mayo, tangy and delicious. It's BYO which is always nice. We live really close so we typically take it to go.  However, for a to-go order, you will want to plan ahead! We've been told anywhere from 45-90 mins and that's for a pickup, not delivery.  When the time is right, it's a must try...if you haven't been there already. :)
