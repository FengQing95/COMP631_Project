Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is just so dependable. I often venture here for dinner with out of town guests (many from NYC) and they all love it! The atmosphere is wonderful, the sangria is very good, and the menu has something for everyone (it is of course tapas!), and none of it disappoints. The service is typically excellent as well. The only reason I give 4 stars rather than 5 is because of all of Chicago's fabulous restaurants, nothing on the menu here is out of this world memorable, but again it's all very good! Prices are also quite reasonable.
