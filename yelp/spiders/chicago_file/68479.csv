Little Goat Diner////I don't understand why people will wait over an hour to eat here...! The food is ok, not horrible but not worth an hour wait. For a place that serves mediocre burgers and overly greasy food I don't understand the hype. We went on a Saturday night and waited way too long to sit at the counter only to listen to the kitchen manager yell at the staff for our entire meal (awkward)... We got chili cheese fries, tuna sandwich and patty melt, none of which was worth the wait or the experience. We won't go back.
