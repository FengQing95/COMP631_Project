Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great Chicago pizza. The thin crust is delicious but I prefer the thick crust. Not as thick as some other Chicago places but solid. I prefer the sausage or sausage and mushroom. Â It's not my absolute favorite Chicago pizza, that's Gino's East. But Lou's is still consistently 5-star quality.
