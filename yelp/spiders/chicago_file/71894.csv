Little Goat Diner////Just tried the new thing on the menu today: the little piggy went to China. It was really good, creative combination of authentic Sichuan flavor and American brunch! The Sichuan sausage was very authentic flavored! And the spice sauce on the biscuit taste so hometown. With the green Chinese onions on top, amazing!!! And of course, little goat would never fail in its biscuit!!
