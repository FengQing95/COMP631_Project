Art Institute of Chicago////This was my first visit to an art museum, and I was simply blown away. I could spend hours here. There are extensive collections of many different types of art, and my favourite is the impressionism. The miniature rooms are a close second. I recommend wearing comfortable footwear, and to not bring a backpack (you're required to rent a locker to store it for the duration of your visit). The Art Institute is my favourite place in all of Chicago.
