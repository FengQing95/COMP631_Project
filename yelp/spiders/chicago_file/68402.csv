Little Goat Diner////The interior is very classy, while playing on the diner theme. It is a little obvious that the whole shebang is funded by the BRG Group. The waitstaff is friendly, as friendly as you can be when you have hundreds of people shuffling in on a weekend afternoon to flash their wide eyes and exclamations of "Oh my god this is so good, I need to take a picture."
