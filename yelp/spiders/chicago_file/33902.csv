Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The full experience of Bavette's is fantastic. Just walking in the door takes you back into another era. The menu is simple, yet very well executed. The salmon tartar with crème fraîche is a perfect start for a great meal. The cocktails are very well made and the bar tenders friendly. The wine list is small, but has some phenomenal options. I highly recommend making an evening out of your time at Bavette's.
