Little Goat Diner////It was a good place. The wait was reasonable. The only drawback is the area of wait/bar in the background which has excessive oil/food smell that we couldn't tolerate. The food was delicious, love the lamb ribs! The waitress was slow and came to take the order after 15min! Not a great fan of their service but would go back for the food tho
