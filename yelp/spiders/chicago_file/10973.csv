Art Institute of Chicago////I've been here twice now and words cannot express how much I love the place! This place has a wide variety of classic artwork that I've learned about in elementary/middle school, as well as more contemporary pieces I loved learning about. There is such a wide variety of collections, all organized to best fit the space they're given. This wide variety makes it possible to spend an entire day here without getting bored. And it's so much more than just artwork--the different collections cover all sorts of cultural issues from throughout the world! Both times I went I saw different exhibits. I hope I get another opportunity to go back to the Art Institute in the future!
