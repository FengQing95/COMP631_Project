Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Was here last night with two others. Had small deep dish pizza with plain crust, pepperoni, giardiniera, and spinach, as well as boneless wings with barbecue sauce. Wings were particularly outstanding although deep dish was really good too. Would probably get pizza with sausage next time or with no meat as the pepperoni and veggies felt a bit weird together, but taste was really good.
