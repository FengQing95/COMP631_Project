Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I feel there are other comparable pizza options in the city of equal quality for a lower price. I looked into the pay structure for employees in hopes of seeing that money go to higher wages, but it seems the employee industry matches up with industry standards.
