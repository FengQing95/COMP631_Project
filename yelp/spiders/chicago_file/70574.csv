Little Goat Diner////Food was excellent my Veggie quesadillas was delish and the portions are very good, I was full the whole day. The service was OK, but not great. I'm excited to come back and perhaps try the roof. The roof is first come first serve. I would recommend getting up to the roof early if you want a seat. We also had a Moscow goat and it was refreshing! Fabulous outside dinning options and cute indoor booths are also available. :-D
