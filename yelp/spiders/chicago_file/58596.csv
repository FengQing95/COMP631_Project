Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba for years and love my in person experience - such a fun space and amazing food for tapas. My go-to's are the: seafood paella, garlic shrimp (so tangy and savory), bacon wrapped dates (MUST ORDER), smoked ham, smoked salmon, beef empanadas, goat cheese baked in tomato sauce with garlic bread (MUST GET!!), patatas bravas (crispy potatoes that taste exactly like the ones you get in Spain and the spicy aioli is to die for!!) and any of the sangrias!
