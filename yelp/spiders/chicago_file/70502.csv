Little Goat Diner////Little Goat is a diner-lovers dream come true!  Work friends brought me here for lunch yesterday and wow... just wow!  The atmosphere is bright and warm. The server was so friendly and welcoming. The menu was full of so many tempting delights. And since we were celebrating the completion of a project, we started with a craft cocktail. I had the Lapsang Peach Blossom - a sweet and boozy bourbon delight! We shared the warm crab dip with Ritz crackers - heaven!  And each of us tried a different lunch entrée.  I had the kale-chickpea salad - a very hearty and satisfying explosion of flavor, texture and color. It was amazing.  And then.... oh then..... we shared the Banana crème pie and it was quite simply the best thing ever. The crust was thick sugared graham cracker. The filling was decadent bananas in banana cream, topped with inches of fluffy whipped cream.  Have I already used the word heaven? Well, heaven it is. The menu promises so many more delights. I eagerly await the chance to escape here again soon!
