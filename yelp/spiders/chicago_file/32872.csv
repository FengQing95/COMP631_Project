Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I really wanted to love it, but at this price it should be perfect. The good, crab cake, lyonnaise salad, sides, half our steak. The bad, one strip was sent back. It was significantly overcooked, but even at the correct temp it would have been the toughest piece of meat we've ever tried. We ordered two of them so we knew how it was supposed to taste. Â Their next attempt was perfect and, to their credit, quickly delivered. The service also needs work, our waitress was very nice, but wore so much perfume it took a few minutes for the air to clear each time she came by, not a nice way to enjoy your food. The bus staff was overwhelming, water every two minutes, plates cleared too fast and all done very loudly & recklessly. It was clear they'd never experienced a meal of that caliber from the other side of the table, management should consider treating them to a meal so they can understand how service can affect the whole atmosphere. I may go back, but for a better experience try Boeufhaus on Western.
