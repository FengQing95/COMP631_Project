Smoque BBQ////Stopped for a quick lunch and had the sliced brisket sandwich -- very soft and flavorful. I'm no BBQ expert but I prefer mustard-based sauce, which is Smoque's feature. It was busy but the owner came by and asked if everything was ok, which I always appreciate. Only thing I thought was missing was a sausage sandwich (as opposed to platter). Hope to be back soon.
