Little Goat Diner////I ordered "this little piggy went to China," it was literally one of the best things I've ever eaten. I love to eat, and often explore interesting foods, but nothing has ever had the flavor profile that this meal had. The texture of the cheddar biscuit is perfect. It's crispy on the exterior, and soft and flavorful on the inside. The sausage is great too. It's tasty and a little sweet. The eggs were perfectly cooked, and the vinegar sauce that's swimming around the bowl is so dope. Oh! And the blackberries are a nice touch...not only are they a pretty garnish, but they're delicious and add a little bit of a tangy twist to the dish.
