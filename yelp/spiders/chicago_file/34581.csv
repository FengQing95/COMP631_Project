Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////And when I say good, I mean friggin' great.  Took the gf here for our anniversary, and it did not disappoint.  First, the ambiance is great.  Not the standard, generic brass rails and tons of oak.  Great lighting, exposed brick, not too crowded, not too loud.  The service was exceptional.  Our server was very attentive, offered some good suggestions, the manager came by at one point to ask how everything was and at another point to fold my gf's napkin while she was away from the table.
