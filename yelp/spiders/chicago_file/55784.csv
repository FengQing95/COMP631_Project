Smoque BBQ////Al recommended the half-and-half sandwich which is half pulled pork and half brisket.... that way you get to try both!  It was TOTALLY awesome, but I think I liked the brisket best.  Get both the BBQ sauces so you can see if you like North Carolina style (vinegar) or Memphis (tangy) better.  The fries, cornbread and slaw were perfect accompaniments.  I tried my dates mac 'n cheese and thought it was only so-so but I'm not a huge mac 'n cheese fan anyway.
