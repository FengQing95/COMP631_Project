Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place and have been here several times.  It is in a fabulous location, always crowded and fun, and good authentic Spanish food and Sangria.  I went most recently with a Spanish friend of mine who also loved the food.  We had the classic old faithful jamòn serrano with queso manchego, pan con tomate and olives.  We also ordered the pinxos platter which was not your traditional pinxos in terms of bread with a tapa on tap (more or less) but were still very tasty.  The sangria was also delicious and not too sugary.  When it's nice outside, you can sit in this outdoor covered patio area.  Definitely check this place out!
