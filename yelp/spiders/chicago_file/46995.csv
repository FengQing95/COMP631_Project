Smoque BBQ////We ordered carry-out and I thought it was definitely worth the trip to Pulaski. Chicago has some great bbq spots and this is definitely one of the good ones. Actually, the fries were delicious too and the mac and cheese. We all had the pulled pork and although the bbq sauce they gave us was good with it--the pork itself is good on its own too! I would recommend trying it for sure.
