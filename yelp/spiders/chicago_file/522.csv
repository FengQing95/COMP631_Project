Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Had Breakfast here on Saturday, March 30th.  We arrived around 7:45 AM and were seated at a square table for 4 (there were only 2 of us) almost immediately.  No wait - actually they were only about 2/3rd full when we walked in.  Hooray!  (we did notice that by around 8 or 8:15, the place had filled in and become packed to the point that there were lots of people waiting outside for tables.
