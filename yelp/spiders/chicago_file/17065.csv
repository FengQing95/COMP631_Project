Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came to Lou Malnati's on my first night in Chicago after hearing multiple raving reviews about it. Disappointed is an understatement. After 45 minutes or so after ordering the manager stopped to tell us our pizza was "burned" and it would be 30 more minutes for our new pizza. She offered us an appetizer, we told her we already had one, so she offered us another one? 40 more minutes passed and we received our very small pizza, which apparently feeds 2 people. The size, taste, and service was below average, and far worse than what I was expecting and had heard from other people. The manager did not stop back by after we got our pizza, just took it off the bill. After spending more than 2 hours in the restaurant, we left hungry and disappointed. All the manager did for us after waiting an almost an hour and a half for our very small, and honestly not even hot, pizza, was take the pizza off the bill. Not the appetizer after offering it to us? Makes no sense to me.
