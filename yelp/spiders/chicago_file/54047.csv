Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If the review was based on paella, it would have gotten 1 star... The paella was subpar (we got their recommended pork paella), and they took away the paella pan...who does that! Â That's the best part about paella! The way the rice crisps on the bottom of the pan & keeps the paella warm as it sits on your table... Instead the server brought the paella in the pan, but divided it up in portions & served it in regular tapas plates...fail!
