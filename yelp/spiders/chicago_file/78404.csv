Little Goat Diner////Great customer care, biggest plus was how quick the food came out! Piggy in China was bomb! Didn't make me tired full just satisfying .. my husband had hash brown he said it could have been less oily but even the oily was clean and pancakes were made perfect just a tap bit too sweet. Above all it was a great experience the place itself is inviting and comfortable and clean
