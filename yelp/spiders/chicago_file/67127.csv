Little Goat Diner////Just had lunch there, lets start with the food I ordered the kimchi, egg, bacon, pancake 'tasty thingy' which sounded interesting and the server sold me on it and not to mention I'm a big fan of Korean food. One word SODIUM....wow I must of had three glasses of water to rinse this puppy down. Did i mention it was cold. My coworker ordered the Hashbrown and eggs, nothing to jump about, to sum his review I quote him "I had better for less" not to mention we were still hungry.
