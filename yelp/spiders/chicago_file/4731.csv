The Purple Pig////Really one of those special restaurants that don't come around too often. Super original menu with options that you won't see in your everyday restaurant. Every single thing I had was amazing, highly recommend the crispy pig ears and the bone marrow is one of the best things I've ever tasted. Have been planning a trip to Chicago ever since just to eat here again.
