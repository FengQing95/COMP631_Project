Little Goat Diner////I came back Little goat diner after a visit several years ago which was as truly perfection. This visit, while good want as great as I remembered. I returned to my favorite "This little piggy went to China "'which includes a sesame cheddar biscuit, pork sausage, eggs, and a chili garlic chive sauce. When I started with my first bite I thought .. this is cold! But when I felt the eggs and sausage I realized they were all warm but the chili garlic sauce was very cold which made the entire dish cool. The flavors are amazing so I'll give them a pass but keep the sauce out of the frig so they don't cool off the entree!
