Little Goat Diner////Stopped by Little Goat for a late lunch/early dinner around like 3:45pm on a Saturday and the place was still busy! We got seated at the counter which was pretty nice. Vibes in here are like half diner with the counter seating and then half Santa Monica Summer House with the the booths and tables.
