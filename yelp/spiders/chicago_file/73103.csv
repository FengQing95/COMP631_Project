Little Goat Diner////The mac n cheese was exceptional, except that for the price I would have liked a slightly bigger serving. I would also suggest that the burgers come with the side of fries. Even if it's a small side, a nod to the "fries are complementary when ordering a burger" establishment would be much appreciated by gluttons like myself. Plus, this place is a diner--it is quintessentially Americana and synonymous with oversized servings and fries with a side of coronary, no?
