Little Goat Diner////I've been here a few times; sat in the dining area and also eaten at the bar.  It's a cute diner with a lot of unique options on the menu.  I think you have to be a little daring and order something any way.  The food, ambiance, cleanliness, and service have been pretty good each time.
