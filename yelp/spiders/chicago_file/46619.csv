Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I loved the atmosphere of this place! The pitcher of refreshing sangria was delicious.  All the tapas were sooo good and affordable. My favorite tapas were the steak with blue cheese and potatoes with some yummy spicy hummus tasting dip.  I recommend having reservations for this place if you go on a weekend. It gets pretty busy! Also you get two free dessert tapas for FREE when you check in on yelp or Facebook. So cool.
