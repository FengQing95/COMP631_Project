Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was so stoked to try Chicago pizza! I got the lunch special ($9.95), which includes a personal pizza as well as your choice of soup or salad. I went for the soup, which was cream of broccoli. Flipping delicious. Creamy as it should be, and broccoli was tender. I got a simple cheese pizza and it was pretty good. The cheese would string when you pull up a piece of pizza, always a good sign lol. I just wish the crust was less crispy, more soft. Maybe it would have been if I ordered the butter crust for $0.75 more.
