Little Goat Diner////The restaurant side was bright and mainly lit from an enormous skylight. The atmosphere was perfect for brunch and the retro decor was cool and not overdone. Our server was great, not overly chipper, and was quick to grab our last minute coffee order at the end. She reminded me of Zooey Deschanel.
