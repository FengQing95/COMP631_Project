Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I love pizza and I believe it is extremely important to have the right crust. If you like a crust that is infused with olive oil and is greasy and hard this place is for you. I am not a fan. We ordered a deep dish cheese pizza and calamari and a few other sides. The price is fine, but I am not a fan of the quality of Â pizza. I will not be back. The place is very clean and the waitress was extremely attentive.
