Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been coming to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba for years and I always seem to leave hungry. I understand that they are a tapas restaurant but their portion sizes are TINY. Their portions sizes are not even small, they are miniscule. I have been to Spain and trust me Tapas come with a lot more food.
