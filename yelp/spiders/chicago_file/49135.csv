Smoque BBQ////This place has a real bbq pit feel, lots of communal tables, small, and smells delicious. I had the rib combo with slaw, peach cobbler, chili, and corn bread. Of the ribs, the baby back were better without the bbq sauce, while the st. louis were better with the bbq sauce. The St. Louis rib I thought was the better of the two, and they are inherently meatier which makes them more satisfying. The peach cobbler was really delicious, the slaw was good - though I would prefer less crunchy, the corn bread was good but not addictive (I prefer either sweet or with jalapeno), and the chili was ok but I couldn't really detect the brisket and I'm not a fan of a strong tomato flavor. It really all comes down to the meat though, and that's the best rib meat I've found in Chicago.
