Little Goat Diner////According to our server, this was one of the more popular items, so I had to get it. It's french toast with bbq maple syrup, sweet onion brioche, and crispy chicken. You get like 3 pieces of french toast, but they're small, like french bread slices, not Texas toast. There's syrup, and the fact that it's bbq doesn't really make too much of a difference, and you get like 5 pieces of crispy chicken. And no, it's not like 5 individual pieces of popcorn chicken, no no no. It's like a big McDonald's chicken nugget cut into 5 pieces. This was pathetic! Had they used actual McD's nuggets, I would've been happier, but the chicken was dry, and probably from Tyson's at Costco or something. The french toast was just french toast, nothing spectacular about it at all!
