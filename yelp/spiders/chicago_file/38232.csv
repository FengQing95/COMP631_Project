Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Beautiful ambiance, a divine collection of flavors, and free wine?!!!! My partner and I enjoyed sweet/tart gimlets, the salmon caesar (my favorite dish all night), the dry aged steak with bone marrow, a baked potato, and yes, of course, the chocolate cream cake. The free wine of the day was prosecco, which was so fun.
