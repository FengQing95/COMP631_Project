Little Goat Diner////The muffin had a crusty, crunchy top with a nice texture, and there was a good balance of banana throughout with a slight hint of espresso. The Little Goat was tasty! I've always liked goat milk, and I never thought to have it in latte form. The caramel went well with goat milk's unique taste.
