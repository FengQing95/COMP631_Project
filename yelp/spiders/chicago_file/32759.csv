Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I, initially, had high expectations from all of the rave yelp reviews. I had booked a reservation for Sun, but Â called to cancel it yesterday at 7:50pm. The hostess asked me when I wanted to reschedule and I jokingly said, you don't have anything tonight do you? She said we have an 8pm opening, can you be here soon? I said, I can be there by 8:20pm, would that work and she said yes, she would hold it.
