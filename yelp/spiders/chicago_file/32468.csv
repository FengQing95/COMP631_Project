Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We came here after we checked into our hotel and was told that it was about an hour wait to be seated. It was Saturday around 2pm. So we decided to order a deep dish pizza to-go. It took less than an hour but pizza never tastes as good as it does when it comes fresh out the oven. By the time I got to eat it, it wasn't hot anymore. The cheese wasn't as melty. But my friends who ate it hot all said it tasted good. The crust was a bit too thick for me. I only ate the the toppings part.
