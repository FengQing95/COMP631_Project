Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Let's get one thing clear: it's unacceptable to wait 11 minutes for a waiter to approach your table. Moreover, the approach was only after flagging the floor manager who I believe was named "Johnny." When I playfully expressed we had been waiting a while by saying, "We need some cocktails!" with a smile and a clap, his response was a VERY annoyed , "Okaaaaay.....what can I get you?"
