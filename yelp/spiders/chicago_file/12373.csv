Art Institute of Chicago////We are so lucky to have an absolutely world-class museum in Chicago. With an already fantasic permanent collection (my favorite is the impressionist pieces), the museum complements this by consistently bringing in beautiful and thought-provoking exhibits regularly. You can visit the AIC repeatedly and never have an identical experience. The first time I went, I spent 6 hours there. While I don't have such lengthy visits anymore, I usually do find myself close to tears. The only thing better than the art is to see people of all walks of life thoroughly enjoying the pieces that some of the greatest minds of all time have generously given us to treasure. Life moves slower and is simpler at the AIC. It's nice to step away from the hubbub of the big city and escape into a world of art now and then. Nothing else matters when you're inside the AIC. It's a portal to another world where the only thing that matters is treasuring the the present and enjoying each moment when you're face-to-face with a Monet, a Manet, a Degas, or perhaps Caillebotte's masterpiece Paris Street, Rainy Day. Just writing this has made me want to go back to my happy place as soon as I can.
