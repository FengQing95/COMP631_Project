Smoque BBQ////I went there at about 6pm on a Saturday.  There was a line, but it moved quickly with people being efficiently seated.  Yes, they could use more room, but they manage the space they have very well.  After ordering, the food was quickly prepared and the order was accurate.  The staff was helpful and very friendly.
