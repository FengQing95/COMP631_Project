Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were seated for dinner at a two top tucked away in the corner.  The dark lighting creates a romantic ambiance, which was well suited for our date night out.  If you prefer large portions and traditional dinner service sans the small plate business, then you will absolutely love Bavette's.  We began with a dozen oysters, six Raspberry Points and six Kumomotos.  They were perfectly shucked and fresh.  Our server Brandon, was extremely knowledgeable and personable.  If we went back (which we fully intend to) we will likely ask to sit with him again.  He explained to us well ahead of time that everything was meant to be shared--as the portions are gigantic.  Well advised, we split the wedge salad (see photo attached now).  This monster could have really served four people in my opinion.  It was wonderful--the dill and succulent "bacon" (I think it was pork belly) were to die for!  Next up was dinner; I had the prime rib sandwich, which came with a small side of their malt vinegar chips.  This was served on a delicious baguette, with melted Gouda and peppers served with au jus and horseradish sauce.  I couldn't even finish half and the rest was packed up for home.  My husband had the 24-ounce bone-in Ribeye.  This was prepared perfectly to his order and we  agreed, was one of the best steaks we'd had ever had.  They have a lot of sides, so if you're coming in a large group, I'd recommend ordering a few of these.  We had the roasted broccoli... it was pretty good.  My only complaint of the evening would be the amount of salt that was on the broccoli... toooo salty for my taste.  With dinner we had a nice Borolo which complimented le boeuf nicely.
