Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I think 2 stars is a little generous for what my friends and I experienced while dining at this establishment. We walked in and checked in, waited about 20 minutes for a table. Fine, not a problem. We received the notification that a table was ready for us and are taken upstairs to a small table in the corner. 5 minutes pass, then 10, then 20. Saw at least 3 servers, made eye contact even, none of which made any attempt to greet us. Finally had to grab a manager who came and took our order. Even after it had been brought to her attention that we had not been greeted, we STILL received no service from a server. After appetizer arrived, a gentleman begrudgingly checked on us, and I'm talking bare minimum "do you need anything else", but made sure to turn the charm on moments before it was time to ask for the check, which we ironically never received. We left cash and called it a night because enough of our time had been wasted. This was my first night in Chicago and while the quality of the food was great, I would not return due to the complete lack of attention and respect from the service staff. All of this coming from someone that has been in the industry for years, there are certain signs that a server should have, a gut reaction something is wrong. Simply put, they did not care.
