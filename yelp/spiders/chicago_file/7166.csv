Art Institute of Chicago////I recently saw the Girodet exhibit, which was enormous, something like 60 paintings and 40 drawings and sketches.  It speaks volumes about the Art Institute's influence in compiling such a comprehensive exhibit.  The collection was also expertly curated, so that patrons left with a thorough understanding of the artist, the arc of his career, and his place within the movement he participated in.
