Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My dinner started off good... I was able to preorder my pizza and got seated fairly quickly. It went down hill from there. The service was some of the worst I've ever had.  I don't know if it was because I was alone or because I was a tourist.  I waited 10 minutes for someone  to ask me if I wanted a drink. I flagged someone down and asked who my waiter was and he said it was some other guy. I could not even order a freaking water. So finally my waiter came and I ordered a beer and a water. Another 10+ minutes. So i sat 20 to 25 minutes without even a glass of water.  The pizza was decent.  The crust was a little overcooked but it had a good flavor.  I just couldn't get over the poor service.
