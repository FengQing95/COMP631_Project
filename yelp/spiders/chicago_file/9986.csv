Art Institute of Chicago////In the downstairs library, I was blessed to see vintage photos of Chicago back in time... from Cook County before its transformation to Stroger Hospital, to industrial buildings, to ornate homes of magnates that were either lost to fire or are no longer...the displays were many.. and I was moved to catch a glimpse of this City as it was a century + ago.
