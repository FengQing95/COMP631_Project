Little Goat Diner////Little Goat is new and already doing many things well.  The breads tasted so fresh with great texture.  My los drowned sandwich was full of the flavor of slowly stewed beef and balanced by the tangy spicy pickles and peppers.  The milkshake with salty sweet chocolate taco shards in savory sour cream gelato was genius.  The challenge going forward will be tweaking the devil in the details.  The future looks bright for Little Goat.
