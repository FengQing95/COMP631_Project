Art Institute of Chicago////Superb Art Museum. Sad to show my ignorance but i didn't really know of this place before we went . I could have spent a couple of days here, especially the newish contemporary Art wing. The Collection is magnificent & almost all types of art are represented. The Museum itself is stunning architecturally. The Staff are mostly knowledgeable, usually i find the staff scattered around the museum are useful only for directions to the rest room & not for the art itself. Good bet is to take the audio equipment with you
