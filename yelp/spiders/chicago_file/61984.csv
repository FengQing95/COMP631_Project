Smoque BBQ////It's the best place to eat in Chicago! Most of the time it's really busy. I love their pulled pork & sliced brisket. My favorite is by far the Mac and cheese! I didn't rate it 5 stars because their cashier isn't the friendliest. When my boyfriend and I were ordering she wasn't speaking or making eye contact. She didn't even ask what type of side we wanted. But overall amazing food!
