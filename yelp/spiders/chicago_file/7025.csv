Art Institute of Chicago////i am intrigued by the geometric accidents of how the figures block the view of the house in the background. the highlighting of the couple draws attention away from the house, but forces certain lines to become mysterious there because of the obscuring through line of sight imposition. the expressions on the couple's faces match the ruggedness of the house's unornamental facade, yet both the costumes of the figures and the details of the facade have an almost presupposed intention not to leave out just a modicum of accent, as if all the comforts that this way of life allows are just tradition and no more, put in place because comfort is more akin to an outhouse in its necessity than to any real relief from the rigors of life here.
