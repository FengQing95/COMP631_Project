Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We used to live in Chicago and bring some friends from California to visit family over the weekend. We were so excited to show them what Chicago deep dish taste like. We got there at 12 pm, waited for table for 2 hours, got our food at 3 pm after several complained. Food came out cold and hard. Wow! The worst customer service and horrible food. We refused to pay for the food and we left hungry. Such a wasted of time!
