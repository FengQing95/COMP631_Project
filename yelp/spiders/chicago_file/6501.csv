The Purple Pig////What an extravagant dining experience! Our friends made our reservation for a party of five. We visited on a Friday evening at the end of May. This place was busy, but we were very well taken care of. Our friend who made our reservations, also took charge of our dining plans. After drinks were decided, he suggested that we order multiple appetizers and entr√©es to share among all of us. When the food eventually arrived, it just kept coming and coming! LOL.
