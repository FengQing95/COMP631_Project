Smoque BBQ////THE best BBQ in Chicago. No room to dispute this. I've eaten here numerous times and never have been disappointed. The brisket sandwich is absurd. When there's a line out the door on weekday nights you know the food is killer. Besides dining in which is always good, I bought their sauce for ribs I was going to grill. The price was right on par and my family flipped out when the had a taste. There is some great BBQ in Chicago, too bad they all have to stand in Smoque's shadow.
