Little Goat Diner////I've developed an affinity for kimchee over the last few years -- basically the 'breakfast tasty thing' (which is the only way you can describe it when it arrives at the table) had everything I wanted for breakfast. Â Combined with hash browns and a delectable mango habanero sauce, it was comfort food to the Nth degree.
