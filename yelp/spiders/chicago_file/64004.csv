Smoque BBQ////I'm a SE Louisiana hunting bbq chick and anytime I'm visiting a city I've never been to, I always check my Diner's, Drive-In's & Dive's app to see where Guy Fieri has been to and I got super excited when I saw that he'd been to a bbq place. My bf and I decided that we'd check out Smoque BBQ before I headed back home to New Orleans from my New Year's visit.
