Smoque BBQ////If you love smoked meats and barbeque, go here! Don't waste your time anywhere else. Food is GREAT! You may need to stand in line to place your order, but if you need something additional, a server places that order for you and takes your money for you. That is a big plus. We have been going to Smoque since it opened. It only gets better!
