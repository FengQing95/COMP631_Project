Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's ok, as good as pizzeria uno in my opinion. Bar is Â small and not good if you're looking for that, service is not what I would expect. Asked for a recommendation from bar tender several minutes later another patron asked the same bartender for a recommendation and got a totally different response. Food isn't bad like just not what I'd expect with so many yelp reviews. Writing this review cause I'm sitting at bar with an empty glass for the second time and not being offered another drink or given a check.
