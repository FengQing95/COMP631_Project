Little Goat Diner////My friend and I made a reservation at Little Goat for breakfast this morning and were so impressed, both by the service and the quality of food. The waitstaff was super friendly and several precautions were taken (masks, temperatures taken at door, sanitizer) to make the dining experience safe and comfortable. I greatly enjoyed my meal and the dollop of goat milk honey yogurt on top upgraded a would-be basic dish.
