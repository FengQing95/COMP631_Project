Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.  The tapas are delicious and there's  a lot of variety, my favorites are the spicy potatoes, chicken empanada, tomato goat cheese spread and the garlic shrimp.  The food is super affordable and you get to try a bunch of different delicious small plates and is great for sharing.  The sangria tastes good but is weak and hard to get a good buzz from but that's my only gripe.
