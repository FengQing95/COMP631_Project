Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza is really filling and you have to use a fork and knife to eat. Two slices will get anyone full. The pizza that I ordered was for 2 people, it came with 4 slices and I was not able to finish my portion of the pizza. The pizza had a perfect ratio of cheese, topping, as well as tomato sauce. Definitely recommend if you are to visit Chicago!
