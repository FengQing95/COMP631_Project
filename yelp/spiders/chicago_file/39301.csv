Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We shared the wedge salad which is seriously enough for 2 people, and it was the best wedge salad I have ever tasted! It was just the right amount of cheese and dressing. Our steaks were cooked to perfection. They were well seasoned and since I order my steaks medium/rare, they are still often overcooked, but that wasn't the case for this steak.
