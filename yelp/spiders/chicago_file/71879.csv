Little Goat Diner////I am a die hard Top Chef fan. When I decided to visit Chicago I wanted to eat at The Girl and the Goat. I checked about 2 months before coming and reservations were 3 months out. So I decided to try her diner across the street, The Little Goat. I was able to eat at TGATG but that is another review.
