Little Goat Diner////however, the main dish to write home about is the salad. i know it sounds crazy to write about a salad, but this is no ordinary salad. i truly think it is the best salad in chicago! i used to add chicken on it, but with the chickpeas and falafel bites, there's really no need for extra protein- it's HUGE. and so, so delicious. PLEASE go get it. you wont regret it!!
