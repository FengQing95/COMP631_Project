Smoque BBQ////This is my favorite BBQ place . Ive never traveled south to BBQ states. This place is amazing. There will be a line out the door in the summer all the way down the sidewalk. I enjoy the baby back ribs. I enjoy the spare ribs. I love ribs, and these are awesome. The sauce is not my favorite but it is very good. I prefer very sweet BBQ on spicy seasoned meat. The brisket is to die for. The briskett melts in your mouth. I have never tasted flavor like that in briskett from anywhere everrr. It is so tender and never dry. I want it and need it like every week. Too bad I dont live in Chicago. Please do yourself a favor and try SMOQUE
