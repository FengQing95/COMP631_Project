Smoque BBQ////Great meats, which you would expect. I tried the pulled pork and the brisket. Good serving size too. I got takeout and the fries were limp by the time it was ready and I got home, but they were delicious enough that I ate two orders worth after hearing them in the oven (yes I felt sick and regretted it!). Â FYI, my mom LOVES the brisket at the revival location.
