Art Institute of Chicago////So a few years back, Hubs and I were walking through the Regenstein building and we heard screaming. Kept walking, kept hearing screaming and yelling..like someone was getting a beat down. We finally arrived at a gallery labeled "Clown Torture" (where all the screaming was coming from) and were like "Holy Shit! Someone's torturing a clown! Sweet!" Because, let's be honest - who among us doesn't want to see a clown get an ass kicking? So we enter the gallery to see...a projection of a dude in a clown costume sitting on the toilet reading a newspaper. Best EVER.
