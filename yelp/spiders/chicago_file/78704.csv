Little Goat Diner////I had the This Little Piggy Went to China as well as the Bull's Eye French Toast. The first dish was very tasty. The smoked blueberries were cool, but I wasn't sure how they complemented the overall dish. It didn't seem to jive that well with chili oil, biscuit, and sausage. The french toast was sweet and smoky from the barbecue flavor in the maple syrup. The chicken and strawberry with barebecue I found to be an unusual combination. It definitely challenged my palate.
