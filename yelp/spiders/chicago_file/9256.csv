Art Institute of Chicago////For the first timers, or tourists, I would recommend going to check out Â the American Gothic, Monet's Water Lilies, the Van Gogh (Self Portrait and Bedroom) and Nighthawk. Those are the "big" pieces that the museum keeps on permanent display there (except for the occasional loan and cleaning). I was impressed by how many pieces the museum actually had!
