Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service: I mentioned it was our first anniversary when making the reservation and EVERY employee we ran into said congratulations to us (hostess, 2nd hostess who took us to our table, waiter, bus boy (yes, really), and yet another hostess on our way out). Our waiter, Sean, was fantastic. He provided excellent recommendations on the menu (we were waffling between the truffle mac and cheese and the elote corn at first, and also had questions about the drinks). Our favorite part was that we did not hear him once say "ready to order?" He allowed us to move at our own pace, but was always there to answer questions.
