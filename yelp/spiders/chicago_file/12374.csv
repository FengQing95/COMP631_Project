Art Institute of Chicago////Absolute world-class collection of artwork. So lucky to have such a phenomenal gallery of art right here in Chicago. I've been a member for 7 years now, and I'm so happy. Great discounts in the gift shop and free admission for myself and a guest. Highly recommend becoming a member. Free admission to the special exhibits too. Check out the AIC ASAP. I recommend giving yourself about 4-6 hours if you're an art aficionado like me.
