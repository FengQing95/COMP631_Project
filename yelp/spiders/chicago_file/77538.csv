Little Goat Diner////If you have a shellfish allergy don't come here. Everything fried here is fried with shellfish. On this particular night they were also 100% out of anything goat. For a place with goat in the name, that's pathetic. I came with friends and literally couldn't eat anything that sounded good. Very disappointed, especially after waiting for 2 hours. Would give it a 0 if I could. Service was also crappy since the waitress knew nothing about food allergies or what the kitchen was out of until 30 mins after ordering. Total waste of time. Was so excited but will never try again.
