Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service was wonderful here; she was very helpful and was attentive.  The mango sangria is soo delicious too and complimented the dinner very well!  We also ordered some scallops, shrimp and green beans paella, and it was everything I've been craving for.  The rice was cooked great, and the portion was perfect for two people.  The different tapas was yummy!!  My favorite were the spicy potatoes with tomato aioli!  I would definitely go back just for that!  The shrimp with garlic , olive oil, and pepper flakes was also pretty amazing.
