Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////But if you insist on going at meal time, rest assured that your wait time is worth it. Go around the corner to Starbucks and satiate your wait hunger with some plain coffee or iced tea, then suck it up and wait for Lou's. This is a better use of your time and resources than going down the street to Gino's East (because believe me, we've tried that) or, worse yet, finding a Giordano's. Lou Malnati's is the only way to go!
