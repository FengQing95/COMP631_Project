Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Had to experience the deep dish pizza while driving through Chicago. Completely different than my normal thin crust choices. They have a size pizza for everyone, but I got the personal size cheese. Be prepared to wait 30-45 minutes for your pizza, so this makes a great time to order apps and salads. My table ordered the cheesy bread and the garden salads. The salads were a large portion, and just enough to keep you full until the pizza arrived. Pizzas were cooked great. It was a completely different experience of pizza, but I enjoyed it! Service was awesome, and we left happy.
