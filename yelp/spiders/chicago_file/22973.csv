Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's worth nothing that although the Yankee Baseball legend passed some 40 odd years ago, this restaurant (& the other 3 locations) remain family owned and operated Â & it shows. This pizza really is an excellent version of Chicago style deep dish pizza. We ordered the Classic-sausage & cheese pizza with a 312 Pale Ale & also the Wheat beer. My preference was the ale, my friend preferred the wheat, BUT we both loved the pizza!
