Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ba Ba Reeba seems to be a little more consistent with their tapas than other joints in town.  The marinara goat cheese was so good we had to order a second order.  Also delicious were the grilled squid, scallops, and bacon wrapped dates.  The patatas bravas were a little over done.
