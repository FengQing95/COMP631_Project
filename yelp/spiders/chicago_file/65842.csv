Smoque BBQ////The Mac and cheese was my favorite part of the whole meal. It comes with delicious breading on top and a thick, hearty cheese sauce. I liked that the portion wasn't gigantic but filling at the same time. The cornbread was served warm and also tasted great -- it was so warm it crumbled right off the fork. The Cole Slaw was more vinegar-based than Mayo-based. I wish it was a bit creamier, but it complemented the brisket and sides well without being too heavy.
