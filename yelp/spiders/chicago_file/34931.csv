Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Had a birthday/anniversary dinner here this past weekend and it did not disappoint! Amazing atmosphere - very romantic, almost speak easy feel to the place. Quality food all around - we had a filet and a ribeye, both were cooked brilliantly. We had the crab cake which was huge and probably the best crab cake I've ever had. Corn and Mac and cheese did not disappoint either. Lastly, exceptional service from the hostess desk to waiter to the clearing staff!
