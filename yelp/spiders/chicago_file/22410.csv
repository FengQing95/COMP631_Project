Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What I like about this place is that you can get the pizza crust on the bottom crispy and add a butter glaze to the crust (which you absolutely must otherwise it will be a Â disgusting soggy mess!). We put an order in for an all cheese deep dish with a the crispy crust/butter glaze and half of it with pepperoni and then waited about 10 min to be seated. We can around 5:30 so it wasn't packed yet but by the time we left there was a huge line.
