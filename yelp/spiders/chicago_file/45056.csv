Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The menu is so unexciting that I can't think of anything that's so good that I'd order two of in one sitting, which just kinda means you're eating for the sake of eating.  I like the potato bravas, even though they're pretty standard and I can replicate them at home...   I've had REALLY bad squid there, rubbery and tasteless.  The queso dip is decent but not the best I've had.  Meatballs are good.
