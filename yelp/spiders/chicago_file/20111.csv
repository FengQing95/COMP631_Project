Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Got seated quickly on a saturday night however took 5 mins to be greeted by server. She seemed annoyed n not overly friendly. Plates at table had pizza sauce from the last person on it. Kinda gross.  Bruscetta appetizer wad really good n so was fettucine Alfredo.  Yum! Pizza was pretty good but not the best (thin crust). I liked the casual environment but way overcrowded and extremely loud
