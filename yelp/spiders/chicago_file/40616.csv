Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The ambiance here is amazing. Its rustic, vintage, classic, and romantic. Its awesome. We made reservations for the downstairs parlor area which we loved. We had plush couches for seats, they played great music, and it was very intimate. It felt like we had the entire area to ourselves.
