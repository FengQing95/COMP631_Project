Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The service and the food were both excellent. Our server, Eric, was very professional, knowledgeable about the food/restaurant, and just the right amount of attentive. The avocado and crab salad was great. Our 10 oz filet was cooked perfectly. The Mac and cheese plus the corn sides (recommended by the server) lives up to the hype.
