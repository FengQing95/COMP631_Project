Art Institute of Chicago////I've been to this museum tons of times (I had a class here in college) and still find it necessary to go at least once or twice a year. I think you can get a good overview in about 3 hours (if you're rushed). The only drawback is the price. I used to go to the museum when it was pay what you can (obviously that was a long time ago). Now, prices are pretty high, but you can get a discount if you're a Chicago resident (show them your ID) or check out the free day on Thursday. Definitely a top attraction in Chicago.
