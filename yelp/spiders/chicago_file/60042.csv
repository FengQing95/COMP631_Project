Smoque BBQ////I'm Â sure it's all been said here, but I do wanna shout out to the young guy hanging out by the seats, making sure everyone was taken care of and tables were cleaned properly. I'm sure it's a bottom-of-the-totem-pole position. I wouldn't say he was happy. But he did a good job, and he added an extra note of attentive professionalism to an overall superb dining experience.
