Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Hubby and I were visiting from out of town and our family recommended this place.  When in Chicago, you have to try deep dish pizza and if you're not a fan, just for the experience.  We walked in during lunch time and were seated right away which was a plus since I've read there could be a long wait.  The pizza was pretty good, we ordered the Lou Malnati's and we were a fan.  It was a bit on the saucy side for me, but I didn't mind.  My favorite part of the pizza was the crust, I know, call me weird, but the crust was pretty delicious.  Definitely check out this place for the deep dish pizza experience.  Service was pretty quick and the servers were pretty friendly.
