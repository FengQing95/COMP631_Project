Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great place to come if you want to experience a bit of the downtown area and get some good pizza. Deep dish pizza that's worthy of reppin the chi-town flavor. This place is a bit tight wouldn't recommend people with kids, but you'll have a lot a people with parties, it's really good pizza.
