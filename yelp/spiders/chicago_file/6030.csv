The Purple Pig////3. Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder: Even though this was one of the most popular dishes according to Yelp, my friend was hesitant on this originally until our waiter said he recommended it as well. Ended up being possibly the best dish we had all night! The pork was extremely tender and the ginger glaze added extra zest. Definitely sold on this one.
