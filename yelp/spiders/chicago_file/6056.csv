The Purple Pig////Cured meat house platter: 1/5 oh gosh please don't anyone else waste their money on this dish. This was $50 but most of it made me wince as I ate it. Sure there was a variety of different types of meat, but 1) the server was not able to even name all the meats and only pointed out a few and said "and those are the only ones I know". What is the point of getting a platter if even the server does not know what they are feeding us? Most of the meats were very, very, very salty and a couple tasted downright terrible. I was very glad that we had other dishes to wash this down with.
