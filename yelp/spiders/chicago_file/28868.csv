Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We waited for about 40 min for a table. We did the preordering thing, thinking our pizza would come around the time we got seated. Nope. We waited a total of an hour and 15 minutes from the time we stepped foot into that restaurant to eat our pizza. Fine. I get it. It's packed.
