Smoque BBQ////Saturday night was busy and the line went out the door.  Even though you don't get a waiter, a host seats your party.  I had the full slab of baby back ribs, taste of brisket( 4oz., kind of like a sample), baked mac/cheese, and brisket chili.  Everything was good, but the 2 sauces weren't my favorite.  Also, I saw a table bring their own beer in. byob
