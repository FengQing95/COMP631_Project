Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Funnily enough, dessert was my favorite part even though I generally prefer savory over sweet. Being a yelper I picked up that they give a free dessert tapa for each guest. My wife and I ordered the ice cream sandwiches and the chocolate truffle. The truffle was an exceptionally rich block of truffle chocolate with a homemade creamy whipped cream dollop to the side. Very good, but not really my cup of tea. The ice cream sandwiches were home made pumpkin iced cream between two ginger snap cookies, with a bit of powdered sugar and cinnamon or nutmeg (not quite sure from the flavor explosion) sprinkled on top. I took a small bite of one and was blown away! We will be back if not solely for those ice cream sandwiches.
