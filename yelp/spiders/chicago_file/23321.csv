Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Totally overrated. Hey, the service is good, the salads are good, the coca cola is good, but the pizza is totally middle-of-the-road. Malnati's is not one of a kind. It's a large chain. To be asked to wait 45 minutes to an hour for a soupy cheese/sauce deep dish pizza. I won't recommend other places here because that's not the point. Forget about looking at all the top-ten lists when you Google Chicago pizza. Go to a neighborhood and ask the people who live there where they go. That's where you should go.
