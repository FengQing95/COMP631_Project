Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our pizza tour is coming to an end...we found our favourite hands down or up or where you want to put them. The crust is light and buttery, the cheese is stringy and the right amount. The tomato sauce is tangy good. We had the "Lou" with spinach, mushrooms and onions. So good we gobbled up every bite. We highly recommended this pizza landmark. Thanks for reading. Avram
