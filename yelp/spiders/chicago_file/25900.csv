Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Lou was delicious--nothing to write home about, but we weren't disappointed in it. We expected more from the buttercrust on both pizzas; it just didn't wow us. I'm a fan of deep dish, but our friends were more into New York style. But overall, it was a satisfying lunch for a bunch of first timers!
