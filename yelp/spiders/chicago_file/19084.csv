Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////YUM! I'm so glad that I did my homework on where to have Chicago pizza. This is it! No need to look any further! We ordered the Malnati Classic with pepperoni. The crust, while thick is crispy and the sauce is delicious with the sausage cooked in it. The portion sizes that they have published on the menu are no joke. My husband just had to order the medium which feeds four and of course we had leftovers because we're two people. My only criticism is that I wish they had more craft beer options.
