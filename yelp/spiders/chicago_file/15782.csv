Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When I got home in LA, I finally had a chance to experience a piece of Chicago. For some reason, I was expecting a thick greasy crust sauced with oil...instead, when I took a bite into it, I found that there was more sauce than cheese, and the bottom of the crust was dry (corn-mealy like). At first, I was wondering what the heck was wrong with the pizza (I'm sure Chicago'ans are laughing at this review right now). But as I kept eating, it made me want to eat more and more! Don't get me wrong, I'm sure I still gained 5 lbs by eating the pizza, but damn, I loved it!...and now I have handles to hold on to!
