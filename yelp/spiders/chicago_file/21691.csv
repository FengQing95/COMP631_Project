Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm a New York/New Haven Pizza Guy through and through, but when in Chicago, you have to have one of their deep dish pizzas and while there are no shortages of deep dish pie in the Windy City, Lou Malnati's is definitely the best.  The crust is rich and buttery.  The toppings are rich, plentiful and fresh.  It was so good.  And the service was top notch.  A must-stop whenever I'm there.
