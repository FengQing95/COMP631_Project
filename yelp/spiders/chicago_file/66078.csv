Smoque BBQ////Here comes a Yelp clich√©... I can't believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I'm a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem's. Although I'm partial to Lem's and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.
