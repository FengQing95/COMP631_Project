Little Goat Diner////I started with a hot chocolate, and my friend a coffee - both were wonderful on the cold day. I ordered the "This Little Piggy Went to China." The sesame cheddar biscuit was delicious, as was the Szechuan pork sausage and sunny side up egg. The chili garlic chive sauce, in my opinion was good, but would have complemented the dish better in a smaller amount. It was very sweet and I found myself trying to avoid getting too much of it on the other elements of my dish. My friend ordered some sort of omelet with a sauce that she also found too sweet. Those complaints do not equal a negative review, though. Everything except the sweet sauces was delicious, and I think it all boils down to personal preference. I need to go back and try something without a sweet element! What I did really like was that everything was so flavorful and there were really great, creative combinations throughout the menu.
