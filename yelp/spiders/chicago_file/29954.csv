Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Laura was our waitress and was great! Being from Florida we ordered an "original cheese deep dish" not knowing that "original" meant it had sausage on it. We told her it was our fault and not to worry about it but she insisted on taking the pizza off our bill. Pizza was great, service was great, and the spinach bread was amazing. Will be back again! Thanks Laura!
