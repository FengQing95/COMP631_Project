Little Goat Diner////I have been so excited for this diner to open. Alas, I was disappointed. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I went for breakfast, and the breakfast menu is limited. There is no regular, build your own omelette, and everything comes ala carte. Husband ordered oatmeal, which was below average, I ordered eggs easy over which were actually excellent. I also had a bagel with cream cheese which was poor by my Jewish standards. My biggest complaint besides the limited menu, was Â how the food came out. My bagel which came from the bakery side came out first. But we had to wait twenty minutes after that for our oatmeal and eggs. This is their first week so they have kinks. The manager came to apologize, but that was it, just words. Did not offer up anything to make us feel better. He should have offered us a complimentary something, since they just opened you would think they would want to make us leave with happy thoughts.
