Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Dinner was had earlier somewhere else. We arrived and asked for a table for five. We were downstairs only for drinks. Rather than all of us hovering over people seated at the small bar we asked for a table. Our table was then (happily) given up to another party of two bc the woman had a cane. After a couple rounds of old fashion(ed)s for our group we wanted to finish up, settle up and top off with shots before moving on to another establishment. Not the bartender, but our server turned down our request for said shots (an order ranging from whiskey to Mallort) and said we should just finish what we have. As if we were young, inexperienced drinkers who couldn't drink both or make our own decisions? To make matters worse, Brandon the server (well younger than his patrons), thought it appropriate to let us know (nodding to) the table just "over there ordered $90 steaks." That is a quote.
