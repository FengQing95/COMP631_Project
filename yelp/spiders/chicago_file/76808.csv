Little Goat Diner////The pancakes were tasty with the right balance of sweet and slight bitter from the dark chocolate. The little piggy meet China was a breakfast sandwich covered in their version of a Sichuan sauce w a mild amount of the numbing peppercorns. It was a very unique and well balanced dish. The oatmeal I only had a small taste of because it was for my toddler. She didn't like it because she has the typical refined toddler palate. I had a taste and the steel cut oats were very creamy and all the flavors really meddled well together. I also had the little goat latte which uses goat milk and tons of spices. It tasted like a chai latte on steroids. The flavor profile was very unique but extremely tasty. I wished I had opted for the whipped cream because that would have been that hit of sugar it needed. I should have known that each component of each dish/drink has been thought out and I should not alter or substitute.
