Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm giving 2 stars because I'm willing to give this place one more chance; it could have been an off night in the kitchen and our waiter could have been covering for folks who stayed home sick. Â The table size issue is something to really be concerned about, however; if you go, ask the hostess to seat you at a larger table.
