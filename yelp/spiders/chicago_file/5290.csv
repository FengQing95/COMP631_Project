The Purple Pig////Went back with Brian and have all new faves! The chicken thigh skewers are classic but also just the very best. The foie gras was so well balanced and so good we ordered a second one! The butternut squash veggie was also utterly fantastic. Well paired with rich, fresh, and flavorful flavors!
