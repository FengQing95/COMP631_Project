Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been going to Cafe Babareeba for a decade and have never been disappointed.  We decided to have our rehearsal dinner there, and it was one of the best decisions that we made for the entire wedding process.  My fiance and I both worked with Katie in their events area, and I can't say enough about how easy she was to work with.  The event itself was absolutely beautiful- the servers were incredible and paid attention to every detail.   There are no changes that I would make to the dinner because it was perfect in every way, the great same service and food I have grown to expect from Babareeba- but in an intimate private atmosphere.  For anyone looking for a good rehearsal dinner spot, Katie and the folks at Babareeba are A+
