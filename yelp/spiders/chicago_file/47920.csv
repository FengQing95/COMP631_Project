Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered about 15 different dishes, and I honestly am having a very hard time picking a favorite. The lamb kebab, tomato aoli potatoes, and sausage skewers are still leaving me longing for another visit. The portions are good for about two people to share one order, though we got multiples of each because we couldn't resist.
