Smoque BBQ////Hubs and I made it here an hour before closing time last Thursday.  It still was pretty busy.  Everyone was super friendly which eminded me of some BBQ joints back home in NC.  Someone near the front will seat you after you order.  Of note, if you want to eat outside, you have to finish up right at closing time, but if you eat inside, you can stay longer if you want.
