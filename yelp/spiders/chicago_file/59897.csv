Smoque BBQ////Good 'ol Southern Cookin! Very popular place and for good reason. Great bbq sauce and very tender meat. Menu is short and sweet, but you can't go wrong! Ribs are my favorite! The cornbread, macaroni and cheese, and peach cobbler are the best sides. Cole slaw is vinegar based and the beans are...well, beans! :) Â Perfect bbq place, but the food does add up money-wise!
