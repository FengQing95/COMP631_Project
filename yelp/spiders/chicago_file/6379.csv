The Purple Pig////Absolutely great experience here. Although the wait was long, it was well worth it. We had a couple of cocktails at the bar. What we thought was casual conversation with one of the bartenders, ended up being a very attentive manager who listened to what we had to say and even sent a drink over on the house. No, it's not about a free drink, rather the point that he listened and showed interest in what we liked. The food was ALL delicious. Can't really go wrong. Although I'm a fan of steaks and protein, the broccoli was beyond words of explanation. Great service, reasonable pricing and great cocktails!!
