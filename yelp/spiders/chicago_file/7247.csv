Art Institute of Chicago////What a gem of a museum. Sadly we only had a couple hours before our flight but luckily they give you a map outlining the top things to see if you only have an hour. That is what we did as well as explore a bit on our own. I felt as though if we'd spent the entire day there it still wouldn't have been enough. My favorites were: Van Gogh "the bedroom" Chagall's windows and Georges Seurat "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte". Wow! Seeing these pieces for the first time made me quite teary eyed. To be honest I was a bit overwhelmed by the size of this museum and trying to make the most of our time there so there was a bit of rushing around. I definitely recommend anyone visiting Chicago give this museum a shot. We got there around 10:30am on a Saturday and although the line was hanging out the door, it moved rather quickly so do not stress about lines as they were very organized. Also made a point to visit both museum shops and I gotta say if you want any gifts for yourself or someone special make it a point to visit the shops as there are some great finds. Will definitely be visiting this museum again on my next Chicago trip! If you are staying around or near the loop you can simply walk to this one.
