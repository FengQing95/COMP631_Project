Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I took my wife (both in our late 20's) here on our second wedding anniversary and we were in complete and total awe. I seriously don't even know where to begin describing our night. Do I start with the incredible service, perhaps I should talk about their perfect Chicago atmosphere, or should I just get to the main point with the short rib stroganoff?
