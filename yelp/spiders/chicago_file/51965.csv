Smoque BBQ////Finally ate here just this past Monday, the seating arrangement is family/picnic style so make room for others to sit next to you. There is a nice big board for you to read the menu. We decided to get half and half. I wanted the pulled pork, she wanted the brisket. Was it amazing and tender! The sauce was really good and vinegary, I wish it was thicker, but still worked out. The mac n cheese is a must have along with the scrumptious corn bread! Last but not least, peach cobbler was really great...all it needed was a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The price is really good, and all for about $22 for the 2 of us was more than enough! There is always a line, but it moves pretty fast and worth the wait if you are a BBQ lover! I will be back for more even though I make some good pulled pork myself hehehe...
