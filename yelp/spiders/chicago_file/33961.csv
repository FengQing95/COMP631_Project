Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great meal, great service.   My son had the 22 ounce dry aged steak which he ranked as a tie with his number one best steak ever a huge bistecca florentine cooked over a wood fire in Italy.   Salmon was excellent, goat cheese appetizer, salad lyonnaise all very good.   Service excellent.   Would go again but crazy long 3 month wait for a weekend table requires a lot of advance planning.
