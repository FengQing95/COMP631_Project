Little Goat Diner////Like its larger, fancier parent, Little Goat has a very hip feel, friendly folks, and close-knit seating arrangements. We went on a Sunday at prime brunch time (around 11:30 a.m.) and only had to wait about a half hour -- they have seating on the bar/pastry/coffee side and text you when your table (or two seats on the end of a larger table, as it turned out) is ready, which is nice and hassle-free.
