Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////But I was not alone. I brought with me a friend from Russia who was also attending the conference, and I had the unlucky task of trying to explain this odd beast that vaguely resembles the Platonic ideal of pizza. "The sauce is on top." "But why?" "Who can explain the mysteries of this earth?" Fortunately, Malnati's provided an excellent example of the red-topped step-child of the pizza family, as our "Chicago Classic," topped with sausage, tasted fantastic and certainly stands as one of the best Chicago-styles I've had. Which is probably a good thing, because, you know, it's like authentic or something.
