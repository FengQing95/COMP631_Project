Little Goat Diner////My favorite thing to eat here is a savory dish with a breakfast dish. Breakfast is ANYTIME at this place. Add a nostalgic soda shop adult beverage and I am set! Any of the pancakes are good (dark choco chip crunch yassss and I'm getting sourdough next time) and I'm pretty into their take on jap chae. I always get the umami mayo on the side though because I grew up in Hawaii and I cant do mayo on my noods. I've tried the nachos and while they were good, my stomach real estate is limited so I could probably skip. What you really should do is get the Grown Up Malt and thank me later.
