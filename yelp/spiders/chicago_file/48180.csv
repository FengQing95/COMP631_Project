Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Between 6 adults and 3 kids we spent over $250. For this price point I expect a restaurant to nail every (not just some) dish. What they were good at... Chocolate truffle cake, saffron flan and vegetable paella. Also enjoyed the bacon wrapped dates. Their plating and presentations were gorgeous. Where they failed... Shrimp skewers were charred and tasted charred, a different shrimp dish tasted really fishy, steak tapas were under seasoned, fried calamari was extremely over done, the mango sangria lacked flavor. The waitstaff was attentive and did a good job clearing our table, but they did clear some tapas that we were still working on.
