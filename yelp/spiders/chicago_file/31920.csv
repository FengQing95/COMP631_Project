Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As far as what to order, all you really need is a slice (or maybe 2) of the The Malnati Chicago Classic! If you're a purist, I wouldn't add anything and just appreciate it as the creators intended it to be! Munch on that butter crust and chomp on that amazingly sweet sweet sausage. Highly consider ordering a local beer to wash all that nomnom down.
