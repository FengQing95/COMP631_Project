Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is my new favorite steak house ever. The ambience is lovely and unique. Service is attentive and the waiter is knowledgeable. Favorite dish is the foie gras terrine, but the aged ribeye, the King crab, the old fashioned, the champagne smash and the whiskey ice cream are all absolutely amazing! Will definitely come back again to try out all the dishes!
