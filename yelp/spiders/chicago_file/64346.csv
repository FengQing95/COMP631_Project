Smoque BBQ////Wasn't able to try Smoque last time I was in Chicago, so I had to make sure I came this time around. Went during lunch with 3 friends. Ordered the rib combo platter (6 St. Louis and 6 baby backs), the sliced brisket platter, 2 extra sausages, a side of pulled pork, 2 orders of fries, 2 corn breads, 2 mac n cheese, brisket chili and an extra coleslaw. Regretted ordering the extra coleslaw because each platter actually comes with a side already, so we ended up with 3 coleslaws. Also tried both the Memphis and Carolina BBQ sauce. Both different in their own way.
