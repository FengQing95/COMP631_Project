Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had a 7:45 reservation on a Tuesday.  We were there on time, but we weren't seated until 8:15.   Service was slow the entire night and the waiter had a pretty serious attitude.  Food was decent.  The sides were the highlight of the meal, but didn't make up for the shortcomings elsewhere.  I'm in no rush to get back to Bavette's and would much rather go to Maude's.
