Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati definitely has the best crust out of all the deep dish pizza joints in Chicago. The wait time here was not that long considering it is right in the middle of downtown Chicago. You have to get the classic Chicago deep dish pizza and wash it down with some good draft on tap. I could spend a whole week just eating Chicago deep dish pizzas here.
