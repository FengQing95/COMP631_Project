Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So excited about returning to Bavette's this sat. night, we love it! The ambiance is so sexy and the food is amazing! I order the same things every time, maybe it's time to branch out, but I'm addicted to that wedge w/ the huge slice of BACON!!! the Chicken is so juicy and flavorful then the grilled broccoli, yummy! The chocolate mouse cake is probably the best desert I have ever had, it is heaven! The only thing I would change is the fact they are always booked, my husband and I never leave without making a reservation. We usually have to wait 90 days, but that's good enough for me, also, make sure you sit upstairs, the basement kind of feels like a basement.
