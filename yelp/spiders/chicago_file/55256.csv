Smoque BBQ////This is one of the best restaurants in the city, and DEFINITELY the best BBQ place I've ever encountered, which includes all the ones I've been to in Southern states. The food is indescribably good, especially the ribs, pork, beef brisket, and of course both types of the BBQ sauce. The meat is so tender, flavorful and cooked with care and ultimate quality. Â All the sides are delicious too. This place has excellent customer service, a great ambiance inside and out on the patio, and also great with catering! Trust me... If you choose Smoque to cater your party, the only bad thing is that you'll have to do it for the rest of your life, because every time family visits you, they will say, "you're going to have Smoque, right?!?"
