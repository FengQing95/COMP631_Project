Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was not disappointed! For a starving group of 6, we were seated within minutes (around 4PM on a Wednesday) and decided to get two of their most popular deep dishes, the Chicago Classic and the Lou. I will warn you, the large is LARGE. We had originally ordered both of those pizzas in a Large but after taking a look at the neighboring table's humongous pizza, we decided to change the Lou to a medium. In hindsight, we should've just ordered both as a medium but the leftovers do make a good midnight snack.
