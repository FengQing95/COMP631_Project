Smoque BBQ////I had mac and cheese and peach cobbler as the sides.  The mac and cheese is very heavy and creamy so a small side portion is all you need.  The cobbler was my least-favorite part of the meal (although I ate the whole thing, so that should tell you something).  The cobbler topping was awesome and crunchy, but the peach stuff underneath was incredibly sweet.  Really needed some unsweetened whipped cream or something to cut the sugar.  I would skip it next time.
