Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////In the last three years, I have one been to one steakhouse in Chicago and this would be it. I have been here about 20 times and have had Brandon as a server for 18 of them. He even got to the point where he would have our drinks ready when we walked in the door. Besides that, their food is awesome. Best steaks I have ever had, incredible crab and oysters, and their side dishes are to die for. I recommend that you get the bacon as it is incredible. Also, the sundae royale is a perfect way to end the dinner.
