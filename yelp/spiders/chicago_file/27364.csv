Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now the deep dish pizza. I must say I am bias towards my NY style pizza and still prefer getting a slice versus a personal pie. However this deep dish pizza did not disappoint. The crust was extremely fluffy and soft and included the right amount of sauce and cheese. The pizza came straight out of the oven so it was nice and hot. After the second slice I was completely stuffed and satisfied.
