The Purple Pig////-Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder - The infamous pork shoulder have a lot of hits amongst the reviews and a lot of misses. On this occasion, it was defintel a hit. Braised well and so tender, this would have been the perfect protein to eat with just a nice service of white rice. You can taste the love in the shoulder and the time spent ensuring the texture is just right. Some reviews state this was a tad bit too salty, for us it was just right. Come to say, we had leftovers of this dish and the BF and I ate it cold in the airport a few hours later and it tasted even better. The perfect roast.
