Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Hands down, my favorite pizzeria! I always bring out of town friends to this place, and if they say they don't like deep dish, they like it after they've had Lou's. Try the butter crust deep dish spinach. It is seasoned so nicely and tastes great. Their thin crust is excellent too. Highly recommend.
