Bavette's Bar & Boeuf//// date didn't say anything but we just feel that we got forced sale. But is ok. When I get out of the place. My date told me their rule is if u bring a bottle no bottle open fee there but u have to offer ur next door a glass. That's why the lady next to me offered me a glass. And he told me I was rude by told her that I drink too much... I feel very very annoyed the night Â the place and my date. They force sale make me wait and bitchy from my date very annoying.I want some place easy and simple and no bs rule and people I have to deal with. Food is good my expectation was high turn out the guarded rule drive me crazy. I want simple easy dinning experience no have to deal with Anything or anyone. Bill was $210 plus's $60 at the bar and I have to deal with none sense I don't know what to say. At least the food was good. But can be better experience overall.
