Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I had a great breakfast at Wildberry cafe :-). I had the signature omelette with my choice of ingredients and it was lovely, very light and tasty. It came with the choice of a side of fruit or hash-brown, along with 2 buttermilk pancakes or toast. I also had a small freshly squeezed orange juice that was lovely.
