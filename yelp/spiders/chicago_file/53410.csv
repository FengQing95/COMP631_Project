Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Pintxos: In my opinion they are just even smaller tapas (bite-sized) -- perfect for sharing and allows you to try a little bit of everything. A friend of mine had a Groupon for the pintxos platter (pictured in review) so we were able to try all six pintxos listed on the menu. My favorite would have to be the deviled egg with bacon but they were all great!
