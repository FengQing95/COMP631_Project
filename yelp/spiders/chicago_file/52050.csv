Smoque BBQ////Great barbecue favorites. People complain about the long lines and cramped seating, that's a sign that this stuff is legit and people want it. The pulled pork is some of the best in the city and the brisket is juicy and tender. Fries are great and you get a lot per order, same with the beans, absolutely delicious. Even the cole slaw is great. It's also cool to BYOB. The owner is usually there making sure things go smoothly as it can get kinda hectic. Nice guy. I'd recommend everything, especially the peach cobbler if you have room. It may be best to order it with your meal because you may have to wait in a long line again. The sauce is a tad watery but great flavor, works well with the fries too. Go here.
