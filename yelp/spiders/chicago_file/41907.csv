Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been here twice: once with a HUGE group (I'm talking 20 people here) and once with two people (we sat at the bar). Fabulous both times. While tapas is better with a big group (because you get to try more dishes), it's great with only a few people too. The decor is great, the staff friendly, and the sangria will knock you on your ass if you're not careful.
