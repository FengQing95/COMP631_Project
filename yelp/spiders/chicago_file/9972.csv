Art Institute of Chicago////This is certainly one of the great art museums in the US. We were fortunate to see a John Singer Sargeant exhibition.  I was surprised that the Art Institute had as many Sargeants as the Boston Fine Arts.  It was great seeing the different Impressionist pieces housed there.  Absolutely a must see.
