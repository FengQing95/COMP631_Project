Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Although they have a tempting menu, we were here for le beouf. The choices are New York, ribeye or filet mignon in different cuts and preparations. I chose the ribeye which was one of the specials of the day. It was perfectly cooked and one of the better steaks I've had in a while.
