Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is THE BEST pizza in Chicago.  Hands down.  The crispy crust, the flavorful tomatoes, oh my!  I'm addicted to the deep dish spinach and pepperoni, but, their thin crust is also out of this world.  It took me years to think of trying it, I wish I'd known how good it was sooner!
