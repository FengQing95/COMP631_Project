Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ohhhhhhh man! This place is delicious. Tapas are one of my favorite dishes to eat, especially with groups of 4 or more, and with a pitcher of sangria to wash them all down with.  This place is deceptively large but still has a very small Spanish bar vibe to it which I like.  I've only been twice and my waiter the second time around was less than ideal but that didn't stop everyone from having a great time.  He was especially slow on drinks and with a group of 12 it was a little problematic. We ended up ordering two pitchers of sangria (which was amazing!!!) and immediately ordered another two when they arrived knowing by the time we'd finished our first ones the next round would be on the table soon after.
