Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////These deep dish pizzas are created with LOVE.  I cannot get over the simply delicious FRESH tomato sauce that bursts "fresh picked from the vine" flavors over every tastebud in tandem with the Fresh Wisconsin  Mozz melted to pure perfection.  Our one & only tweak from the classic deep dish is to make the crust "well done" as we like crust a bit crispy, and the addition of FRESH Basil.  That's it!
