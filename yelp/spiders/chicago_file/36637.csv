Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We ordered a bunch of other foods to share in order to maximize trying all the yumminess - caesar salad was the bomb, peppered duck and goat cheese pate was very different and tasty, foie gras pate (although very fatty) had a lot of flavor.  The only "disappointment" were the marrow bones.
