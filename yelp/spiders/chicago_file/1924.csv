Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Whoa, something doubled this place is my estimation...And that thing is the havarti bacon burger with onion jam. By far it is the best lunch dish in a three block vicinity and I'm happy I came back to give this place another chance. Â I promptly returned two more times to enjoy the dish and have been very pleased.
