Smoque BBQ////Really delicious BBQ.  Small dive-y joint a little far outside of the city, but worth the trip and the wait.  We brought my suburban dad here who was initially skeptical about the BYOB factor and having to wait in a line that wrapped outside the building (and on a weeknight, no less) but even he seemed more than satisfied to finally sit down and eat good BBQ while drinking the beer of his choice.  Between the 4 of us we tried a little bit of everything and everyone left full and nobody left disappointed.
