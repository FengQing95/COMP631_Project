Little Goat Diner////For my entree I ordered the 'This little piggy went to China' and it was amazing. It's a sesame cheddar biscuit served with Szechuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, blackberries and sunny eggs. The flavors may seem a bit confusing at first but it actually works pretty well together. The blackberries give a nice tartness and offer a good contrast to the spicy and salty Asian flavors. The oozing egg yolk adds a delightful richness to the dish
