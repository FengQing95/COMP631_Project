The Purple Pig////I expected a lot from this place, but I was sub par satisfied.  Their milk pork shoulder was flavorful and tender.  It was fall off the fat meat haha.  The bone marrow wasn't too flavorful and just super oily.  I've had bone marrow many times before but the fatty and oily consistency wasn't to my liking and the flavor wasn't there. Good music was played at the restaurant tho!
