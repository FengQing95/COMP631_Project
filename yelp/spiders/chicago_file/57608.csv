Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We got a table for six pretty easily around noon on Sunday. The layout of the restaurant is pretty fun and there are pretty deliberately sectioned off parts of the restaurant. We were ushered to the back right of the establishment. Just glancing at the menu I knew this was probably going to be a great brunch. That, and the fact that there is an "!" in the name of the restaurant makes me expect big things.
