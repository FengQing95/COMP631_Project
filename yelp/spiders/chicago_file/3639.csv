The Purple Pig////When we finally got seated, we were seated at a long table along side strangers. This is how the restaurant is set up. All the tables are long and fit about 10 people so parties are sat together. I guess the experience really depends on who you are seated next to. The food was wonderful but I think my visit was ruined by a rowdy table with drunk guest next to us.
