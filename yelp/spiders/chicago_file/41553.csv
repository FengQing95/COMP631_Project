Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Out of all the Tapas restaurants in Chicago... this one takes the cake! By far the best atmosphere and best quality tapas around. This place is a lettuce entertain you restaurant, and it gets very busy. I like the atmosphere because it's busy and bustling. The Sangria is awesome, and the wait staff is always very attentive. Sitting at the bar can get annoying because it gets so busy, people are always trying to get drinks, which makes it kind of annoying to eat at. Definitely has a cozy feel to the place and the paella is pretty good too. Note: I usually eat vegetarian and so I have not eaten any of the meat dishes here. It would be a good idea to make reservations if you plan on going.
