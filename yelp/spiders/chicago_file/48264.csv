Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ba-Ba-Reeba tends to be crowded on the weekends. Especially from 6 to 10 pm.  I was pleasantly surprised to walk in on Valentine's day and get a table.  I thought for sure we would eat at the bar area and I was ok with that.  I really do love the food here, the waiters and hostesses are so friendly and helpful.
