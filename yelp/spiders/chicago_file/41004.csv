Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This wasn't the very best Tapas I have ever eaten but it was certainly very good.  The menu is varied with a good mix of veggie/cheese/seafood/red meats/white meats, and includes Paella served in individual portions.  Some of the plates were lacking that really deep paprika flavour you want from a Chorizo dish (in my opinion the defining flavour of Spanish food).....in fact the chicken and chorizo on skewers used a VERY mild flavoured sausage which needed a bit more punch.
