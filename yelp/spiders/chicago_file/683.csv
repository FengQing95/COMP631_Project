Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////It's a big place that gets very crowded; however, it's run very well.  We waited a while for a table, but it was well worth the wait as our breakfast was really good.  I never order an omelet for breakfast because I usually end up with some sort of rubberized egg with or without a ton of grease, which is folded in half with fillings inside.  I was ready to order when a server walked by our table with several omelets on her tray.  Quickly, I changed my mind and ordered an egg white omelet with an array of vegetables.  My egg white omelet arrived at the table light and fluffy as if it was baked and served as a souffle.  Delicious and perfect, no grease or butter, and most importantly, no rubberized eggs.  If I lived in Chicago, this would be my breakfast spot.  Oh yeah, my husband really liked his chorizo and egg breakfast burrito too.
