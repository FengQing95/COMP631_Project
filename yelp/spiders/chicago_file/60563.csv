Smoque BBQ////This has got be my favorite bbq joint in the city right now.  I've been here three times already, yet with each time I leave wanting to come back even more!  Smoque's had an incredible amount of publicity since they opened.  It's been on Metromix, Check Please, and even Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network!!   Everything about this place screams bbq, from the shack-line appearance on the outside to the small, cozy interior w/ a heavenly aroma of smoke and goodness in the air.
