Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had a friend in town and he has never been to a tapas restaurant and we were in the area so we found a seat at the bar at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.  We were served quickly and received all of our small plates as they were ready from the kitchen.  Every plate we received was delicoius - some portions larger than others.  The bartender who was serving us gave us some tips on which items were larger than others!
