Art Institute of Chicago////We have had a membership here for 15 years and it is a world class bargain. We go often - every time we're in the city - and just pop in to see one or two areas or whatever special exhibition is on. I don't think I could see it all in one day without collapsing from joy! The new-ish Modern wing is a revelation. Be sure to look out the large windows towards Millennium Park and the gardens. The birds eye view from there shows the layout of the garden in ways you don't notice on the ground, especially when the Salvia River is blooming.
