Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Wow. I think this place is one of the best places to go for nice and satisfying meal. The ribeye was just so tender and tasty. I am all about putting extra condiments, but I refused to put any because I wanted to taste the original flavor and texture of the meat. We ordered dozen oysters. Half from east coast other half from west coast. Both versions were fantastic! The fritz aka fries. Can I just say Bravo? I asked for ketchup as soon as the waiter brought the fries out, but didn't even touch that and used the house sauce. Even the bread that came with was satisfying. Loved the butter.
