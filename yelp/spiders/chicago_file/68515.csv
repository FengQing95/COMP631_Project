Little Goat Diner////At this point, I'm feeling pretty hopeful as the place is pretty huge and seemed cool. When we got seated, we ended up at a communal table next to a few folks. I may be dating myself, but it was tight and one of the guys reminded me of an older, creepy Monroe from Too Close For Comfort which was pretty appropriate.
