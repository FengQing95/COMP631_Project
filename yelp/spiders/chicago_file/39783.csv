Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Evening started out poorly as we were seated 30 minutes after our reservation and shoved downstairs, despite the reservation made 3 months in advance and the special occasions noted on the reserve. We were made to stand cramped at the packed bar and not offered a complimentary drink for our trouble or anything for that matter. This also brings to light that they have no area in which to sit and wait. If you're going to make people wait 30 minutes without taking care of them, don't take reservations.
