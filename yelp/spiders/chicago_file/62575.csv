Smoque BBQ////I saw this restaurant on DDD, and thought to myself if I ever go to Chicago I have to go.  Good decision on my part.  This place is so good you can smell the BBQ from about a block away, and as good as it smells it tastes better than that if you can believe it.  My wife and I had the full rack St. Louis style, incredible! As for sides we had the Mac n cheese only great and cole slaw, which I usually hate but I found myself eating the whole side. The owner/manager? Al gave a taste of the brisket with a mild sauce and sweet jalapeño which we wish we would've ordered because it melts I your mouth. This place had me wanting to move  from NYC to Chicago. I might come back just to eat here again!  OMG!!!!
