Little Goat Diner////For the the expectations and word of mouth,  I found this breakfast / brunch place to be d isappointing.   Actually, I woke up super early to avoid the lines as my first attempt was going on Friday around 2pm for lunch but wait line were about 35 minutes long which I ended up at great burger place which exceed my expectations.   Don't go there unless you don't have any other option.  The wait staff was friendly and ignored us the rest of time not knowledgeable of the food.   He was too busy providing better service at the bigger table.
