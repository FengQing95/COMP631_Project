Little Goat Diner////We sat at a community table which wasn't too bad since that wasn't a new experience to me. My husband ordered the Bull's Eye french toast and I had the spiced apple pancakes. He was loving the french toast. It has these chicken crisps on top of 'Texas toast sized' slices of french toast. He marveled at the hidden egg inside the toast when he cut through his syrup drizzled breakfast. He said it was the perfect mix of a runny egg mixing with the sweet. I also fell in love with my gigantic portion of pancakes (which I had to box because it was a giant plate). Apple slices are buried in the fluffy stacks topped with the best spiced oatmeal crumble mix I have ever tasted.
