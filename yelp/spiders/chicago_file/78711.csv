Little Goat Diner////Got reservations for 1 on a Saturday. Packed, but we got seated right away! We got their famous cinnamon rolls & damn the frosting is delicious. The topping was the best part because I love cinnamon rolls that are a bit doughy. There cinnamon roll was hard to cut into & a bit dry, but that is me.
