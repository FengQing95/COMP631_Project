Little Goat Diner////When you think of a regular diner you think of cheap food, sticky table tops, dirty silverware, and bad service.  That is NOT the Little Goat.  Instead, its good food in such large quantities even Cheesecake factory would be surprised and really good service.  The menu is HUGE so I think you should review it before going to the restaurant.
