Smoque BBQ////Have been there twice and have gotten the ribs both times. The first time I got a 1/2 slab of st louis & 1/2 baby back. Both are excellent but I preferred the less fatty baby back ribs. It has a great crust! My 18 month old son also LOVES the ribs. Just pull the meat off the bone for him and he goes to town almost jumping out of the high chair because he was sooooo excited!
