Smoque BBQ////UPDATE: As of my initial review I hadn't yet tried the ribs or chicken, but we just ordered carry-out last night and got to sample the St. Louis ribs and the smoked chicken.  Both were out of this world good -- and now that I've tried both sauces I can say they're both wonderful.  Thus, despite any misgivings about the ambience of the restaurant, I am compelled to upgrade from 4 stars to 5 stars!
