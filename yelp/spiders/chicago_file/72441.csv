Little Goat Diner////We try to get to Little Goat for breakfast or lunch every time we are in Chicago. Since we are typically in the city on the weekends, there is always a wait, but it's worth it. Sometimes we just grab something from the bakery for the drive home to Kalamazoo, but we try to eat in the diner whenever possible.
