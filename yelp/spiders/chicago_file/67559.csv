Little Goat Diner////My dad's $22 fried chicken looked promising. However, the chicken's skin was not crispy. The breading fell off as soon as my dad dig his fork and knife into it. He did rave that the chicken was not dry. It was rather juicy. He also loved the mashed potatoes. So, I guess the fried chicken is a safe option to order.
