Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Roasted dates with bacon & apple vinaigrette ($6) ---Where to start with this plate. Okay, lets go with the one word : SPECTACULAR. I'm not particularly attracted to dates or bacon (I know I know, I'm a weird one), but this dish was an explosion of delicious. A good flavour balance from the honey sweetened dates, savory crisp bacon, and refreshing tart apples. My friend John quotes: "Worth giving up your first-born child for. THEY ARE THAT GOOD." I'll let you decide how much of that statement is exaggeration and truth.
