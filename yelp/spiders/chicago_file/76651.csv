Little Goat Diner////I am so sad to write a poor review for Little Goat. I was super excited to eat here. My husband and I made reservations, but when we got there our seats were given away. It had rained and so they put everyone who was outside inside. Which isn't a huge deal, but I am diabetic and can't have too big of a gap between meals. I finally asked to speak with a manager, who was very friendly and patient and found us seats at a communal table that runs the middle of the restaurant. My sugar was too low by then, and after waiting for over 5 minutes for a server we just flagged someone down and got a coke for me. Finally our waitress came, and she was very efficient after that. My husband ordered the smoked friend chicken and I ordered the chicken tenders and macaroni and cheese. My husband liked the interesting flavor of his chicken, but they were the smallest pieces of chicken I had ever seen. He had a huge biscuit, that was quite dry. The best dish on the table was his coleslaw. The MAC was decent, had a creamy texture to it. The chicken tenders were terrible. Thick, slightly sweet and slightly burnt batter and over cooked too firm/not juicy chicken. I asked for hot sauce to combat the sweetness, and all they had was in house apricot or chipotle sauce. I can appreciate they make them in house, but it did not help my chicken. I finally gave up eating it. We spent around $40 on this meal, which is a frustrating feeling when the food is not up to par. I saw a lot of people win breakfast so perhaps I ordered the "wrong" thing. Bummer.
