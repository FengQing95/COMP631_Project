Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Classic Chicago pizza at its finest! Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza is buttery, saucy, cheesy deliciousness. We got a large pizza which accurately fed 4 people - beware though, if you're starving, the pizza takes about 40-45 minutes to make. You can get appetizers to start but you'll definitely be full off of the pizza.
