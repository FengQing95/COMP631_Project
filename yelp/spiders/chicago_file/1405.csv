Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I work about a block from Wildberry and I think the food is great.  We go for lunch sometimes and if you go right at 11-1115 you can get a table pretty quickly.  Once 1130 hits you will have a significant wait.  The thing about Wildberry is that in addition to the hundreds of companies within walking distance they also get alot of tourist from the surrounding hotels and millennium park.  If you have the time then the food is worth the wait.  It comes out hot and fast and the service is always good.  I usually get breakfast... cuz there is nothing like breakfast for lunch.  But I've also had the cajun chicken sandwich which is really good.  Parking is non existent but there are plenty of busses within walking distance.
