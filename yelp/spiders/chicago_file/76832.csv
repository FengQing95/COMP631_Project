Little Goat Diner////I mean, how do you even start a review for a restaurant such as this? I'd long been a fan of Stephanie Izard after watching (and rooting for her to) win Top Chef many years ago and I'd heard of her amazing restaurants in Chicago. The time finally came for me to come to Stephanie's city and try, for the first time, her award winning food.
