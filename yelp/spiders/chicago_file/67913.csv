Little Goat Diner////Delish! Went for a swearing in celebration and we all loved it (The cubano, the corned beef, the chili, the banana cake all amazing). The one flat note? The Parathas Burrito was Â not great. The pita was good, the eggs were cooked PERFECTLY but the taste wasn't anything special. Random kidney beans? Barely there avocado? Orangey sort of spicy sauce? Say pass!
