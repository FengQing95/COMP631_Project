Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I was really hoping for a 5 star steak, but it just didn't deliver. I got the dry aged bone in ribeye, and it was great, but didn't taste any better than what I can make at home (note: I came in at 11:15pm, not sure if it's better during normal dinner hours. Although Chicago is pretty active at night). The crab cake was amazing, 5 stars for that. My partner had the Double Bone Berkshire Pork Chop and that was really good -- as much as I love steak, I think I'd have chosen that over the steak! We also had the buttery mashed potatoes, which tasted pretty good. We were too full for dessert.
