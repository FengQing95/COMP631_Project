Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got the original Lou's (roma tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, cheeses), and the Malnati Chicago classic (sausage). The crust was pretty good, with a bit of a tart, sourdough taste, which complemented the rich toppings. Both were very good, and left all of us stuffed, with a few slices to spare. We ordered two mediums for 6 people, and the stuffed spinach bread as an appetizer, which was more than enough food. Service was a little spotty, but not enough to be a problem. The prices are actually pretty good, in my opinion, as each of us only paid around $18, including a 20% tip.
