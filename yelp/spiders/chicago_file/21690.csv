Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My non-gluten free friends loved their regular pizza as well! Definitely lived up to these reviews. When we put our name in, they told us it would be an hour wait. We put our name in and then proceeded to order our pizza. When we sat down, our pizza arrived in 10 min. It was great timing and awesome that they have that option to speed up the process. I recommend doing that if there is a long wait!
