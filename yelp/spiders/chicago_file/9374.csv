Art Institute of Chicago////Great place to stop by if you're visiting Chicago. I recommend buying a city pass. It includes tickets to the aquarium, Willis tower, Chicago 360 (John Hancock), field museum and the art institute of Chicago. You're basically pre-purchasing the tickets and you're in a fast pass lane. It's definitely nice when you're trying hit all the touristy sites on the weekend!
