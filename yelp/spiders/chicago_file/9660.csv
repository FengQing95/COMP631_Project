Art Institute of Chicago////There is a line to enter at all hours but the line moves relatively quickly. Tickets are about $23 for non-Chicago residents. Fortunately for me, I'm currently living here and I'm also a student so I had 2 discounts stacked. Huzzah! Benefits of being a poor grad student.
