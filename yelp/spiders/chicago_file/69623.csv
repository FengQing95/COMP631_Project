Little Goat Diner////My friends and I have wanted to go to Little Goat ever since it opened a couple weeks ago. We finally decided to go last night for dinner. The three of us showed up around 8PM on a Wednesday night and we were told it would be a 45 minute wait. Cool, no big deal. We decided to hang out at the bar and grab some drinks while we waited. The hostess asked one of my friends for his number when he arrived so he could receive updates on how long the wait time would be. I thought this was super cool and convenient.
