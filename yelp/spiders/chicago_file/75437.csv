Little Goat Diner////This chef is supposed to be renowned and there was an eggshell in the eggs! For something so pricey on the menu, at least take a second to scoop out the eggshell. I've eaten at Waffle House a bunch of times and I have yet to discover an eggshell in my food--and Waffle House is infamous for their sloppiness.
