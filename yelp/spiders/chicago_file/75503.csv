Little Goat Diner////Wow wow wow!!! Love this place! Super interesting menu and fast service. All of us enjoyed our food and were beyond stuffed. The wait is crazy long, but for good reason. We sat at the counter which had no wait and we scarfed down our food since we were hungry, but also because it was delightful. Can't wait to visit again.
