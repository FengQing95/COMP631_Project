Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't know what they do to their crust but it is soooo friggin good. Thick crust, think crust...I love it. Just give me the crust and I'll be good. Okay, so maybe I need more then the crust but mmmmm, soo good! It's just a toss up for me as to which is better....think it just depends on what I'm in the mood for. Oh the thing I don't like is if you ask for extra sausage they end up putting a sausage patty across the entire pizza which I am not a fan of. I want my sausage crumbled not in huge patty form...that's just weird...or maybe I'm weird...whatever. To each his own.
