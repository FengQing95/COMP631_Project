Little Goat Diner////I got the Tonkatsu sandwich... if I were just judging the tonkatsu I'd say it was pretty decent! But the sandwich overall was missing something to bring it all together. I kept eating the parts individually (which I never do) because they tasted better on their own than in a sandwich.
