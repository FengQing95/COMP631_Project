Smoque BBQ////One shouldn't under estimate the sliced brisket though.  The passion for real smoked barbecue shines with the sliced brisket.  It will basically melt in your mouth.  The sausage is pretty good, as are the ribs.  They stay to the chicago roots and offer the baby back, as well as the fattier St. Louis style.  Both are great decisions.
