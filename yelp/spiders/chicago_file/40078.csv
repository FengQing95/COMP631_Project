Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Here's what you need to know: this is my favorite restaurant in all of Chicago. Incredible steaks and service, along with the beat BYOB policy ever - share a glass of your wine with a stranger in the restaurant and you don't pay corkage. Order the mixed green and apple salad along with the crab cake and burger with bacon for apps (yes especially the burger since it's the Au cheval burger with pork belly). Order the bone in filet (they have limited quantities and they can run out at the end of a busy night) with a side of mushrooms for dinner and the chocolate cream pie for dessert. Note: Very hard to get reservations on weekends or even regular dinner hours on weekdays. Pro tip, if you're really looking for amazing service, ask to be seated in John's section. He makes your experience better :)
