Art Institute of Chicago////Membership is well worth it Â Love bringing Plus Ones for free, the membership lounge downstairs as a great break in the day/visit, and the gift shop sketchbook paper is the BEST I've ever drawn with. Staff are also amazing and polite. The selection of art is immaculate. Love love love. Had to mention- Sketchbook paper is very very good! Acid free (so can take marker), can layer a regular pencil over/over for extreme darks.. I pick up a new one every time I go in. (And they're always on sale!)
