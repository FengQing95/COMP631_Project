Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Delicious! We had the steak, bacon, and chicken. Everything was cooked to perfection! The ambiance of the restaurant makes for a perfect date night and I would recommend coming here to celebrate a big event or anniversary. The only downfall is the food is a bit pricey but not bad compared to other surrounding restaurants in the area.
