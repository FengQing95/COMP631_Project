Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Side dishes: We had the frites, elote and creamed spinach. The fries are delicious (the same you'll find at Au Cheval). You can tell they're fried in animal fat, and I'll pretty much eat anything that fits that description. The elote was pretty meh, but this is coming from someone who likes authentic elote, so maybe you'll think it's great. The spinach was not good. I think both of us only had a bite or two--not as creamy as you'd think.
