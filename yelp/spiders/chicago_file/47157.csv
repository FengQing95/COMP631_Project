Smoque BBQ////this place seems to be really busy. i get it. it looks really really good online. when my boyfriend and i got there, being the noobs we were to the place, we were a little confused to how the place works. it was a little more pricey than i wanted for the food that i actually received. it looks SO much bigger on their website. my plating seemed smaller than expected. they food was pretty good though. my cornbread took longer than the rest of the food and by the time i had gotten it, i was almost done with my plate. the mac and cheese was decent and my brisket could have been more moist. there could be a possibility that i'll be back, but only if i have the dying urge to have bbq or just have a craving.
