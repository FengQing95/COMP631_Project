Little Goat Diner////Oh, Little Goat. I live close, so I've eaten here probably 10 times with a variety of friends and family. I am a fan. I like the vibe and the cute goat graphics and the big booths and the coffee and the vegetarian options. I love the parathas burrito, the chap chae, and the salted caramel milkshake. I don't eat meat, but I love how much my friends like the nachos.
