Smoque BBQ////The meat was excellent but I guess Texas style just isn't my favorite. I like the style of bbq traditionally considered subpar in which both the sauce and meat are integrated; here, they give you little buckets of sauce for dipping, pouring, whatever, and it's fine, but could be better. I also wish the menu offered more combination options, although it IS nice that you can order a "taste" of various meats for ~$3 (and they're pretty generous tastes).
