Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Service was good. When you arrive you can put in your order while you wait for a table due to the long cooking times. We were seated just as we made up our minds and were about to place our order. Due to the long wait between ordering and our pizza's arrival we could have used another check-in to refill drinks, but that was my only complaint. Once we got our pizza our server was great about checking in to make sure we were happy with our meal and that we had everything we needed.
