Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We love the deep dish here! Fresh tomato, and it was a big sausage patty covering the top of the pizza, not just small bits of sausages. There were alot of cheese which we love about. So it's very meaty and cheesy, and we love both meat and cheese. The pie crust is crispy, not soggy at all. The price was right. We got a medium pizza for under $20, and the medium pizza is big and heavy enough. We were able to have left over for a second meal the other day. We love it! Be prepared for the long wait though, but the wait was worth it. I recommend you to eat there when you visit Chicago, it's a must! And if you are already in Chicago, this is a must deep dish!
