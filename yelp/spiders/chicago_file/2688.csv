The Purple Pig////I stan the fried pig ear salad. Anytime I take someone here, it's the one single item I consider a mandatory. Seafood is always done well here. They have a great variety of charcuterie options which pleases this salami slut. I once had a steak that was served with a beef cheek pie and broccoli ice cream. That blew my mind. I promise it's not the wine talking.
