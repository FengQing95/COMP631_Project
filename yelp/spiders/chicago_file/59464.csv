Smoque BBQ////To be fair, I DO pretty much dislike most things ~American~ so my palette may have adjusted accordingly... But perhaps my displeasure with our culture began with the cuisine... Who knows! All I know is that I won't be back here again. Sorry, Smoque. Next time I'm craving BBQ flavors, I'll just dump some Sweet Baby Ray's on something.
