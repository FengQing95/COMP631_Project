Smoque BBQ////The ribs were tougher then I thought they would be. When attempting to pull the bone away from the meat or remove a portion by hand there was a lot of resistance. It was one of those moments where if it would have given way I may have clocked the guy next to me. Another in my party commented on the toughness of the Ribs.
