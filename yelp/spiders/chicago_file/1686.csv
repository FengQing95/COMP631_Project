Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Breakfast is one of my favorite times to eat and this place did not disappoint.  My husband found this place online by looking for good spots to take a group to and this place came highly recommended.  Please come hungry as the portions are huge.  I had the french toast with bacon and one side of scrambled eggs and could barely finish everything.  The ambiance is charming but if you get there after 10 am, expect to wait a little bit as this place gets crowded very quick.  The staff didn't stand out per say but non the less, I have no complaints as everyone was very nice.  The hostess made sure to greet every customer that walked in and out the door.  I think my favorite item on the menu was the coffee though.  I had a Turtle latte that was simply amazing.  The portion of coffee was better than any Starbucks and I would come back again just for that!
