Little Goat Diner////Enjoyed our dinner at Little Goat a lot. It's in a hip neighborhood with a studenty vibe. The decor is beautiful. I had the Fat Elvis (waffles with bananas, bacon and peanut butter) and it was everything I imagined. One tiny complaint is that the syrup (already added) made some of the waffle a little soggy.
