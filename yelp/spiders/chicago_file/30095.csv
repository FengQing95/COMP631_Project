Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ate with a knife and fork and cutting into the crust can be a little difficult. During my last piece, I stabbed my pizza and it popped off my plate. Whoops. 5 second rule. I'm not letting that slice go to waste. I'm usually a thin crust pizza kind of girl but Lou Malnati's is beginning to change my mind on deep dish pizza.
