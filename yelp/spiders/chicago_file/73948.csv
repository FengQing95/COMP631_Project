Little Goat Diner////We had burgers and split the Mac n cheese. I had the kimchi burger which was delicious and pretty unique. The egg was a great touch. It was a little under for medium; it was pretty pink on the inside. My friend's burger was good as well, but her bun was so soggy it was impossible to pick the burger up. The Mac n cheese was delicious and was surprisingly light; it was definitely enough for the two of us to share.
