Little Goat Diner////I've been to Little Goat a bunch of times, and I always love the food and service here. I didn't realize that I've never written a review before! They've changed the menu quite a bit since the first time I've been, which was maybe a year and a half ago...? Little Goat is ALWAYS one of my go-to places when I'm taking an out-of-town friend out for brunch, recommending a place for people to try, or simply when I'm in the mood for some delicious and unique food to try! I do have some staples that I love when I'm not in the mood to be daring though. For their coffee bar, I absolutely adore their hot chocolate, razzle chai latte, and the little goat. For food I can always count on the bull's eye french toast (fried chicken, french toast, and strawberries--sweet and savory all in one--what could be better?!), parathas burrito (can I get a holler from my carb and egg lovers out there?!), and their ooey gooey cinnabun! I also loved their brandade, but it's no longer on their menu. Hopefully they'll bring it back someday!
