Art Institute of Chicago////If you are a tourist, you will find this to be an excellent place to see up close all of those classic pieces of art you've seen in books. Their history of being a fine art institution is more than represented in it's halls. As for the new Modern Wing, the architecture is really inspiring, but so far the art has lacks freshness. We are lucky to have the MCA and lots of art galleries to show us what's happening in contemporary art, but I was hoping to see a little more here as well. I think it falls short to the MoMA and the Guggenheim in NYC. Â The Milwaukee Art Museum has in its collection artwork I've seen in galleries just one year ago, which is really being on top of it! The St. Louis Art Museum is smaller, but is free.
