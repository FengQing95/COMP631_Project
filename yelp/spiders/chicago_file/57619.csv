Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Oh, how we LOVE Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! The ambiance and service are amazing. We typically start with anywhere from 3-8 tapas between the two of us, staggering them between half pitchers of different flavors of sangria, and finishing our meal with a few servings of paella. Everything is delicious! We have not had a single dish that we didn't like. That said, the potato salad and ham & cheese croquettes are an absolute must.
