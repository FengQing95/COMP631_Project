Little Goat Diner////Seriously underwhelmed.  It was supposed to be a 15 - 20 minute wait that turned into over 30.  My husband order the Sloppy Goat, I got the Los Drowned, and we ordered the tempura mashed potatoes since everyone seems to rave about them.  Right before our food was served we were informed that the mashed potatoes weren't available.  Both of our sandwiches were just okay.  The food and experience would usually garner a 3 star rating but the fact that the food is so outrageously overpriced results in only 2 stars.  Charging $13 for a mediocre sandwich that doesn't even come with a side dish is ridiculous but suckers like me fall for it.
