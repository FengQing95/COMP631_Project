Art Institute of Chicago////One could wish there were greater depth in the Americas collections (more Hopper and Sargent would be nice, and there's almost nothing of the Bay Area movement and Mexico, and Canada and South America are ignored), and there's very little work of Dutch masters, etc. Â The Institute would do well to add another wing if they could.
