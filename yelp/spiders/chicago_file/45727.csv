Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Loved the escargot, caesar salad, and the "small tapas"----Pinxtos---(pronounced Peen-Chose if I recall correctly).  The are apparently single item tapas or bar food that are popular in Spain and we loved them.  I think they were $1.50 a piece and you are able to try a variety for a low cost.
