Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////No wait and was seated right away for 2 around 7pm. Angelica was super friendly and attentive. I ordered the Lou and the significant ordered the Malnati. Hers was stuffed with sausage and she enjoyed it. Mine was for the vegetarian and the mushrooms and tomatoes were cooked perfectly. Our deep dish pizza were 9 inch personal sizes.
