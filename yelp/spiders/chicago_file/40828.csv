Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I used to love Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, especially their blackberry sangria and bacon wrapped dates.  I still love both of those items, but the menu has changed so much since I first starting going there, that there is little more left to satisfy me.  The paella used to be delicious, now it's just so-so.
