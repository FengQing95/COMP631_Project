Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Before leaving the office, I called in to place an order for a 6" individual-sized deep dish "Malnati Chicago Classic" at about 6:15pm.  They said that the pizza will take about 30-45 minutes to make so I got there around 6:45pm, in case it came out sooner.  After arriving there at 6:45, I waited for another 30  minutes before my pizza came.  In addition to waiting about 1 hours for my pizza to come out, the bartender was a bit unresponsive.  I know it was busy, but it's times like this that there should be some more support at the restaurant.  I felt sorry for the overworked staff so I gave a big tip; I hope they get the help they need in the future.
