Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My husband and I went there before the big dinner crowd at 3:30pm, but it was already so busy and crowded, we were able to put our name in and preorder our pizza. We ordered the Malnati's salad and the classic Malnati's deep dish pizza plus pepperoni, WOW!!!!! The best deep dish ever! They are busy, due to being famous, so expect to wait for your pizza, but well worth it. It is a little pricey, so what! I would come back and I would bring my family. Â By the way, we ordered a large pizza and we could only eat 2 pieces, due to being deep dish each slice is big and thick! I will be ordering pizza for shipment to San Diego soon so my family can experience the deliciousness of Lou Malnati's Chicago!
