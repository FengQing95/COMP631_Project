Little Goat Diner////Because I like to reserve 5 stars for the most elite of places I gave The Little Goat Diner 4 stars but I would recommend this place. I had a cup of chili which was fantastic. The sloppy goat was very good also with a nice blend of flavors. The Mac-and-cheese was good too but you have to be pretty poor to mess Mac-and-cheese up. Will return when in the west loop.
