Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////New favorite place for authentic Chicago deep dish pizza. Hands down, it's the best. You can taste the fresh ingredients. I tried some others like Giordanos and they don't compete with the food here. Yeah the pizza may take 45 mins to cook but the way they have everything organized you wouldn't even notice. You order your deep dish before you even sit down, so when you get to your table the pizza is pretty much brought out a few mins later.
