Smoque BBQ////Been back a few times over the years, most recently on 10/13/13.  If I get to have a last meal I want it to be the sliced brisket platter.  I have yet to find any meal of any kind that tastes better.  This is simply the best tasting meal I have ever had.  Period.  The fact that it's a few steps from the blue line makes it even better.  No parking worries when I take the train.
