Smoque BBQ////Smoque actually catered our wedding back in November. While we had our own helpers to serve the food, the catering staff was very thorough and easy to communicate with and the food was dropped off with chafing dishes, etc on time. The cost was very reasonable for 215 people! We ended up ordering brisket, pulled pork, mac n cheese, and salad. Â People really loved it. Even a few months later, we still get many compliments of using Smoque as our caterer. Would definitely recommend!!
