Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started off with delicious bread and butter, then made our way to a duck terrine appetizer (more bread). My wife had lamb (delicious) and I had the 22 oz. bone-in rib eye steak. Expensive? At 60 bucks, yes. Worth it? Absolutely. We shared the fantastic elote corn (with cheese), and the pommes frites. We both had two glasses of wine, pinot noir and grigiot, both of which were smooth as silk. Oh, and I also had mushrooms and garlic on top of the steak. I am here to tell you that the steak was buttery and delicious. I've never quite had it made that way, however they did it.
