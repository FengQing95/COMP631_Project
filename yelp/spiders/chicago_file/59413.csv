Smoque BBQ////We've been loyal Smoque customers for 5 years.  We've had it catered for multiple parties and its truly a crowd pleaser.  Everyone raves that its just the best brisket they've ever had.  The sauce is so flavorful and the meat is beyond top notch and cooked to bbq perfection.  I love the mac and cheese and coleslaw as well!  Don't forget the homemade peach cobbler too, one of my favs.  Truly the best BBQ place in Chicago!
