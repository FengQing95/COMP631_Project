Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was my first time in Chicago so naturally I kept hearing that I just had to try deep dish pizza. Lou's was recommended as one of the best in town. I don't know what all the hype is about. I only had one piece. It did taste good but it is pretty hard to mess up pizza entirely. It is not something I will schedule into my visit next time I am in Chicago.
