Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I will say, reservations are highly recommended and almost necessary because it's always busy (I use OpenTable) and justifiably so! Most guests dress up a notch or are coming directly from work and tend to be a more established professional crowd. Pricing is on par with all other steakhouses in the city but IMO offers one of the highest quality dining experiences without the pretense or snobbery.
