Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute has the finest collection of impressionist paintings I  have ever seen, if that is what you are looking for.  It is the perfect sized art museum and is not an overload like the more extensive Met or Louvre, which require an entire day to explore but feature much more.  It is reasonably priced and easy to access by El.
