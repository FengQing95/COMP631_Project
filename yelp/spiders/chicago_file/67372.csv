Little Goat Diner////- Korean Burger - The goat meat was nicely cooked, if a little underseasoned. The bread was pillowy and great. The kimchi...was not kimchi. More like the regular pickled cabbage one would get at a Chinese restaurant to whet the appetite. Great portion size but overall, the burger needed a little more kick to it.
