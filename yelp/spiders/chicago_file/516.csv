Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////great place for brunch and nice location right by Millennium Park! Love the red velvet french toast, skillets, and waffles. They have really big portions....so be prepared to take leftovers! This is not the best place for pancakes though. They can get really busy on weekends, but it is definitely worth the wait. No reservations on weekends.
