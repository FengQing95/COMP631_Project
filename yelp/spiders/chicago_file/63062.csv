Smoque BBQ////Great food very delicious but I think I hyped it up too much in my head. I saw it on the show Dinners, Drive-ins & Dives with Guy & I travelled 12 hrs from Jersey to Chicago & honestly, it was great food but it wasn't the best dish I've ever had. The brisket was a little dry, the smoked beans had a great bbq flavor, the mac & cheese was very good. The coleslaw was different in flavor, it had apple vinegar which threw me off a bit & not in a good way. Potatoes were fresh but they get very stale after an hour or two so I wouldn't recommend taking the food to go.
