Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friend and I waited for about an hour for our pizza (at 2:30 pm on a Saturday). So, while I get that this is a popular place, it just seemed odd to me that at 2:30 it took an hour to make a deep dish pizza for two (9"). Whatever, I was sitting at the bar crushing a couple of Goose Island IPAs to kill the time.
