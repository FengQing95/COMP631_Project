Little Goat Diner////This place is so cute. It's "diner-chic" atmosphere perfectly matches the cuisine. There's even an adorable photo booth near the hostess stand. We ordered the goat chili cheese fries from the snack corner menu to share, and they were soooooo good. It kind of has some Spanish flavors which really worked in the dish. Then I ordered that night's special, the salmon. It was cooked medium rare which isn't something I'm used to, but the arugula grapefruit salad and the chipotle aioli made it really come together! For dessert we shared the passion fruit meringue pie. Order it. Please. Do it. It's amazing. The meringue tasted like marshmallow heaven and the fruit was perfectly tender. And the nilla wafer crust was of course, delicious. Perfect for a date or hangout with friends!
