Art Institute of Chicago////We didn't spend a lot of time in here as we didn't arrive until 8 pm on a Friday night and we were exhausted from walking around the city. We couldn't pass it up however, since it was free admission. We saw what we could and enjoyed every minute of it. The next time I come to Chicago, I'm definitely carving out a good 3 hour chunk of my time to spend here. What a great museum.
