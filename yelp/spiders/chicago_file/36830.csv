Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I can't speak highly enough about Bavette's and the dinner we had there. It was a Sunday evening and were told on the phone that the wait could be an hour or more....we figured "fuck it, let's go check it out anyway." As we walked in, a table of 3 just cleared from the bar and we got SUPER lucky with a table in the back. If you are planning on a Saturday night out, definitely call ahead and make a reservation.
