Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My friend took us here before I moved to Chicago for a group dinner.  The majority of the group semi-liked it, while I thought it was pretty good.  It's a fun place to come with a group because you can keep ordering dishes to share. Among the favorites was the chicken paella, garlic potato salad, and the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce is a great dip.  We also thought the empanadas were well done and their sangria (i dont ever remember sangria being this good) is fantastic, make sure to get a pitcher of them and everyone at the table will be happy and a little buzzed.
