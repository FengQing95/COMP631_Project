Little Goat Diner////The event started up a bit bumpy as they did not anticipate 20+ hungry individuals would wipe out the food in minutes. After looking for someone to place additional orders... about 30 min in, they were able to get more food out to the group. The food itself was delicious and the portions were appropriate for the size of the group. I would suggest not having the bartender be the go-between for ordering food with the kitchen because they are busy servicing drink orders and may not have enough capacity to monitor how much of the food is being consumed. There should always be a liaison monitoring how the group is doing during the event to make sure things are flowing smoothly.
