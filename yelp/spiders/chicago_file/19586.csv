Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I love this place best pizza in the world if anyone ask this is the place I'm recommending the atmosphere is amazing & so homely. I love their chicken alfredo pasta omg it's to die for & the pizza is so good that you don't have to even ask for extra sauce like most places this is the spot for the best pizza in Chicago
