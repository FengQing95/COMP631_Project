Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The Good: Where to begin? The food is absolutely spectacular. The bacon-wrapped dates are a must, and the goat cheese in tomato sauce is equally amazing. I don't think I've had a bad thing on the menu, but I have yet to try many of the dishes. Also, the sangria is superb - I particularly love the classic red and the white peach. My one friend is convinced that Babareeba should sell the peach sangria in an "adult juicebox" because she loved it so much. It's also a very beautiful restaurant, with lots to offer everyone. The waitstaff is really attentive considering how busy it gets too!
