Little Goat Diner////My French toasts - thick cut toasts with fried egg at the center. It was the most disappointing meal of my Chicago visit. The BBQ chili syrup tasted like store bought duck sauce. The fried chicken pieces appeared as a thrown on afterthought. Though crispy, they were flavorless. The toasts themselves were undercooked - the centers were still soggy. So much regrets on one plate.
