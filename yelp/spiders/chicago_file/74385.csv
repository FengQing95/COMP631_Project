Little Goat Diner////Anyway, despite my singleton status that night, I was treated with nothing but kindness from every person on the staff I dealt with and I hope I tipped them well enough to let them know how much I appreciated that. Once seated, I pored over the menu. It's huge, guys, and everything on it sounds delicious. The struggle is real but my waiter was there for me. I let him know a couple of the things I was considering and he steered me towards the Reuben since they make the corned beef in-house and I'm a big fan of kimchi too. I threw on a side of the brussels sprouts too, for a vegetable.
