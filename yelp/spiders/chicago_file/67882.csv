Little Goat Diner////we were both like,"wait, what?!" but we couldn't complain because the tonkatsu item was inside the "Sammie" section of the menu for sandwiches.  so we just missed it.  just never heard of making tonkatsu patties into a sandwich.....and i hope to never run into this monster in the future. it was horrible.  just had the patties. but again, couldn't complain cuase it was our fault for missing this detail.
