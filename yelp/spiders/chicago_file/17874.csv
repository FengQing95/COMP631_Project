Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////after hearing that pizza takes 30-40 minutes to cook, we started with the house salad with red wine vinaigrette dressing which was lovely, although a tad too sweet.  a small sized "malnati's" pizza was more than enough to feed 2 adults.  the infamous butter crust was not particularly buttery, but more flaky and crusty, similar to pizza hut's crust, and the cheese was rubbery and hard, however, the overall flavors exceeded my expectations.  the pizza was not oily nor salty, but i don't think i could take more than 2 slices of it, whereas i could devour the whole thing of pieology pizza.
