Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We always order the mashed potatoes and have ordered it with either brussel sprouts or elote, both are good. For apps we've tried the shrimp de jhong which was okay and the peppered duck and goat cheese, which I preferred. For an app, a steak for two, a dessert, two drinks and a nice bottle of cab/franc, dinner comes to about $300 with tax and tip. Which is pricey but pretty standard for a high end steakhouse.
