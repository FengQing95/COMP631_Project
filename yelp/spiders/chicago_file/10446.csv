Art Institute of Chicago////Great museum! We spent the entire day here and still didn't have enough time to see everything. I loved the Charles White: A Retrospective exhibit, the contemporary art, textile art (Music and Movement: Rhythm in Textile Design sculptures), photography (Never a Lovely So Real: Photography and Film in Chicago, 1950-1980) and Islamic art exhibits. I didn't like that they charge you extra for certain exhibits once you are in the museum even after paying a pricey admission fee and I took away a star for that. Also thought that the gift shop options were very limited. Could not find any prints of some of the artwork I really loved. The children's program using the interactive map was awesome. Using a software, children select styles of art they like and the programs suggests work they may enjoy. Children get a printout of the map. They walk around the museum to find them and take notes or answer questions about the art. Once they've found everything they get a prize. Great way to get kids engaged. Stop by the museum gardens with the fountain if you get the chance, it's so peaceful. Employees were very nice and helpful. They all seem to enjoy working here. Will visit again on future trips to Chicago.
