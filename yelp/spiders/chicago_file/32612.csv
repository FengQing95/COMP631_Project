Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started off with the terrine and the avocado and crab salad.  Both were very good. The terrine is among the best I have every had!  My date had the steak frites (the steak was huge, and very good).  I had the short rib stroganoff (delicious!).  For desert we ordered the lemon meringue (which was very fresh).  We also ordered some cocktails (I had the absinthe champaign cocktail, which was great).  The decor and overall style of this restaurant is impressive (down to the music selection!).   The overall menu and drinks selection is one of the most interesting (and compellingly good) that I have seen in a long time. I look forward to my next meal here.
