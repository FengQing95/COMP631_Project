Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great for big groups, though it is quite loud.  Service was a bit slow, but the restaurant was very crowded and we were with a bunch of friends so we didn't care.  Very reasonable prices.  Each couple paid ~$50-60, drinks included.  Make sure you make a reservation well in advance.
