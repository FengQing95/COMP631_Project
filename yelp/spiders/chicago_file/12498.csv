Art Institute of Chicago////Don't miss the newer modern wing, the old masters, the black & white photography, numerous sculptures, and remember they have a world class library also. While you can bring strollers, it is a bit unwieldy to schlep infants through the rooms. There is a lot of walking, so bring comfortable shoes. And walk up the grand staircase - they don't build stuff like this anymore. Highly recommended.
