Little Goat Diner////Place was definitely crowded so good thing we had a reservation. The hostess got very confused about the gluten-free menu situation but that was resolved. We order the brussels sprouts and broccoli to shear. I ordered the duck which was amazing, and my other non gluten free friend the ravioli which was amazing. My two gluten-free friends ordered the chili which was great and the tomato apple soup. Which Â she said was a little weird at first taste but she liked it by the end.
