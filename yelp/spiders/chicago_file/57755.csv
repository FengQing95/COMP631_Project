Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Had a WONDERFUL meal here with my daughter when I was there dropping her for college at DePaul. We were STARVING- the day we arrived, after moving all her stuff into the dorm. Was so wanting paella as we can not get it in Nashville but the 45 minute wait and minimum of 2 orders when we wanted to try other things and we COULD NOT WAIT  45 minutes to eat.  So, we got garlic shrimp, shredded Brussel sprout salad and I forget what other amazeballs small plate that was one of the best things I ever put in my mouth.  The crusty bread and the olive oil worthy of drinking straight up were SO AMAZING! Can't wait to go back another time when I'm not ready to eat my own hand and wait the 45 minutes for the paella. It looked and smelled worth the wait.
