Smoque BBQ////I got a rib combo because I couldn't decide if I wanted the St. Louis style ribs or baby back ribs. If you like more meat on your ribs, then you'll opt for the baby back ribs. If you like more fat and something more tender, you'll like the St. Louis style ribs. Personally, I liked the St. Louis styled ribs better. They had much more flavor and were just tastier in general. The baby back ribs were a little on the dry side because it had more meat on the bone but you can just dip the pork in the Memphis style sauce that they provide. For sides, I got an order of the mac n cheese and cornbread. Both came in small portions but I thought it was just the right amount of food. The mac n cheese was average in my opinion. I also love gumbo so I had to try the gumbo special that they had going on. It was pretty good!
