Art Institute of Chicago////I'll keep this as simple as possible. They have that painting of the farmer with his daughter or whoever she is. They also have 'Nighthawk' which is the painting of people sitting in a diner. I'm sure there are other interesting pieces but I don't really remember. I've been here twice and both times I've wandered around aimlessly for a couple hours. If you live in Illinois, they offer free/discounted weekends throughout the year for residents, which is definitely the best time to go if you're just a normal person like me. I mean, who wants to go to a museum when all of the fancy people are there? I sure as Hell don't want to listen to them talk about what Monet was FEELING when he did whatever it is he did. Actually, try sneaking in mini bottles of alcohol, I'm sure it'll make the entire experience that much more enjoyable.
