Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Lovely low-lit old-school ambiance. Deep, dark booths and ultra professional staff. I've been to Bavette's with gal pals, on date night, for double dates, for business dinners, after-work drinks, and I always leave happy. I must have at least one lillet rose martini whenever I am there, but their old-fashioned is not to be missed either! I like to order oysters, the filet mignon (ask for the tomato with the 10oz.) and as many sides as the table can handle. Do not miss the elotes, buttery mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach. I'd say Bavette's is my go-to spot in the loop.
