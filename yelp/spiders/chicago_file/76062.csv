Little Goat Diner////Case in point - I popped in for an early lunch during a week of conferencing in the city. And Little Goat was stuffed to the brim, whether diners were enjoying themselves al fresco or within. Little Goat is Chef Izard's upscale, yet unpretentious, diner. It features a wide gamut of classics with some culinary twists, many of which were Asian-inspired. I pulled up a seat at the counter, which offered a decent view of the kitchen at work.
