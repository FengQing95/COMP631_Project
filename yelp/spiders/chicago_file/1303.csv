Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We went on a Sunday about 1 pm.  Wait was about 45 minutes but we expected this.  The service (thanks Renzo), coffee drinks, and food were excellent.  We had cappuccinos, the mexicana skillet, very berry crepes, and chocolate chip pancakes. Only complaint was the knives, you will see what I mean when you are there.  Highly recommend.  Worth the wait.
