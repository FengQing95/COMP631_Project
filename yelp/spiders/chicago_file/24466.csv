Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friend brought me this place and said this is one of the best pizza place in Chicago. We are ordered the trio drip with chip, one medium classic pizza and one medium the Lou. The trio drip is a good pick and the garlic drip is my favorite. The pizza is big and filling. Between the two I like the classic better than the Lou. The classic has a big flat sausage and cheese on the pizza that is my favorite. We are in a group of 5 guys and we have one slice each left from the two pizza so beware that the portion when you are ordering.
