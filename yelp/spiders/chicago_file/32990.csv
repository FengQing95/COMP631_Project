Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////okay and who could possibly forget the goldbrick sundae?? its malted whiskey black dog gelato with magic shell... basically its a magical chocolate sauce that wizards came up with to torture fatty pattys like me... its normal-seeming until that sauce hits the ice cream and it hardens into a crunchy chocolate covering your ice cream... and i do not hesitate with that sauce... just pour it all over and dig in!!!
