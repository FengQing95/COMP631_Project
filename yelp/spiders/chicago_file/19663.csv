Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was excellent! It's right up there with Gino's East, cooked to perfection. Its really a toss up between the two in my opinion but now that I think of it I might have to give it to Lou only because the cheese is cooked right up onto the crust which is my absolute favorite! One could say this pizza also has no crust, either way I love it because I hardly ever eat the crust.
