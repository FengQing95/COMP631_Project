Little Goat Diner////Ordered the kimchi burger.  It was perfectly medium rare, which was great, but the kimchi was bland and lacked texture. Shoestring fries were a mistake.   I never seem to learn that they're going to be cold very shortly after being served no matter who's kitchen they some from.  Ending up with a cold, yet oddly still crispy, bowl of fries was a bummer.
