Smoque BBQ////First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn't need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I'm usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque's is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don't use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac & cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz.
