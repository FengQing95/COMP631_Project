Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Spent the week in Chicago with a group of 19 and this was our last breakfast before heading home!  This place is FANTASTIC!  They had a line and quite a wait when we arrive and with 19 I expected a LONG wait -- that was not the case at all.  They move quickly to seat and we all ate together outside in beautiful weather with a back drop of Millennium Park and the skyline.  It was beautiful!  As if that wasn't enough, the food was OUT OF THIS WORLD!  The helpings were huge and the food was delicious.  The service was top notch!  When you take a large group anywhere you expect delayed service and less than happy servers.  This was the complete opposite and we appreciate being treated so well!  Thanks Renzo and his happy helper!  A must eat location in Chicago!
