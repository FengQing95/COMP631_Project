Little Goat Diner////The menu is cute but it leaves out some ingredients for certain dishes. (Ex: the Shrimp & Porkbelly has more veggies than just the pea shoots listed) While I appreciate the cleanness of the menu, I'm a somewhat picky eater so it would have been nice to know in advance what I was going to get.
