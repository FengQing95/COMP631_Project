Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been in nearly all of the seating areas and can't really complain about the setup.  Recently I was seated in the room adjacent to the patio and even though it was a busy night, I was able to talk to my table without having to shout.  The service is usually very good and the wait staff is accommodating to both rookie and veteran patrons.
