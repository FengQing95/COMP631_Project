The Purple Pig////All of these were popular plates that the waiter recommended except for the scallops (we just love scallops). The crispy pig's ears, arguably one of the purple pig's most popular dishes, was too salty for my liking. The milk braised Berkshire shoulder was very tender. The seared scallops were good but there were only 2. A bit pricey for just two scallops. The octopus was on the oily side without enough flavor.
