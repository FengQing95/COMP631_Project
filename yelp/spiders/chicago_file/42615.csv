Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The patatas bravas, baked goat cheese, potatoes in garlic aioli, short rib pinxto, mushroom croquette, and grilled calamari are so freakin' amazing. We usually double up orders of these because we can't get enough. They have happy hour specials from 4-6 and the portions are slightly smaller, but you can hardly tell.
