Little Goat Diner////I was excited to try Little Goat yesterday because I loved Girl & The Goat. I knew Little Goat was more like reinvented diner food but I wasn't expecting the disgusting combinations of flavors. While perusing the menu, I didn't see anything that sounded remotely appetizing, so I ordered something that sounded safe, Kalbi Beef Ribs with dirty rice and fried onions. Boy was I wrong! The ribs themselves tasted fine but the rice was disgusting! It was like they tried to bread and deep fry the rice. I was so disappointed with my meal. After quickly eating my entree just to get it over with, I ordered the cookie pie with vanilla ice cream for dessert, hoping to rid myself of the horrible taste of my dinner. The cookie pie was good, what's not like about a warm chocolate chip cookie topped with ice cream?
