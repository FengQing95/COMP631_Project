Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////-The "Classic":  oh, hellllllo you sausage-y goodness, you.  This Classic was jacked up on lean sausage, tomater sauce, and lots o'  cheese.  This pizza was perfect.  Probably due to the leanness of the sausage, the sausage actually had a good bite to it. Still perfect and I'd order this baby up again!
