Smoque BBQ////he second time I had it, my family who lives 3 blocks away from there and heard the great reviews on it decided to order it for Christmas dinner. Â I thought hey why not lets give it another try. We called to place an order but they weren't going to be open Christmas eve so we ended up buying frozen ribs from them to try to warm them up at home. BIG MISTAKE. the already "ok" ribs were now awful tasting , to say the least it was not a happy Christmas.
