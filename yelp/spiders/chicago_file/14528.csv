Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Grew up on Pizzeria Uno via Philly; however, always wanted to go to Chicago and sample the best there is. Lou's is definitely it! Waited 30 minutes on a Fri night at 6pm, then waited another 30 mins once I ordered. Well worth the wait!! Their deep dish pizza with sausage and the butter crust is the absolute bomb!!! Can't wait to return!!!
