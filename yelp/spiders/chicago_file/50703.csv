Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////THE BEST SPANISH TAPAS IN THE WORLD (never been to Spain so I'm not an expert but take my word for it). Came here with friends (get a reservation the line can be long) and were seated in about 10 minutes. The sangria is on tap here and is amazing and honestly everything on the menu is 10/10. The bacon wrapped dates will definitely be a part of my last meal on earth. Obviously you have to get the baked goat cheese in tomato sauce and bread. The paella is also spot on and the portion is huge so definitely keep that in mind if you're ordering tapas as well. One of my favorite places in Chicago and the prices are very reasonable.
