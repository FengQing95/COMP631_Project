Art Institute of Chicago////I wasn't very impressed with the Chinese/Korean/Asian section, but perhaps I've been spoiled by the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco. You can't really compare an entire museum on Asian art and artifacts with just a section in a regular art museum, so I guess AIC did the best with what they had. It was alright.
