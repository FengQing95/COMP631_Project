Little Goat Diner////I ordered the peanut butter butter and bacon waffles while my sister ordered the fried chicken French toast. The bacon was a little too greasy for my taste, but the waffles were great with the peanut butter. I'd probably definitely order this again. My sister likes the French toast but she was a little thrown off by the combination of the strawberries and chicken and the fact that the eggs were fried inside the bread. Nevertheless she loved it.
