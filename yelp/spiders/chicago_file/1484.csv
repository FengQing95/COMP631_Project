Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Probably my FAVORITE breakfast spot in Chicago...I have been here a handful of times and it's always pleasant. It's a big place and always packed. Even when I arrived at 8:35am on Saturday, they were already on a 45-minute wait! Worth it though. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge. I ordered a skillet which came with pancakes so it definitely satisfied my savory and sweet cravings. Our server was also super friendly and attentive, despite the place being so busy. I always appreciate friendly staff. Thanks for the good experience!
