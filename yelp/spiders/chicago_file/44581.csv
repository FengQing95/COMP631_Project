Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////All the food was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and arrived at our table right on time. My mom daringly tried the grilled octopus and loved it! (as did I). The sangria was delicious and the smaller-sized desserts (like the champagne, also on the house) turned out to be perfectly portioned by virtue of having such rich flavor.
