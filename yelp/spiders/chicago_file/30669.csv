Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The service was really good! I didn't catch our servers name but he was the young guy with glasses. Super nice, always checked up on us, and he was just easy to talk to! Felt like he was a friend. I'm not sure if i'd come back for the pizza but i'd come back for the wings anytime. Matter of fact i want some right now!
