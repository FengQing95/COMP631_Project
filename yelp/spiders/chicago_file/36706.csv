Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were early so hung out at the bar and then were seating exactly at our reservation time. Loved the drinks (had ol fashioned), girl friend (wife, but is a gf when we go out) had the Malbec. The side dishes; crab cake mushrooms and brussel sprouts were amazing, especially the crab cake.
