Smoque BBQ////Very impressive.  I think that the sauce just may be the best I've ever had.   I've been around the chicago bbq circuit and have to say that Smoque is the best yet.  I ordered a half slab of baby back's, mac and cheese, and fries.  I like the fact that the coleslaw is made without mayo as well.
