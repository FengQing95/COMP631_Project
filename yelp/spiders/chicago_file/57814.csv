Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I mostly stuck with breakfast items. I liked the egg and potato small bite I had. The French toast stick bite and deviled egg were just ok. The Nutella waffle was good but I was pretty full by the time I got it (it came very late but the waitress apologized). I did not care for the chicken waffle stick, it was like a corn dog with chicken sausage, gross in my opinion! I checked in for a free dessert which I appreciate however my dessert was awful!!! It was passion fruit sorbet and it was soooo sour that it wasn't even edible and I'm not one to pass up dessert. I don't know how anyone could ever eat that, I think it was a poor choice by the restaurant.
