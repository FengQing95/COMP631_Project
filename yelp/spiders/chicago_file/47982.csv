Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We've been here twice, and both times we really enjoyed ourselves. We lived nearby at one point and noticed that sometimes this place is dead, and other times it is packed full even though there is a ton of seating. The tapas we had were tasty and reasonably price. The second visit was probably better than the first because we listened to our waiter's recommendations which served us well. I have friends who think it's over priced and overhyped, but I did not feel that way at all. I've travelled extensively in Spain and nothing can compare with fresh seafood tapas in Barcelona or Jamon Iberico platters in Madrid, but this does a pretty good job for what it is and where it is, and for how much we ate and drank, it didn't break the bank. Probably not a place we will take out of town visitors who want to experience the best of Chicago, but it's a fun spot to get some tasty bites and a drink on a Friday night.
