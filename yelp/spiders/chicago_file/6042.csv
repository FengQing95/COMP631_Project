The Purple Pig////I have had many people tell how good this place is so I had to try it. We were lucky enough to get a kitchen table  where the cooks are cooking directly in front of you. Ordered the grilled octopus and ribs. The food was tasty but way too much salt for my liking. I thought it was just me but the people I went with thought the same of the food they ordered.  Ease off the salt and the 3 star would be a 4.
