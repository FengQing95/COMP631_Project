Little Goat Diner////Good upscale diner in west loop that has a twist on traditional diner food. Service is on point and menu items are creative and tasty.  This is one of Stephanie Izard's restaurant group so you know it is worth checking out. It is attached to Little Goat Bakery that serves coffee, shakes, and some pastries.  There is a private upstairs patio dining area that can be reserved.  The food is quality, always made to order with the freshest ingredients.
