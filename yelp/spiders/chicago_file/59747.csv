Smoque BBQ////I had a pulled pork platter, which came with an ample amount of pork. an extra side of sauce and 'slaw and 2 sides. The slaw was okay, but you may find that the two sides are a bit smaller than you may think. I had the mac and cheese, and the cornbread. Both were excellent, but a bit undersized considering you just forked over about 2 Lincolns.
