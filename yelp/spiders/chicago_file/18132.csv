Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is the second time I have come to eat at Lou Malnatti's restaurant and once again it didn't disappoint. Their deep dish pizza is hands-down the best I've ever had. The crust is buttery an amazing, the sauce is zesty and delicious but the best part of the whole pizza is the tomatoes that they use on top.
