Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was my mom's first time to Chicago, and we knew deep-dish had to be part of the agenda. I had been to Gino's East before, but thought maybe I'd try another of the popular joints. This wasn't too far from our hotel, so my mom and I dropped by for lunch. We ended up waiting about 15-20 minutes, so not bad. In fact, you can pre-order your pizza at a counter so that it's baking while you're waiting/getting seated. I was STILL in line when we actually were seated, so I didn't even get to put in my order.
