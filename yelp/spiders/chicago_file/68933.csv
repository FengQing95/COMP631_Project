Little Goat Diner////The food is good. The service lacks. We informed our waitress that this is our first time here. She encouraged us to order sides with every one of our five meals. The sides are enormous! One side can easily be shared by 3 people. Instead we ended up with 5 sides for each person in our party, including children. We walked out with bags of expensive leftovers, which we kept in the car all day as we were spending the day out and about. Mimosas were not served in champagne flutes. Not the special feeling we were hoping for.
