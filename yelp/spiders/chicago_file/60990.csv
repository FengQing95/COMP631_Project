Smoque BBQ////Went here for a buddy's birthday after we found out Rockit was closed for renovations. As far as appearances go, it has the same feel all other "legit" BBQ places I have been. Transient seating, old school vinyl flooring, and that smell! The smoke you smell a block away. The smoke that smacks you in the face when you walk in the door. There is no doubt you are in a place that takes BBQ seriously. They don't really have a "combo" platter, but you can order your main meat meal and then add on "tastes" of the other meats available. I had ribs, brisket, and sausage. They were out of pork by the time we arrived.I am a fan and I will be back! For sure I need to try the pork!
