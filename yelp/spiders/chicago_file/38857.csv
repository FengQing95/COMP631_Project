Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Loved the atmosphere of this place! Dark with just the right amount of lighting. Like restoration hardware designed it. Spacious for the patrons. Their menu was the perfect balance of unique with steakhouse staples like wedge salad. They have a cocktail and spirits menu that is pretty impressive.
