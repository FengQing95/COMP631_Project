Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Now to the food, we started with the duck and goat cheese terrine which was amazing with plenty of bread and apricot mustard to top off to offer a sweet and vinegar flavor.  I ended up with the 10oz filet and we shared the elotes and brussels sprouts.  I found myself savoring every bite.  I will go out on a limb and even state that it was one of the finest dining and steak experiences I have ever had.  This is a must have if you're in Chicago.
