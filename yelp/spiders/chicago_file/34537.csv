Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We arrived about 30 mins before our reservation and had a couple of cocktails. We got seated and ordered the baked goat cheese - very interesting and very good! Â We bother ordered the Chicago Ribeye which was cooked to perfection. We ordered the sweet potatoes and corn for sides.
