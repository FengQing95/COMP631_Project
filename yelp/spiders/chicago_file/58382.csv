Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The restaurant is located in North Chicago - it was a bit far away from Chicago downtown.  Very friendly and cozy atmosphere with plenty of dining table options to cover any size of party.  The lighting was perfect in the morning with enough natural light coming in to sit back and enjoy our talk with great foods an drink.  On the table, there were many small plates stacking all the way up - that's the tapas style!
