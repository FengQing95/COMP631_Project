Art Institute of Chicago////This is my favorite museum of all time. I have a burning passion for art, so my family took me there for my birthday. Never before in my life have I seen such a beautiful and wide array of art! It provides a relaxing atmosphere which is excellent for the appreciation of art. The little food court they had amazing food, and needless to say, I was surprised. I strongly recommend this museum.
