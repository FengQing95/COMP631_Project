Little Goat Diner////- "Medium rare only": This was truly bizarre. I ordered the skirt steak and asked for it to be done medium, but was told the kitchen does medium rare and does not like to change this (? why is this the case?). Waitress said she would check with the kitchen and let me know before ordering anything. She didn't come back so I assumed everything was ok. Got my dish and of course, medium rare. It seems like this chef cooks for the kitchen and not the customer who is actually eating.
