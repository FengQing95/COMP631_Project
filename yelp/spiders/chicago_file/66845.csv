Little Goat Diner////I'm giving it 4 stars because the food was outstanding. I would really like to give it 3 stars for the hostess stand/wait time. The food: I had the Los Drowned sandwich and it was awesome. All the flavors just worked. It's huge so I only ate half and took the other half home (husband was lucky enough to get it for his lunch today). My husband had a patty melt which he said was one of the best he has had in a long time. My cousin had the Parathas Burrito which was also so good! We all shared an order of the smoked fries. I would recommend all the dishes we ordered and would get them again.
