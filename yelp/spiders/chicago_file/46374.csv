Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////New friends, great food, and a couple of pitchers of Sangria and you realize why you should always, ALWAYS rally despite how tired you may be. Life's never going to wait for you, so if you don't get out there and live it, you're going to miss out on wonderful new people who can only enrich your future in every sense.
