Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A few friends and I hosted another friend's bachelorette party dinner here. It was beyond amazing. I knew from visiting before that the food would be delicious. The service and space was over the top. We felt like we were still part of the "crowd" that is the atmosphere at the restaurant, while still having an intimate setting for everyone to enjoy their meal. All of the food is good. I can't just name one thing. I typically get the chicken and ham croquettas, the mushrooms and the potatas. I would also recommend the brussel sprout salad and the meatballs.
