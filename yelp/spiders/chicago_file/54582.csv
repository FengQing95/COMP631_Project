Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love Tapas! The place looks small from the outside, but its huge once you get in. Â We came here for Restaurant week, but the R week menu was pretty lame so we just ordered off the regular menu. It was Sunday brunch, and there was a Bloody Mary bar which was pretty cool. The bacon wrapped dates were my fave, followed by the patatas bravas, that orange chipotle mayo is to die for. The jamon eggs benedict was surprisingly good. I would pass on the hanger steak it had a weird after taste. We finished the meal off with some French toast with jam and goat cheese, not too sweet and a great savory dessert. Overall great tapas, great brunch!
