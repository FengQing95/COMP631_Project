Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place was packed on a Wednesday night, with a wait of ~45 minutes around 8pm.  Had the Lou's special (mushrooms, spinach, tomatos) & fried calamari (mediocre).  To be honest, I'm not sure this is the best deep dish in Chicago but Lou's is an institution nonetheless.  This location is on a surprisingly quiet block of River North, nice for al fresco dining.
