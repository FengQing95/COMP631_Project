Art Institute of Chicago////The museum has a cool, modern, and quite ambience.  There is a free admission day which encourages more people to go.  It is very clean and the noise level is quite low.  It is located in the middle of downtown, so it is easy to access wherever you are coming from.  The coat check is only a buck.
