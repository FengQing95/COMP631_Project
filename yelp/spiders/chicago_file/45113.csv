Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went back this past Saturday with two girlfriends and had a great time from start to finish. I particularly enjoyed my mango sangria (their special sangria of the day) and the steak special with the green butter, which was very rich and satisfying. But the breakout performer had to be their chocolate truffle cake. The three of us split it and it was the perfect finish to the meal (and under $3!).
