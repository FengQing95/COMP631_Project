Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////By far the best pizza in Chicago! Literally my first stop when I arrive into Chicago! All of the pizzas are fabulous but I suggest eating at the restaurant! I have done delivery but fresh at the restaurant is the best experience! Also- since I live in San Francisco.... I have ordered Lou's through Tastes of Chicago! So fabulous and a fun gift to send to those also missing Lou's!
