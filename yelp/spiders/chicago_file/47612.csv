Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Three stars because we waited over three hours to get a table despite calling to put our name on their list at six on a Friday night - the food was good but it wasn't THAT good! If you can get in without waiting so long I recommend the sangria and their carrots with dill sauce (though that was a special the night I went so they may not be offering it).
