Little Goat Diner////I have been here several times. The salads are very good. More recently I had a bim bim bop bowl with riced cauliflower and pickled onions. It was a different take on bim bim bop with much different flavors than I'm used to but I actually enjoyed it and would definitely order it again. Service has been good on all of my visits. It's a good lunch place. They have valet which is great but that combined with the prices of the meals makes for a pricy lunch outing so I don't frequent the restaurant as much as I would if parking was free or street parking was more accessible .
