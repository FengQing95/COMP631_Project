Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Wait is a little longer than stated, add about 15 mins. You can preorder prior to seating but it ended up failing for us because the order got mixed up and a small ended up elsewhere n had to be remade. 75 mins later, I got it. Waitress was nice n gave us a snack to eat so I can't complain much. She was great and I appreciated her honesty.
