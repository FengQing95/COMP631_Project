Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now the long wait begins... it took over 45 minutes to an hour for our pizza to arrive at our table. The waitress said it was due to the size and because they wanted to make sure the sausage was cooked thoroughly. Now, the sausage is not the usual small pieces you get at your regular pizza places but large, slices of sausage. I'm not usually a fan of sausage, but their blend of sausage and seasoning sure makes this kind pretty tasty. You really do get your bang for your buck here.
