Smoque BBQ////The ribs seemed kind of small to me, but they were cooked really well. Tender meat, not fall off the bone, but giving to a little pull. Â The sausage was delicious, nice bit of spice. All the meats had a great flavor on their own, but I really liked the BBQ sauce, peppery and tangy, I also loved dipping my fries in it.
