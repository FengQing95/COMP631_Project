Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Everything was excellent! From the service to the food. The food came out quick. I got the eggs Benedict with spinach instead of meat... So tasty!! Not to mention big plate! The service was really good too which is important. This will be my go to breakfast place next time I visit Chicago.
