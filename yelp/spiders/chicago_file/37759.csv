Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Old Fashioneds - at the time I went I had just "discovered" them.  I had 3, which is probably unwise but they are still to date the best I've ever had.  Not to sweet, not too strong, warm and round and sweet and perfect. (Rye was my favorite). At the time, I had a friend who was very into OF's, and I kept telling him we had to go and throw down a few on me - sadly, we never went :(
