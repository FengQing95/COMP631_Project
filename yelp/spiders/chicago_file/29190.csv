Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We went on a very busy Friday Afternoon and had about a 20 minute wait. However that was great as they had a smooth process where you preorder your pizza and by the time you sat down you had salad, appetizer and pizza almost boom boom boom ready. Our waiter was awesome and very patient with all our questions and requests for more and more food. It was delicious and I can't wait to go back!!
