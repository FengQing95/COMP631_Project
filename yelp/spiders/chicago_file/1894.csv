Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Came her on a raining and chilling morning and waited for an hour before we got our table, but I have to say this is the BEST pancake and cafe place i've ever tried. I ordered their signature pancake and a caramel latte, taste fantastic! I usually can't finish a big pancake but the signature berry pancake is so delicious that i don't think anyone will have leftovers. My friend got a Denver skillet and it tastes good too. Their berry latte is something to new and it became my favorite after i tried. Will definitely recommend this place. Make sure you get time to wait tho, it is always full of people and there's always a line waiting.
