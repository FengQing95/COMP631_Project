The Purple Pig////I had the good fortune of sitting at the kitchen counter at The Purple Pig this evening. It was buzzing with activity from start to finish. Everything looked and smelled amazing! We had trouble narrowing in on what to order. We finally decided to get the corn risotto, the pork shoulder, and the huevos. It was all delicious. The flavors were complex yet complementary. I savored every bite.
