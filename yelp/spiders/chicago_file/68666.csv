Little Goat Diner////Met a friend here for lunch (we had a reservation so no wait). I don't like cheese, the least of all cheddar. But the "The Little Piggy Went To China" was strongly suggested so I gave it a try and was not disappointed. Pleasantly surprised that the cheddar biscuits didn't curb my appetite. I also had a "Scotch in the Morning" cocktail that was pretty tasty as well. Good job guys, good job.
