Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service deserves a better rating, but I can't get over my disappointment with the food. My server was pretty damn good. Save the end of the meal where he was a bit too insistent on our purchasing dessert. He coursed our meal exactly the right way even though we didn't tell him anything when we placed our orders. Also, the mini-churros were awesome. The bussers were great with refilling our water. The food runner, however, was very unclear with announcing our dishes, and kind of threw them onto our table.
