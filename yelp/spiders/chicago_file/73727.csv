Little Goat Diner////The service was great, our server really knew the menu and was ready to recommend something from any part of the menu. We stared with the pizza bread, I could not get enough of the stewed tomato sauce. For entrees, two of us got the veggie burger and I got the Korean burger. The veggie burger patty had identifiable veggies, which we loved, though the patties had a little trouble staying together, but they were very flavorful! Â The Korean burger was amazing, the egg was cooked perfectly and really reminded me of a Bim Bop! Next time, I'd go with the beef or chicken patty over the goat though, I felt that the goat patty took away from the overall burger.
