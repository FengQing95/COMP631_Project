The Purple Pig////We came in around 3 or 4 so right before dinner, but after the lunch crowd left on a Monday so it was easy to get seated (apparently it's difficult on weekends and such). We were asked if we wanted to sit inside or the heated patio area and we decided on the inside, since the bf didn't bring a jacket or coat (amateurs from Texas hello!). We were seated right away and brought waters. The busboys has Purple Pig shirts, but the waiters and waitresses just wear regular clothes with an apron, but for some reason they (waiters and waitresses) all look like managers or something...they're all dressed well (I know random lol).
