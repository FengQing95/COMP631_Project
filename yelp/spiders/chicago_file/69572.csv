Little Goat Diner////Anyway, I asked for a sandwich rec at the counter, and was recommended The Shrimp because "it changed my life." I ordered the sandwich and a hot chocolate to go and was planning to wait until actual lunchtime to eat, but the sandwich just looked too good. However, it will hold up for awhile if you need to transport your lunch! I was in and out of the shop in about 10 minutes, and I took my time.
