Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Unfortunately Chicago is light on real breakfast options. Wildberry has an extremely long wait and I'm not sure why. Yes the portions are huge, you get a free side of pancakes and it's all cheap. But if it isn't great quality then who cares? Evidently a lot of people do and if that's what you value then go for it!
