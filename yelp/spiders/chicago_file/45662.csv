Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas is awesome, and Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba offers a really nice experience.  The food is very good, but the best tapas I've ever had (Emilio's) but it's very good.  They have a new single bite menu that's really awesome, it offers super rich tastes of really delicious food (like the Spanish brownie which might be one of my top 10 favorite things I've ever tasted).
