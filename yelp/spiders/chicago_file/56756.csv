Smoque BBQ////Went on a Saturday afternoon after seeing this place on 2 TV shows.  Bad idea to go then.  The line was out the door!  We could hear everyone talking "I saw it on this show, I saw it on that show."  We wait in line for honestly 30 minutes.  Oh, and they have a sign on the door saying they are out of one type of rib.
