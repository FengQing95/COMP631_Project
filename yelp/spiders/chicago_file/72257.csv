Little Goat Diner////This is really elevated diner food.  Casual, retro setting, with mid-century feel.  There is an attention to detail that is relaxing and smile-inducing.  Service is friendly and the coffee is good.  We came for breakfast and were informed that the entire menu, breakfast-lunch-dinner, is available.  Cocktails too - a really nice selection of craft cocktails - alas, it was just too early on a Sunday morning for that.
