Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The 40 minute wait (felt like less honestly) for this deep dish "The Lou" pizza was SO WORTH IT! Incredibly delicious, well-cooked, fresh ingredients. We also had calamari for an appetizer and it was also spectacular. I have to come back next time I am in town. Beautiful inside, too.
