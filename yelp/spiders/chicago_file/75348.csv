Little Goat Diner////Went here for Brunch with a couple of friends. I liked this place but I didn't think it was anything special. They've got your normal standard American fare as well as some Asian fusion dishes that I didn't think were great. In a city with so many great options for food, I didn't find anything special in this place.
