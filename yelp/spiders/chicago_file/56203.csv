Smoque BBQ////Picked up some brisket and a half slab of the St. Louis style ribs a week ago.  I think the brisket was great again.  I actually thought it was better than the other 10 times I have gotten it from there.  It did not have much of a smoke ring but it was so tender you could cut it with a spoon.
