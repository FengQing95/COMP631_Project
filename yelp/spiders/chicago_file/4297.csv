The Purple Pig////Outstanding dishes ! We had the best salad. Delightful. Would have never paired beets and peanut butter/sauce, but it was a great combo. The heirloom tomato salad was the very best salad I have had in a long while. Sweet grapes, pear with great tomatoes in a perfectly balanced vinegarette chilled to perfection. The papperdelle pasta was fresh and delicate.
