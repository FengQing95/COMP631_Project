Little Goat Diner////Out of this world fried chicken....need I say more? When you're looking something more casual on Randolph, this a great place to enjoy a laid-back meal. With only two weeks of summer before my teaching schedules starts full-swing, my friend and I came down to the West Loop with no particular destination in mind. Parking is definitely more successful toward Madison and we lucked out. Our stroll around the neighborhood brought us to deciding between De Cero and The Little Goat Diner. After skimming the menu and spotting the reuben sandwich, we didn't even think twice. My friend ordered the Reuben, a grapefruit mimosa, and smoked fries, while I ordered a cider and the fried chicken. Wowza. The Reuben was scrumptious with the perfect balance of oozing cheese, toasted rye, and kimchi in place of sauerkraut (close cousin with a little more hear) to cut through the richness of the sandwich. My fried chicken included a breast, drumstick, and wing. I have no idea how long they let the chicken sit in what I'm guessing buttermilk with tabasco, but this chicken was fall off the bone, moist with this amazing crunch on the outside. The only thing left was bones. It did come with a slaw on the side, that I didn't care too much for (the flavor was on the blander side) but it had these delicious fried onions on top, which I picked off. I will be back for my fried chicken fix!
