Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After several beers I walked in on a Saturday night, and not surprisingly was met with a large crowd.  However, they're obviously used to it, and had a system to keep things moving.  Name on a wait-list, menu to review, spot to pre-order the pizza, and a bar to grab a drink at while waiting to be called (the bar could be bigger, but it is what it is).
