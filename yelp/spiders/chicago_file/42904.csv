Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ambience is lively, service is generally good though we have had some issues with undercooked paella (which took an extra 20 minutes to cook...not great when you are dining with a toddler) and items left off of our order. Servers are always friendly, and the hostesses are very sweet.
