Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My fillet also had great flavor and I got it with the roasted garlic - AMAZING! The knife cut it like butter and having it cooked medium rare was perfect for me. The dry age steak had a great flavor as well and was fatty and delicious. Bavette's has pretty generous portions in general so we had a hard time finishing our food.
