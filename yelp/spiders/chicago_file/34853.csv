Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is a regular hang out for one of my BFF's and I.  We go there when he comes into town and it's now kind of our spot.  The first time I had a meal there I was thoroughly impressed for a few reasons:  Firstly, I don't eat a lot of meat, dairy or bread/wheat.  I'll eat these things every once in a while, but they're certainly not everyday items on my menu and I prefer not to indulge.  I found that for a steak house, Bavette's was surprisingly easy to order in.  I could order the food that felt good to me and not feel like a missed something amazing (although I'm sure I did).  I appreciate that.  Secondly, Bavette's (especially the downstairs bar and dining area) is beautiful.  It's one of those places that makes you feel sexy, flirty, and like playing footsie under the table (not that I did).
