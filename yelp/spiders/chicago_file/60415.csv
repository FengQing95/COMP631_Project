Smoque BBQ////- The layout of the restaurant seems problematic though.  The arrangement of the line, the drinks, the food pickup, and the layout of the tables seems poor.  You have to go all over the place and through lots of people if it's crowded.  There's no logic or flow to it.  I didn't have the problem since there was hardly anyone there when I went, but I'd bet it's pretty chaotic when there's actually a bit of a crowd.  However, I realize that they might be doing the best they can with the space they have to work with so, if that's true, you can't fault them too much.
