Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Similar wait times as Giordano's. But one big difference, at Giordano's they call out ur name looking for you. And if u don't hear them or miss them, ur screwed. That is what happened to one couple when we got to Giordano's. But at Lou's, they use technology. They get ur number so that when ure next, u get both a call and a text that ur table is ready. Easy for them, easy for me. No need to worry about whether or not u missed ur name being called like that on couple at Giordano's.
