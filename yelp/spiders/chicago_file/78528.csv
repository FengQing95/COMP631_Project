Little Goat Diner////My wife's French toast was also very tasty. A sweet & savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling.
