Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Had done reservations through Yelp and it was great not have to wait for a table. They have Sangria on tap! The sangrias were great - get a pitcher - it is good value and you know you are going to finish it :). If you are a veggie lover, try the Brussels sprout salad. Bread is good and fun atmosphere. Highly recommended!
