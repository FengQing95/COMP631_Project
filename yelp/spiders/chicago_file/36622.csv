Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I am a foodie and have written a plethora of steak house reviews.  I once went on a 10 day steakhouse romp through the heart of Vegas and Los Angeles trying the same dish at every steak house to compare the nuances.  Those were the best times of my life but got me steaked out for a year.  Now that I've come to my senses, I decided to expand my borders to the east side of the US and Chicago was my culinary target.  Having tried 2 other steak houses in the area, I wasn't sure what to make of such high ratings here at Bavettes.
