Little Goat Diner////For my meal, I ordered The Fat Club and got Smoked Fries with ranch on the side. The fat club is exactly what you'd think it would be, a HUGE club sandwhich with ton more than a standard club on it. I'm a 250lb athlete with an appetite, and I could only eat half of it. The fries were amazing (even though Taylor ate half of them! but that's love I guess). Â
