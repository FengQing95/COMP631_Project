Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service is great, their cocktail and ice program are excellent. You can really see the European influence with all the lillet and other spirits used. I had a Lillet rose martini, an old fashioned and a paper plane. For the heck of it I actually bought a coors banquet. Small beer selection of decent offerings mixed with crap domestic. It's actually not so bad after having eaten and drank such rich, dense and opulent flavors to cleanse the pallet a bit. I was happy to see red breast and the 16 yo laga available. I wasn't a fan of the stirred cocktail charge of $2. They use crystal clear cocktail ice which I've got down to a science at home and knowing how much extra work it is, makes you appreciate the added enhancement it adds to cocktails.
