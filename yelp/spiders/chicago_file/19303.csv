Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As far as I'm concerned, the BEST deep dish pizza in Chicago! This place came recommended by my brother and friend and it was WELL worth the 50 minute wait to get a table! I will say that I have not yet tried Giordano's but this place blows Gino's East out of the water.  I liked how we got to pre-order our pizza so when we sat down, they'd cook it the rest of the way and save us some time. My friend also suggested I should try to Malnati salad which was pretty darn tasty! It had mushrooms, bacon bits, gorgonzola cheese all wrapped in some mildly sweet dressing goodness! The wait staff was friendly and quick and everyone (including the customers waiting) seemed happy to be there.
