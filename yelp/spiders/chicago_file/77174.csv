Little Goat Diner////Overall, the food is great with a sense of creativity that's unique to Stephanie Izard. The service was fast and pleasant. My friends enjoyed themselves too. Everything was a perfect from start to finish. Based on this visit, I hope to make time for Girl and the Goat during my next visit to Chi town.
