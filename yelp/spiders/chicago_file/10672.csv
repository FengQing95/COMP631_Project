Art Institute of Chicago////So, I've been to a lot of museums. I am actually a huge loser and LOVE culture and history and art and all of that nonsense. You could leave me at this museum for hours by myself, and I would be totally fine. I spent about 4 hours here, and didn't even get to the third floor.
