Smoque BBQ////So identity and authenticity?  Yeah, i've got a major bone to pick (no pun intended) with Smoque's whole business plan.  I don't know about yourself, but Barbecue to me is the embodiment of cultural identities throughout America.  It is localized and unique to each state, town, neighborhood and family.  It is something that tells a story and encapsulates a particular history and identity of many people(s).  Call me crazy, but i'm just not getting that sort of atmosphere out of Smoque.  To me, it is a truly Anglicized version of "barbecue."  I mean, I really feel like the place and the food is very much contrived.  From the perfect little macaroni tins to the campy metal plate that you're served on, this place is on it's way to becoming Famous Dave's and propped up in every strip mall in Schaumberg.  It's not that the food is bad, but it's the homogenizing of barbecue into one spot.  Don't get me wrong, you can get Carolina style in Chicago.  Except that the owner was originally born in South Carolina, they moved to Chicago and brought all of their recipes and traditions with them.  You see where i'm going?  Texas, St. Louis, Chicago, and Carolina styles all under one roof?  It's just not right like it should be.
