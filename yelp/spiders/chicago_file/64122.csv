Smoque BBQ////The sliced brisket rivals any of the BBQ places that I've eaten at, and I've spent time in both South Carolina and Kansas City.  The smoked chicken has great flavor as well, and begs to be eaten without sauce to experience the full flavor of the pit.  The portion sizes are large, as my wife and I usually get one sandwich and a platter so that we can split the sides. I enjoy the Memphis style BBQ sauce, and don't care much for the Carolina style that they serve with their dishes, but it ultimately comes down to personal preference there.
