Smoque BBQ////Walking next door (and trying to reclaim some cool), I finally entered Smoque.  There were a decent amount of people sitting but still some empty tables.  I sauntered up to the register, ordered a pulled pork sandwich with slaw and fries and a soda.  With tax (hi Todd!), that was $10.14.  Not bad.  I went to the soda fountain, drew some SWEET TEA (the only non-alcoholic beverage to drink with bbq) and sat my happy self down.  Then I remembered I'd been on the CTA and I washed my hands in the restroom.  And used some towellettes.
