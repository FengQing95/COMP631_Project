Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I found this place thank to Yelp! it was everything I thought it was going to be and more. We flew into Chicago at 5am on Sunday. By the time we got here, it was open (that's a plus). We were seated right away. There were so many great choices it was hard to decide. Our waitress, she was great, helped us to find some of the items in the pictures we saw on here. I opted for the bliss berry crepes. AMAZING. it made me want to try the bliss berry pancakes. My husband got the corn beef has eggs benedict and a side of banana cream pancakes. Everything was really good. He loved the pancakes. He said the banana cream filling was amazing! We really wanted to eat here again before we left, but just never made it in time. But if we are every in the area, its a must stop. By the time we left, the wait was at least an 1!!!
