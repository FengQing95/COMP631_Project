Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Sunday morning, about 10:30, we had a 45 minute wait. Totally worth it. We ordered the Napa Valley Omelet and the Mexicano Skillet, both of which were amazing. I think we both preferred the skillets, but everything was soooo good! Really just depends on the mood that you're in. Can't go wrong with anything! Huge breakfasts, and lattes for $30. THANK YOU!
