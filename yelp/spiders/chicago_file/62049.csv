Smoque BBQ////I remember not only was the food delicious, but that the staff was kind and friendly.  I can't remember what happened - I think because we came right when they opened they didn't have one of their side dishes ready yet, so they gave us a different side for free and then made sure to bring out some of what we wanted once it was ready.  Great customer service!
