Smoque BBQ////I love this place.  My wife and I eat here all the time.  This last time I had the chopped brisket sandwich, mac & cheese, and bbq beans.  Everything was great as usual and the mac & cheese is probably the best I have ever had.  The only complaint for me would be the seating and the small portion size on the sides.  Although it is not like I ever leave hungry so I don't know what I am whining about.
