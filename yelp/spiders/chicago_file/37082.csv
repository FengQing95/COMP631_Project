Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I ordered a manhattan, which was made with Rittenhouse rye and executed perfectly...the ideal way to start a steak dinner. We started off with the wedge salad, which came strongly recommended by our bartender. I normally never order a wedge salad. It just seems too passe and more suited for a diner than a fancy steakhouse, but she insisted that it was a staff favorite. She couldn't have been more right! Just a delicious half of fresh, crispy iceberg lettuce drizzled with plenty of blue cheese and loads of bacon. The bacon was thick and more like crispy pork belly than bacon bits. Oh yeah and to top it off they add a soft boiled egg!...a delightful way to start your meal.
