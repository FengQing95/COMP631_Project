Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is just as old as some of the other joints, but their decor manages to be clean, rather than old and busted. Service is quick, and as always, keep in mind that deep-dish pizzas take 30-40 minutes to arrive...so don't waste any time choosing! Be sure to get the Malnati Chicago classic with sliced sausage that pretty much covers the entire pizza. You wont regret it!
