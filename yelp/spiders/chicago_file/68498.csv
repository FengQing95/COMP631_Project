Little Goat Diner////I've been here for brunch a few times and haven't been disappointed. There is usually a wait, but it hasn't been too bad. A big plus is that the kitchen is prepared to deal with food allergies (e.g. dairy.) In nicer weather, it's great to wait outside and people watch or grab a drink on the rooftop.
