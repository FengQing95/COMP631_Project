Little Goat Diner////We had reservations (I highly recommend that you make them) and were sat immediately in spite of a long waiting line.  I also encourage you to ask for the high back boothes where we sat because you can actually hear people in your party speaking.  This place is very, very noisy, making it quite hard to hear which is really the only drawback and why I gave it 4, not 5 starts.  If you sit in these high booths, that will take care of some of the noise issue.
