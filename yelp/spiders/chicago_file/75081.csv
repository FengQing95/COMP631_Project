Little Goat Diner////Not impressed . The food was good, service was nice, the restaurant decorations along with the coffee counter was excellent, and the restaurant's location was perfect... But still not impressed. I couldn't get past the ala carte menu style. In most brunch restaurants in the city such as yolk, most entrees come with your choice of hash browns or potatoes and pancakes/ toast/ English muffin. At this restaurant however you purchase everything separately. It seems like a cute concept & it allows one to try multiple dishes similar to a tapas restaurant however I think the idea just does not translate well to a restaurant that focuses on breakfast.
