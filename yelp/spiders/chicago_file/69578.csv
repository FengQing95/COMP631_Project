Little Goat Diner////For the entrees, I got the Pork Belly pancake and my husband go the Tonkatsu sandwich - sharing of course.  The pork belly pancake was delicious and perfectly seasoned.  The bok choy salad with it gave a nice fresh crunch and crisp to it.  The maple-ginger dressing tied everything together into one dish.  The Tonkatsu was also really good and is a definite repeat. The mayo/bbq dressing on it was perfect and it was really tasty on white bread.  With those, we split the smoked fries which were tasty and the smoke gives it something a little different.
