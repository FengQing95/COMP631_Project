Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is the Olive Garden of Chicago deep dish pizzas. We came with a big party - 12 people; we called 30 minutes ahead before arriving (we understand anywhere we go we are going to wait) but we also waited an additional hour and 30 minutes at the restaurant. The hostess advised that we could order ahead so our pizza would be ready once seated, so we did. Our food did not arrive till one hour after being seated. Once the food came it was okay- a bit undercooked still. I might be biased because I'm from New York but I was expecting at least some competition. They offer free cookies as compensation, the cookies were absolutely delicious, thank you manager.
