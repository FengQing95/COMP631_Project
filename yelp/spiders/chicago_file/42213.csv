Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A friend of mine recommended this place and it's definitely quite elegant but their portions are small even for tapas and the service is a bit slow. If you are going for a meal (ordering just tapas) don't bother because you don't get much for your money and you are better off ordering their paella which is decently priced. For sure this is a nice place to come for a date or turn down your hunger, but not very good if you are really hungry and need to fill up.
