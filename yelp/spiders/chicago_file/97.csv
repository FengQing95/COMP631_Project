Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////What an ideal place for indoor/outdoor brunch on a cozy morning. Like its location, and the food was quite good as well. I'm not a big fan of pancake, but their signature one is really good. The veggie omelette tastes a bit plain but acceptable. The mixed flavored lemonade is excellent!
