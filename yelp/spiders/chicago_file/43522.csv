Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had the chorizo and bacon wrapped dates, which were soooo good. I had never tried them, but I'm glad I did! The calamari was cooked well, it was crunchy but still tender. The garlic potato salad and the spicy potatoes were also tasty. I didn't try the chicken empanada, but I think my friends liked them...
