Smoque BBQ////Not really sure what the hype is about ... Must be because they were featured on Diners Drive Ins and Dives. I ordered the half slab of baby back ribs and my boyfriend got the brisket sandwich. Brisket was sparse, was half dry and had a chalky taste. My ribs were ok but the dry rub had no flavor. I've had better ribs at Popeyes in Lake Geneva! Won't be returning.
