Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Yummy Yummy Yummy!  Clean establishment.  Attentive waitstaff.  Went here for breakfast with the family while visiting Chicago - even though it was the middle of the week - it was extremely crowded.  We sat outside and were seated immediately as most people wanted to sit inside at that time.  Food came out pretty fast, the kids enjoyed waffles, omelettes and pancakes - lots of fruit and coffee as well.  Everything tasted really good.  A breakfast for 5 people will end up costing around $70 but we were full and didn't even have lunch that day!  Definitely recommend it for families - place is very kid-friendly.
