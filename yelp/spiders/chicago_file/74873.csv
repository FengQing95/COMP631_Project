Little Goat Diner////In terms of food, we started off with the goat chili which was absolutely delicious! Perfect for a cold winter day! My boyfriend ordered the patty melt which came with caramelized onions, a thin beef patty, cheese and a special sauce on two slices of toast. Definitely a worth while grilled cheese burger. I went with the los drowned, which is one of their top sellers. It's basically a sandwich with braised beef which I was not a fan of. The meet itself was too chewy.
