Smoque BBQ////Brisket is my only focus when heading into this meatopia. The sauce is not necessary b/c it's flavorful and definitely not dry...but adding a touch of the spicy bbq sauce does compliment it. Love the little guy with the white mustache. He adds something to the experience, gives great recommendations and got me hooked on the candied jalape√±os. Since it was on the Food Network, the lines are sometimes craaazy long... fortunately, it goes pretty fast. The seating is a bit packed & loud but who cares when you're feeding your face with meat!
