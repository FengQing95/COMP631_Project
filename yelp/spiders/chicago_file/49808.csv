Smoque BBQ////Not a fan....I've been here at least 5 times because of the reviews, my friends and all the good things you hear about this place all the time.  I want it to be good, I really do.  That's why I keep going back, but I think I've finally given up.  I've tried all the different meats.  I want to be part of the crowd that loves this place, I just can't seem to get into it.  The sauce is decent, but that's about all this place has going for it.  The ribs are never fall off the bone, the pulled pork needs the sauce, its dry and the brisket....nothing special.  Sorry all of you Smoque lovers out there, but it just doesn't work.   The bread for the sandwiches....nothing special, always seems likes it's on the stale side, the fries...blah.  I could go on, but you get the picture.
