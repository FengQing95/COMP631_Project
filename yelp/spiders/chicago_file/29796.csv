Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Recommended by a TON of folks, and they DID NOT DISAPPOINT! The pizza was freaking the BOMB!!! Explosion scene just happened, sorry y'all can't see it! Took roughly 33 min to get it, but it was fresh! We went with the Malnati and added pepperoni. We got a large, but for the 4 of us, a medium would've sufficed. Our pre-game consisted of bruschetta and mozzarella sticks, both held their own! For the grand finale, we got the baked cookie! (Free if you ride the big bus) - it was very good.
