Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I all of the sudden forgave them all for the confusion that we endured after my first bite of this perfect salad. It's so perfectly balanced. Then the calamari...they are delicious, not rubbery fried to perfection. But what's even better is that sauceeeeee....it's marinara with cocktail sauce...STOP AND BEHOLD! This is the sauce of sauces...I wanted to drink it! So here I am so happy thinking can it really get better than this....&
