Smoque BBQ////Smoque served up some delicious briskets.  I got the brisket platter (half chopped, half sliced), cornbread, and peach cobbler with a taste of Texas sausage.  OMG!  The savory brisket melts in your mouth, especially the sliced brisket.  I much prefer the sliced over the chopped brisket.  The Texas Sausage was a little spicy and was perfectly grilled.  The peach cobbler, oh peach cobbler... was fantastic!  Sweet and sour and crunchy...  The flavors and texture just blends together so well in your mouth.  The cole slaw was good as well.  I like that it's not a creamy slaw (although I like that too).  But it's good the way they make it here!
