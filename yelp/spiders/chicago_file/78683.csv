Little Goat Diner////I had a great experience here. We came for a lunch date and were thrilled when they were able to squeeze us in. The staff was all super friendly and bubbly and were quick to welcome us and explain specials. I was most excited for the okonomiyaki, because it's not something that I come across often (unfortunate, since it's one of my favorites). It was everything I wanted and more. It was well cooked, well seasoned, and a good blend of salty and savory with just a hint of sweetness. My partner had whatever omelette was on special and didn't say much about it because they were too busy enjoying it, so I think that's a good sign!
