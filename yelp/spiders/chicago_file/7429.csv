Art Institute of Chicago////This place is just amazing, the works are priceless and the layout is chill and there is lots of room to move around. We went on a Friday and it was not very busy, which was nice. There is no possible way you can see and take in everything in the institute in one trip... maybe if you have the stamina of those people that compete on Ninja Warrior.
