Little Goat Diner////We made a special trip to the west loop for lunch at Little Goat Diner, and it was so worth it! It was crowded and loud inside, so we were happy to get a table outside.  I had the parathas burrito which was unusual and tasty- two fried eggs were tucked into the delicious Indian flat bread.  The bread was thin and sort of grilled so the outside was crispy. It's topped with some greens, red beans, and a just a hint of spicy sauce. I loved it. I also tasted the shrimp and grits which were great - delicate and deep in flavor, it was really well executed. We had the pork belly home fries which was good and a chocolate malt shake which was also good. The portion sizes are hearty, so the fries and shake were a bit over the top. I totally recommend this place for friendly service and yummy food!
