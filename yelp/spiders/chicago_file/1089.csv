Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////When I was in college, this was my spot! I would recommend all of my friends to come here and try out their lattes. Wildberry's food was not only tasty, but also very generous in proportion size. For the price, I feel as though they took really good care of me and I was very very satisfied with every experience I had here. Though the wait was quite long at some points, it was well worth the time. I can't wait to visit Chicago in the future and come back! :) 5 stars from this girl.
