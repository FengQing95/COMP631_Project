Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered six tapas and loved each and everyone. From the veggies and appetizer section we had the Brussel sprout salad and the spicy potatoes. I preferred the Brussel sprout salad because it was so finely chopped, lightly drizzled with oil and enhanced with sweet almonds. My partner preferred the spicy potatoes with the spicy tomato aioli. It was a perfect split for the two of us, but we enjoyed both! From the beef section we ordered the short rib and we ordered the fried calamari from the seafood section. The short rib was decadent, flavorful and heavenly tender. I could have eaten five of them, they were so good. The fried calamari were also good, but the mixture of the red Fresca salsa and cream sauce was the highlight of the dish! From the pork menu we ordered the assortment of cured pork meats and olives as well as the dates wrapped in bacon. The cured meats were a great starter and way to try some of the restaurants house cured meats. The dates, however, were my favorite dish. Paired with a sweet vinaigrette and apples, it was simply to die for!
