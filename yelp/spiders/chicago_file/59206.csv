Smoque BBQ////Smoque is great; I'd go there at least once a week when my place of employment was within walking distance.  Start with the pulled pork sandwich and french fries and work your way up to more complex meats.  Peach cobbler side is wonderful as well.  The coleslaw is not my favorite, but that's mostly because I'm not a raw onion fan.
