Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The house special, berry pancakes were wonderful. You can order as many or as few as you like. On our second breakfast here, I ordered a short stack and split it with my 5 year old. The berries and cream were freshly prepared, drizzled prettily over the cakes. No syrup necessary.
