Smoque BBQ////I am from Kansas City. Roll your eyes if you want; I'll wait. I'm from Kansas City and nothing can unseat from my heart those champions of BBQ (Smokestack, Gates, Oklahoma Joe's). But I'm also a realistic person. I know it's more convenient to drive 20 minutes south instead of 9.5 hours south when I feel like eating BBQ. And my fianc√© loves this place so I'm sort of stuck with it.
