Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Alas "The Malnati Chicago Classic" came out with its famous buttercrust. Yes, BUTTERCRUST. Definitely worth the calories! The sausage was flavorful as well as the sauce. I couldn't finish my share of the pizza but of course had to eat all the crust :) Definitely worth a try. I have to say I'm thankful I don't live in Chicago so I don't have to be tempted to eat deep dish all the time.
