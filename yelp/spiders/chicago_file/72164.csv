Little Goat Diner////Was in Chicago for a conference and some of the people we were with suggested Little Goat. I was hesitant at first because it the night was intended to be a nice dinner out with a bunch of colleagues and Little Goat looked like a diner. I was pleasantly surprised! Little Goat is a diner, yes but with panache! We started with drinks at the bar which is a swanky section of the restaurant away from the dining area. I highly recommend the Raspberry Beret! Yummy! Even though it is a smaller restaurant, we were able to get a large table together. The food was absolutely divine! Who would have thought friend chicken could be so elegant but tasty so utterly fantastic!! But what made it even better was the bill at the end of the evening! Super reasonable!! The staff was amazing and the entire experience was awesome! You must visit the Little Goat!
