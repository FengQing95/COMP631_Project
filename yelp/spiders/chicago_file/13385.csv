Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After one slice of Lou's, I convinced myself that I need to move to this city. Being a Californian with all our vegan/hipster/gluten free/ extremely health conscious thin crust pizza I had no idea what was waiting for me at Lou's. Can't wait to go back and dive into the best deep dish pizza ever. If you're visiting the city, I'd call in the order and if there's only two of you get the small. The medium was just too big for us.
