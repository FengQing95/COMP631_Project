Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Okay, I will let you know up front the food was very good for casual tapas, but was it worth the horrendous service?  I think not... I can honestly say that this was the worse service I have had in years.  In short, go to Iberico(the food is comparable and a bit more authentic) at least the service is better(that is saying a lot if I am routing for Iberico's service).  Also, I can honestly vouch that Iberico actually puts wine/and or liquor in the Sangria--CBBR's Sangria was just juice.  Plus, your salt and pepper shakers at Iberico will not be covered with grease--totally disgusting.
