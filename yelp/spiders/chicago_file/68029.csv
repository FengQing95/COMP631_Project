Little Goat Diner////The food was great. I had the Fat Elvis Waffles, which were insane. Waffles, bananas, peanut butter and bacon maple syrup. Seriously. I couldn't finish them, because they were so rich, but damn were they good! My sister ordered the Reuben sandwich (she said, "I don't like reubens, but strangely I'm in the mood for one...") and she loved it! I had a bite and it was very good. Excellent menu options, lots of fun twists on classic dishes and some great new ideas.
