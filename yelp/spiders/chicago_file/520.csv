Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Best pancakes ever ever ever. I ate here on a recommendation of the concierge at a hotel while visiting. It might be the sole reason I moved to chicago. (not really. but kind of.) the pancakes are basically like crack. so sweet and yummy. The ham is perfectly cooked, not rubbery at all. the hash browns are just how i like them- crispy. I've had the Denver skillet as well and that was seriously the best breakfast of my life. my egg (which i am EXTREMELY picky about- i usually will only eat them at home out of my skillet) was perfectly cooked. I wish i could give them 10 stars.
