Little Goat Diner////Nice new approach on the classic diner atmosphere.  Everything we had was delicious, and I wouldn't mind another round of their shakes. I have to go back there if for nothing else but to try all of their items.  I am being honest when I said that I sat there for a good 10 minutes because I didn't know what I wanted from all the good looking food.
