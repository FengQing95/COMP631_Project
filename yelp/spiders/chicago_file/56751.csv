Smoque BBQ////I love this place. I try to go as often as possible. I'm not one for sweet barbecue ribs, so this place is perfect for me with the dry rub ribs. They're coleslaw is unlike any other also not sweet but, very vinegary and I love it. My son and I always share a rack of ribs as well as a kids brisket sandwich. My husband loves the pulled pork sandwich. Honestly when you walk in to here you want one of each, which is why they have a small portion called a taste. The Mac and cheese is amazing. The fries are great. I'm not much of a fan of sitting at a table with other people I don't know, who are having loud conversations. I. Usually take my food to go and only make it to the car. I go as often as I can! Highly recommend this place!
