Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So get used to it: You have to plan your trip to Lou Malnati's. Eat breakfast and be prepared to wait until 2:00 for lunch. The smallest size they have is just enough for two people, no matter what it says on the menu about it being suitable for one (unless you're a bear). This plan really works.
