Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The Black Raspberry sangria was delicious, the 1/2 pitcher is enough 3-4 glasses each for two people. My girlfriend and I got a variety of tapas but the highlights were the bacon wrapped dates and stuffed mushrooms. The potato omelet was a bit disappointing, and the beef skewers were OK but not great. The cheese plate was very good but the portions of cheese were a bit too small for my liking. The vibe was very upbeat and the patrons were a diverse bunch. Our waitress was friendly enough and the food came out super quick, which is always a plus!
