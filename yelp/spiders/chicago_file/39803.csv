Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Love the ambiance! Â The atmosphere and vibe was exactly what we were looking for on our trip to Chicago. The staff and servers were all great. Attentive to every detail - keeping our glasses full, taking away plates, giving us new utensils, knowledgeable with the food and bar menu.
