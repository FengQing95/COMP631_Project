Little Goat Diner////Been here a few times with friends and keep coming back for the hearty food. Breakfast all day is a huge plus! Â The menu takes traditional items and puts a spin on them. Really enjoy the little piggy and Parantha burrito for those who prefer savory and blueberry pancakes for my sweet tooths out there. The Korean tacos are just okay - too much cole slaw and not enough meat. Overall an elevated diner experience with quality food.
