The Purple Pig////This restaurant is my favorite one in Chicago. Great ambiance, amazing dishes. What gets me is the sheer consistency of their food and how good it is. Broccoli dish is amazing, pork shank is amazing. Highly recommend The Purple Pig. I've lived in Chicago for almost a decade now, and is by far the best restaurant downtown!
