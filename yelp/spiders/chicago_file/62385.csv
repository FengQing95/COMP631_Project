Smoque BBQ////I have been going to Smoque periodically over the last 12 months.   I will say for north side BBQ, it's good.   Generally speaking for a BBQ snob, it's alright.   My likes here are definitely the brisket.   The brisket is top notch with a bit a heat, very juicy and quite tasty.   I find the pulled pork to be average.   I thought the ribs were overcooked and dried out.  As for sides, cole slaw is so so, same for the beans.  People rave about the mac and cheese and I thought it was overrated.   Had brisket chili the last visit and it was interesting.  The fries are fresh cut and very good.
