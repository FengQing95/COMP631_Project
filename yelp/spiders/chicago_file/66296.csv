Little Goat Diner////I really like Girl and the Goat and wanted to try Little Goat! Got there on a Saturday night: the place does not take reservations but will take your number and text you when a table opens up. They had two stools by the bar available immediately and we took the seats to avoid the wait. The bar area is set up like a diner and is located across from the kitchen. In fact we were staring right into the kitchen and all the deliciousness it was producing. While sitting on the diner stools and sweating from the kitchen heat proved to be less than comfortable the food and service more than made up for it. Our server was amazing. She made food recommendations and that's what we went with. The portions were more then generous in size! After we were done with our dinner, our server suggested dessert but we were too full to move so my friend joked that the only thing that she desires is a spoon of ice cream. Nothing less, nothing more. To our surprise, the waitress came back with two spoons with ice cream! sweet! I recommend this places for it's amazing food and superior service!
