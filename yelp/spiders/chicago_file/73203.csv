Little Goat Diner////We had breakfast here on a family trip. Everyone loved their choice. The cinnamon rolls were warm, deliciously gooey ands completely scrumptious mess! I got the blueberry pancakes were wonderful. The portions are really large and made it easy for us all to share with each other. We found it very family friendly. The 2 year old in our party could have watched the baker window for hours. It kept him pleasantly occupied and quiet while we waited for our food. Great pick!
