Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Reservations are hard to come by! Make sure you reserve way in advance, especially if you're trying to get a coveted weekend dinner spot. I went with two friends. We booked about 3 weeks in advance for a Wednesday evening at 8pm in the dining room (sophisticated vibes). I hear the vibe downstairs in the parlor is different and more laidback with different music. Despite having a reservation, we still waited about 15min to be seated.
