Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We started with cheese bread before we ordered our pizza. I did think it was a little too much to have right before eating more bread and cheese after, but the pizza takes about 40 minutes so we wanted to nibble on something. It comes with a marinara dipping sauce and was very good.
