Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My date ordered the dry-aged ribeye, his first try of a dry-aged steak, and absolutely loved it. I went a little off the beaten path choosing their spice fried chicken over a steak, and it was the best choice I've made in quite a while. The chicken was juicy, mashed potatoes flavorful, and both served with a delicious gravy and peas combo which was to die for! I will absolutely be ordering it again! Both were large portions, and we were thoroughly impressed with our meal and our service throughout.
