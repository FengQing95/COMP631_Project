Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The atmosphere is just like a classic Italian-American restaurant look with lots of sports jerseys. Our waiter was very attentive as well! Just keep in mind when you go, you will need to wait as we were told the pizzas take 30-40 mins to make! But highly worth the wait, and will definitely be returning next time I'm back in Chicago!
