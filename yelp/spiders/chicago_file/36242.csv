Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Living here in River North, I've been wanting to try this restaurant for a long time now and was so happy when we did. This classy, upscale restaurant, is perfect to meet with a girl friend or for a romantic date. No one that I know that has went here has been disappointment. Even just stopping in for a glass of wine will wind you down to a relaxing evening.
