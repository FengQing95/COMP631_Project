Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I was in Chicago on a short trip. Rather than eat the expensive (and lackluster) hotel breakfast, I wanted something different. I called ahead and ordered based on some reviews that said there was a wait each time. I ordered the Minced Ham and Eggs with Cheddar. It also came with an order of hash browns and pancakes. I also ordered an orange juice which was fresh-squeezed.
