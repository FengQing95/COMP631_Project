Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I feel like every time I come here, I just end up eating the patatas bravas, the goat cheese with bread and sangria.  I can't say I am ever not satisfied with these tried and true staples.  The potatoes come with this spicy mayo that at times runs out faster than the potatoes themselves, but if you ask for more, they will give you a plate of the stuff which is pretty much 5 times more than you normally get.  We also tried the fried green peppers.  They come out looking like straight serranos, which was slightly intimidating, but they really are no hotter than a sweet pepper.
