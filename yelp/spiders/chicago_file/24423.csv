Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////ALWAYS PACKED! Been here twice and waited about an hour to be seated. But the wait is worth it, because their deep dish pizza is too good and instagram worthy. I had their veggie deep dish and it did not disappoint. Better go there with a good friend so the wait time goes by faster and not too hungry otherwise the wait will make you hangry
