The Purple Pig////This review is way overdue!  When I think about memorable meals in Chicago I think of the Purple Pig.  My fiancé and I went last year in September and had the best experience.  The food is just wonderful!  We ordered a charcuterie board, the milk braised pork, and the duck.  Everything was just fantastic!  I know the milk braised pork is a favorite and I understand why now!  The pork was so tender and full of flavor.  The duck was wonderful as well, again full of flavor and very rich.  We paired everything with red wine like you should.  Our service was perfect.  I know it's been a while since I've been back but I'll be taking a friend that is visiting town in September, can't wait.
