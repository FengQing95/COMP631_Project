Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I used to work around the corner from this Lou Malnati's, and lived around the corner from the one in Lincoln Park.  As for this one, I only ate their lunch specials, and they are absolutely top notch.  A personal pizza or pasta, a salad, bread, and a soda for all of like $6.  Absurdly affordable, and incredibly tasty.  Having a LM nearby for lunch made my job somewhat tolerable (for about a year).
