Little Goat Diner////Truly spectacular. We scored a reservation for a late night on a random tuesday. Keep in mind their plates are meant to be shared (AKA, they're really small). Although it was very expensive (spent ~$250 per couple) it was worth the money. Because it was four of us we ended up ordering about 8 or 9 plates. You have to listen to the server when he/she recommends the green beans. They sound like whatever, but probably some of the tastiest I've had. I specifically enjoyed their hamachi crudo, duck tongues, pig face, and beef tongue.
