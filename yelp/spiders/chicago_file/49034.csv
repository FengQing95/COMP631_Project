Smoque BBQ////Having eaten Brisket all over Texas (and even lesser BBQ cities) this is not really in the same league.  I had the brisket, sliced.  The smoke is too light (almost nonexistent in mine that day) and the the meat far too moist and tender. There should be a slight pull but this seems rendered like they steamed it after the fact.  Maybe they're shorting the time in the smoker to meet demand and finishing in an oven.  But, hey, they have the lines waiting to pay, so who am I?  Not sure if the folks I saw have much of an idea what BBQ is about but it must work for Chicago.  Will say the Coleslaw was a great complement.
