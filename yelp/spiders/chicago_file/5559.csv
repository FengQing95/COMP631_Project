The Purple Pig////Didn't realize it came with a Fried Egg on top. My server told me to mix it all up and eat it...so I took his advice. But first, I had to try a few of the Crispy Pig ears by themselves. Amazing! I'm not sure if this dish was suppose to be an appetizer or a main course. Either way, I'm just glad I ordered it...Crispy, Crunchy, Flavorful...FRIED!!! There's nothing bad about this dish!
