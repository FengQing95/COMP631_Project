Smoque BBQ////I ordered the ribs and approximately 30 minutes later they yelled my name. I got up and retrieved my order from the counter and right away I could tell something wasn't quite right. The ribs were so dry, I thought I had mistakenly ordered beef jerky. All the mediocre BBQ sauce in the restaurant could not have helped me choke those ribs down. I am a big fan of smoke flavored BBQ, but this place took it to an entirely new level. The meat tasted like someone dropped a napalm bomb into a pig pen. The staff behind the counter was so aloof you'd have better luck carrying a conversation with your scorched meal. Very disappointing.
