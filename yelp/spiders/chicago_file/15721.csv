Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We're from New England so we love our thin crust pizza. Did not have high expectations for deep dish.....it was fantastic. The light buttery crust, sauce not overloaded with spices but featuring a great fresh tomato taste. My husband fully expected to not really like it, he said it was great and he'd come back again and so would I!! Takes awhile to get the pizza but worth the wait. GO
