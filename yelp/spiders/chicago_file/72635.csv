Little Goat Diner////Mmm...comfort diner-style food with an Asian twist! Many of the combinations seem odd, but they work. After an hour wait, our party of three was seated at the counter. It was cool to see the chefs at work, but man did it make us salivate! I had the pork belly pancake, which is under sandwiches, but it's open-faced. That didn't bother me though because it was amazing! The flavors went really well together and it wasn't too greasy. The special of the day was a salad topped with fried pig snout. It was tempting, but I needed that pork belly!
