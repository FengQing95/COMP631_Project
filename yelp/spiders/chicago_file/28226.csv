Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Overrated. Now l know why many say deep dish isn't as good as some say. Ordered 2 "personal servings". Mine was the "The Lou Deep Dish" & my boyfriend ordered the "Deep Dish Sausage", before that we got Minestrone soup starters since the waiter told us it would take 40min to make the deep dish so he advised some apps. Minestrone tasted like the one in a can & our "deep dish pizzas" were a let down! We were told not to bother with deep dish when in Chicago but we had to try "local delicacies" (haha) and try for ourselves. They were right.
