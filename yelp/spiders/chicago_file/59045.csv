Smoque BBQ////We were super excited to finally get to try smoque! We popped in on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch and were pleasantly surprised that the line wasn't too long. Ordered a 1/2 slab of baby back ribs, sliced brisket and a pulled pork sandwhich with sides of mac n cheese and baked beans.
