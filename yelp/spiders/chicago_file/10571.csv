Art Institute of Chicago////The restrooms were very clean and well maintained. Prepare for extreme temperatures... while you're walking from exhibit to exhibit, it can get pretty warm, likely due to some of the temperature requirements for some of the pieces. It was rather uncomfortable for us, however, throughout the entire institute.
