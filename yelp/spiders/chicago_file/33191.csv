Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Wow... I love this place. Simply giving it 4 stars, rather than 5 because I haven't DINED here, yet. I've been here a couple times now, after work hours and met friends for a glass of wine.  I LOVE the dim lighting and ambiance of this place.  I' d imagine a date here would be quite romantic.   A wonderful Riesling by the glass (not overly sweet) they have, as well.
