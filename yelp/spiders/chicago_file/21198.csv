Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Location is conveniently located for an office lunch or if you are staying downtown at a hotel in the Loop or River North.  Colleagues visiting from out of town wanted classic famous Chicago Deep Dish pizza and a Deep Dish Lou did not disappoint.  Have taken many visitors here and even after they return home still talking about the buttery crust pizza.  Great selection of beer and wine to pair with the meal.
