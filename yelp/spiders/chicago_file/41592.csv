Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I chose to go to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba for my 35th birthday.  I'll tell ya, this place NEVER disappoints.  Service was EXCELLENT from the time we sat down to the time we left.  The waitress was great, coming by to keep track of what we had been served and what hadn't come yet.  We ate quite a bit of food and from begining to end we were out of there in 45 minutes.  Granted, we had a 5:30pm reservation so the place was still pretty empty.  Regardless, the busboys cleared our table of empty dishes immediately and the waitress was always on hand if we wanted more.  There wasn't one single dish I didn't like.  Everything was excellent as always.  Best tapas place in the city in my opinion, bar none.  Thanks for a great birthday dinner Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!
