Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The place was very crowded.  The pancakes were so delicious that I didn't even think about syrup.  Kimberly was very attentive without being overbearing.  The omelette was okay.  The portion size was wonderful.  I am not normally a latte drinker but Kimberly recommended the honey toffee nut latte and  it was delicious.  I will return, but probably a little earlier in the day.  I got there around 11:30 and had about a half hour wait.  There are still dishes that I want to try.  I recommend this place to all the foodies out there.
