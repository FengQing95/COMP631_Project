Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////No matter when you go there, there is always a wait. But if you stay patient, you will be rewarded with outstanding food. My favorite is the Home Made Corned Beef Hash with the Specialty "Berry Bliss" Pancake as substitue ($1.00 extra). They also offer excellent smoothies and friendly service.
