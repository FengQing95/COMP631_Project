Smoque BBQ////The ribs (the larger St. Louis style) I love were great. Perfectly tender. There is this disgusting love for 'fall off the bone' ribs that makes people boil ribs to cook them then throw them in a smoker or on a grill. Boiled meat, people? What, are we English? no dude, it's gotta be smoked and thiers are amazingly tender but not sodden. really good and served with the Memphis style BBQ sauce.
