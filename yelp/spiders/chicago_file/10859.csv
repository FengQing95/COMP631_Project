Art Institute of Chicago////Chicago has some of the greatest museums in the world, and the Art Institute is no exception. When I lived in the city, I was a member here and used to visit all the time. Still, I'm not sure if I ever really managed to see everything as it would likely take weeks to really absorb everything this museum has to offer.
