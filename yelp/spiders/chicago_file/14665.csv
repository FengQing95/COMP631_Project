Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So here is the scoop - this place did taste different than the other two. The sauce is better, but what gets it is the crust. Its really buttery and the sausage patty (my recommendation) is perfect on the the pie. Their pizza has what you pay for, meat, veggies, where the other guys tend to skimp on the meat. Also the other places crust sucks!!!
