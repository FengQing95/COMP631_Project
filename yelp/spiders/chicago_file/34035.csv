Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Got the bone marrow and the beef sandwich. They were both pretty excellent except the bone marrow was too much on the salty side. The fries were amazing. They have a nice selection of whiskey as well. And ordered a shot of espresso at the end to start of the night. Good place to take your date out for a fancy meal.
