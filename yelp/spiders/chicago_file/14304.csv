Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm not a particular fan of deep dish pizza so I knew going into it, I would probably not like it.  I did enjoy the pizza here.  The crust is actually thin and crispy.  They have a lot of cheese.  We ordered the classic with jalapeno. My husband loved it.  I liked it. Our server was very nice and helpful.  I would recommend it and come back again.
