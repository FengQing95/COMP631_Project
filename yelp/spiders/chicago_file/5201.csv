The Purple Pig////This is one of my favorite spots in Chicago. We stopped here for lunch after our time at Millennium Park and Cloud Gate and we were NOT disappointed. The place was packed which just shows how great it is. Their dishes are high quality, the service is good, and it's great to sit outside on the patio when the weather is nice. There are individual tables but they have more communal tables which can be fun.
