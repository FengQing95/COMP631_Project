Little Goat Diner////A year later we were back in Chicago and, yes, back to Little Goat Diner. This time we sat inside because of cooler weather. Still great food and friendly service. This time I had the fried chicken entree one day and the chicken sandwich another day. This place has quality food for reasonable prices. Love it.
