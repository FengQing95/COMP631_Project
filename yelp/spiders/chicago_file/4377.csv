The Purple Pig////Holyyyyyy cow. I have always wanted to try this place and it was amazing. I actually came here alone and ended up sitting next to a woman and we ordered a few different things and split the check. So much fun!! She had already ordered the eggplant caponata and That was delicious. We also got the Ricotta Gnocci which came with a pork neck-bone gravy, stuffed squid as well as the lamb ribs and oh my word everything was delicious. I canNOT wait to come back. It was everything that I hoped it would be! It was extremely busy even on a Monday night so anticipate there being a wait, especially if you have 2+ people in your party!
