Little Goat Diner////After making reservations way in advance a group of friends and I went to the Little Goat. Two people ordered the omelet for brunch and within hours had horrific food poisoning leaving one in urgent care. They had flown into town from out of state and missed the entire weekend and could not eat for 36 + plus hours.
