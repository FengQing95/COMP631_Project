Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////JUST OK. The food was alright but it's not worth the 1-2 hour wait. Also, because of the continuous line up, we felt rushed by our server to order but generally, the service was good. However, the owner of the restaurant was extremely rude. We had a group of 6 people and one of the members of our party has "mysteriously" gone missing (he was exploring the subway marketplace, classic tourist). The owner said that all members of our party must be present before we were to be seated. This was fine, but the way he said it and went about it was extremely rude.
