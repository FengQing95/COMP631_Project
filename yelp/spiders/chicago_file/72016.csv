Little Goat Diner////I had the Parathas Burrito which was SO flippin' good, I don't even know how to begin. I was a little concerned, because I've never done the sunny side up egg thing before, but it was cooked just the way I like my eggs, runny yolk, solid white. Win. The flavor combination was unique and perfect for my quirky breakfast palate.
