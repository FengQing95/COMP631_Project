Smoque BBQ////A real urban experience.  In a quiet part of Chgo, Old Irving......The ribs were great, the sides especially good...not so much on the slaw.  The full slab is huge, so I'll now have a half slab for later on.  The dine in experience is just okay...the order line seems to run right throught the center of the store and there is really no place for you to wait for carry out.  I hope they have oudoor seating now that the weather is so nice.....can't wait to tey many of the other menu selections.  I give Smoque five big stars!!!!!!
