Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////There are many steakhouses in Chicago, but I chose this one over others for a variety of reasons. Despite the company owning it called HogSalt it's still a beef steakhouse and just like many steakhouses they offer a healthy selection of seafood (mostly towers) and just like most places they do some mean cocktails. Steak of this kind is very American, but there is a Europeanness about this place that can't be understated. It lacks the high paced, high stress life we lead here in American compared to European counterparts.
