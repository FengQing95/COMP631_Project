Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tapa selection was great. I enjoyed the deviled eggs, the pork belly lollipop, paella, burata and many other small dishes. Especially this breaded chicken, I forgot what it was called but that was delicious. Perfect portion for sharing for those of you that enjoy family style. For drinks we order a sangria jar and we split with the table. Very refreshing.
