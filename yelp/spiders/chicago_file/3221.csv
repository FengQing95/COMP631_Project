The Purple Pig////The place was packed around 2 PM, so I kind of felt like I was in the way just standing around waiting around the bar area but the workers were all friendly and accommodating. They have an extensive wine, cocktail and beer list to enjoy while you wait or with your meal. Our table was ready a little sooner than expected and luckily sat at our own table rather than the communal tables.
