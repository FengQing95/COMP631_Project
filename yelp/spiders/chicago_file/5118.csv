The Purple Pig////Considering its prime location on Michigan Ave and the quality of the food I felt that the prices were reasonable.  Lunch for 2 was $100 and that included tip and a glass of wine.  My friend and I left feeling satisfied and full at the end of that.  If I were to find myself in Chicago again in the future I would most definitely make an effort to come back here.
