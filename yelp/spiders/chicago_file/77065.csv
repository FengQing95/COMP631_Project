Little Goat Diner////Fantastic diner atmosphere, whether sitting at a table, or at the counter the service was fantastic. Bring your appetite as the portions that they serve are massive and are served swiftly. Even with a full dining room the food came out within 10-15 minutes of ordering. The cheese fries were really rich and fatty. Neat place with great Asian twists on dishes.
