Art Institute of Chicago////I love the Art Institute of Chicago. I've been to art museums all over the world and truly believe that Chicago's are museum ranks among the best. Its high profile art pieces are numerous as well as countless hidden gems. There are wonderful exhibits that are interactive as well as many educational sessions available to peoples of all ages. Furthermore, the member option is incredible and well worth the money. The member lounge with free coffee and tea, free entrance with a guest and member only events make the membership well worth it. There is a student membership at a reduced price but has the same amenities. As a student, I greatly appreciate this fact and am extremely thankful. If you frequent the Art Institute, please consider a membership! It is definitely worth your money!
