Smoque BBQ////Looking for some great ribs and being new to town I did not know where to go. Decided to use yelp for the very first time, I found that Smoque BBQ had great reviews. Keep in mind that I've been in Texas for the past 12 years so my standards may be a bit high. I have to say that the best they have to offer are the ribs, by far the greatest thing on the menu. As for the rest of the food Items I would have to say that they are good but leaves much to be desired. The brisket was very bland and did not have much taste or texture to it, I t seem as if I was eating roast beef instead of actual brisket. The coleslaw, beans, macaroni and cheese were very good and appetizing however the regular sizes seem to be very small and not contain much food. If you're in the mood for some good ribs this would be a great spot to go, however if you're looking for great brisket I would not recommend at this restaurant.
