Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm not a big steakhouse person, but this is the best steakhouse I've ever eaten at in my life and one of the best meals of my life (also probably the most calories). This is one of those places where you marvel that literally everything is done perfectly. I've had the garlic shrimp appetizer, tomato salad, ribeye, filet, corn...I'm not sure what they put on that ribeye but it's an incredibly flavorful spice.
