Smoque BBQ////I have to say that Smoque runs a pretty close second! I am so excited to have found Texas BBQ in the great city of Chicago - who knew!!!! I went there for my second time today and enjoyed it as much as the first time I was there. The brisket is smoked to perfection and as tender as can be! I recommend the mac & cheese as a side - it is some of the best mac & cheese I have ever eaten.
