The Purple Pig////OK - everyone knows the food here is amazing, and it is! But the high quality SERVICE - wow!!!!! Everyone was working in tandem in our entire area (11:30, on Fri Jan 3rd)to ensure an upbeat efficient outstanding service experience - I'm sorry I can't remember the name of the very gracious young lady in the Cobalt blue sweater who was our primary server and the absolutely charming young lady who was her primary assistant at our table - but I bet you can identify yourselves from this - so THANK YOU!!!!! We were celebrating my daughters birthday and you made it very special!!!!!
