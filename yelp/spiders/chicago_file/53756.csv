Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So I recommend to any of you reading this if you order the buttermilk chicken you specify that you want the sauce that comes with the chicken and you'd like it in a small silver cup the way they always served it previously without having to ask for it or specify I won't be dinning here for awhile as it left a bad taste in my mouth. Hopefully they hire some nicer servers.
