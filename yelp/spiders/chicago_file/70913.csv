Little Goat Diner////I loved the shrimp and grits, great savory flavor.  Shrimp were cooked perfectly, generously portioned, and the cheesy grits were the right consistency of grainy/soft/buttery, and the tomato broth, pistachios (tender) and brussel sprouts made it unique.  The grilled cheeses' cheese was melted all the way through and the bread golden brown...so simple yet so good especially here at the Little Goat.  The fries well seasoned with the right amount of crisp.  I didn't try the Bandade but he was more than happy with it (Cod/Pork Belly/Kale/Kimchi/Eggs).  I'm not a Kimchi fan, but it looked so good that I would have attempted it had he not eaten it all so quickly.  He did have a bite of the grits and then helped himself to more cuz the grits were that good.
