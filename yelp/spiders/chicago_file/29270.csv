Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's tough to compare Lou's to Giordano's because I feel that they're almost different types of pizza. I tried Giordano's first, which I was very impressed with. But I kept having people suggest I'd try Lou's so I was expecting it to be way better or something. The pricing is a bit cheaper here and there are more size options, which is nice esp if you want a deep dish to yourself.
