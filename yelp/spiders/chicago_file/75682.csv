Little Goat Diner////Every time we go to Chicago, LGD is always a planned stop. It's on open table and yelp reservations to help avoid the long wait - as there is usual a wait to be seat given the popularity of the diner. We have been here for both brunch as well as lunch and have never been disappointed by any of our food choices. Their food is American with some Asian fusion embedded in some of the plates. Definitely a good choice if you have time to sit and eat - not a good quick dine option. Always good service when we've been. Attached is their bakery which we always buy to go for the road. Freshly baked on site.
