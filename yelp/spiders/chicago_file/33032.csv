Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This was a tiny bit underwhelming. We ordered a wedge salad, which was kind of blah. Just tasted like ranch and dill to me. You get a thick cut slice of bacon on the side, which was too fatty for my taste. I like the crunchy, crisp kind of bacon on my salad for crumbling. We also ordered the 6oz filet. This was cooked to perfection, but had a distinct flavor I did not care for. Dessert was probably the best part. I do have to say the service is really great. Everyone we had was really friendly, and did a great job.
