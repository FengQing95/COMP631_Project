Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place is absolutely to die for! The only thing that's better than the cozy, posh atmosphere is the delectable food and sweet as can be staff! I would recommend this restaurant over and over again. I have been here three times so far and everything we've ordered has been fantastic from the entrees (ask about the specials--they're great!) to the side dishes to the desserts. Favorite restaurant in Chicago by far.
