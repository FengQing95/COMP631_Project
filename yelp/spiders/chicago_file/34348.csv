Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Outstanding! Killer atmosphere, great drinks and staff. Epic wedge salad with two pieces of house-cured bacon speared to the lettuce with a steak knife. Out of this world steak -- I got the Ribeye Au Poivre. Seriously one of the best steaks I've had worldwide. Save room for malt whiskey ice cream with hot fudge.
