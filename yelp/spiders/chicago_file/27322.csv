Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Worst customer service ever had to go to the bar and my own beer. 1 hour and 45 minutes for a personal pizza. Our waitress was too scared to come back and check on us because she knew the frustration of the restaurant overall this place I would go ahead and skip even though it's been recommended by Chicago Food influencers just go ahead and order slice of pizza off the street fresher and more satisfying!!!
