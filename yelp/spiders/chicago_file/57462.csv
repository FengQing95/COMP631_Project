Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We decided to split some of their tapas dishes, which I highly recommend doing when you visit. The spicy potatoes with tomato aioli were just the right amount of crispiness.  The spice level of the potatoes was manageable, but I do like spicy foods.  We each ordered our own beef empanada, and this was a solid choice.  The pastry crust of the empanada was just the right amount of flakey, and the filling was well seasoned.  My favorite tapas dish we ordered was the buttermilk fried chicken thighs with piri piri sauce.  The chicken and sauce paired beautifully together for a delicious flavor.  Cafe Ba Ba Reeba has a fun, lively atmosphere and I highly recommend checking it out.
