Smoque BBQ////Sept 6, 2018 We made a huge discovery of the top 50 places to eat in Chicago list... at the Revival Food Hall on Clark St 4 places are in there! Â  They didn't have the recommended Ribs at this location but I would recommend the Beef Brisket. It was perfect and not fatty like other places I've been. Smoque we had the Beef Brisket Sandwich with the recommended Carolina and Memphis Sauces, Coleslaw and a Coke about $14
