Little Goat Diner////Now lets get to the sides.  The fries were "smoked" with a nacho cheese seasoning.  Where?  No smoke, no nacho seasoning.  Just mediocre fries. Room temperature and greasy, not light and crisp.  Like the oil wasn't hot enough when they were fried, so they got saturated with oil.   McDonalds fries taste better.  Seriously, and that's SAD.
