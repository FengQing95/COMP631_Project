Art Institute of Chicago////There were actually quite a few famous pieces that I recognized - Nighthawks (nighttime view of a diner with a few people inside), American Gothic (woman and farmer guy holding a pitchfork), lots of water lilies by Monet, Van Gogh's self-portrait, Georgia O'Keeffe's cow skulls and clouds, and more.
