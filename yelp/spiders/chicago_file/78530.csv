Little Goat Diner////Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can't get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly.
