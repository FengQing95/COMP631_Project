Little Goat Diner////See about a month and a half ago we tried to go to Little Goat to be informed at the door that they were closing their kitchen for a few hours to catch up. I understand new restaurant, not yet learning how to manage the business flow, whatever. They produced one small angry client. He left hungry with a Little Goat refrigerator magnet.
