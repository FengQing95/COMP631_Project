Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////LOVE Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! :) Food is reasonably priced and delicious. I especially loved the rioja braised short rib with mashed potatoes (#51), and you can't go wrong with any of their empanadas. I used to live in Lincoln Park and would go here at least once a week with my girlfriends for sangria and tapas. Service is always great, too!
