Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute contains pieces by many of the rock stars of the art world so even those with slept through history class (and who wouldn't even dream of taking an art history class) can appreciate it.  Renoir, Van Gogh, Monet, Cezanne, some other French dudes (yes, I know Van Gogh isn't French)!  They're all there. But even if one doesn't know the artists, the paintings are just as famous.  "American Gothic" (angry dude with a pitchfork and his wife who's probably the reason he's angry), "Nighthawks" (that diner one), and, of course, the favorite of everyone who has seen Ferris Bueller's Day Off, "Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte."
