Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't think I've ever had a real deep dish pizza before. Pizzeria Uno doesn't count, and that was years ago. I followed the exact baking directions and the results were fabulous. Impressed by the real pie-like crust and the distinct layers of sausage and cheese. No opportunity to skimp on ingredients when they are stacked.
