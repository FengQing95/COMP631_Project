Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had a mishap when we went here. The runner delivering our pizza didn't cut it properly and when he was trying to serve us slices, it fell flat on the table. Luckily, the manager, Matt, came by and took care of us. He was apologetic and got us another pizza within minutes. We were apprehensive because we didn't want to wait another 45 minutes for a replacement pizza but he said he stole another pizza on the assembly line. It wasn't the exact same as our order but it was close enough.
