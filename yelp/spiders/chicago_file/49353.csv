Smoque BBQ////We came after hearing about Smoque for months. I had the smoked brisket and ribs. Â The brisket was very good and the ribs were well flavored but did not fall off the bone, which is the way I prefer them. Overall of Smoque is a good value and worth trying but it didn't live up to all the high praise I had heard about it.
