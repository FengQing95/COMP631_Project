Smoque BBQ////Soooooo Authentic BBQ fans... (that means nothing but grilled cooking no boiled preps and smoked finishes and no smoked beginnings and oven finishes) this place is the truth! The St. Louis ribs are amazing and a must their sauces are phenomenal ranging from a sweet baby rays to a Carolina mustard based are awesome. On top of the ribs you have to try their smoked brisket (best in the city) their Mac and cheese is slightly breaded on top and very good very reminiscent of a great homemade oven baked Mac and cheese. Now here is where you get to the coup de gras ....BURNT ENDS...(they are not on the menu but if you know Competition style BBQ then you know burnt ends from double smoked brisket ends) ask for them because from time to time they have them. Don't be intimidated by the long lines the service is fast and the food is worth it. This is Kansas City,Memphis,St.Louis quality BBQ 12 minutes from millennium park! It's a no brainer go and become part of the initiated
