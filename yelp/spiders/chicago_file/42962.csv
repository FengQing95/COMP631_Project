Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Beyond the wonderful Food, and exquisite service of Amber, the manager Scott was more than welcoming, accommodating and pleasant. It was such a rememberable night filled with good friends, delicious food, and a delightful  atmosphere. Thank u to the amazing staff for their hard work on a busy night.  Paella, buratta, and bacon wrapped dates were out of this world.
