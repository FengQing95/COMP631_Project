Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I personally ordered the shrimp with garlic, olive oil, red pepper flakes which were very good, I also ordered the beef tenderloin & blue cheese which was TO DIE FOR !!! Â It was two pieces of tenderloin with a dollop on blue cheese.... literally I would ask this to be my last mean... DELISH !
