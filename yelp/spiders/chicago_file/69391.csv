Little Goat Diner////The wait can be painful but it's worth it.  My fridge is covered in photo booth photos.  Last time, I took my friend for the first time and she mentioned to our waiter about how all I do is rave about this place (I'm not kidding, I love Little Goat).  He went back to the kitchen and when he came back, he was with Stephanie and our orders!  Stephanie was incredibly sweet.  Even though I totally made a fool of myself by mentioning that they suddenly made the hash differently that day (telling you, I'm a freak for my hash).  Didn't matter what it looked like.  The taste is unwavering.
