Little Goat Diner////This place is such crowd pleaser. I've been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and 90% of the time will resort to the Bullseye french toast. I am sucker for what I like. The rooftop is awesome (and the site of my ice bucket challenge). Some places big menus can be intimidating but with this one, you really can't go wrong! Â (even though I order the bullseye-- i tend to mooch of other people's plates and I've liked everything they've had too!)
