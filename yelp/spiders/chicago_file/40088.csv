Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////"To order the 45 day dry aged bone in ribeye, or to not order the 45 day bone in ribeye."  This question was begging for answers.  No, we didn't ask our attentive but somewhat robotic waiter, Joel? Service was solid, but felt ingenuine.  Bus boys provided stellar service.  Never a water glass unfilled. They constantly checked on our table.  Want more of the complimentary, delicious, super crusty & airy sourdough bread?  It's excellent, but don't fill up on this, cause the really good stuff is about to come.  We took advantage of the BYOB.  Avoid paying a corkage fee ($15) by sharing one glass of your bottle with a neighbor.  The table next to us kindly thanked us. I happen to like their take on this.
