The Purple Pig////This place never disappoints! This is my must-have every time I am in Chicago. The bone marrow wasn't as good as I remember it pre-COVID (I think it's a lot smaller), but the rest is just so delicious. We got the pork tongue which is really really good melt in your mouth, the pat√© was tasty but not salty, and the duck is to.die.for. Like the best duck we have ever eaten in our lives. The oreo cheesecake with sorbet was also a hit!
