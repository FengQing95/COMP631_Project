Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I really enjoy a good deep dish, and normally I am greatly satisfied by Lou's yummy pizzas.  However, my last visit was not good.  Pizza was not hot when it hit our table, our drinks were mixed up and our appetizers also came out kinda cold.... I was not too thrilled, not to mention when we told our waitress she didn't really say much... I understand that its ALWAYS busy in there but a little understanding can go a long way....
