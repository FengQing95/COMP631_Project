Smoque BBQ////Now to the part all of you care about, the meat. The baby back ribs fall off the bone so easily, and yet they are not greasy in any way. The only thing that comes off on your fingers is a little bit of dry rub and the occasional sauce you wound up getting your fingers into by accident. The brisket was so tender and moist I was actually quite happy eating it without any sauce at all. However, I can recommend all of their sauces. Based on what you like, a NC vinegar based sauce, or a smokey and sweet Memphis sauce you will find one you like. They even have a spicy Memphis style; however, I did not find it to be substantially hotter. I was not expecting to find a gem like this in Chicago.
