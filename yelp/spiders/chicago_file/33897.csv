Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Prime ribeye to die for. They will brag about their bacon, and you'll realize why they do once you get your first bite. I advise you to get the elotes as a side for your meal. I wish more steak joints served epic elotes as sides. Don't even get me started on the chocolate cream pie. Phenomenal.
