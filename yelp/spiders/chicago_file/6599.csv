The Purple Pig////Can I just say that the beets salad was to die for?! Wow, wow the pistachio butter was everything a girl needed and then some. At first I was under the impression I was having peanut butter or tahini so don't think it tastes like butter at all, because it does not. Something about the tanginess of the beets/feta just works perfectly. Â
