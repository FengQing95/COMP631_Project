Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After living in Chicago for the Summer I have tried my fair share of Chicago Pizza! I lived right down the block from the State Street location and found myself ordering from there more than I would like to admit.  My go to is always The "Lou".  Better than Gino's for sure.  I have also had the beef sandwich and the lasagna.  The beef was OK but the lasagna was just as good as the pizza.  If you have never had Chicago style pizza go here!!!! Don't get tricked in to Gino's!
