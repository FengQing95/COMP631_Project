Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Best bone-in ribeye I've had on this planet. I had to go back to make sure the chef is consistent in his standards. No disappointment. Also doesn't hurt that the place also offers amazing appetizers, ambiance, a great wine list at a very reasonable mark-up, and non-intrusive, warm and respectful service. Getting a reservation is not easy, so I am always hesitant to write reviews like this in this situation. But competency requires honest feedback and recognition. They deserve it.
