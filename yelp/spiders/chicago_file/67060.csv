Little Goat Diner////I have been here for few family diners and with friends,overall always ok food and service,also i get my coffee and bagel couple times a week here in the mornings ,today i parked in front the restaurant to pick up my coffee and breakfast,the valet guy approved it,i told him i was getting my coffee ..... It took them fairly long to finish my bagel i would say 10-15 minutes,so the bartender at the bar area where i was waiting had to go check on it and the coffee too,i would say busy morning but didn't think much of it as it happens sometimes,as everything came late,i got phone call and decided to finish my bagel at the bar area in the bread/coffee shop not the part of the restaurant,i was on the phone when the valet guy approached to me and said he would have to charge me valet when i leave,mind you he interrupted my phone call and he did not valet park me just approved me to park in front,he said i have been inside for 45 minutes ... When i left i waited for him to come he asked for 12$ he obviously saw i was holding my beverage ,i gave him 20$ already furious ,he asked me how much would i leave in tip,then i freaked ,didn't use bad words but was visibly distressed and told him i would like all of the change because i dont think i should pay at all,his colleague the other valet guy saw this conversation and was visibly on my side ,he even say loud i wouldn't do it to you.... Anyhow as he didn't have change he went inside brought some change gave it to me,as i was leaving he changed his mind and tried to give me back my 20 $ ,i refused and left.... In case the management read this,he is young white guy with beard,he was working around 10 am on 29 Th of October. His rudeness totally ruined my day and my coffee and my breakfast,you should not have guys like this work for you,because i will take my coffee somewhere else from now on,sadly because i do like yours coffee and the vibe inside but it's the whole team that makes one place GREAT!!!!! Â And please tell other valet guys if they have to worn somebody that they are parked too long while waiting for their coffee which is rude itself,do not do it while people take phone calls,wait until they get to their car!!! And sometimes get over it!!!
