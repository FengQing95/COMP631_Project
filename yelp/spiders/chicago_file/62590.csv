Smoque BBQ////I had the brisket sandwich with the Mac and cheese and French fries. Brisket was melt-in-your-mouth tender. Bbq sauces were a great balance of tangy and smokey. Fries were hand-cut and tasted very fresh. Mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy. Yum! I did add a bit of salt to the meat and there was a little too much bun for the meat ratio on the sandwich. Overall, really good!!
