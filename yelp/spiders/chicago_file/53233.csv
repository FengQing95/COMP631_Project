Smoque BBQ////I had a half a slab of the St. Louis ribs (my personal favorite style), the corn bread and the mac and cheese. The ribs were so damn juicy and the bones pulled clean out. I don't like having sauce on the ribs because I love the taste of the burnt crust and taste the flavor of the meat. The house BBQ sauce they gave was nice and sweet and good. The corn bread was super delicious. The best part was that there was pieces of corn inside. The mac and cheese was super creamy and the best part of that was the bread crumbs on top.
