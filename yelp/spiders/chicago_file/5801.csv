The Purple Pig////When you take the time to look through the menu and finally decide on the dish you want and then they come back 10 minutes later telling you that it's not available, you get bummed. Then you quickly look through the menu again and chances are, you'll make a hasty decision. And yeah, that's what happened. We chose the Ricotta Gnocchi filled with tomato sauce to replace the homemade meatballs. I didn't love the dish and the tomato sauce overtook the pasta. I found myself wiping some of the sauce off before eating them. Nothing special.
