Art Institute of Chicago////One of the best art museums!!!  I love the American Art (the famous Grant Wood's American Gothic and Edward Hopper's Nighthawks) and the Impressionism sections (Seurat, Monet, Van Gogh, etc), but it was also nice to see the contemporary art section (by the new addition I presume).  My review doesn't do justice as I've only seen ~30% of the museum (in 3 hours).  I can practically spend all day there.
