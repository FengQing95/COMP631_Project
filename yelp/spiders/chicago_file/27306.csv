Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had garlic bread and a pitcher of sangria before eating -- both were decent but wasn't anything special. As for deep dish, we had the Chicago Classic and The Lou which were both amazing! I love how deep dish actually has a good amount of toppings beyond the tomato sauce and cheese instead of something like a few flakes of pepperoni. The Chicago Classic was filled with sausage and The Lou was filled with veggies and mushrooms. Oh god, getting hungry again writing this review...
