Little Goat Diner////Staff was great. Very nice and attentive. Were cool even when we had to change the reservation from 2 to 3. So, I was pretty excited for the food. Buuuuut I was a tad disappointed. I'm not a super health nut... I just felt that most of the flavors were bc they were soaked/steeped/marinated in fat. Which is fair and normal. But the nachos were like triple fried so the flavor was there (obviously) but ohhh so heavy. It was almost like not pleasant. Like just putting a straw in a tasty deep fryer and going to town. And that was just the appetizer. Anyways, I just felt like it was a gluttinous showdown. And I wasn't digging it. I say go there after a stomach virus and you need to gain a few pounds back. Dang I'm not usually a hater. But yelp is free territory.
