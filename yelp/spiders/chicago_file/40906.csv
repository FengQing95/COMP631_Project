Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I lived in Spain. I LOVE tapas. This place was probably one of the better tapas places I have been to since living in Barcelona. The food was good, didnt have to wait long and the staff was really friendly. Being a vegetarian I always have a hard time finding things I can eat at tapas places but there were plenty of things to try here. The only thing I had that I didn't like was the churros- they were pretty greasy and definitely not up to par with the real thing but hey- its Chicago.
