Smoque BBQ////Carlos has a gift and a finely honed skill. 'Smoque BBQ' has a selection of delicious BBQ easily accessible on the web. They also have specials that Carlos and the other staff point out as one decides what to order. He enjoys his work and is a confident, yet humble man (trait of a great service professional). We laughed as my wife photographed us, against the new construction going on. And as he assisted my wife and I, to the door, we felt like the most important people in Chicago. And, that is as good as dining-out gets.
