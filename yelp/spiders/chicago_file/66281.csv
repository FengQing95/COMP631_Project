Little Goat Diner////Went here for a weekday lunch - on a cold, rainy day this week.  The place was hopping (they don't take reservations), and we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table.  (And the hosts were honest in their estimate of the time it would take to get a table.)  The food was very good - I had the pork tenderloin sandwich, and my friend had the sloppy goat.  There were many menu choices that were tempting, and I loved that there was a great variety of bread/rolls for the different sandwiches and burgers.  Both of the dishes we ordered were delicious.  I really enjoy a good pork tenderloin sandwich, and this one definitely did not disappoint.  It was pounded thin, breaded and pan fried.  There was a nice barbecue sauce and slaw on the sandwich as well.  Definitely the right amount of both - to add flavor, but not to overwhelm the tenderloin.  I tasted the sloppy goat - this was also very good.  The pulled pork sandwhich looked amazing, and the salads I saw also looked great.  My friend and I also split a side of the smoked fries.  I really loved these - not too much smoky flavor, just enough to make them unique.
