Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I can't wait to go back here. Ok first off the ambiance is wonderful! It makes me want to channel my inner Daisy from the Great Gatsby. The drinks are fantastic and although I didn't have the steak, the salad I ordered came with this succulent piece of bacon . . . hence why I'm writing this review. Yes, I am writing this review over a piece of bacon. It was that good. :)
