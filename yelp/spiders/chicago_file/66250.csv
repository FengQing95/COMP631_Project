Little Goat Diner////We went here for brunch on a weekday. The wait was only about 20 minutes, and the service was great- not too pushy, not too hard to find. We shared the turkey sandwich and a cinnamon roll. I highly recommend both of these. I'm usually not a fan of cinnamon rolls in general, but I would go back just to eat one here! I'm looking forward to going back for breakfast, which is served all day.
