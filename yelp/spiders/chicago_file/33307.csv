Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Update: Â One of our absolute favorite places anywhere. Great environment, service and food, the total package. Visited again last night and had our favorite waiter Brandon. Appetizers were tomato with bacon (if this isn't the best bacon anywhere tell me) and a smoked trout Caesar salad. We share the Chicago cut steak and the lamb T bone, both perfectly cooked and delicious. Side dishes were the corn (also the best anywhere) and spinach. Although we were all full, the chocolate cream pie disappeared in moments.
