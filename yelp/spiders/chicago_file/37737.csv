Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My issues with this so called 'dry aged ' cut is that it is definitely not dry aged.  Dry aged steak is tender, so tender you could almost compare the soft texture to the consistency of butter.  This steak had a metallic-y taste and was so chewy I actually struggled swallowing it! This leads me to believe it's actually wet aged and that they are banking on the fact that the vast majority must not know the difference. Dry aged steak is considerably more expensive but well worth it. This particular steak should have been half the cost as the wet aging process is significantly cheaper and takes way less time.
