Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Amazing gluten free menu(among other offerings!)!! My husband and I have been going to Café Ba Ba Reeba for years and always love it! We have a few favorites like the bacon wrapped dates, Brussel sprout salad, and always delicious sangria.  We also held our rehearsal dinner there for our wedding and were beyond pleased with the process and product. Now we go back every year for our anniversary, but there's no need for a special occasion to visit this place. I'm always surprised at how little we spend for the amount of food and drinks we order. Ba-ba-Reeba is the best!
