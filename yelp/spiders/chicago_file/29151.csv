Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is a classic stop if you want that authentic Chicago style pizza. We stop here every trip we take to Chicago. It has a nice Italian restaurant interior, the place is filled with the great aromas of pizza cooking in the kitchen. The pizza itself is great and very, very, very, very filling. I'd schedule a long, walk and a nap after your meal, lol.
