The Purple Pig////AMAZING place!! My boyfriend and I decided to stop by this place because it was highly recommended by a few friends of ours. It also has amazing reviews so why not?! And this place definitely didn't disappoint at all! We wanted to order 2-3 dishes since it's a tapas place however the portion is HUGE. We definitely could have been completely full with only 2 dishes. We got the turkey leg (MASSIVE!!! delicious and tender), the pork shoulder (the sauce is amazing), and a pasta (wouldn't recommend pastas here because all the other dishes are so unique so I would spend money on others instead). I would totally recommend this place if you're in Chicago, it's a must!
