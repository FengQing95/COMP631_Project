Little Goat Diner////Between the brandade + belly and the pork belly pancake, the waiter recommended the former. It was impressively presented but disappointing once I dug in. Two tiny pieces of pork belly that weren't very flavorful, biscuits that were firmly on the dry side, and an assortment of veggies & under-fermented kimchi that made me glad that I was eating my greens but offered very little in terms of flavor. Wished I had given the more popular pork belly pancake a try, but skeptical whether I would have come to a different conclusion.
