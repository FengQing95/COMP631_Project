Art Institute of Chicago////Lots of people available to point you in the right direction cause its easy to get lost in here! I'm by no means an art person but I brought my brother and he told me he doesn't like art and even he enjoyed it. They have 2 souvenir shops that stay open a little after the museum closes.
