Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Buttery Mashed Potatoes - these were way too thick for my taste.  You are already eating a heavy steak, a lighter silky mashed potato would be a less filling side.  The flavor was fine, but I just couln't get past consistency and we ended up leaving most of it.  If you are looking for one side dish that can feed an entire table, this would be it.  3 stars
