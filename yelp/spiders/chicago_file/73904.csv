Little Goat Diner////I was sitting on my couch late at night when my head started itching. At first, no big deal. I hadn't washed my hair for an extended and undisclosed number of days, it's probably just, you know, build up or whatever. So I continue to sit there and I'm working, typing away when this little thing glides into my frame of sight and then disappears. Maybe a fuzzball? A Gnat? I swat the air once as a precaution and get back to work.
