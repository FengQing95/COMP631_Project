Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////without a doubt, best tapas in town. the environment is pretty authentic with the jamon serrano legs hanging on top of the bar.. the patio is great, the service is really good and the most important thing the food is AWESOME! My favorite is the goat cheese with tomato sauce, which is actually pretty simple, but I just really enjoy its flavor. The croquetas are awesome too and the calamari as well. They have the best Paella I've tried out of Spain!
