Little Goat Diner////Now, down to business.  This menu is HUGE and you can get breakfast all day.  I pondered way too much before finally asking our waitress some opinions.  I elected to have the burritto and I was thrilled with my choice.  While it's not a burritto in the traditional sense, it was amazing.  It's naan bread with eggs, kidney beans on top, guac and a bunch of other delicious items.  I honestly wasn't sure what I was going to get, but it was wonderful.  I took half home and I hardly ever bring breakfast leftovers home (by the way - a few seconds in the microwave turned this into an afternoon snack!).  I had a bite of the corned beef with eggs and hash browns.  It was good, but I really enjoyed mine better.
