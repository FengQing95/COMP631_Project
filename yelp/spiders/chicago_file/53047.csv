Smoque BBQ////I have eaten at the Salt Lick in Austin, TX more times than I can remember.  I used to think they had the best BBQ in all the land, but now I must confess that Smoque is vying for that sauce-slathered place in my heart.  Their brisket is amazing - it comes out hot and tender with a sauce that compliments it well.  The sausage is delicious and authentically Texan.  Their mac and cheese is wonderful, their cobbler quite tasty and their coleslaw is some of the only slaw I've ever liked.
