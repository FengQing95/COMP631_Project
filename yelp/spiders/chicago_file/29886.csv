Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We have always heard of the deep dish Chicago style pizza as having a delicious thick crust and were very disappointed when the pizza arrived with a barely thicker than a New York style thin crust with a thin layer of toppings. When I sent the pictures of the pizza to my husband who was a Chicago regular throughout college and grad school, he responded "wow! That is really thin." On a positive note about the pizza, the chicken sausage was yummy.
