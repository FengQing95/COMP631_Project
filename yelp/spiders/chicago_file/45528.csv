Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great sangria, delicious Pintxos & Tapas, and sweet happy hour deals at the bar. We had the pintxos platter, chicken & ham croquetas, Â patatas bravas, calamares a la plancha, and flan. Everything was very tasty, the service was fast & friendly, and the ambiance is cute (love the hanging ham leg ;)
