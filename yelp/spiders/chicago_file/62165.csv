Smoque BBQ////Of course like everyone else says, the bbq is to die for! I always get the sliced brisket, Mac and cheese, corn bread and of course the bread pudding I'm obsessed with! I atually worked there for a short amount of time and ended up quitting because to be honest some of the employees there are foul human beings. They do tip pool there and is split between the restaurant and the beginning of each month. They ended up taking mine away because I had the flu and still tried to work because I had no one to cover my shift and I didn't want to leave them short handed. They ended up sending me home after 4 hours of work because they said I looked too ill and out of it. Well come two days later I am approached by the manager and told that I do not deserve my tips for the month because I couldn't perform the proper customer service skill that day because I looked too sick...It's funny because La Ville Restaurant down the street even told me they are known for screwing people out of there tips. So needless to say I will always love the food but it's sad I have to go there and get food when I know when I'm dealing ignorant employees that are making the food..
