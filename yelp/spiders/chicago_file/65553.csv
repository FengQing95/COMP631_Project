Smoque BBQ////I had their rib combo: half slab of beef ribs and half slab of baby back. Both were amazing! Perfectly smoked and cooked to perfection. The kind that you can eat without BBQ sauce. Yeah that's the good kind! To my dismay, their sides were not pleasing. I had their mac n cheese which was baked and crusted and their cornbread. Both were disappointing. The cornbread was dry and the mac n cheese was bleh. They're a bit frugal with their BBQ sauce so get up there and ask for it. They also serve all orders with their housemade Cole slaw. Too vinegar-y for me.
