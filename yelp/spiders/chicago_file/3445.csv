The Purple Pig////What a great spot in the city for brunching with your honey or some friends. I came here with less time than I should have. I had to hurry and eat brunch due to a sailboat tour reservation. I was able to be sat immediately, after arriving a little before they opened for brunch. Come early if you don't want to wait because there was a long line. They out every pretty close together but it was nice and has a big family feel to it.
