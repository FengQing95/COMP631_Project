Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was me at this restaurant. Plates were tiny like it was a restaurant for children. Had to order more plates than normal because of tiny plates. Wasn't children's food though. This is definitely a restaurant for adults. Enjoyed the octopus. Wanted more octopus, really, but was with a woman and didn't want to gross her out by only ordering octopus. So I ordered a salad as well. Was surprised by how much I like salad. What was very good also was the queso de cabra al horno. Spanish for cheese ball in tomato soup. Waiter was very nice. Lady I was going to eat with came late and waiter made me feel not like loser while sitting alone with sangria pitcher.
