Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went there on a rainy and cold Sunday night with a fairly large group ... and if it weren't for our lively banter, we could've possibly heard a pin drop. I can imagine this place is much livelier on other nights, so I cannot really comment on the vibe of the place. The decor was nice though and it felt sort of cozy. The food was really excellent and every single tapas dish we ordered was delicious. Thumbs up for the Sangria too ... and double thumbs up for our waiter who kept topping off our Sangria from our pitcher. I'll definitely be going back.
