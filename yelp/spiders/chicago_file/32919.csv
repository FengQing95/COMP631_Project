Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went here for dinner with two couples last week, third time dining here. Place is awesome all around. Oysters to kick it off and possibly the best Ribeye I have ever had. Don't skip the mashed potatoes or the Brussels sprouts as a side. The downstairs has a cozier feel, perfect for a date. Upstairs also great, more action/lively. My new #1 steak place.
