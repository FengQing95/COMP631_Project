Little Goat Diner////Per my waitresses recommendation, I got the Los Drowned sandwich.  I was looking at the Reuben and she told me that I shouldn't get it that its just a Reuben, that the Los Drowned was like a way better version of an Italian Beef.  This was not the case.  Reading the description it sounded great, but sadly my meal did not resemble anything that was described.  It looked like it had been thrown out then placed back on my place.  It was beyond Soggy, you couldn't even pick it up.  The juice from it was just swimming all over the plate.  There was extra au jus for dipping, but I couldn't image as it already seemed as though it was dipped.  I expected some kick or at least some really good braised beef inside.  Bland, no flavor.  I would order this from a fast food joint for half the price before I would order from here again.  I noticed after I read descriptions online that it should have had avocado, mine had none.  Once our sever came back around I let her know that she was totally off the mark on that recommendation.  She did offer to get me something else and I took her up on it.   The waitress proceeded to tell me she only had it twice, once prepared by the chef and it was bland and greasy, then once when Stephanie was on the line and it was great so she had thought it improved.  Stephanie was there that day, but did not see her on the line.  However, her cooks have to be able to carry out her vision and recipe consistently for this to work.
