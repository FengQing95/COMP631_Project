Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The first time, we sat at the bar upstairs. The bartenders were great and the atmosphere was wonderful. I had the Chicago cut ribeye, cooked rare. Perfect sear and flavor, perfect red in the center. We squeezed in a dessert and split the chocolate cream pie, an absolute must-try. This experience convinced me that we had to go back.
