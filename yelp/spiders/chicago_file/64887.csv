Smoque BBQ////I've had this place bookmarked for awhile and finally got the chance to go. For the few that are uninitiated, you go in, wait for the host. You tell him/her how many people are in your party, they note it down and looks for a table for you. You order your food, said host shows you your table, you wait for your order number to be called out, and boom you're good to eat!
