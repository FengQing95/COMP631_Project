Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I also prefer the dining experience, as Malnati's is a bit less cramped than the typical Chicago pizzeria and the lines are generally shorter due to the multiple locations in high traffic areas. It's hard to cite hard facts, as it's been awhile since I've visited another Chicago pizza parlor (one visit per trip home is about all my diet can handle), but my gut tells me the prices are more reasonable than most as well.
