Art Institute of Chicago////First off, I don't care about art.  Or at least I haven't any time in my life other than when I was in here.  I've been to the Louvre, many museums in Europe and New York and around the country, and even though they were neat, I didn't leave feeling flabbergasted.  I was blown away by the Art Institute of Chicago.  It's huge, and the paintings/artifacts/statues/etc are just amazing.  There are thousands of years of invaluable stuff in this museum, and you just feel like you're in a place that's bigger than life.  You see paintings all over the place that you never figured you'd see in your life, and again, I know very little about art.  When I knew my time living in Chicago was coming to an end (I wasn't dying, just moving, so dry those tears), I made a bucket list of things to do.  This included going to all the famous museums.  Some were good, some were great, but this museum is the only one that took my breath away, it's one of the most amazing places I've ever been to.  The place is really cool, it's really amazing, and believe it or not, it's very relaxed.  Relaxed in the sense that most of the staff/security guards are either so young or so bored that you feel like you could punch a hole in a painting and nobody would even flinch.  So it's an amazing museum, and I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Chicago.
