Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting Chicago from Oregon, and looking to see what all the hub bub is about, Chicago deep dish pizza. Lou Malnati's was strongly recommended by staff at my hotel. I am now a believer. Best pizza I have ever had. From excellent customer service, to fantastic food, I will only order pizza from Lou Malnati's when I return to Chicago. Order, relax and enjoy. You won't be disappointed.
