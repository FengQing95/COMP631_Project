Smoque BBQ////Almost every cut was great...moist, strong flavors, and tender. They are efficient too: I would call ahead of time for a weekend pick-up order. My only complaint is the price. It's not outrageous, but I would visit more often if entrees cost a couple of dollars less. Cornbread is good, but I like crunch edges.
