Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We shared the "Prime Bone in Dry Aged Ribeye" (and couldn't finish it!).  This was hands down the best steak that we've ever eaten.  It was crusty and juicy... just amazing flavor and texture.  We ordered the "Roasted Bone Marrow" with ours and it was like meat butter...  just delicious.  Totally recommended.
