Little Goat Diner////There's good food and good service, and then there's great food and great service. Little Goat exemplifies the latter. Ordered the Ham N' Cheese Omelette with Hash Browns which were better than my high expectations. There's something about good ingredients prepared well that just tastes better. My server, Joan, provided perfect service in every way with a smile. Can't wait to go back.
