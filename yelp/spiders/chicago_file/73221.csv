Little Goat Diner////Came here for dinner with my friend who's in town. We both stewed over the drinks and food menus for 20 minutes. Ultimately, he copied me (!) and we both got the "This Little Piggy went to China," which is a sesame cheddar biscuit with sunny side eggs, Szechuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and strawberries. Sounds weird but it works. We also split a side of pork belly home fries, which was totally unnecessary because we were so full from little piggy.
