Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had a pretty bad service experience with our waiter but the manager came and made it right by bringing us complimentary food and ensuring that our pizza finally made it out to us. I appreciate him taking ownership of the situation and turning what had been a very bad experience into a more positive one.
