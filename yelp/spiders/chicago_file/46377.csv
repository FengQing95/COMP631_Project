Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Last time in town, I took my family here, and they liked it.  This includes my grandfather who scoffs at change.  The sangria selection is fantastic.  It'd be nice if it were a bit stronger, but I'll take taste over potency any day.  The paella was also really good, which surprised me.  In theory I shouldn't have been, as pretty much everything there is delicious, but it's good to know.
