Smoque BBQ////The staff and cashiers here are great. They have cleaning staff that a take your trays after you eat and throw out your food to expedite table for the next arriving guest, which was awesome. I really enjoyed this place and look forward to ordering the Texas ribs on my return. This place is by far out of this world and the bbq here is very good.
