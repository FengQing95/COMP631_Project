Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Excellent food, old school rustic charm with the blues playing in the background. I would have to say this place was off the hook delicious. We had filets and ribeye, truffle Mac and Cheese and the Charred Brussels Sprouts. All excellent flavor and perfectly cooked. We also had the Shrimp Scampi and Crab Cake for appetizers and they did not disappoint either. I give this place 5 Stars.
