Smoque BBQ////I don't know about you but I'm REAL picky when it comes to barbecue places. The sauce has to be amazing, the meat has to be a certain way, and the smells have to be delicious. Smoque to-go was my first visit to this restaurant and walking in to pick up our order quickly exceeded one expectation quickly; smells.
