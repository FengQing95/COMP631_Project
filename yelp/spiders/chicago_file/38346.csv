Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////TRUFFLE MAC & CHEESE topped with CHOPPED BACON - No, the bacon did not come with the mac and cheese, but it's worth the surcharge.  (Just read my bacon review in and of itself.)  The Mac and cheese was super delicious and the bacon just adds another element to it.  (Thanks for the idea from another yelper who posted a pic of this amazing combo previously - spot on!)
