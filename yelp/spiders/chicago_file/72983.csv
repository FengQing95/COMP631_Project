Little Goat Diner////I was in Chicago this past weekend and came here on Friday night with 3 friends, 2 of which are gluten-free. They take reservations which we made like Thursday night for dinner on Friday, otherwise the wait is pretty long. My friend called to make the reservation, I don't know if you can make them online.
