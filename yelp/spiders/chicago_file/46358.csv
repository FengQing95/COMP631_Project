Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My husband and I got here at 11:00 on a Saturday and it was so nice and calm and quiet.  I noticed the cool decor, I was so relaxed. I realized I could enjoy this restaurant as a real person.  Our waiter was wonderful, attentive but not hovering.  We both had Sangria and delicious brunch Pintxos - my favorite was the egg bite.  We then moved on to lunch Tapas and the best was the Pincho de Solomillo and the lamb.  We were now too full for the paella which was quite a shame because I love their paella even when I was sharing it with about a hundred children, that's how good it is.   Then our waiter brought us a complimentary selection of Dessert Pintxos for our anniversary.   I enjoyed them and a superb Latte.   ¡Sabroso!
