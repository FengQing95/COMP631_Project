Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here on a Wednesday night and was told that the wait would be 25 minutes. Turned out to be a 50+ minute wait - doubled the estimate. We pre-ordered once we put my name in the queue and was told that way we could have our pizza ready when we get our table. However we still needed to wait another 15 minutes for our pizza when we sat down. Food is good, but the management of wait times and food preparation process was sub-par. For such a strong chicago franchise, operational improvements are greatly needed. Wasted more than an hour waiting to sit and waiting for food - not how I want to spend my evening after a day at work.
