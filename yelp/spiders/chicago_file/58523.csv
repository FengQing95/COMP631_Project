Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The beef tenderloin and blue cheese is a lovely invention. It's so delectable, juicy and tender and the cheese perfectly complements. I found out my order with the Brussels sprout salad which is tasty with nutty and cheesy notes as well. Haven't gotten to try the sangria as it has been a pandemic and ordering exclusively take out so far but looking forward to trying that in the spring.
