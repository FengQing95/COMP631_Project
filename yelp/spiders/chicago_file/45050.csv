Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Let me just say that I love ethnic food and I was super excited to try different Spanish dishes. When I got to Ba Ba Reeba, I didn't know where I was exactly. The sign clearly says Tapas and somewhere in fine print, there was Ba Ba Reeba. Eventually we got to our seats, but the area seemed a bit confined for such a large group.
