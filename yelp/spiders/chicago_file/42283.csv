Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Anyway, we were seated (at 9:47!) and had a very kind and patient server who did a great job. The food was outstanding... the shrimp in garlic and olive oil with red pepper flakes was the best I've had by far at the versions at Iberico, Twist, Emilio's, or Sangria. Other highlights were the skirt steak with green onions and herbed butter... jockeying with the shrimp to be my favorite!
