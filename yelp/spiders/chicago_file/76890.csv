Little Goat Diner////Can I just say- wow. I had heard the hype around the restaurants that this amazing bad*** chef was creating. So much so, that I moved my train back several hours so I could experience it for myself. It was a culinary experience. Where do I start? First of all, I love the cute environment of the restaurant. It does make you feel like you're in your local diner (except cleaner and there are no health code violations). The restaurant serves breakfast all day --what could get better than that? I'm not ashamed to say, Â I love me a good parfait which gets snubbed by the brunch crowd. This shamed breakfast item brought a sensation of ecstasy to even the biggest non believers. Heaven was shining on every bite of that tangy lemony Greek delight. Next, let's talk bullseye french toast. "Where did my eggs go?," one may ask. It's incepted your toast *shook*. Overall, i will be coming back and bringing everyone I love with me. This was such a great experience.
