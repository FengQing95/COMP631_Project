Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What can I say... I love me some tapas! My friend and I came here on a busy Friday night and started out with an awesome pitcher of white peach sangria! We then continued to enhale the following: chorizo-wrapped medjool date & cheese; catalan bread with ripe tomato, garlic (so simple but yet my favorite!); house-marinated spanish olives; patatas bravas (awesome tomato alioli!); and fried calamari. So many calories - but complete worth it!!! Must visit again soon...
