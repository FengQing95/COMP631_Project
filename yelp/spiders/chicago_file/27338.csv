Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Definitely worth the wait. When I walked in, I could smell the delicious aroma. The pizza tasted like the smell when I walked in. I never had the famous "Chicago deep dish pizza" before. And this pizza for sure exceeded my expectations. The toppings of goodness were filled to the crust line. Once you took a bit, the deep dish filled your mouth with cheese, spinach, and the unique crust. Not only was the pizza amazing but the service was too.
