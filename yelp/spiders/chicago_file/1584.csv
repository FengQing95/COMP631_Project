Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////For $10 buackaroos, you get enough delicious yummy food to easily last you 2 meals. This cafe is located right under the Prudential Insurance building within walking distance of the Hyatt Regency Hotel and is open for breakfast and lunch. Their coffee drinks are super good and may even be better than Starbucks (But don't tell corporate. I absolutely love my gold Sbucks card!). Portions are more than generous. I had the seasonal omelette special with bacon, goat cheese, and spinach. It also came with extra crsipy hashbrowns and 2 pancakaes. YUMMY!
