Smoque BBQ////Now this place is a real gem! A true Chicago treasure! The BBQ is out of this world, the brisket melts in your mouth, and their peach cobbler is to die for! But what they don't tell you is that this place has one of the best salads in the city!! I'm always on the look out for a good salad and I was skeptical but their vinaigrette is so delicious and it has roasted red peppers, and chicken, and all of the veggies are incredibly fresh and crunchy! Snowiest knows food and they know salad!
