Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food here was great, except for the steaks, which is a bit of a problem for a steakhouse. We started with the crab cake and wedge salad. The crab cake was full of crab, a huge portion with a crisp exterior. The wedge salad had these amazing bacon chunks that totally made the salad! Â Also, the sourdough bread is out of this world. We got the truffle Mac n cheese which was as delicious as it sounds. But the Brussel sprouts, oh my god the brussel sprouts were amazing. Charred nuggets of balsamic glazed goodness were literally life changing.
