Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We ordered enough food to put all three of us in a food coma. I had the Classic Chicago Cut Rib Eye. It was perfectly cooked to medium rare and it just melted in my mouth. For sides, we had Truffle Mac and Cheese, Elote Style Corn, Charred Broccoli, Thick Cut Bacon, anddddd a dozen oysters.
