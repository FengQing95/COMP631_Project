Art Institute of Chicago////This place was huge, I mean there were so many rooms and different art collections I got kind of dizzy trying to look at everything. It is worth looking into if you are into art (painting, sculptures, etc.). I'm not totally into those things, I mean it was cool to explore but when you are overwhelmed with so much your brain just stop working...
