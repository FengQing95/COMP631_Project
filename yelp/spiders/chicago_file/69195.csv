Little Goat Diner////The first time I tried the Fried Chicken for dinner I thought it was really good. Just wish they had served the coleslaw separately because it's cold and tasted a little funny when it mixed with the warm gravy and mashed potatoes. The second time I had it (yes I had it twice) I thought it was a little too salty, which is a lot coming from me because I LOVE salty food!
