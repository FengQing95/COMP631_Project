Smoque BBQ////Smoque BBQ is one of the best barbecue restaurants in the Chicago area. Their food is really good. I love their brisket, ribs, and pulled pork. The sides at Smoque BBQ are great as well. Their macaroni and cheese, fries, and cole slaw are amazing. Try this place out if you're in the area.
