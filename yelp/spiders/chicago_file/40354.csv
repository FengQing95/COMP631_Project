Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Chicago'a best steakhouse!! We came here on NYE and it was crowded, but the service was excellent. We started with some west coast oysters. They were SO fresh and tasty. Followed with crab cakes. I ordered the filet and it was the most tender, perfectly cooked steak I have ever had. The asparagus and mashed potatoes were excellent. We finished the night with espresso martinis and the strawberry vacherin. I couldn't find a single thing wrong with anything we ordered. I also must add the ambiance is unmatched. It gives off old school speak easy vibes and is super intimate for a date night.
