Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great experience with 2 other couples. Start with a pitcher of sangria and 2 appetizers. Move in to several other things to share. So filling. DO NOT RUSH. Â Order more as you go; more fun that way. They do try to push you for more but I would take a few suggestions on what is popular. Dress very well but cool, if ya know what I mean.
