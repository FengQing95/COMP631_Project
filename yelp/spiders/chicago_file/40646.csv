Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////have been before and it was good but tonight i really hate to say it but it was awful. all i can say is the food is very very rich and heavy even though the portions are small. the paella was like eating mortar. not that im a spanish food expert but i really think the food shouldnt be so heavy. maybe would go again but would stick to the grilled calamari and the roasted potatoes. the place is still fun and lively.
