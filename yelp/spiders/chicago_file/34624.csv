Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Well...it didnt exactly happen that way. Even with a 2 week in advance reservation, I had to wait a lil over half an hour for my table. Didn't wanna drink so my hubs and i were just kinda lingeringgg around the bar. Hungry. Grumpy me. Then.....things completely turned when the host finally called us up for our table. I was a lil distracted to pay too much attention to the ambiance then, but now thinking bout it, the ambiance was nice. Very rustic coffee tables, leather couches, dimmed lights, sexy looking cocktails...somewhere Don Draper would take his business associates...for some reason all the guys were wearing blazers and suits..maybe coz it was a tuesday. anywayy..
