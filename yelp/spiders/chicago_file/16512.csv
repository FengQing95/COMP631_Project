Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The wings came out soon enough.  It was delicious, but nothing out of the ordinary.  We did not have to wait too long for the pizza to come out.  I was excited to try deep dish for the first time, and I already knew that it is better eaten with fork and knife, so my utensils were ready and my mouth was watering because at this point I was pretty hungry.  The sausage was good, and the sauce and cheese were delicious.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but I did not really think it was as good as everyone clamoured it to be.  What I found disappointing was the sausage.  It tasted good, but it was obvious that the sausage was pre-shaped into a circular shape to be used as topping and the entire thing put on the pizza before being cooked in the oven.  The entire circular mass of sausage would move when you maneuver the pizza.
