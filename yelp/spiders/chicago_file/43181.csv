Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been to this restaurant a few times and have loved it. But tonight we had an unfortunate situation with the manager SCOTT. We had a reservation and were seated, the manager approached & asked us rudely to move bc he thought we sat there without the staff seating us and we needed for wait for another table. When we inquired about the mix up and how much longer we would need to wait he had a "fit" and again suggested we were in the wrong.and wanted us to point out which staff member sat us, obviously again insinuating that we were in the wrong. He made a scene in front of the restaurant and was really embarrassing himself. We all know managers like this do not last long.
