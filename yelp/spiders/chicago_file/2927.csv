The Purple Pig////Beware, though, because this place is so delicious, there is usually a wait. They do not take reservations. I've waited anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 hours. The smaller your party, the less wait time, as there are many communal tables. Also, they are open late and are not as busy after the dinner rush (arrive around 9). BUT they have excellent wine and cocktails that you can sip on while you wait with some seating and comfortable places to stand while you wait.
