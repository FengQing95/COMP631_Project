Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza quality and flavor was great. Service was excellent. The crust and sauce really made it for me. Our teen daughter did not like it. The combination of butter & the pepperoni oil made it way too oily for her. Overall, I thought it was great! Will definitely have Lou's on our next trip.
