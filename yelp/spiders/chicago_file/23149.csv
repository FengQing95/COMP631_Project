Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Finally, got the notification that our table was ready.  We sat down and placed our orders.  I thought that our pizza would be ready, but nope...we had to wait an extra 20-30 mins.  With that, we just decided to order the wings.  Now, the wings are delicious and we were excited to eat our pizza.  The pizza came out and I was SOOO exited.
