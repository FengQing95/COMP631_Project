Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here on a double date, and the other couple who apparently love the place proceeded to order everything off the menu. Would have been frustrating had they not paid for the meal at the end. I suppose that's why they were so liberal with their selections. But I have to say, the food was pretty good. I am not a fan of the goat cheese, but the spicy potatoes were delicious. Instead of going into detail on everything we ate that night, suffice it to say that the majority of the dishes were tasty and the portions were filling. We also ordered the red and white sangrias. On this particular occasion, the red sangria was the winner. The prices are a little high, but it's at least worth a try if you're searching for a tapas place in the neighborhood. Fist pump!
