Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Been around forever on Halsted and have visited multiple times because it was in neighborhood.. Seems to be always packed so must be appreciated. I thought this time it was mediocre food and selections. Perhaps because I am not-30 something anymore. What no sherry options on the wine list!? Maybe because we were there this time in afternoon but I asked for full menu which was limited and uninspired. OK, nice to have shrimp in the build your own Bloody Mary etc. but there is no challenge or excitement for me in this place. Probably the only restaurant I have had arguments in. Maybe the wait, traffic, wait, slow service, and loudness.
