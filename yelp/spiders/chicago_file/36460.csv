Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Simply one of the finest steak dining experiences I've had.  Brought my two kids here as well for our last meal in town and the three of us could not have been more satisfied.  The steaks (filet and strip) were spot on!  Mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese sides were a meal in and of themselves.  I really love the old feel to the ambience, and the low lighting makes for a nice intimate atmosphere.
