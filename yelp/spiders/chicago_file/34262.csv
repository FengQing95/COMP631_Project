Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What an amazing birthday dinner! First of all, it's so beautiful inside. I was in love with the lighting and the music. Just perfect! And the service was amazing! I was wished happy birthday about 5 times but not in a cheesy awkward way but definitely sweet and genuine. Anyway, I recommend coming with a big appetite and a group so you can try everything! Which btw I heard there's a wait list for reservations so call now! My boyfriend got a 5:30 reservation after being on the wait list and just took it without second thinking it. Street parking seems a tad bit difficult and I didn't see valet but we got a spothero a block away so it wasn't bad. They have a cute waiting area with sofas that I waited as he parked and was offered the drink menu as I waited.
