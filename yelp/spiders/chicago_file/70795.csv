Little Goat Diner////The Meh ... well I should start by saying I'm not the biggest fan of fusion food. And going into this meal, I didn't know that the little goat diner was going to be all fusion-y. So, especially when I'm hungry and just want diner style simple foods, this did not hit any spots. This also might be why I was in love with the breads that we started with. But I felt like most fusion food, it just tried too hard to be cool. I only had breakfast foods, so maybe the lunch items are better? But what they called kimchee was korean hot pepper paste. Whatever they called hosin sauce was cut too much with rice vinegar that it lost any of the sweet hosin taste.
