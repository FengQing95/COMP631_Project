Smoque BBQ////I kid you not, I nearly climaxed when I was done with my meal. After having the STL style ribs, delicious fries, and BBQ beans, I would have been ok dying in a car accident on my way home. This place is amazing! My tastebuds were never exposed to something so great. Going to Smoque should be on everyone's bucket list. It is a shame that I don't come here often to enjoy the ribs, soft and tender brisket, and everything on the menu.
