Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went with my friend and cousin to one of her favorite tapas restaurants in Chicago. I can see why this is her favorite; everything we tried was excellent, the service was fabulous, and the sangria made our evening. I absolutely love the decor. It can be crowded but it is a great restaurant in a great neighborhood. Love it, love it, love it and I can't wait to go back!
