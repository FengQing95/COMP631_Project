The Purple Pig////Decor-first this place is located in the Magnificent Mile which is a super cool location. One other note, location is not easy to find, but that makes it fun. Large bar, large outdoor eating area, and communal tables describe this place. Upscale everything and I loved the open kitchen so you could see them cook your food.
