Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were seated promptly after I had booked my reservation a month in advance. This place must be pretty popular as I've tried times before and couldn't get dates 2 weeks in advance. We had a very nice corner table where the server did wish my boyfriend a happy birthday as we were here for his dinner, and I did note that in my comments through Open Table. I ordered the Bone In 'Delmonico' Strip and a side of the Creamed Spinach. I was appreciative of the server letting me know that the side was a little spicy, and it was and really yummy. I love the ambiance of the place warm, cozy, and romantic. It can be dressy or casual. The staff was friendly and the prices were reasonable. I can see why so many people like this place. I would certainly like to come back.
