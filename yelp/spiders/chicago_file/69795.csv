Little Goat Diner////The rest of the food didn't fare so well.  The pork belly pancake was good..in theory.  But there wasn't enough pork belly!  By the end, I had eaten all the pork, had eaten most of the pancake (which was tasty...) but seriously had over a cup of the slaw left.  They pile on all the slaw to hide the fact there is hardly any meat!  My friend ate his burger, said it was ok, but far from the best he'd ever had.
