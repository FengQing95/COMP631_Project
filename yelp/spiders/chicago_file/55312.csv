Smoque BBQ////My friend ordered a 1/2 brisket sandwich, chopped, and I ordered a 1/2 brisket sandwich sliced.  The bread felt cheap, like the Hawaiian buns you buy at the jewel.  While the traditional BBQ sauce was delicious, the vinegar sauce had a terrible aftertaste; I love Carolina BBQ, so I love vinegar sauce.
