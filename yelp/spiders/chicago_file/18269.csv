Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Every time I'm in Chicago I have to go to Lou's. It's perfect deep dish pizza! Coming from Brooklyn, home of the "foldable slice", it's nice to have something different. Pizza with a knife and fork is a big change for a New Yorker but as long as it tastes this good, I'm willing. Awesome pizza! You have to try it.
