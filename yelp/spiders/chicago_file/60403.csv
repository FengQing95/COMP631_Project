Smoque BBQ////- pulled pork - The pork was decent - a B-.  It was nicely-pulled, had a nice bit of smoke and was tender.  However, it was probably cooked a little too long as some parts were borderline mushy.  It also seemed to be a little underseasoned too me.  It was also served with the sauce already on - which is a no-no (good meat should be able to stand on its own).
