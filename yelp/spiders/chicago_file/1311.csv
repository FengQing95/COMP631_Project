Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The wait was long but very well worth it.  Outstanding food, good service, and they operate like a NASCAR pit crew.  My wife had some brisket thingy for breakfast while I had the Mexicana platter.  Neither of us could decide what we wanted so we ordered the Cinnamon French Toast also.  That was a little slice of heaven.   The best surprise was that the price was cheap for Chicago.
