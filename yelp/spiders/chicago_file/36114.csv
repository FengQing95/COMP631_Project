Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////i came here for a really late dinner on fri night.  our reservation was at 10, which was fine, since i was on CA time anyway.  3 of us shared the shrimp cocktail, pork chop, fried chicken, lamb chops (which i didn't try), and sides of creamed spinach, brussels sprouts, and elote corn.  everything was delicious, especially the pork chop and corn.  as if this wasn't enough, we got the chocolate cream pie to share at the end, which was rich and decadent.
