Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I definitely underestimated Bavette's! I honestly didn't have any expectation for Bavette's since it's a bar/restaurant. My friend insisted on checking this place out so we ended up making reservations. We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation and went to the bar to grab a drink. We were lucky to grab seats at the bar and the bartender told us that we could just eat at the bar if we wanted to. Love that this place has an extensive list of entrees including steak, chicken, lamb, fish, pork chop, and etc. I guarantee you'll be able to find something you like at Bavette's.
