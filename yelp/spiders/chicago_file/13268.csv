Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm in Chicago on a business trip and sick of hotel food. My group and I decided to head into the city for some traditional deep dish pizza. We got a recommendation to visit Lous and boy am I glad we did. The food was amazing and plentiful and the service was... Blehhh:p just kidding. Jason was bustin our chops all night long but we loved it.
