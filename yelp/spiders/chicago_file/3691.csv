The Purple Pig////I'll be honest, the wait sucked. We got there around 830 on a saturday hoping the line would be shorter, which it was (we waited an hour), but i hate waiting longer than 15 mins for food, so it was not fun for me. but i was happy that we didn't have to wait two hours like some other people who got there earlier did. i didn't have a chance to walk around that area, but my recommendation would be to put your name down and walk around/maybe grab a snack while you're waiting. anyway, when i have waited a long time for food, i get hangry and annoyed, so i wasn't too happy when we were finally seated. i'm providing this detail because our waiter was simply incredible at lifting our spirits. I'm sure he's used to getting a bunch of hungry, tired, bored people who've waited for literally hours, but he's so good at creating a positive atmosphere. needless to say, he really helped make our experience that much better.
