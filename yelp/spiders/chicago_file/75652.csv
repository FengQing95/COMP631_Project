Little Goat Diner////Since they don't take reservations, we didn't know what to expect in terms of a wait. Lucky for us, we went late enough that we only had a few minutes to wait before being shown to a nice, comfy booth that fit the five of us quite nicely. The wallpaper that covers the walls inside reminds me of something my grandmother once had, and the entire place had a somewhat cozy, homey feel to it.
