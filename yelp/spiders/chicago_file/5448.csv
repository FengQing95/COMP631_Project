The Purple Pig////Just had dinner today for my 5th wedding anniversary.  Was really excited to eat here as this was our first time despite being in chicago for the last 4 years. We were seated promptly and the place was very clean with nice soothing music in the background. We ordered the crispy pig ear, the bone marrow, roasted beets, half duck and milk braised pork. To be honest, the crispy pig ear almost tasted like nothing. We couldnt tell if it was actual meat and the crispy kale that it comes with was seasoned quite heavily with salt. Hats off to the chef on understanding what works with what. If you eat the fried ear, fried kale and egg in one bite, the whole dish kinda makes sense, but the dish on its own wasnt worth the hype. The bone marrow and roasted beets were brought next. I was actually incredibly excited to try the bone marrow and for 25 bucks it better be worth the hype! I was thoroughly disappointed  the bone marrow comes with slices of toasted bread and some parsley with capers salad. The bone marrow had 0 flavor which was really disappointing. On top of that, the pickled capers were super salty so the salad itself did not taste that good either. What actually caught me by surprise were the roasted beets. Wow! I cannot compliment the chef enough for putting this dish on the menu. The beets had a nice sweet flavor and were paired with goat cheese foam, pistachios and peanut butter. I really realpy enjoyed eating these and my wife doesnt really like beets and she ended up loving this dish! 5 stars for the roasted beets! We then had the milk braised pork and boy was this a big fail  the meat was really tender but SO salty. The pork was served with mashed potatoes and gravy and i guess really salty pork with mildly salted mashed potatoes and gravy kinda works but man, this dish definitely did not live up to all the comments. I think the pork was brined in too much salt since the meat was salty in and out. I actually ate the pork with some of the roasted beets to offset the saltiness. Wouldve imagined that at least the pork dishes would be perfectly seasoned since the restaurant has a pig in its name! Finally had the duck and boy oh boy, im so glad we ate that as our last dish. The duck was seasoned perfectly (a little more salt wouldve turned it really salty) and its combination along with yoghurt and fish eggs turned out perfectly! Duck skin is one of the most heavenly things out there and this dish didnt disappoint for sure. We really enjoyed it a lot. We also ended up ordering the panna cotta as this would be our second time having panna cotta in our lives. Im not too experienced with this but the panna cotta here isnt really jelloey. It was kinda condensed and didnt taste as milky as i thought it would but didnt really taste bad either. All in all, the food was just ok in my view. I again would like to compliment the chef for coming up with the combination of ingredients in each dish because they really seemed to work but the over seasoning really killed it. The kitchen staff should really keep a look out for over seasoning such expensive dishes. Not really sure if the regular customer enjoys their food this salty and at $20+, the dishes should be more palatable. I really loved the service we were provided. We told our server that it was our 5th anniversary and she went ahead a got us a candle to make it extra special for us. So definitely 5 stars for the service but probably just 3 for the food. My advice would be to definitely AVOID the bone marrow and the milk braised pork. You could try the fried pork ear for fun but its nothing to rave about. Definitely get the beets and the half duck as you won't be disappointed.
