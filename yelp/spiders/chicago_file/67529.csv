Little Goat Diner////The wait time was long but the food was pretty good! Â I expected it to be a little better but my boyfriends meal was top notch. I got the gravy and biscuits and my boyfriend got the fat elvis. Service was okay but I only got one drink refill out of several table visits and the wait for the food was pretty long as well
