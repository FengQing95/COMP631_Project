Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place the ambiance is great if you're looking for dim lighting. The servers and everyone there are great. I like the open kitchen concept and seeing the chefs create their work. I highly recommend their burger with thick cut bacon and their handmade Fettuccine, also don't forget a side of their thick cut bacon
