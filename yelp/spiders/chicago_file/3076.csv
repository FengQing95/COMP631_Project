The Purple Pig////I was more of a fan of the appetizers (which were cheaper) than the entrees of octopus and pork. Overall total was $54, which seems a lot for four small plates. Other than that, service was great. Our server was really nice. Constant water refills. I'd recommend with a bit of caution.
