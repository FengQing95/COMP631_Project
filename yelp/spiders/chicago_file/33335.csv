Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Side note:  I never know if I should be rating a place based on what it is or verses all restaurants out there.  Bavette's is up there with some of the best restaurants I have been too so I did hold it to a higher standard in my ratings perhaps it should have a 4.80 stars but it wasn't perfect so I can't go with 5.
