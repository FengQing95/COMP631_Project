Smoque BBQ////The brisket was charred just right, moist & juicy on the inside.  I had it on a sammich with bread almost as thick as Texas toast (which is a good thing).  I also tried the "Texas Sausage."  It was as good as you could get it up here--- with flavor of mesquite wood and a bit of pecan.. it tasted the way I expected -- which is as good an endorsement as any.
