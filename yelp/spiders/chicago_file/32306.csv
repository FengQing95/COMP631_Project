Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Slightly off the beaten path from most touristy spots in/around downtown, so we didn't have to wait to be seated. As to be expected, great service, amazing Ceasar salad, and 'The Lou' (spinach, fresh tomatoes, and 'shrooms) with added sausage was excellent. I enjoyed it with the house Chianti. Next time, we'll try a different Chicago pizza joint, but would definitely come back to Lou's if given the opportunity!
