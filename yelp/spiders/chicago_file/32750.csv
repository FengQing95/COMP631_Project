Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I ordered a burger...this is usually against my foody religion. Im still dreaming about my burger. Best choice I've made in a while. I also had oysters, which were phenomenally fresh and sweet. The smoked trout caesar salad is worth a try as well. No complaints on this one, Ill definitely be going back.
