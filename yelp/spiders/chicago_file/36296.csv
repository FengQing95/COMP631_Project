Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Delicious dinner, fantastic environment, great cocktails! All around would highly recommend. The one downfall is making reservations is extremely difficult, however, it makes sense since the quality of restaurant is so high. Went early evening in the middle of the week and was still packed even then.
