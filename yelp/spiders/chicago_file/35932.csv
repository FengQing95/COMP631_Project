Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I feel compelled to further highlight the staff at Bavette's. My friend has Celiac disease - so she cannot eat gluten. The Foie Gras was served with slices of delicious toast - which was great for me, but not so much for her. When asked for an alternate option for my friend, our fantastic waiter talked with the chef and brought her a plate of apple and carrot slices. It was perfect and very much appreciated. All of the staff were friendly, helpful and attentive.
