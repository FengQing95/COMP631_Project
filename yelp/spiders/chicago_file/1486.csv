Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Awesome atmosphere super clean friendly and efficient wait staff huge menu. Presentation was really nice just like all the pictures show but the actual texture of the pancake is very soggy....I had the signature berry bliss. Obviously aesthetics are important but taste and texture is everything. Ill definitely go back to try something else but ill steer clear of the pancakes. By the way big portions so i suggest two people splitting.
