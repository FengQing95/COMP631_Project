Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first visit to Lou Malnati's and it did not disappoint. We arrived around 6:45pm and was told it would be a 30 min wait, it was fairly accurate. Once we sat down we had a Cesar salad while our pizza finished cooking. The personal size chicago style pizza was enough for two people and it was delicious.
