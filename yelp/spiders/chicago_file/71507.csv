Little Goat Diner////Food here has always been on point. I like the whole spin on the diner food...and the menu selection is quite large. Another thing I like about this place is that although the food is "comfort" food, it doesn't sit heavy--or at least not with the food I've ever ordered. Â I ordered the veggie burger and was totally surprised at how amazing it was. The server told me that they make the veggie burgers in house, which definitely was evident!
