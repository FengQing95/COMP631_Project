Smoque BBQ////As exaggerating as it sounds, Smoque BBQ blew my mind away. It was that good. The beef brisket sandwich was delicious. It was slightly burnt and had a nice texture to it. You get BBQ sauce with it too. Now this is good BBQ food. Try all their side dishes, they are all fantastic. I really liked the peach cobbler and the cole slaw. The peach cobbler...fresh pieces of peaches and a nice crumble on top. Amazing! I don't like cole slaw from Popeye's, KFC, or grocery stores but the cole slaw here is fresh and a vinegar base which makes you crave for more.
