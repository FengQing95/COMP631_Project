Art Institute of Chicago////There's all sorts of art here, from ceramics to photography to a ton of classic paintings.  (Van Gogh, Monet... The Old Guitarist by Picasso!)  They got whole sections devoted to ancient Greek and Roman art, Asian art, African art, Native American art.  There's the room of miniature rooms that I missed out on, as well as the paperweight collection.  So like, essentially, anything you'd wanna see.  And the top twelve "must-see" guide is on the back of their map for the convenience of those who came to just see the classics.  (But honestly, I don't know how you couldn't get distracted...)
