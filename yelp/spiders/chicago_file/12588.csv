Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was pretty angry that Matt did not even want to step up and help explain why the bill should have been adjusted. We never asked for the pizzas to be taken off the bill. Matt just came out and said they would be on him. We he first said that, we were all impressed and said we would definately leave a nice tip but after that the service level completely dropped off. We spent about two hours there. We saw other tables come and go. Waited 1/2 hour for dessert and the check.
