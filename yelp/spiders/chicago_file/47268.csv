Smoque BBQ////The MOST enjoyable part of coming here, though, was the service! Everyone was very well conducted. They were always checking how the food was, etc. etc. And because of the atmosphere, even when the place was fully packed, the customers remained in good spirits as well. I'd ordered, with family, and we were getting ready to leave when I wanted to get some to go. One of the staff saw it was my second time in line and saw the rest of my party had left, so he rushed my order and got me out of there quick. It was a great trip experience (if you discount the issue of rush hour Chicago traffic, but hey, what can you do, right?).
