Little Goat Diner////Good food, no flexibility. I requested a different type of bread for my Reuben and was happy to pay any necessary surcharges. After I made my request, the waitress stopped taking the rest of the table's orders, walked away, and subsequently started to help other tables. It was not until over 5 minutes later that she came back to our table. At which point I was told they make exactly the amount of bread for each item that they plan to sell as such I could not get what I wanted even if I was happy to pay for it. Plenty of other options in the area...will not be returning.
