Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This time my baby shower was hosted here in a private room that accommodated my 50 person party! I cannot express how friendly and accommodating the wait staff was, anything we needed, they provided! The food and drinks were brought out in a timely manor! This is a wonderful location for a private party, they are so flexible, make any changes to the room that you need and help you set up and clean up the room so fast!!
