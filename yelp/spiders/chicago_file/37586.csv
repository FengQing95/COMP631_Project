Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The interior of the restaurant is dark and woodsy; which gives it a cool atmosphere. However, the lack of lighting makes it pretty much impossible to do anything in this joint! I felt like I needed a 100 watt flashlight to see my date, read the menu, make my way to the bathroom and see what I was doing in the bathroom.
