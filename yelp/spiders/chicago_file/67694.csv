Little Goat Diner////The atmosphere is pretty typical of any West Loop - hipster, modern and energetic. The staff is friendly. The food was definitely different than your typical diner food but we definitely enjoyed the tasty experience. I had the Kimchi + Bacon + Egg Pancake, which was fantastic. The grits are great. The Bullseye French Toast was tasty and the Corned Beef Hash Egg was good although it was a little salty. The Spanish omelete looked good on the menu but definitely aggressive with the mix of food.
