Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Every thing was plated beautifully! Each sauce was delicious and complemented its star ingredient without overpowering it. We really enjoyed our experience here and can't wait to go back to try more! I would like to also add that they never left empty plates on our table (which I appreciate because I hate a lot of unnecessary things on the table). Water was always filled quickly also.
