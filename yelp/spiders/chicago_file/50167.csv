Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went with the short rib which was extremely succulent and tender and the ham/chorizo and manchego plate. Our side was the spicy potatoes which although were not spicy at all, had a great tomato alioli to go along with it. If you do find yourself hungry they also bring out Bread and Olive Oil to dip which is a huge plus as well.
