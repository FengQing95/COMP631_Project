Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////While visiting Chicago on a business trip, was recommended by the concierges at the hotel to go here for pizza. Service was friendly, they were packed for dinner, they suggested we place our order while we wait to be seated. Once seated, service was friendly and efficient. Bruschetta was fabulous and Lou's original pizza was very good. Overall a great experience, I will be back here with family on my next personal trip to Chicago.
