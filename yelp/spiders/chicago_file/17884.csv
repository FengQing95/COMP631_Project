Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The crust just wasn't for me. It was very crispy and buttery but too hard. There was none of the soft, moist bready center that other Chicago deep dishes feature. Some people may enjoy the fact that the crust has a substantial amount of density, but I wanted something with more yeast, a little lighter. The sauce was unremarkable and the big sausage patty was good, but on the overwhelming side. The pizza was good, but I wouldn't head back here for my signature Chicago-style. It's all a matter of personal preference. Find your own!
