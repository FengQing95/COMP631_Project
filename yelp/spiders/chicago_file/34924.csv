Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I didn't have the opportunity to try out downstairs for as long as I would like, but it's made to be a speakeasy feel featuring old school east coast hip hop (whaaaaaaaaat?!).  Next time I go I will make sure to sip on some whiskey in this little nook because the vibe was right.  Everything about this place is right!
