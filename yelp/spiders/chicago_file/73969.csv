Little Goat Diner////We came back here a second time. I got the patty melt with beef this time and again it was cheesy and delicious. My hubby got the sloppy goat sammich and a side of fries. He really liked it. My sister got chili cheese fries and said they were really good too! The server was also very nice and we got a nice table outside. Good experience!
