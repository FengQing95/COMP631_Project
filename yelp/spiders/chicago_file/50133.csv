Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The short rib-stuffed piquillo pepper (on the Pinxto platter) had a nice smoky flavor balanced by the mild pepper flavor. I also liked the Spanish cheese and quince (also on the Pinxto platter) just a very simple flavor of semi soft cheese and sweet quince. The salad was also very fresh and so light--I could have eaten the whole plate of salad by myself. The squid was very fresh and tasty--not at all rubbery, but I wished it was a bit hotter. By the time it arrived at the table it was lukewarm. The grilled sirloin was cooked to medium and delicious. The asparagus that came out was more like asparagus tips and there were definitely more potatoes than asparagus and shitake put together.
