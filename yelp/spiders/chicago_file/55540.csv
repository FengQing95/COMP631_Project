Smoque BBQ////I love barbecue, and Smoque is the best I've ever tasted. I am partial to the chopped brisket platter. Even my vegetarian daughter loves their salads. The restaurant is not fancy, but you're going for the food anyway, right? The staff is really kind and helpful too. Plan to arrive early or wait, and don't forget to BYOB.
