Art Institute of Chicago////Either way, you should really consider getting a membership. Coming here on a regular basis is a source for inspiration and enrichment. This is where I saw my first Cy Twombly and other life changing pieces of art. I've never thought to myself "Wow, I wish I didn't get that Art Institute membership - what a waste!"
