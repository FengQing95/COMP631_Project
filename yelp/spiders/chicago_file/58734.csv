Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food here is phenomenal and I loved it -- however, we had a reservation for 7 and when we got there with 7 + an infant, we were told we had to wait an additional 20 mins just because of adding a baby. Though the food left a great taste in my mouth, that experience left a bad taste in my mouth because it didn't seem very pro-family. Typically, adding a child is not a big deal as you simply pull up a high chair or the guests can hold the infant, which we offered to do. However, the hostile attitude of the hostess made us feel like the baby was a burden. 5 stars for food and 2 stars for service. Would love to know what the restaurant plans to do as a follow up.
