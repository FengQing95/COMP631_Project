Little Goat Diner////The menu had a lot of twists to what regular diner food would be. I decided to try the Fried Pickles and Onion Rings with curry mayo as well as the Crispy Shrimp Cocktail romen noodle wrapped shrimp served over lettuce wraps that you are supposed to use to eat the shrimp with. The Onion rings pretty much tasted like fried pickles because the onions were fried with the pickles. The battery was very light and over all tasty. The Shrimp was a little different. I personally think there were to many noodles wrapped around the shrimp because on the outside the noodles were perfectly crisp but the ones on the inside were a little soggy.
