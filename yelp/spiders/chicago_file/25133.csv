Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our first time in Chicago and of course we had to try the famous deep dish pizza.   It's was worth the 2 hours (1 hour wait for our table and another hour for the pizza).   Excellent pizza.   We also ordered calamari (it was ok but the sauce was good) and buffalo wings (it was also ok).   Anyway, we went there for the pizza.   Next time no more appetizers, because the pizza was humongous!   Their Bloody Mary was also very good!
