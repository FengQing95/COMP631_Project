Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The complaint was that we were a party at four without a reservation. We were told that if we arrived when they opened just before 5, it wouldn't be an issue that night. Three of our four arrived just as they opened and we asked for a table, the host said they could seat us once our fourth arrived and it shouldn't be an issue but our fourth was going to be like 20 minutes behind us. Once he arrived, we went back and the host said it'd be an hour and a half wait. What the hell? I don't understand why they didn't seat us, why they weren't up front with us regarding the wait, or why it was suddenly 1.5 hours!
