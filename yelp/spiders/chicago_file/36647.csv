Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were in Chicago celebrating our anniversary for a long weekend and my husband wanted us to have a nice dinner at a steakhouse. Even though i do not eat red meat, i was sure i would find something to eat. We made a reservation (recommended)and took an Uber from the hotel. When we arrived, we were warmly greeted and shown to our table, which was actually located underground, almost like in a cellar. Pretty neat space, very upscale in decor and the ambiance is nice. All through the restaurant is dimmed lights, only illuminated by candlelight, which adds to the romantic atmosphere.
