Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We luckily had no problem getting a table and were able to sit at a booth right away. First things first, the menu all sounds DELISH. We had the hardest time deciding on what to try. Our lovely waitress recommended the Chicago Classic. A butter crust sausage pizza that they're well known for, and we were not disappointed. That crust was hella buttery, but equally hella tasty. The crushed tomatoes on top was the perfect balance to all the sausage and crust. Super thick, the definition of a Chicago deep dish. Absolutely would get this again.
