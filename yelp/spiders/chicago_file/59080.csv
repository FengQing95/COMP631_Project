Smoque BBQ////The nice-sized brisket and pulled pork sandwiches and platters have a terrific depth of flavor, with that smoky tang that takes you to the Carolinas, or Memphis, or someplace down there. Individual ramekins of cornbread and mac and cheese are noteworthy complements, and the BBQ beans should not be missed. They do a nice salad that you can add chicken to, and they serve it with a creamy ranch dressing that makes it very rich. I think I would add a few drops of sauce to that dressing for a bit more piquancy. All in all a lovely experience, comforting and reasonably priced. Get in there!
