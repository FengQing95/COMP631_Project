Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Not that I'm knocking it! It's pretty tasty, all around. I liked the buttery crust, the molten cheese, and the healthy smattering of toppings. It was all pretty solid. But the sauce was just not hitting it for me... no seasoning, no herbs, no spices. Just tomato-y and slightly acidic (which was actually all right.)
