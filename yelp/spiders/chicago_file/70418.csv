Little Goat Diner////I honestly just wasn't impressed.  Very "bougie" and "LA".  Extremely overpriced.  They did not give much food because everything is "a la carte". Just a waste of money, in my opinion.  The food wasn't memorable but it wasn't bad by any means.  If you have a lot of money then you have nothing to worry about.
