Smoque BBQ////The dining experience is cafeteria style. We jumped at the first available standalone table - I don't like eating next to strangers... Anyway, that's why I'm taking away a star. I wish the ambiance was a bit more comfy and it would be great if they found a way to incorporate some outside seating.
