Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I guarantee you will find plenty of items to tickle your taste buds... and if your starting to get nervous about the food, order some Sangria and relax!! Have a good time!! Do not come to Cafe BaBaReeba if you are in a rush, I have never spent less than 2 hours here and I do not recommend any less.
