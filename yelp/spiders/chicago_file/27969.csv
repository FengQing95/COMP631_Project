Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I really don't know what the hype is about this pizza. The time it took to get the pizza built up an anticipation that simply just wasn't justified. The service we received was excellent, but the pizza and appetizers were just "okay." I've definitely had better deep dish while visiting Chicago.
