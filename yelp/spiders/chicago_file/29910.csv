Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first deep dish experience and I was already hesitant because I'm not sure how I feel about my pizza being a pie essentially. I'm your basic gal from Texas so a regular crust pizza is definitely satisfying to me. We landed in Chicago pretty late so we weren't sure if there would be a line or not so called to make place an order. I'm not sure if we were allowed to do this but when we got there, there wasn't really a line a some tables were opened so we asked if we were able to move out order to dine-in and they let us. Super sweet! It might look like a small restaurant but it goes in pretty deep, like a deep dish pizza, I guess. The restaurant has an old timey vibe that is very cozy, perfect for date night. I'm guessing it wasn't too busy because it was on a Friday night before Easter but we were thankful that we were able to eat there.
