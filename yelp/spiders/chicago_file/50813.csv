Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We used to be regulars at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba. Fast forward to 15 years, and I had a Lettuce Entertain You gift card. Saw they still had good reviews on yelp (failed to notice the 450+ hidden reviews), and thought we'd give it a try. Out of the eight tapas plates that we had, only three were OK--the chicken empanada, the meatballs, and the goat cheese. That's not much for $68 worth of food and two glasses of Sangria. The calamari was tough and overdone. The tomato bread was cold, soggy, and just weird. The lamb kabob was literally raw in the middle, charred on the outside and contained bones or something else hard. It was inedible. That was removed from the bill. I didn't complain. Just didn't eat it. Couldn't eat the chicken and sausage skewer either. The chicken was oddly tough and to me it seemed underdone, but it was hard to see due to dim lighting. The Sangria's were still phenomenal, but unfortunately, we will never go back.
