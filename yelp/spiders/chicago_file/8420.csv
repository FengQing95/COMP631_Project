Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute also has quite a few fine Van Goghs.   I particularly like his painting "bedroom in Arles".  Which is a dumpy one room apartment that I model my home after.  I wonder if his management company was a bunch of unresponsive jerks who didn't respond to a simple request  like an email asking to fix a couple of broken floor boards.  Even though he asked nicely.  And then they raise your rent ever single year for no reason at all except pure meanness.  Yeah, I can see why he cut his ear off.  Sons of bitches.
