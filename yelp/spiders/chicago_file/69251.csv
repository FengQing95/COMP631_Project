Little Goat Diner////Fresh squeezed orange juice and a cup of coffee to drink. A cinnamon bun and sausage gravy biscuit to start. Both were good -- cinnamon bun was great. Sourdough pancakes were very good, but for some reason I fell in love with the syrup. It's so good. Where was this before I went on a low carb diet? Â I recommend ordering anything you can pour this syrup on. Oh yeah -- finished off with the bulls eye French toast. It's very good as well.
