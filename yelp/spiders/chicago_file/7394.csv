Art Institute of Chicago////Located in the heart of downtown at 100 south this museum is a place you must see at least once while in Chicago. Paintings from the masters are everywhere thru-out the building. There are many sculptures and ancient artifacts and even jewlery collections from the Egyptians. I also get a kick out of the long hall lined with ancient armour and weapons. It's inspiring to go here and I also recomend the School of the Art Inst. for those learning.
