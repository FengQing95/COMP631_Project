Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came here to try out the deep dish pizza and I was not disappointed! I ordered a personal sized classic deep dish pizza with the minestrone soup as an appetizer. In retrospect, it probably would have been better to call ahead and order, as they said it takes about 45 minutes to prepare a deep dish pizza. The minestrone soup was tasty; I'm not too familiar with the cuisine, so I don't know what minestrone soup is "supposed" to be, but I was pretty happy with mine. When the pizza finally came out, it did not disappoint. The sausage disk was super tasty, as was the generous amounts of melty cheese. The crust was also crispy and tasty by itself which was awesome. Overall, I had a great experience and would definitely come back again.
