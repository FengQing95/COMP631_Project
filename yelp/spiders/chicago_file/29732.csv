Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went here for pizza. Loved the lou's salad. We ordered ahead. Checked out the recommendations for the Italian sausage which was good but the pie crust style wasn't our favorite. We're still arguing between some of the other pizza places. Maybe someday we will know the real Chicago pizza king. Though we may not be Chicago pizza people.
