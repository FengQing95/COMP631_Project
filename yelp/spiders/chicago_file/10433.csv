Art Institute of Chicago////On a recent family trip, my mom was amazing enough to buy me a membership to the museum, and so in the past month I've been able to go several times. Â You might think that you'd get bored of hanging out at a museum once a week, but honestly, every time I go I just get more and more excited to go again.
