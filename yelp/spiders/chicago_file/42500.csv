Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////More Pro than Con: The mushroom and sherry soup, the sweet potato bravas, spinach and manchego mushrooms, and goat cheese baked in tomato sauce were just alerady. The soup tasted similar to traditional mushroom soup that I could make myself, and there really was no "pop" of flavor. Â The sweet potato bravas were just sweet potato fries served with some kind of aioli. It said it was pomegranate aioli, but that must have been the nectar of the gods as far as I'm concerned. It was sweet and tangy, and perfectly complemented the sweetness of the fries. It may have been balsamic aioli now that I think of it. The goat cheese baked in tomato sauce was literally just that. A round of goat cheese in a traditional tomato sauce. Not worth getting unless you want something to dip your bread it. Comes with pesto bread as well that were alright. The filling for the mushrooms was creamy and delicious. The mushrooms themselves weren't seasoned well at all. I found myself eating the inside and leaving the mushroom caps.
