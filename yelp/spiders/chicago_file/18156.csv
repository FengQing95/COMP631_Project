Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I heard from everyone how great Lou's was for their pizza. However, we were shocked to find that it didn't live up to all the hype. The crust was clearly not fresh and probably premade or frozen. Ordered two deep dishes and two flatbread. The deep dish was among the least favorite I've tried while in town. The flatbread was one the better flarbread in the area. However compared to the pizza I have back home, there is no comparison and it just doesn't cut it.
