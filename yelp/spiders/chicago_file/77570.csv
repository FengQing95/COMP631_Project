Little Goat Diner////Service - Our server was friendly & attentive, and was great tending to our needs.  But the restaurant was packed on a Wednesday night, and we had to flag him down a few times.  Service was delayed, but this is really due to how busy they were.  When available, our server was sure to get our orders in and did a great job following up.  Bonus, he made a few great recommendations from the huge menu that turned out to be table pleasers.  1/2 Star.
