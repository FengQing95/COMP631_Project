Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////...but I still recommend trying the pizza! It is definitely NOT like UNO's chains. However, do keep in mind that the cooking time will be a while (30- 45 min to make), so try to distract your hunger with something else if you dont want to eat too much beforehand! I came here around 5-ish on Friday, and by the time I was done with my meal, the place was packed with people coming in for dinner hour (sardines in a can)!
