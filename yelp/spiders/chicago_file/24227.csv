Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I wanted to love this place! But the combination of the long wait then soggy calamari and warm pizza, it just all went downhill. The service could have been better too by offering us to replace the app/pizza since I'm sure she knew the pizza was cold. Watching every other table with piping hot pizza, I knew something was wrong. Â Didn't even want to complain since it was already 10:30pm and we already missed the fireworks. What a disastrous night.
