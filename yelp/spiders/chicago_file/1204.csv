Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I was skeptical given the fact that this place's location will lead people in the door by default, but the food was actually good. That said, specialty pancakes aren't exactly the highest form of culinary genius. If you have to eat brunch in the loop and are willing to wait over an hour, go for it.
