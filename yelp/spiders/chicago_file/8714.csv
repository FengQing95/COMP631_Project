Art Institute of Chicago////I won't describe the pieces of art here since my kudos in that regard belongs to the artists and not the museum.  However, the museum does a fantastic job of tailoring the rooms that house the pieces to the style of the pieces themselves.  For instance, they had an exhibit on modern Japanese fashion and when you went into that room, the whole room was painted black with low lighting and many wooden vertical black beams arranged in an open space like a courtyard (or, perhaps, an abstract forest) with the fashion pieces in the distance along a wall.  The setup of the room was a work of art in itself.
