Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Love Bavette's!! We sat in the basement, which is a bit dark but was perfect for our date night and celebration. The waiter was on point with his attentiveness and care. I wish I knew his name so I could give him a shout out here for his awesomeness. Dinner and drinks were pricey but I would definitely come back for a special occasion. One qualm was the hostesses at the stand. There were four standing there and we waited while they finished gossiping before they even looked at us. When they did, they all looked at us like we were stupid when we asked for a table. Felt like I walked into a bad sorority party.
