Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chicago is synonymous with good pizza. Lou Malnatti's is easily in the top 5 of anyone who's in the know's deep dish pizza spots. Regardless of the crust you pick (Buttercrust is a must for first-timers), you can't lose with their fresh ingredients and seasoning mixes. Gluten-free? No worries... grab a "crustless" and enjoy.
