Little Goat Diner////I'm usually not a fan of Asian fusion brunch, but this place was AWESOME!! Get their french toast and little pig goes to china. The french toast has such a nice contrast between sweet and savory, and the little pig goes to china has such crispy biscuits and interesting asian-inspired sauce. Def try!
