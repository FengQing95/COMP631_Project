Smoque BBQ////I'm not much of a meat eater .. so you might be asking what I was doing at a BBQ joint.  Well, my dad saw them on the Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins ad Dives.  My family loves BBQ and I live for mac and cheese.  Seeing that they had mac and cheese on the menu, I couldn't pass up a trip to try it out.  I also ordered the 1/2 chicken and fresh cut fries.  I'm picky about my chicken and theirs was just awesome - very flavorful and cooked just right.  And the mac and cheese was to die for!!  They serve it up in small foil cups with a crunchy breadcrumb top.   Yum!  I shared the fries with my group and we all kept reaching for more.  Even though I am not much of a meat eater, my family is and they all loved their dishes (ribs, brisket and all the sides).  Like I said, we started talking about our next visit before leaving our first and we continued to talk about it the whole way home.
