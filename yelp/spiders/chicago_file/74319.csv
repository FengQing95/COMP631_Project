Little Goat Diner////Ordered a Caesar salad to go.  Turns out, it's not a Caesar salad, at least not in the traditional sense.  Way too much going on in there.  Loved the radicchio, but found the unexpected addition of red peppers, zucchini and apples overwhelming.  The mint was a nice, subtle addiction, and the croutons were fantastic.  I was hoping for the punch of Parmesan and overall simplicity of a basic Caesar, so I was a little disappointed.  I guess if that's the only thing on the menu that ends up disappointing, they're doing something right.
