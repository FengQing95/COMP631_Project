Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm not quite sure what I was expecting upon coming to Lou Malnatis.  I did quite a bit of research of which deep dish I wanted to try in Chicago and had chosen this place.   It was solidified by the fact we have some friends in Chicago who suggested we meet there for dinner.
