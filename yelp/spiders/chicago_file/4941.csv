The Purple Pig////(+++) Pork spare ribs with BBQ sauce + farro ($18): Omg this is possibly the most meticulously fine-tuned ribs I've ever had. The meat is so tender it appears to fall off the bone spontaneously, and the flavors are robust with prominent smokey tones, with hints of bacon and ham. I thought the thick overlaying sauce would be overwhelming, but the mix of BBQ sauce and creamy yogurt-like drizzle added dimensions of familiarity and novelty. Not sure if I could go back to plain old BBQ ribs now.
