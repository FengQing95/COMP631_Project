Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.
