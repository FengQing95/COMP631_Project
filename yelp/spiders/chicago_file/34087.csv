Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Stating the obvious here, there are great steak restos all over Chicago that I've been so why return? This place is part of the same restaurant group as Maude's, Gilt and Au Chavel and I've had great meals in all three, and once a very long time ago here. Granted, I didn't order the same thing then as I did last night, but wow was I disappointed!
