Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food from Cafe Ba Ba Reeba is always exquisite - I love small plates because you get to try EVERYTHING if you want.  I used to be all about the hot tapas, but after trying the seafood salad, shrimp, scallops & squid, I've been converted.  If you pick the right combinations of tapas, there will literally be an explosion in your mouth.  I'm not joking.
