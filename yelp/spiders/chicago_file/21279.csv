Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Wow. That is all I can say and even that does not justice to this pizza. This pizza has awesome crust, the toppings are super fresh, and oh man the cheese is outta control. One bite of this gooey cheese is enough to make me start drooling. The sausage is awesome because as opposed to bits of it, it's essentially a sheet allowing you to have the perfect proportion of sausage, pepperoni, cheese, and fresh tomato in each single bite that you take. Don't bother with the other deep dish places in Chicago and come straight here. You will not regret it and please bring me one!!
