Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We obviously wanted to try some of the sangrias. Our waiter told us that we can order half pitchers, which was great because we just could not decide! We chose the sangria of the day, mango, and cev√© I believe it was called, which was a sparkling sangria. Both were great, but I preferred the mango one, which we ordered a second pitcher of.
