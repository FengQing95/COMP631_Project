Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So, three stars.  If you want appetizers before your pizza, this is a fine place.  Or, if you want to finish those last 80 pages of James Joyce's Ulysses in a setting in which you won't be disturbed for a while, this is fine.  But otherwise, go to Portillos and enjoy the char-grilled sausage with grilled onions...   It won't satisfy your pizza craving, but you'll be on your way to your next stop a lot more quickly.
