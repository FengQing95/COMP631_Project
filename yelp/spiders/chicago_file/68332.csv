Little Goat Diner////We sat in a communal table with a couple other parties. I was worried how they'd react to my daughter who tends to throw food sometimes. But they were receptive. My daughter just stared. Red hair and facial hair keep her interested for a while. I sleekly glance at their half eaten food as I'm trying to decide between the egg, pancake, kimchi Asian breakfast or the breakfast spaghetti w clams. The apple pancakes and hash browns next to us do appeal to us (me, really). We order both the Asian breakfast and breakfast spaghetti for ourselves. We also get hash browns w goat cheese and the apple pancakes "for my daughter".
