Smoque BBQ////I like this place. The BBQ is pretty darn good. Sauce is not overly sweet, which i like. Baked Beans are good, but too sweet. Fries are very good, especially dunked in the BBQ sauce! I just wish the seating area was larger. Sometimes it's not fun eating BBQ when someone's bum is in your face...ack!
