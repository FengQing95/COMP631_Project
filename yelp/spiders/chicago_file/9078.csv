Art Institute of Chicago////On the other hand, many of the lectures are not free. Admission to the museum used to be by voluntary donation but entrance fee is compulsory these days. Rather than make every Tuesday a free day, the Art Institute assigns its statutory 50 free days according to some method that, no doubt, minimizes the impact on its income. Each Chicago Public Library branch has one single free pass to the museum that is available to any CPL member who can snag it. For the above reasons, I think that the museum has become less accessible to the public in the past two decades.
