Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Very memorable and one of the the most unique places I've dined at. We had to wait past our reservation time, but there were seats at the bar downstairs so we started with drinks and appetizers there. The downstairs had an entire different ambiance than the upstairs and was hidden away which we thought was cool. Would highly recommend the filet mignon, truffle Mac and cheese and thick cut bacon! I will definitely be coming back here.
