Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We are regulars. We used to love this place. I guess management has changed or some significant cost cutting is taking place. Since our last three visits, we noticed they have cut down on sauces. Barely any hollandaise on your Benedicts and non-existent Mascarpone on your pancakes. Even if you ask for extra, they give you this super small sauce cups. This is exactly how excellent establishments drive away their loyal customers and then eventually shut down. I don't know - we may give them one more try before calling it quits.
