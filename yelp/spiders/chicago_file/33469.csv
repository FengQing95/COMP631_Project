Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I cannot express how much I love this place. This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I fully understand how big of a statement that is, and I stand by it. I am a bartender in the city in nearby bars and I ALWAYS recommend this to people visiting from out of town or people who generally ask me where to go besides my place of employment. My go to on the menu is the petit filet. Which is like heaven. I do not care what you say about other steak houses..... this is THE best steak I have ever had. And not just one time. EVERY SINGLE TIME I I COME HERE. The bread. Dear lord. It takes like jesus made it. Give me five baskets please. I have sampled many other items on the menu because the filet. Every dish is amazing. I literally do not think you can go wrong. I stick to an old fashioned or champagne. I have been with groups or ordered bottles of wine or champagne, or people ordering off of the drink menu. My most recent trip was this past monday when I was catching up with an old friend. The bartender (with the accent... sorry I dont remember your name! male...? ) was very friendly and attentive but not overbearing. He did not flinch when I asked him to please muddle my orange and cherry in my drink. Benjamin was our server and he was absolutely lovely. I would describe him the same was, attentive but not overbearing. Which is exactly what you are looking for. He answered all of my friends questions and had a great energy to him. Thumbs up to both. ( I know monday shifts can be tough and I am pretty sure we were his last table.)
