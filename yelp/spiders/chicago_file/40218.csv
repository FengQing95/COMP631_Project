Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Made a reservation right at the 30 day mark, and so glad I did. There were four of us celebrating my girlfriends 40th, and this restaurant made it even more special. Let's start with the decor-beautiful, sexy, dim lighting, top notch. If you get the pleasure of having Erik as your server, then your experience will be elevated. Erik is funny, friendly, and we all wanted to be his BFF's at the end of our dinner. The special was the 32oz ribeye which was enough for all of us, and soooo flavorful and cooked to perfection. Sides of garlic mashed potatoes, and brussel sprouts, delicious.  At the end of dinner, we said no dessert, but Erik brought out ice cream with a candle anyway, and my girlfriend was so happy!  Thank you Bavette's and Erik for a wonderful dining experience and for enhancing our Chicago trip!
