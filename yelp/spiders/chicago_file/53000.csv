Smoque BBQ////   I got there around 5 PM on Sunday and waited approximately 90 minutes.  By the time we ordered, I was drooling! But then my disappointment started.  I ordered the St. Louis Ribs (what they're known for) and they just ran out.  RAN OUT?  I nearly cried.  If this is your specialty, how can you possibly run out?  Having to make a very quick, on-the-spot decision (there were about twenty people behind me giving me the evil stare of death), I chose a pulled pork platter.  The pulled pork was standard.  Nothing great, but standard.  The mac-and-cheese was standard, and the fries were very good.
