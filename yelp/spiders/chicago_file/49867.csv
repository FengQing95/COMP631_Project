Smoque BBQ////Smoque BBQ is a great restaurant. I am from S. Texas and went to college in Central Texas. Their BBQ always takes me back home to my origins and father' cooking. The owner is great and really listens to your catering needs, along with free samples. The parking is a little difficult and it's pretty packed but they always find a way to seat you. Smoque's has excellent customer service!
