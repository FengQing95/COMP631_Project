Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been coming here for a while. I've never had a bad experience or bad service until today. Not only did we make reservations and our table wasn't ready but the service was not good. Hopefully it was just a bad night but tonight was a real let down. The goat cheese which is my all time favorite did not hold the same taste or consistency as the times I've previously been here. We had to wait for our waiter, literally searching for him to get the check to leave. I love this place but tonight just blew. We rarely go out for dinner but it was for our anniversary. We might as well have stayed home and ordered in.
