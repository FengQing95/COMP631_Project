Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Quite possibly the best deep dish pizza I've eaten.  While it was deep dish, the crust was not whole and solid.  It was perfect.  The tomato sauce with chunks of tomato that you can taste.  We asked what would be a good portion, here I am thinking that a medium would be good for 2 people, but we managed to get full on 1 small and an appetizer.  As recommender by our waiter.
