Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Excellent dinner experience. The setting is dark, warm Â and sexy. The service was top notch. Tried the oysters east and west. They were both fantastic but the east were my favorite. For dinner the steak frites. It was one of the best steaks I've ever had. It was cooked perfectly. It was buttery soft and seasoned perfectly. The portion was a tad small but still a good size. They also serve a warm and toasty sourdough bread with some melted butter that was very tasty.
