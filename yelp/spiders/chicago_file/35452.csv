Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////First steak restaurant I've been to since moving to Chicago and I'm sold! On a cold Tuesday night my boyfriend and I were craving a steak and this place exceed my expectations. It has quite a romantic atmosphere and if you get a booth the whole dinner feels super cozy and intimate.
