Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Every time I'm in Chicago I always stop at wildberry for breakfast. The skillets are large enough for 2 people and they come with pancakes. The prices are reasonable for the amount of food they give. While the coffee sucks their service is awesome. The wait was 1:30min long so we then decided to do a carry out which took 20 min and the food come out fast and delicious. Next time I'm in Chicago I will just call ahead for a carry out. Â Must try great food.
