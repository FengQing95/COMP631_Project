Smoque BBQ////I am not really a BBQ person but I really enjoyed Smoque! This was my first time at the restaurant and it was pretty much what I had expected... counter service, long communal tables, and very casual. (A perfect BBQ joint.) I was lucky and got to try different things since I convinced my dining companions that we should just share. Unfortunately, they were out of pulled pork by the time we got there. We tried the brisket, both chopped and sliced, the chicken and the baby back ribs. The BBQ sauce was very good, again not a great judge of that stuff, but I know when I like it! The sliced brisket was so tender and melt-in-your-mouth delicious... the chicken juicy... the baby back ribs really succulent! My favorite, though, were the fries. Yes, I am a french fry connoisseur. And when you have a place like this, I think you need good, crispy fries. Yum! I also tried the mac 'n cheese, but I did not like it. It was too cheesy... like with swiss cheese or something that didn't taste right to me. And everything came with cole slaw, which I am never really a big fan of. Overall, it was a great meal! The portions are big so i would recommend to share. Also, get there early... there are lines out the door quite often. We got lucky and got there just in time...
