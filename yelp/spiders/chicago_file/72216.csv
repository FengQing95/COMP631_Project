Little Goat Diner////The Private Upstairs Dining Room and Rooftop is the perfect summertime intimate wedding reception venue!  We held our brunch wedding here in June and were highly impressed with the entire staff, from booking to the day of. Our guests raved about the food and the cakes from their bakery were top notch!  My wife was able to put her own design touches on the decor and flowers. Highly recommend if you're a foodie and looking for a beautifully designed space.
