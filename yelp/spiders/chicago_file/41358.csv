Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been several times over the past year, and each time seems very different. Each server seems to recommend different tapas as the house specialty. One thing is for sure, the "famous' paella, was less than stellar and not worth the wait. Instead, the calamari and garlic shrimp are worth a try. My favorite is the goat cheese warm in tomato base with toasted bread tips for dipping. The atmosphere is absolutely the redeeming quality for BaBa. It always has a great vibe; meeting friends there gives the impression you just joined in on a party. I keep going back because its usually the best late night dinner spot in the area, and the atmosphere is perfect for a Chicago summer night.
