Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best Chicago Deep Dish Pizza ever! If you guys love pizza as much as I do, you all know that the Crust is the best piece. I judge my Chicago Deep Dish pizza on the crust and after trying Pequods and Giordanos, I will always come back to Lous. The crust is flaky, buttery, and their sauce is on point!
