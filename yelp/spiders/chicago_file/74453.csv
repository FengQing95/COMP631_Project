Little Goat Diner////Wow I must say this place got me nocked out with their vegan menu and the chooses, A+ guys! I really thought this place won't have a single vegan item on the menu, the service was amazing food chooses and how it came out were also incredible little over salted I had their vegan local burger, and the savory mushroom pancake.
