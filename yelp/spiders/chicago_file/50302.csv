Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I once came here for dinner on Friday and again for brunch the following Sunday, so clearly I'm in love with CBBR. I have tried pretty much everything on the menu and have never been diasppointed. My personal faves: patatas bravas (of course), bacon wrapped dates, brussel sprout salad, the short rib, and all of the paellas. Seriously though, the paella is amazing and it is well worth the wait.
