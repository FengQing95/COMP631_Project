Smoque BBQ////Omg this is by far the greatest bbq I've had in a while! The meat is extremely tender ( the brisket was better than the pulled pork). The savory bbq sauce mixed with the sweet jalapenos complemented eachother well. As for the sides: they overflow the bag of fries, the mac n cheese has a yummy crisp top layer, coleslaw was tasty, and the cornbread was a mistake. I wanted to bring some with me on the plane ride back to Cali!
