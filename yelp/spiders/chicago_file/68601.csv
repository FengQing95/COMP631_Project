Little Goat Diner////Ok so I was a little tipsy when I got here (drinks with coworkers beforehand), and I was starving - so any food would've tasted delicious.  But Little Goat exceeded all ravenous expectations.  I ordered the french toast (breakfast is served all day) which involved a fried egg baked into each piece of sweet onion brioche, accompanied by fried chicken and strawberries. So random, but all the flavors were wild when combined together.  The only downside was the extremely long wait as they don't take reservations.
