Smoque BBQ////The slaw comes with each meal, it wasn't anything special but it wasn't awful by any means. The fries were done nicely and the cornbread tasted like cornbread. The real good sides was definitely the macaroni and the beans. The macaroni was covered in bread crumb crust and baked perfectly. The sauce was creamy and cheesey as it should. The beans were covered in a sweeter bbq sauce and cooked to perfection. Â
