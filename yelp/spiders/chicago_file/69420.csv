Little Goat Diner////Unlike most diners, you can also order, wine, beer or mixed drinks -- in addition to house-made sodas and coffee, etc. I was really worried that the menu would be small, but Stephanie Izard has clearly made an effort to bring her food vision to as wide an audience as possible. This place is even family friendly, if you are looking not to compromise great food just to satisfy your child companions.
