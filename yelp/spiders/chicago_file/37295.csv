Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Roasted Bone Marrow - (with caramelized onion jam, parsley salad) It looks like they give you soooo many. If you're going to get this, you should definitely share and don't eat the warm bread and butter they give you. Comes with 3 pieces of toasted sourdough and 5 bones (though really only 2 of them really have substance. The bottom 3 bones are fairly shallow, but it's plenty of bone marrow nonetheless, so well worth the price point. On a side note, it'll fill you up. I wasn't a fan of the jam as it was a bit on the sweet side for me, and the marrow could've used a sprinkle of salt flakes.
