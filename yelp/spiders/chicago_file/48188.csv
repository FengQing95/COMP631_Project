Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is amazing! it is huge and has tons of space to accommodate a large group or if you're looking for a table for 2.  I've only been here for brunch, never another meal.  If their dinners are anything remotely close to brunch, you're in luck.  The food is always on point and you cannot go wrong with the make your own Bloody Mary Bar.  Seriously, do it! Its Awesome! Try all the food as its great and if you go with friends and share plates, it won't hit you in the wallet too much either.  Enjoy!
