Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The sides were pretty delicious as well. Definitely get the elotes. It is better than your average side of corn. It Â has a perfect balance of creaminess, spice and acid. The mashed potatoes were good but I wouldn't say they are anything spectacular. If I ever get the opportunity to come back, I will definitely try the truffle mac and cheese.
