Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What a great place.  You must visit the downstairs bar prior to dinner.  Favorites included the fresh east coast oysters and the most perfectly seasoned burger.  We also ordered the bacon which was cooked to perfection, but too fatty for my liking.   Wine list was a little disappointing.
