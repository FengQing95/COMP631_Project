The Purple Pig////This restaurant is fantastic. Came here on the recommendation from a friend and I am glad I did. I started with the salt roasted roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter.  This app was the perfect flavor combination, I love beets and the whipped goat cheese was airy and light the pistachio butter was an unexpected treat not the most appealing visually but the taste was the perfect pairing with the beets and cheese.  I had the roasted bone marrow with herbs, capers, onions and maldon sea salt for my entree.  So decadent and delicious, I wish I came here with other people so I could try more items.  I left here absolutely stuffed!
