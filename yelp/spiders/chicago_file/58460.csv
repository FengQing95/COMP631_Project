Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! has been around since 1985, but my lovely wife and I dined here for the first time finally a few weeks ago.  This tapas restaurant is one of the longest-running establishments of the Lettuce Entertain You empire, with a massive interior that is subdivided into a bunch of more intimate spaces.  It can get loud in here, so we felt fortunate to get a somewhat secluded table in the corner of one of the dining rooms.
