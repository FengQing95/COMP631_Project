Art Institute of Chicago////The food was spectacular and since they have a high-end restaurant at the museum, it was so much more reasonably priced than even the most basic catered meal.  My husband and I got a private tasting a few months before the wedding with wine pairings, full attention of the Master Chef and staff and a walk through of the space.  Even after our contract was solidified, they were so accommodating to special requests (like setting up some curtains for a "photo booth" at the back of the reception room or having a bowl of pretzels for the kids during the cocktail hour) and never tried to get more money from us.
