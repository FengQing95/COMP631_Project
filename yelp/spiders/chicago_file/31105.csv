Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were so impressed from our last visit to Lou Malnati's (state st location) that we came to this location to get more pizza a couple days later! No wait at 4pm on a Saturday, which was great. The restaurant is unique and charming. Before we got the pizza, we got the cheese bread. It's a little pricey (I believe $7.95?) but it was a little garlicky, and a good appetizer since the pizza takes 30-60 minutes to cook, and depending on how busy the restaurant is. It comes with a delicious tomato sauce that has really fresh flavors and balances out the cheese & bread combo. I'd recommend the bread for sure.
