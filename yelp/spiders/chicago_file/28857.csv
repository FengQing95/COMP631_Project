Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Solid deep dish pizza joint! Came here around 4:45pm on a Thursday and luckily there was no wait to be seated. My co-worker and I ordered a few drinks and started off dinner with the stuffed spinach bread. This was definitely the best part of the meal. It was around $8 and a kind of small. The bread was crispy and flaky with cheese, garlic, and spinach pouring out of it.
