Little Goat Diner////Went there yesterday for an early dinner on a Sunday. Arrived at 4:15pm. The hostess said it would be an hour wait and we ended up waiting just under an hour. There's a bar in the back and the 3 of us waited back there for our table. There was no room at the bar to sit though. I was surprised that at such an odd hour that this place was packed. Little Goat is apparently the trendy new restaurant.
