Smoque BBQ////This is how barbecue should be.  A great rub, a great sauce, great meat, and great sides.  I think the St. Louis style is their best one.  Very meaty.  They don't fall off the bone, but to me, they're not supposed to fall off the bone.  That's a loser in the cookoffs to have the ribs fall off the bone.  The standout sides to me are the fries and the cobbler.  I always get corn bread instead of coleslaw, but I never seem to get to it.  I always find it more important to eat the other stuff.  One of my friends said they hit the baked beans out of the park, also.  There can be a wait during prime hours, so I either go a little early or a little late.
