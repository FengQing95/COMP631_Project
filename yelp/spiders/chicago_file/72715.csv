Little Goat Diner////Nice little cosy place. I ordered the parathas burrito and it was something I have never tried before! A perfect combination of Indian and Mexican food! They also have an amazing menu for cocktails. I ordered the mezcalada from the cocktail menu. Host did mention it is spicy but I went ahead and tried it. Was OK. If you like bloody mary, you'd probably enjoy the drink. Will return of am in the area again:)
