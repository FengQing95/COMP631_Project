Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Average to slightly better than average Chicago style deep dish pizza for the time it takes to get it! The wait to get in on a Thursday at 7 pm was about an hour. There is no room to have a drink while you wait so go across the street to The Bottled Blonde where the selection of brew is extensive and the "scenery" is spectacular ;-) Â Lou's will txt you when your table is ready.
