Little Goat Diner////Overall, we all enjoyed our food and appreciated the fact that it was more casual, as we were dining as a group and with a small child.  We didn't have reservations and came right as they opened.  And though it very quickly got busy, there were still open tables.  So, definitely don't hesitate to give Little Goat a try on a whim!
