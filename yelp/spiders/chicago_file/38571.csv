Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place was awesome, period. One of the best steaks I've ever had (42 day dry aged bone in ribeye). Bone marrow for a starter was delicious. Mac and cheese with bacon was great. Basel cab was a nice compliment to the steak. Chocolate dessert hit the spot to top off the evening. Do yourself a favor and go.
