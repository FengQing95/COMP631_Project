The Purple Pig////My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Chicago hands down! The menu changes often but always features delicious, unique flavors. All the ingredients are so fresh and crafted together so perfectly. If on the menu- the broccoli, hot dog, and duck have been some of my all time favorites! You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu though. For the quality of food, it's very reasonably priced and worth every penny.
