Smoque BBQ////I thought the crowds moved quickly from order to being served. Tables were always cleaned and staff quick to point you to an empty one once it opened up. Decor was hip and fun. On a Sunday, I'm sure there were more families but the noise did not become bothersome. I'm surprised and regretful I did not discover this place sooner considering my dietary restrictions. I was pleasantly surprised and will be back for sure. It's sure to become a favorite spot.
