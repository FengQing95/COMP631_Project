Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The bad:  tuna tar tare was over loaded with bitter cilantro.  The pork chop was terrible, firm, dry, dense, over cooked.  The lamb chops were the same, dense, over cooked, not like fresh meat, the texture was just weird.  The lamb sauce was terribly salty.  Our server Amy was nice but always came to the table and talked abruptly instead of pausing for just a moment for us to give her our attention.  The corn was over powered by a heavy mayonnaise-like sauce.  With entree prices at $30-60, it was a really poor experience.
