Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Outstanding experience!! This dimly lit and elegant gem of a restaurant is a must.  Was there for a birthday dinner and we were truly taken care of.  Service and attentiveness - 5 stars all the way.  Knowledgeable and friendly wait staff.  Server assistants on point.  Water always kept full.  Table always wiped clean.  Drinks and food fast.  Note that if you are trying to have a leisurely dinner, take your time ordering as food comes out super fast.  I didn't feel rushed whatsoever, but it seemed like after each course was ordered, the food was out in like 5 minutes.  We had the roasted chicken - fell off the bone.  Portion was the equivalent to a full chicken, or so it seemed.  We also had the 10oz filet - cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection.  Sides are large, and can feed 2-3 people per side.  We tried the corn and loaded potato.  Both fantastic.  Skipped the dessert, but had a few drinks.  The Belle Meade and Bavette's Punch were both outstanding!  Come here for a great meal, leave very full and ready to come back again and again.
