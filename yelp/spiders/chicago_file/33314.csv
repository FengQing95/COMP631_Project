Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Possibly the best steak in the city (had the Ribeye). The sides (fries, brussel sprouts, mac n cheese, creamed spinach) and appetizers (lyonnaise salad, shrimp cocktail, crab cake) were all amazing as well. Old fashioned w/ Rye on point. Everything about this place: the food, the drinks, the ambiance, and the service were on point. Definitely lived up to the hype and then some.
