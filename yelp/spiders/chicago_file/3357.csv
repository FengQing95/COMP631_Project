The Purple Pig////Dessert: Sicilian Iris (Ricotta & chocolate chip filled fried brioche, $7): For some reason, the kitchen took a long time to prepare this dessert (we waited over 15+ minutes). Good crispy brioche with warm chocolate chip filling. Would I get it again? YES, BUT THE WAIT WAS TOO LONG. (4.25/5)
