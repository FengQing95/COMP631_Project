Little Goat Diner////This is not your old school Chicago diner. The ambiance was really nice but the food wasn't exactly something to write home about. Side note: If you personally know my fat ass you KNOW that I'm willing to drive 4 fc*king hours to a great restaurant. With that said, the food was a bit over priced (probably due to its location) the hash browns were crispy and well done (totally my fault), but not exactly what I happened to be in the mood for at the moment (I should have specified). The homemade sausage wasn't the greatest and the menu (outside of the shrimp and grits) seemed a little out of my comfort zone (keep in mind, other than the sausage, I did not try anything "different"). The waitress ("Rebecca") seemed nice (not fake) and not "overly concerned" about me as most waitresses/waiters are only when your mouth is full of food. I think the potential to do better exists (so long as the management cares). For now I'll stick with some of the older establishments.
