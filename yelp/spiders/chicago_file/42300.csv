Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////AND you can also so some window-shopping on Halsted (even though I will always like the French wording so much better: 'window-licking' - so accurate!! It definitely brings to mind desperate fashionistas pulling their hair and drooling on the pavement in front of a pair a Louboutin. Not that I don't subscribe and understand but I would like to think I am a little better and classy than that).
