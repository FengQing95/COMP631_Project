Smoque BBQ////I got the 1/2 slab of ribs, mac and cheese, cole slaw, and their fries. So I loveeee Gale Street Inn's ribs, but wondered if Smoque would be any similar but it was so different I'm not sure if I can compare. If Gale Street has lathered, rich sauce all over the ribs with fall-of-the-bone tenderness, Smoque has dark, smokey, home-made-bbq ribs. I felt that the BBQ sauce was lighter than super thick, which does NOT mean bad.
