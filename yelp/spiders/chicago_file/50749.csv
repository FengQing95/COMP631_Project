Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered a combination of different tapas which included: galacian empanada of bay scallops, chicken & ham croquetas, and the rioja braised short rib. They were all excellent. The service was great as well. The server was very attentive. We weren't starving otherwise, we would have also ordered the Paella for dinner. We did order a few deserts though as we were not completely full yet.
