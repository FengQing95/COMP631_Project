The Purple Pig////Great spot to have some tapas and drinks. It's always full of guests here, but I came for Saturday brunch around 1pm and got seated immediately. No reservations. By the time I had finished my meal there were a bunch of people waiting outside, with drinks of course so it's really not too bad.
