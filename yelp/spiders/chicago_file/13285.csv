Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My first time in Chicago, and I wanted to try the local deep dish pizza. The reviews for Malnati's were high on praise, and I was in the area, so that's where I went. I started with the House salad, which was delicious, and then I had the Malnati special classic deep dish. The Sausage was excellent, and the sauce was tasty, and the crust was nice as well. Overall, I enjoyed it, but I just can't make myself think of this as pizza. I guess I'm more of a NY style guy.
