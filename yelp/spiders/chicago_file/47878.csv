Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I know we can't all sit far away from the bus stations, and I was fine with it, but the staff made NO effort to avoid hitting my chair, no matter how I tried to re-position it away from them. I finally had to hold my purse in my lap after a staff member knocked it off my chair, tangled it up in his feet, stepped on it twice and then kicked it 4 feet away - all without ever looking down. I politely brought the incident to his attention and, without any comment whatsoever, he simply walked away from me. My fellow ladies at the table we appalled - I'm pretty sure the men didn't even notice. Either way, the lack of an apology is unacceptable.
