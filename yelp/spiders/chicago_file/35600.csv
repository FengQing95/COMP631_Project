Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is a top tier Chicago restaurant. Fantastic ambience. They know how to make sazeracs and old fashioneds - on par with any place in Chicago. Â All apps I've had here have been incredible - it's almost as if you can blindly pick one and it will be awesome. The bone-in filet was the best I've ever had. Chocolate creme pie is amazing too. Friendly staff/service as well.
