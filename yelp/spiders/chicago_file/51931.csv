Smoque BBQ////Most important bit of advice I could give anyone is to call ahead to this place....At 6pm on a Sunday they were out of  brisket and ribs...and almost out of chicken.  I thought the pork was great but was there for the brisket.  My friend went at 5 pm on a saturday and they were out of brisket...so call ahead and see if they are running out of stuff...
