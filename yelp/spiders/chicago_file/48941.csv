Smoque BBQ////Yeah it's goo but I really don't understand what all the gushing is about.  It's small so dining is kind of feels like you are in a fishbowl and the lines are usually long.  However, it was pretty tasty and I would go back.  But I just think people are freaking out a bit too much about it.  Also, it's byob so we brought our own wine.  It was awesome--they gave us plastic cups to drink out of and asked us if we wanted ice in them!  For that reason alone it gets bumped up two four stars for the hilarity factor.
