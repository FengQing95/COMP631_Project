Smoque BBQ////You know, I came here during the midst of the pandemic, and I understand they are doing their best. Overall the set up was clean and organised, and the food was delicious. Just felt a bit overpriced, and also felt like it was a copy of Bub City in downtown, just different names for everything, and quantity. Would I come back? Yes just not often.
