Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Yummy!  My co-worker and I ordered the Calamari appetizer to share.  It was light and seasoned perfectly, with a slight spicy kick that we loved.  We munched on the calamari while waiting for our deep dish pizza.  We decided to order 2 personal pizzas to share.  We ordered the Chicago Classic and the Lou.  Both were excellent.  The service was great, our server was Patina.
