Art Institute of Chicago////My only complaint was that I had to check my backpack when I came in & we saw a bunch of other people with backpacks roaming the museum. I understand the security concern, but I would have preferred to keep my belongings on me while I'm wandering around. Plus my wallet was in it & I was thusly unable to buy food or drinks once we were ready for it.
