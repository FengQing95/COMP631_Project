Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'd live here if I could. The interior is lavish and cozy, overall well conceived concept for a swank steakhouse dinner, if anything, it's a little on the dark side. Eating at a table or the bar is a snug and warm experience. When I sat at the bar once, I'll admit I've never been much of a rum drinker, but their dark and stormy was a treat. If you've never experienced a Hogsalt bar or eatery (Gilt Bar, Dillman's, Au Cheval, etc.) this is an excellent introduction. Â Their stroganoff entree has never disappointed, nor has any variation of their many beef cuts. Only once did I and a guest feel somewhat "rushed" but we were the last people in what appeared to be our server's section or last table of the night. A busser pulled an appetizer before we acknowledged we were finished with it, which I've never balked at before and I was anticipating the entree more anyways. The service otherwise was knowledgeable and articulate and the ambience is terrific.
