Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Sat at the bar and had a personal size Lou's Classic and a Goose Island Green Line. The pizza itself was good, but by the time it had arrived, the cheese had already started to settle and it wasn't as ooey gooey as I would've liked. It was also a tad small, but the next size up would've been too much. Great bartender!
