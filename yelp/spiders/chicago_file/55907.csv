Smoque BBQ////If 2000+ reviews was not enough, let's just say in fantasy football you have tiers of QBs, RBs, WRs, etc...3 tiers, with QBs, tier 1 would be Peyton Manning, Drew Brees, Aaron, yeah that guy, tier 2 Jay Cutler, Romo, yada yada...Smoque BBQ is tier 1, Famous Dave's, a tier 2...I recommend highly and can't wait to do the brisket & pork as I hoped today, but forgot to do, and oh yeah, this place is BYOB, can't beat that
