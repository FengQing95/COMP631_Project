Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were seated upstairs after about 15 minutes. Not bad. Our food came out very quickly. I find it odd that the employees need to cut up and serve the pizza. We could have really done it ourselves. I think this slows down service quite a bit. More on that later. The salad was fine. The pizza was pretty good. It wasn't as deep as I expected. Also, it didn't seem to have as much cheese as I am used to with deep dish. We thought it was good, but not spectacular. We both prefer the deep dish in my hometown.
