Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's definitely did not disappoint. We had the stuffed spinich bread for apps, which was pretty decent. The pizza was our first experience at Chicago deep dish pizza and it was really good. I think the crust might have been slightly better at Peqoud's Â For dessert we had chocolate chip pizza, and damnnnn, was it really really good.
