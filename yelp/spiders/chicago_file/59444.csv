Smoque BBQ////the food comes to you on unpretentious trays and everything is nice and tidily packaged up for you. that is, until you eat. for me, my typical method of attack is to save the main entree for last and hover around the sides for a bit to warm things up. I got baked beans, mac n cheese and cole slaw... and it was good! baked beans probably some of the best I've had... they were sweet and tangy with huge chunks of meat and a great texture. I could have had a tub of those and been satisfied. Â the mac was pretty decent and the cole slaw was exactly the way it should be: fresh ingredients with a nice vinegary kick.
