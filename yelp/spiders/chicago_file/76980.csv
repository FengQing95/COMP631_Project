Little Goat Diner////My friend and I both ordered bloody Mary's, which our server informed me are not vegan by default, but can be made vegan upon request. They were amazing-very spicy and boozy! Great coffee too. The ambience is a bit hectic (they are busy for a reason!) but the quality of the food and service are truly memorable and worth the wait. Definitely my top choice for vegan brunch in Chicago.
