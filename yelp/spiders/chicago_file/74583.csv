Little Goat Diner////Los Drowned sandwich is mouth watering satisfaction for your pallet. I seriously come from the other side of town just for this sandwich. I crave it anytime I am craving steak. They are very generous with the meat and it's HUGE! I love the light avocado spread they put on their fluffy bread that soaks up the gravy of the meat. I cannot recommend this sandwich enough. I always end up taking half home with me, perfect to split for two people.
