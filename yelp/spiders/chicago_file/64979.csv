Smoque BBQ////But I want to mention, my employer paid extra for Smoque to come and cater / serve their meals.  I highly recommend paying the extra money.   They have that process down to a SCIENCE.  Very detailed, clean, organized and they even pack up any leftovers with labels.   How awesome is that?
