The Purple Pig////): The crispy pig's ears were sliced a little too thinly for me, but it had a good crisp. I wish they added more flavors to the pig's ears instead of a fried egg, since that didn't do anything for this dish. However, the kale was delicious, and super crispy. This dish is worth trying once.
