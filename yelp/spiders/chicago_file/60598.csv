Smoque BBQ////I went with the baby back ribs and they were the best I have ever had. I liked that they were served with the sauce on the side so you could appreciate the rub that not only flavored the meat but caramelized slightly to give the ribs a great texture. The girlfriend, J, is a brisket fan and she declared the brisket at Smoque the best she's ever had.
