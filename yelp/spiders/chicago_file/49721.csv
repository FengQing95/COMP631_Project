Smoque BBQ////Had this catered and have been wanting to go back ever since.  Chicago has a severe lack of BBQ restaurants but luckily Smoque (terrible name) is there to alleviate the drought.  Their sides are incredible and while I cannot comment on the portions or what you order in the restaurant I can say that what was catered was outstanding and did not last long in the office.  I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys BBQ and who has been looking for BBQ in the city.
