Little Goat Diner////Surprisingly has a lot of great vegetarian options if you ever need it. Breakfast served all day. Service was okay but they were very busy when I went. I really enjoyed the veggie burger chop chae, though don't expect it at all to seem like a burger (more like a bowl of good stuff). None of us at the table could eat the brussel sprouts. The fish taste was too strong and the vegetable undercooked/too hard.
