Smoque BBQ////Went here for the second time.   No frills decor.  Didn't have to wait in line very long.  Ordered sliced, beef brisket sandwiches, babyback ribs and fries.  Food is promptly prepared, but  not "fast-food".  The sauce has a smoky quality to it and isn't a tomato-based or sweet sauce.  The rib meat falls off the bone.
