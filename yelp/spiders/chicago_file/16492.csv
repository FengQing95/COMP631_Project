Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As far as apples vs apples or oranges vs oranges go, LM serves one freakishly good pizza. The buttery crust which put this place on the map is legit! You eat it knowing it is infused with butter and will shorten your lifespan but it's so good you don't even care! Crunchy, crispy, buttery, goodnessery, deliciousnessery!! Pee-in-your-pants-and-just-continue-eating good! Just writing this review makes me want to go back. I find that after eating out a lot, I consider very few things to live up to the "hype" I find advertised on TV or magazine or even on Yelp, but I really think LM lives up to all the positive reviews. Definitely a place I take all visiters.
