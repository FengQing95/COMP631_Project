The Purple Pig////The biggest drawback is no reservations - but fret not I have a solution for everyone.  Put your name on the list and walk two blocks to Eataly.  It is here you can go to the wine bar and enjoy a glass (or two) of wine while you wait for them to send you a text message.  Maybe pick up some pasta and a bottle for later in the week and before you know it you'll be enjoying truly wonderful food at purple pig.  Your welcome!
