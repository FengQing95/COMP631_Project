Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Started w/ a seafood tower as appetizer...amazing w/ crab, shrimp, oysters & salmon ceviche.  Blue cheese wedge salad was the best I have ever had w/ a hint of dill in the dressing and pork belly bacon, delicious. Mashed potatoes w/ garlic so good, as was creamed spinach.  All steaks cooked to perfection including, dry aged  bone-in Ribeye & bone-in filet.  Finished w/ a pot of French press coffee & chocolate pie.  The best meal.
