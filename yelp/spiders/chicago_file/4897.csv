The Purple Pig////We have been wanting to come to The Purple Pig for a long time now!  We finally made it out, and the food did not disappoint! We really liked the ricotta gnocchi - they were amazingly tender and the red sauce was so delicious! The grilled broccoli was super yummy, and even a 9 year old picky eater approved them! The octopus a la plancha was very tender, and my wife loved it!  The only downside were the prices and what you get for them. I think the tapas concept has lost its real meaning of small, inexpensive plates that allow diners to taste many different items for the same price as a traditional dinner entree. The tapas concept in Chicagoland is basically the ability to charge entree prices for appetizers, and the silly patrons still pay... so the real winners are the restaurateurs... sorry - rant over. Also, for faster seating, please be ready to be seated at a communal table - this was unusual for us, but worked out just fine.
