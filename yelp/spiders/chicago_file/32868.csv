Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The steak was huge - 25oz, three to five ounces larger than most steakhouse bone in rib eyes.  Cooked perfectly, medium rare, a nice char on the outside, not quite the crunch of a Gibson's steak, good marbling throughout the steak, juicy and nice beefy flavor.  Overall, delicious, meaty goodness.
