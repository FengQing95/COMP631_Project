Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food itself was quite well prepared- there is a 6 item sampler at the top which was excellent little bites. The short-rib was very tender, with tangy potatoes. The notable exception if the famed shrimp (#44)- they've been seasoned to death. The volume needs to be no higher than 10 (shrimp mass) to 1 (seasoning mass), and this had been exceeded quite clearly.
