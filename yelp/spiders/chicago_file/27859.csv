Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Doesn't really need my review. It's world-famous and it's delicious. The most incredible deep dish pie you're ever going to have. Came with my family on a rainy night and truly enjoyed myself. The service is great, the food was incredible, and I can't say anything other then you must include this in your Chicago experience.
