Smoque BBQ////I've had cobbler only a few times in my life, this by far is the best I've had. Â Encrusted with bits of slice almonds, sweet sugary crust and a caramel like filling w/bit sized peaches. I'm glad they only serve it in little portions or I may have gone well over my alotted amount of cobbler!!!
