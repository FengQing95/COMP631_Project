Art Institute of Chicago////The wife and I visited two years ago (this review is way overdue) using a Chase Private Client pass to get free admission. Walking through this museum was awe-inspiring. There were 16th century European paintings like "The Nativity" on display unprotected. 5th century Byzantine stone mosaics hanging nonchalantly on the wall. And Roman marble statues from the 1st century just chillin' in the middle of the room. Georges Seurat's "A Sunday Afternoon" drew the most crowds, while the space in front of Marc Chagall's famous "American Windows" was not as crowded (granted, we saw the windows towards the end of the day).
