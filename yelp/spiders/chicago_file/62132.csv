Smoque BBQ////Smoque is completely different then every other BBQ place in the city.  In Chicago, it is all the norm to expect sweet, thick sauced baby back ribs, not at Smoque my friend.  We are talking about a vinegar based sauce, which I'm told (mainly by the Food network) that is common in the Carolinas.  Vinegar in BBQ? Its good, its really good and the ribs are tender, try the St. Louis style ribs, COME ON JUST DO IT!  Fries, always fresh, cole slaw (mixed with a vinegar based sauced) is refreshing not creamy and heavy, and if you go and don't get a peach cobbler, you need to be smacked!
