Little Goat Diner////This place was AMAZINGGGGG. I had been to Girl & the Goat in the past and loved it, so my expectations were pretty high. I ordered the pork belly pancake and it was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The decor is really modern and cool in this place, and despite it being jam-packed it was still a relaxing environment to be in. I definitely want to try some of the breakfast food next time I go; literally everything on the menu looks amazing. They don't take reservations though, so be prepared to wait (we waited about an hour for our table...totally worth it though)!
