Little Goat Diner////I tried both of my friends dishes - Los Drowned $12 and Bull's Eye French Toast $13. The braised beef on Los Drowned was quite good & piled on but overall I wasn't blown away. The chicken and maple syrup on the french toast was great, as well but again not completely blown away.
