Little Goat Diner////I came in last night at 9:00 PM. Knowing very well there will be a wait, I put our name down. They quoted me an hour (at 9:08 PM) and I agreed. They check you in, ask for your phone number, and said they will text you when the table is available. In the meantime, I went to the bar in the adjacent room to have a drink while we wait. We order drinks and wait... and wait... and wait... well, it's now 10:15 and still no text saying the table was ready. I walk over to the hostesses and ask about the status: "Oh? You never received a text?" "Nope. Doesn't look like it." I have full coverage in the bar so I'm not sure if this was a phone provider issue or their machine is at fault. In either case, this needs to be checked because there could be other folks waiting for a text that will never come. It's all contingent upon a seemingly unreliable computer system and/or if you have AT&T/Verizon/Sprint/T-Mobile, etc. and if you can get proper reception in the restaurant/bar. Anyway, we sit down around 10:20 and I'm starving.
