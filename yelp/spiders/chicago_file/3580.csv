The Purple Pig////The wine list is HUGE. It's like biblical proportions. They have it separated by region and country. Very cool. Their menu has a lot of creative options and changes seasonally. It's is tapas style so make sure you are open to sharing. We ordered Bone marrow, broccoli, and a charcuterie platter.
