Little Goat Diner////Great breakfast spot in the warehouse district of Chicago.  Very hip, but not so much so that service is lax.  My wife got a belgian waffle and I got the hash and eggs.  Mine came out first and we waited quite a while for hers.  The manager came over to us after a bit, apologized profusely, and told us that the waffle-maker was broken and burnt hers.  He made her a fresh one and, of course, comped us for it.
