Little Goat Diner////Went with a group of 8.  Tried to make a reservation in advance and was told there were none available for a Saturday night.  I was not surprised given their excellent food.  The food and service was fabulous and I would definitely come back.  However, get a reservation and don't believe the receptionist when she tells you that only 30 % of the tables are held for reservation and you could get a table within about 20 to 30 minutes when you walk in on a Saturday at 6.  I went in advance of the rest of my party and arrived at 545 and was told the wait would be 1.75 hours and it was. We had no other options other to wait as we all had used valet parking and all nearby restaurants were booked.  I would definitely come back, just get a reservation.  If I had been told the wait could be an hour or more I would have waited to go this restaurant when reservations are available.
