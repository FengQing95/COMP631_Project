Little Goat Diner////Me and my friend had Bull's eye french toast and Goat almighty burger. It was $16 and $20 which seems a bit over priced but you'll be convinced after checking out the portions of the menus. French toast was delicious having strawberries and well cooked crispy chicken on top w their special bbq maple syrup. But it was overly sweet that after a few bites I had to find spots that had no syrup on them.
