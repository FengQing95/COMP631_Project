Little Goat Diner////I have been to Girl and the Goat several times so I decided to try little goat. Little goat has a trendy look and menu is much different from their sister restaurant. I liked their drink menu and appetizers were good but entrees were so so. I was not really a big fan of the mixture of flavors and their burger was just par. I would have given it a 4 star but because of the high expectations leading to a greater disappointment, I am giving it a 3 star.
