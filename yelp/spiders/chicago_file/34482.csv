Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My goodness this is a beautiful restaurant.  As soon as you walk in you feel like you're really in an old school place with a new school flair, an episode of Mad Men, but with waaaaay less misogyny. Truly, the atmosphere is extraordinarily sexy and its no wonder it has a reputation for being the most romantic steakhouse in town. The steak was some of the best I've ever had, buttery, melt in your mouth, and so, so flavorful. The biggest surprise was the smoked salmon cesar! I am generally in the anti-salad camp (why would I want to eat raw leaves when I could have, at the very least, sauteed leaves?!?!) but I cannot stress enough that this salad was the very best part of my meal. I dreamt about this salad for nights afterward. I even tried to recreate it at home (which did not turn out as anticipated). It is awfully expensive, but for a special occasion, I wouldn't want to miss out.  Also book reservations WAY in advance. I booked three weeks out and STILL could only get a 9:30 reservation on a Sunday.
