Art Institute of Chicago////Unfortunately, aside from the aforementioned exhibit, the only art I saw were the paintings in the modern wing. Fortunately, that is the best part of the place, or at least it was enough to kill a few hours. I got to see some amazing pieces that I'd only seen before in books, and that was kind of awesome. Highlights include: "American Gothic" and "Nighthawks" as well as most of Georgia O'Keeffe's work.
