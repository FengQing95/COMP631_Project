Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I personally liked the pizza more than pequods because it wasn't as greasy, and the meat was spread more evenly throughout the pizza. It doesn't have that burnt crispiness that pequods had, but that's based on your preference. It's definitely a more touristy destination than other deep dish pizza places, but it still delivers a solid pizza.
