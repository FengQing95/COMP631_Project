Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For my main course, I ordered the bone in filet mignon, priced at $68.95. I had a tough time deciding between that, the traditional 10 oz filet, and the 22oz dry aged bone in ribeye. The waiter told me that the 16 oz bone in filet would give me a few ounces more than the 10 oz traditional filet, since the bone only weighs a couple of ounces, so that's what I went with. I was starving and convinced.
