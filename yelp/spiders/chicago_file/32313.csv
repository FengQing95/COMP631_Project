Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't think you can really get a better example or experience of Â Chicago deep dish anywhere. To meet the demands of fickle diners Lou's provides many ways of ordering their pizza. Don't experiment with non-buttered or thin crust OR God-forbid gluten free here! Get it deep, get it buttered, and if your getting sausage get it edge to edge! Persnickety dinners are likely to opt for many of the "alternative" preparations and not get a true experience. BTW these are the people that complain they didn't like their choice.
