Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Their pizza is so good and not too doughy. The deep dish was just perfectly right! I was so impressed with this establishment and their food. We also got their house salad with the Malnati dressing! Best dressing I have ever had!! And I am a big sauce person! Had to also get the cookie for dessert- it was perfection!
