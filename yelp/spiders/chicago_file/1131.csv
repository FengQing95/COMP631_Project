Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////4.  The brioche wild berry French toast was good, but nothing special.  Both my wife and I had better, and it was not at the top of our favorites list, for French toast that is.  The flavor and texture just did not come out.  (Sorry, I do not have a list of restaurants to recommend for excellent French toast.)
