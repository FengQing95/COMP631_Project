Little Goat Diner////I had the omelet of the day, which had fresh corn saut√©ed with cream cheese, peppers, onions, and topped with a semisweet tomato jam. I also had a side of bacon, which was probably one of the top 5 sides of bacon I've ever had. And I've had a lot of bacon in my life. I also had a taste of the Bullseye French Toast, which was OK, although I'm not a huge fan of soggy French Toast and it's pretty gooey on the inside.
