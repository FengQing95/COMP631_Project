Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Sadly, we only ordered three dishes and I can't wait to try some more! The Peppered Duck and Goat Cheese Terrine is a must have!! Unfortunately, our crisp Apple and Endive salad was a little over dressed but still soooo good! From what I hear, the we must try the Tomato Bacon Salad next time.
