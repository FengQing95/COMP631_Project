Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We were seated toward the back next to a mirror (one whole wall of the restaurant is a mirror to give the illusion of a larger size). I noticed right away that there suble, classy Christmasy decorations that created a very inviting and cozy atmosphere. I could not stop smiling from the start to the end of my meal!
