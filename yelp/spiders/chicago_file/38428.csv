Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I celebrated our one year anniversary here and it was everything we could have wanted and more! Our waitress was incredible and they provided a complimentary dessert to add the cherry to the already perfect meal. The steak, Mac and cheese, and roasted chicken were delicious.
