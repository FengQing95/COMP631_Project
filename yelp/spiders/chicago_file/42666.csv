Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been to Spain a couple of times (once for an extended period of time) and so when I can find a good tapas place, I'm pretty happy. Ba-Ba has good to great tapas (yes, get the bacon wrapped dates), though it's a little more expensive than it should be.  Actually, that goes for most tapas places in the US (um, they're supposed to be cheap, remember??).  So whatever.
