Little Goat Diner////As someone new to Chicago, I feel like I hit the jackpot finding this place and can't wait to introduce it to my friends.  For food, I ordered the "This little piggy went to China" - every bite contained new and unexpected flavor explosions in the best way possible.  My friend ordered the biscuits and gravy, which usually I find to be heavy and bland but here was rich in flavor as well.  Our waitress, Gillian, was friendly and courteous, and we especially appreciated that she made sure to tell us that although she had a 25+ table just sitting down, she would not forget about us.  As a brunch spot, this place goes above and beyond.
