Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I do love Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba - I really do. I hesitate 5 stars because of the price. I hear happy hour is a good time to go, but I haven't ventured there early yet. I've never had a plate that I didn't enjoy and I always leave incredibly stuffed, but satisfied. I absolutely recommend getting their sangria, a pitcher if you must. Their sangria itself is worth 5 stars. I do suggest making a reservation, as they are always busy.
