Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time for Deep Dish and Lou's did not disappoint. This place came highly recommended by the concierge at our hotel. I had mentioned Giordano's to him and his comment was that Lou Malnati's is traditional Chicago Deep Dish, while Giordano's is "stuffed" pizza, that is, a top and bottom crust with filling inside. I wanted the authentic thing, so the fam and I went to Lou's. We couldn't have been happier or more full when we left. We got the Chicago Classic which literally has a thin homemade sausage patty under the layer of cheese. It was fantastic. It might have made the pizza a touch heavy, which was bad because I wanted to eat more. The crust was unbelievably light and flaky, with a wonderful buttery flavor. The pepperoni pizza we ordered was the group favorite, simple but delicious. Their sauce is excellent as well,
