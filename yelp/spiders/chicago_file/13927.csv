Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got to Malnati's early, lunch time on a Monday.  Got seated at the outside sidewalk tables right away.  We didn't even go inside so don't have any comments on anything other than they have a red awning over the front door that is up 3 or 4 steps from ths sidewalk.   Our waitress was right there and we ordered a soft drink and a medium Malnati Chicago Classic, a medium sized pizza with sausage, double cheese "vine-ripened tomatoes on a Buttercrust".  Our waitress was helpful, and efficient and stayed on top of our beverages.  I was having diet-coke and she kept my glass filled up for the 40 or so minutes that it took for our pie to cook.  Our pizza came out hot and sliced, we had 6 slices in a medium pie and the crust was golden brown, a saucey covered bed of cheese and sausage that DELIVERED!!  The sauce was plentiful and flavorful, it was nicely seasoned with basil and thyme evident in the taste, nicely seasoned.  There was plenty of sausage amply spread throughout our pizza, the cheese was waiting under the whole mess to surprise your palate and stretch with every bite! Then there was the crust...well it was buttery, crispy and not hard like our Saturday experience.  It all combined for a crispy, buttery wrapping around a cheesy saucey, bite of sausagey goodness.  We were full after the waitress served us both another slice and then she wrapped our pizza in aluminum foil so we could take it back on the plane with us to spread the good word on Lou Malnati's pizza.  Now I don't know if all the crusts are the "Buttercrust" because I didn't see any other pizzas on the menu with this description, but this "buttercrust" was great, crisp, buttery, great tasting and flavorful.
