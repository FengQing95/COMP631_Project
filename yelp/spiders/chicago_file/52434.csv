Smoque BBQ////But enough about the drama: let's talk about the food.  Oh my, is it sooo mouthwatering good.  Denton J. ordered a full slab of ribs and I ordered the pulled pork.  It was so good that we just kept on eating, ignoring the fact that we were on our fourth meal of the day.  Finally, we called mercy and packed the leftovers to go.
