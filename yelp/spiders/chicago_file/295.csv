Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Great breakfast spot by Millennium Park.  You will find elders and professionals dining here as it was located in the Prudential building.  I heard there are long lines, but I went on a Wednesday and was seated immediately.  I got the signature omelette with sausages, bacon, and cheddar.  It came with 2 pancakes and hash browns.  The portions were bigger than Hawaiian portions, which is definitely saying something. Everything came out within 10 min and my waiter was so nice that I submitted a review card to the front desk.  Would highly recommend!
