Art Institute of Chicago////When I was in college and the museum was free on Tuesdays, I was here pretty much every week.  One of the guards knew me by name, even.  It's a grandiose place with some of the best art in the world.  My favorite collections are the Modern and Impressionism collections.  There's something for everyone here.  If you haven't been, you need to go.  And if you have been, you need to go again.
