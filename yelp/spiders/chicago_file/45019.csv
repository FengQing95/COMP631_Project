Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////- The spicy pork dish. Kind of a miss in my book but I was pretty full by the time it showed up. Which is saying something, because I tend to think American renditions of tapas are bullshit b/c it's an excuse to charge you a lot of money for not a lot of food. My fiancee, friend and I were quite full after leaving the Cafe. We didn't even order the delicious looking chocolate desserts we saw floating by our table.
