Little Goat Diner////As for food, the menu looked amazing. From breakfast eats to classic sandwiches, I loved how the menu offered the staple diner items but also infused it's own twist into the dishes. I got the goat-o goat-o which was the perfect summer salad. Light, crisp, and cool with a flavorful dressing that leaves you perfectly content and not overly weighed down by something too greasy.
