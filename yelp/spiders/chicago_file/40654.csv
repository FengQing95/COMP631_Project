Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////True, authentic Spanish tapas right here folks! Every dish we had was fantastic. Our waiter was very friendly and extremely helpful when it came to choosing which wine we wanted (I'm not familiar with Spanish wines). I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly our dishes came out of the kitchen considering how busy it was. The only caution with this place is the noise level. It was very noisy in the dining area, but if you don't mind a little noise I don't know where you'd find tapas this good
