Little Goat Diner//// We made reservations were seated in a timely manner. The server was friendly and nice. My biggest complaint besides the limited gluten free options is that we were asked to leave after 90 mins of dining. I had out of town guests with me and although everyone's meal average $25 or more for my party and we left a generous tip, we were asked to leave due to another reservation. Â If there is a time limit on dining in it should be posted. Extremely disappointed with the restaurant establishment.
