Smoque BBQ////None of this is to try to convince you that you should pay $19.95/lb for brisket.  People will make their own value judgements as to what is and isn't worth spending their money on and we respect that.  But I did want to explain the reasons behind the increase.  We have never taken our customers for granted.  In 11 years in business, we have periodically had to raise prices.  But I can tell you that, without exception, we have never done so for any reason other than as a last-resort measure in response to market-driven cost increases.
