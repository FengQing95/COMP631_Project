Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Truthfully, there is not a huge diversity among his restaurants.  Staples like the steak frites and the bone marrow seem to show up on each new restaurant's menu, and the style of decor/food are all similar.  While the whiny side of me wants to see a completely different place, the hungry side of me sees no need to fix what ain't broke.
