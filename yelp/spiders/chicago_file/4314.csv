The Purple Pig////We were walking towards some awesome Chicago destination when we noticed a line forming. So of course we stood in line and then asked what the line was for! We looked the place up on Yelp while waiting. .The reviews were fantastic. My wife said she had already found a ton of good Yelp reviews on this place while we were in the airport in Orlando.
