Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I don't eat steak, so I was hesitant to come here considering the price.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  From service to food and everything in between, this was one of the best meals I've had in a while.  Worth the price and the calories, so put this on your list if you want a special meal out in River North.
