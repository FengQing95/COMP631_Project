Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was in Chicago this past weekend and my friend recommended this place.  Another tapas style restaurant and everything was amazing!! We tried the black raspberry sangria and the passion fruit sangria both were great!  We got the pintxo platter for free because we checked in through Yelp.  Pintxos are bite-sized tapas popular in the bars of Northern Spain. It included a chorizo wrapped date and manchego, ahi tuna poached in olive oil on avocado toast, goat cheese croqueta- wow yummy, short rib-stuffed piquillo pepper, artisanal spanish cheese & quince- yummy, and mushroom and rice croqueta.  We got the spicy potatoes with a tomato aioli and these were really good. We had the spinach & manchego stuffed mushrooms and these were delicious but the sauce was a little too rich.  2 mushrooms were my limit.  The braised lamb, spinach, couscous & almonds was soooo flavorful. It was not gamy at all.  The roasted chicken empanada is a must-have.  The empanada was flaky and golden. This was delicious and it came with a yummy creamy aioli on the side.  We also had the Paella Valenciana.  It takes about 30 minutes to make the paella so make sure to order that first.  If I go back to Chicago I would definitely come back here.  They also have a location in Vegas, but on there website it says the Vegas location is now closed.
