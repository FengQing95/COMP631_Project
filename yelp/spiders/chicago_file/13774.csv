Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Sorry, we have tried them all and the pizza here is just not as good as at Pizzeria Uno or Pizzeria Due or Gino's East.  The crust just does not have the same texture or flavor of that at the other pizza places downtown.  They do put an ample amount of pepperoni on the pie, but if the crust means something to your pizza  experience, pass them by.
