Art Institute of Chicago////We also browsed the Arts of Africa, China, Korea, Greek, and Roman. All amazing sights to behold. The Chagall windows were georgous. I love the impression and medival/Renaissance Art. My kids seemed to enjoy the modern American Art. That is alot that we got through today. I can't wait to go again, next time maybe by myself so I can actually read and take my time! The staff was very friendly and helpful, guiding us to places we wanted to see. Also, there is a kids scavenger hunt which your child would go separately on. It's a nice option too. The food court was really busy today, but the food was surprisingly very good! It felt good to recharge. All in all it was a great day!
