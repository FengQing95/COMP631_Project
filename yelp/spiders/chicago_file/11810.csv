Art Institute of Chicago////As a former art student with my BFA in Art and Design, I will say that I have always been in love with The Art Institute of Chicago. My husband is in IT, and at points enjoyed the experience more than me (if that is possible?) Exhibits are spacious and boasts some of the most thought provoking art. I will also say that some of the art was not for me. My favorite hall is the French Impressionism Era. Masterpieces line the walls. Monet is easily my favorite painter of all. Up close, there is nothing quite like his paintings. BUT, don't get too close, or an alarm will sound.
