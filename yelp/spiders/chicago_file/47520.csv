Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our waters weren't filled unless we asked and instead of our table being cleaned up quickly like last time, I was stacking empty plates up to clear up the table. Sometimes they noticed and picked them up and sometimes they didn't. Being that the tapas come out at different times and that there are many little plates, they need to be on top of clearing the table up. When the waitress came to bring more she made no effort to clear anything to make room.
