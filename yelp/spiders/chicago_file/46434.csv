Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We were still hungry so we ordered a mushroom empanada and the sirloin with shiitakes, asparagus and potatoes. The empanada was huge for a tapas, but the crust was flaky and the filling was earthy and had notes of sherry; it was delicious. The sirloin didn't have much flavor, and it was cooked as ordered, but it was a tough cut of meat, so I'm not convinced it was sirloin. The accompanying vegetables were fine; the asparagus was a bit woody and tough, but the mushrooms and potatoes were decent, as was the sauce.
