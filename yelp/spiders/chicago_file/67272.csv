Little Goat Diner////Great spot for brunch, Little Goat has a fantastic menu of traditional and interesting breakfast and lunch entrees.  Bright and lively atmosphere, and friendly service.  Shrimp and grits were tasty, with five medium shrimp, goat cheese grits, roasted pistachios, and crisp asparagus.  Looking forward to trying the huge sandwiches on my next visit.  Cool bar, bakery and coffee bar make this a great destination.
