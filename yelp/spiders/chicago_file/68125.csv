Little Goat Diner////I usually refrain from writing bad reviews but this place was beyond awful. Everything that glitters is not gold. When you walk in, place smells like dump raw meat. The food looks ok and tastes very awful. The environment was dirty. The red carpeting is way overdue for cleaning or something. Servers cleaning the floor after customer has been sitted. I think the servers need to take pride in their job. I saw one of the workers cleaning the table and the ketchup lid fell on the floor and she picked it up and put it right back on the ketchup bottle on the table.. The list goes on.
