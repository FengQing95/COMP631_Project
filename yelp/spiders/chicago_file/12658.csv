Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza is great that is not the problem.  I am going to give every customer some very valuable advice so what happened to me does not happen to you.  DO NOT PAY WITH A CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD.  LAST NIGHT I ORDERED A PIZZA FOR DELIVERY FROM THE RIVER NORTH LOCATION AND THE PERSON TAKING THE PHONE ORDER DECIDED TO SWITCH MY ORDER TO THE STATE ST. LOCATION AND MY CARD GOT CHARGED TWICE.  It is an easy fix but it is a hassle because now I have to call the store and make a stink and then call the bank.  So pay in cash and you will not have to deal with a minor irritation like this.  A learning experience that cost me some weekend cash.
