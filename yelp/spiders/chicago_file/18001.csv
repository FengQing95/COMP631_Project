Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My favorite deep dish.  This place is the standard, and the best part about Lou's is that their various locations are highly consistent.  One tends to be as quality as the other.  My favorite is The Lou, add sausage.  The Lou's salad is great too, not so much healthy, with all the blue cheese and bacon bits, but very tasty.  Loves me my Lou's.
