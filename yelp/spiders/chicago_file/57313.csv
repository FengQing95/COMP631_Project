Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had the daily special - Mango Sangria - and didn't really care for it. I expected to have some mango slices in it or maybe some spice in it, but it was just mango juice with some white wine. The apple slices were soft versus being crisp and crunchy and the orange slices were mostly peels.
