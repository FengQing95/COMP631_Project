Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We have sat in-house once, as this place is a total mad house.  There is always a rather long wait (think hours) and while the wait staff attempts to be efficient, and helpful, it's pretty difficult in tandem with the volume they have.  As a result, we choose to order take out from the Malnati's app, as their delivery charge is $4.  Ooof.  Just know that if you do order take out, be sure to arrive 10-15 minutes after their pickup time, as its wrong 99% of the time & you end up waiting amidst the crazy chaos.
