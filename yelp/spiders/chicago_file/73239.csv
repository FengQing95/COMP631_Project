Little Goat Diner////I always bring friends and family here from out of town. It never fails me. I try to order something different everytime and so far all of them are good. Bull's eye french toast, three little pigs, pork belly pancake, they don't take reservations so better come early though I've never really waited for more than 20 minutes. Service is always excellent. The only problem is parking(applies to all restaurants/bar in randolph), they have valet though. But if you come on a less busy day you can probably find one.
