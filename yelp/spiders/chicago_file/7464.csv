Art Institute of Chicago////One, that was also in Chicago at the same time was the "Vote4me" exhibit at the Mc.Cormick Freedom Tribune Museum - though this is a different category of exhibit (its for free btw), it just did a great job on getting the message across. This one is worth a short visit if you stroll along Michigan Avenue.
