Smoque BBQ////The seating was set up in such a way that my lunch partner and I had to sit on opposite sides of a very long row like were participating in a rib-eating contest.  The decor is boring and unimaginative but the place is small and we did come for the food.  They also have created more traffic at the soda fountain than needed by providing people with 12 oz cups which boggles my mind in a "bigger is better" style of food.  Take their food to an an investor and interior designer and this idea could go franchise.
