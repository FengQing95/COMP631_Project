Little Goat Diner////I love Little Goat.  I loved it originally for lunch and dinner, but I love it about a hundred times more for brunch.  Something about the atmosphere just screams old fashioned breakfast diner, and when you add in the amazing goat milk lattes I could sit there all day.  We actually sat at the bar last time and it was great watching the kitchen in action.  The biscuits and gravy are a must try - different and better than the classic.  And if they happen to have the goat hot dog on special, DO IT.  It sells out fast, so don't pass it up.  Then menu is huge, so I'm sure I could go there a hundred times and not have everything, but I think I'd be willing to try!
