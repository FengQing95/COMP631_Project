Little Goat Diner////Little Goat is the restaurant I've been to the most in the West Loop. I have it in my rotation of places I take friends that visit from out of town. I've been going here for years and I've only tried a small portion of the menu. My favorites include the biscuit. I'm from the south and I have very high standards for biscuits and it took me a while to find a place that I thought did them well. My other favorites are the machos nachos, fish tostadas, and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes.
