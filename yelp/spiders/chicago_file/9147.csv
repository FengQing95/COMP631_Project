Art Institute of Chicago////Lovely museum! Visiting from California and needed to get away from my relatives for a while. The museum is right off the Brown Line Train, I think. So easy to get to. Tickets are pricey, but if you get food stamps or aid it's free!  I started on the second floor looking at the Impressionists and made my way through all the Virgin Mary paintings. It's so cool to see works you learned about in College Art History classes, 'cept it's right there! Make your way to Van Gogh's self portrait. It's as if he put down the brush strokes minutes before you arrived. There's such an immediacy about the impressionist art. And a feeling of excitement! Check out"The Hay Stacks". I get a kick out of the Renaissance paintings too. I can't put my finger in why. But I can't get enough. The place is so huge I couldn't make it through the whole wing. I was there at lease 4 hours and I barely grazed the first floor art. I didn't try to do the modern stuff in the upper terrace. Though I did see the Warhols. Seems like everybody's got Warhols. There's and super huge collection in the Broad too. If you can make your way to the African Art so cool the totems and carvings. I felt a bit bad for the lady working that wing; so deserted! But it has cool Native American Headresses and a "scalping" suit. I think kids would enjoy this wing a lot. Start on the second floor and give yourself a day. Wear comfortable shoes. I really had to call it a day because my feet ached! The museum is in the heart of downtown so make your way over to the Federal Building  to see the Picssso Statues too.
