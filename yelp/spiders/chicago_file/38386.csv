Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I would not compare Bavette's toother tops steak spots such as RPM Steak (probably the best modern steakhouse in the city) because they are just very different things. RPM will give you a vastly better selection of steaks while Bavette's will give you an intimate experience with a good selection of non-steak dishes, but together they represent the vanguard on the front of steak in this city. Â Highly recommended.
