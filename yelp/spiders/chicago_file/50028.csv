Smoque BBQ////Someone (I assume one of the owners) asked how I liked my food.  I told him the chicken was dry including the dark meat.  I mean DRY.  He told me they smoked it for 5 hours.  Well, that's why it's so DRY -- smoked 3 1/2 hours too long.  I was not offered a replacement or an apology.  My husband thought his brisket was good.  The fries and cole slaw were just okay.  This place is too crowded for the price and the quality of the food.  Just goes to show hype will get you everywhere.
