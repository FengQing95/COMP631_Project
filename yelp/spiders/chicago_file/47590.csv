Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////BabaReeba was excellent. This was our first time here so we didn't know reservations were a must. We were told there would be a 2hr wait, ugh. But we were able to snag seats at 1 of the 2 bars in a matter of minutes and just ate and drank there. Our bartender was very attentive and courteous. The food was all great as well. We had bacon wrapped dates, grilled squid, shrimp. The sangria was awesome as well. I highly recommend BabaReeba, just be sure to make reservations.
