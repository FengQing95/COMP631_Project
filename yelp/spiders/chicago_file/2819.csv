The Purple Pig////Quite crowded, tables really close together. The wait staff is knowledgeable and gave some great recs. Started off with a beer ($7) and looked over the menu which is separated into categories, Snacks, Panini, Crisp and Fried, Pasta, Offal, Pork, etc. Plates are large, tapas style sharing. Great flavors, lots of options.
