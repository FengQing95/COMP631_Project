Little Goat Diner////Fortunately I did not have to wait long and was seated within minutes of my reservation. In all honesty I could have waited twenty minutes given how pleasant and attentive Jessica was. I had the opportunity to sit back and watch her with other customers and she was flawless. Thank you Jessica for adding some extra sunshine to an already perfect day!
