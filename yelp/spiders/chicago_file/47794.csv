Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great for groups and larger gatherings. I love Tapas style eating with a big group and the dishes here never disappoint. Food is good, good location, good ambiance and not too loud - the space is pretty large. The menu is expansive and people can generally find something that makes everyone happy. Good group drinking options as well (the sangria was good!).
