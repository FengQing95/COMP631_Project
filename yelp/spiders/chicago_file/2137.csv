The Purple Pig////One of the best meals I've ever had in my life. I ordered the bone marrow, which actually had a lot of take off the bones. Most places I go to have more bread than bone marrow, but that wasn't the case here. The parsley that comes with it adds a perfect balance to the buttery bone marrow. My boyfriend got the octopus, which was equally amazing. So much flavor and the right tenderness that is difficult to achieve.
