Smoque BBQ////If I could describe this place in one word it would be "Brisket". I tried the St Louis ribs and the brisket plus all the sides. The brisket outshines everything. It is so juicy and tender that it basically falls apart. The ribs were cooked perfectly, but it just didn't compare. I saw a lot of reviews about the meat being too smokey. I do my own smoking at home and I use very little smoke. I felt this was just as smokey as mine. You do taste the smoke but it's certainly not overwhelming. The sides were good, but nothing special. Same goes for the sauces. Â I just tasted the sauces on the side.
