Little Goat Diner////An entirely separate experience from Girl & the Goat. The food is quite tasty but the drinks are so-so with a minimal beer selection. I'm not really understanding the fancy diner theme. It is cute in a throw back hipster version of those awful 90's retro-50's diners but it is just a diner after all and I don't expect to pay that much for diner food even if it is uber tasty.
