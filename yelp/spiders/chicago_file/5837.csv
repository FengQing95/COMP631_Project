The Purple Pig////I always thought restaurants like these were overrated, giving tiny portions for exorbitant prices. Given how these plates were tapas style and meant to be shared, I knew the price was high. My friend and I came around 4:30 on a Monday, when you think the crowds would be low. But, in fact, I was wrong. The whole restaurant was close to packed!
