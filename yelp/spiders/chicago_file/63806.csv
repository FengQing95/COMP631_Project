Smoque BBQ////The prices are high but it's comparable to other bbq places in Chicago. I would try the ribs next time. My friends and I were able to get a table for 5 but when we were leaving, the line was out the door and people were standing around waiting for an empty table. It's not that big of a place so you might have to take it home to eat if you can refrain from devouring it in your car before getting home.
