Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is so damn good. I went for dinner and a weekend brunch. The brunch was great. It had a make your own bloody mary. You order the Vodka then you pick which juice and other ingredients to put it. The service is excellent and the setting is so fun. The waitstaff is super friendly and helpful if your new to the tapas experience. This is definitely not a place to go solo, though you can. Having a big group is great. The sangria is VERY good. There isn't much here that isn't super flavorful and fresh. And they bring it out in steps so it's a constant stream of amazing food. The chef has also made a commitment to natural and very fresh farm raised and local foods. I can't imagine this doesn't help the quality and taste of this wonderfully delightful tapas bar.
