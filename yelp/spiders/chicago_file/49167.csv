Smoque BBQ////It's a nice yet small dining area. Try the sampler because you can't go wrong. My wife doesn't care for coleslaw but here it's vinegar based and taste very good and she loved it. The brisket and sausage link were good and you can't go wrong with the pulled pork. The ribs are way better than Fat Willy's Ribs by far so give this place a shot.
