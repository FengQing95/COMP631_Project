Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Fun atmosphere and beautiful, casual breakfast. Maybe not the best pancakes i've ever had but they were certainly up there, and really delicious and well-priced. Flavored lemonades galore were an awesome addition. We waited about 40 minutes, but you can check out Millennium Park within buzzer range if you wait. I would return.
