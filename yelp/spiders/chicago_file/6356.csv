The Purple Pig////For entrees, we ordered the squid ink tagliatelle [$22], ravioletto [$19], and milk braised Berkshire shoulder [$23]. The tagliatelle was delicious, with the cherry tomatoes a perfect complement to the seafood flavors. However, the pasta was cooked slightly over al dente, not a major fault. The ravioletto was okay; given the ingredients, I was anticipating to receive a greater shock of flavor, but it seemed to have more of a one-note profile- a rich and warm single note, but could have benefited from more complexity. The pork shoulder was incredibly soft- I could have eaten the whole dish with a spoon. It was hearty and satisfying, but again I found myself wishing for a tiny hint of brightness or sweetness to further elevate the dish (something with fruit would have been fantastic!)- especially since, as previous reviewers have commented, it was on the salty side. As someone who has long since come to terms with my eventual spiral into hypertension, however, I didn't mind the level of salt. That being said, we generally enjoyed all of the entrees, and the portions and quality were generous for the price and location.
