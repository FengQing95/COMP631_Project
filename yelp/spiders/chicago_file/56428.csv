Smoque BBQ////With its trendy spelling, I expected the inside of Smoque to be some kind of Nouvelle Barbeque experience. And am I ever glad it's not! The inside is that of a simple, functional joint: tables and chair a little too close together, a self-serve machine for fountain drinks, and a counter where you place your order, pay your money, and pick up the goods when they call your name.
