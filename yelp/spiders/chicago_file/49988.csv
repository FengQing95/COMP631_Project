Smoque BBQ////First the ribs: while cooked nicely with a good char crust I thought the hickory smoke flavoring very overpowering and distracting. The smoke flavor should enhance the meat, not take it over. The fries were great and plentiful with a dusting of a spice powder which gave them some good flavor. The mac & cheese was only fair. The whole thing was dry with not much flavor and the crumb topping made a mess on the table. The slaw was fresh with a light dressing, however, the red onion was way too strong. The entire bowl smelled and tasted like onion. Finally the extra sauce that came with. For a place that concentrates on BBQ, this sauce is not good at all.
