Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time patrons but will definitely come back. We arrived just before 6 on a Thursday night. 15-20 minute wait, but they recommend placing order while waiting, which we did. We were seated within 10 minutes. Great service. Traditional Chicago style deep dish took about 40 minutes to come out which we were told. It is so worth the wait. Perfect flavors, crust was fantastic, and perfectly melted cheese. People were lined up out the door when we left about 7:30, so go early or prepare to wait. They do take phone number and will text you when table is ready. Â Must try when you visit Chicago.
