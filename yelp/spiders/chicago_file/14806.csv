Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Surprisingly, I think this was the first time I might have had green beer anywhere for St. Patty's Day.  It was some Blue Moon.  Wasn't quite the ephemeral experience I was hoping for, but hey, it was beer and it tasted like it.  It did the job and I didn't feel super different than a Blue Moon without the dye.
