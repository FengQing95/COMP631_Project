Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For those of you not familiar with what a Lou Malnati's deep dish is like, I'll give the basic run-down. The crust is first set into a deep pan. Not too much crust, just enough. Then a layer of sausage, a generous layer of cheese, and then topped with tomato sauce. Simple, but delicious. You wait half an hour after ordering, and then it comes out to you, a hot pie, with a crisp almost crumbly crust. The buttercrust at Malnati's is hands down the best crust of any other deep dish spot. Fork and knife necessary, load up on hot pepper and cheese if you would like, and enjoy!
