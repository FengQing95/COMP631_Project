Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is such a fun place to go. The Sangria is great and the portions are perfect. When everyone at the table orders two things it works out perfectly and you actually feel full. This is a lot of fun for groups of friends, but can be difficult if people do not like to try the things on the menu.
