Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Steakhouse with probably one of the best ambiences I've come across. Service was excellent, at the bar and at the table. Surprisingly, we also ordered some of Â the non steak entrees and they blew us away. That's saying a lot for a steak place. Finish your night off with a drink at the bar next door, and you've got yourself a good a** night
