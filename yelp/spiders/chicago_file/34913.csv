Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I loved everything about this place. Even including the complimentary warm bread and salty butter. My friend and I ordered the salmon tartare, baked goat cheese, bacon roasted tomato salad, fries and the rib eye. Everything was really delicious but I think my favorite was the bacon roasted tomato salad, it had a perfect balance of flavors. It's also a great date place - dim lighting and not too loud. Can't wait to go back and order more things on the menu.
