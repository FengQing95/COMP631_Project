Art Institute of Chicago////This new wing will offer brand new galleries of modern and European painting and sculpture as well as contemporary art, including film, video, and new media. Â It will also offer much needed additional space for special exhibitions and gallery space for the Department of Architecture and Design and Department of Photography (my personal favorite).
