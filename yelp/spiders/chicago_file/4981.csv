The Purple Pig////When a spot has over 5500 reviews, I make it a point to check it out. The roommate and I walked in on Monday, December 4th around when they opened at 11:30am. Luckily, there were only a few parties seated, so we got a table for two right away. The restaurant filled up fairly quickly, so I suggest getting here early as they do not take reservations.
