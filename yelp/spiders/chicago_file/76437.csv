Little Goat Diner////I took one look at the menu and said ta ta to my eat healthy New Years resolution (at least on this particular day). After deciding I wanted to go the lunch route (over breakfast) I narrowed it down to the tuna melt and fish tostadas. I decided to let our waitress choose between the 2 and she opted for the fish tostadas. And even another waitress who overheard enthusiastically shared that the fish tostadas were her favorite thing on the menu. Â We couldn't help, but get not 1...but 2 orders of them! One for a very hungry me and one for my colleague.
