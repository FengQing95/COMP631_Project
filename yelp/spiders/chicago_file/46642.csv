Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Lets just say that next time I'm in Chicago I'm scheduling another reservation here. The food is amazing, the servers are knowledgable about their wine, and the sangria will knock you on your ass. We started with the stuffed mushrooms, goat cheese with tomato sauce and the beef empanada. The goat cheese with tomato sauce was probably my favorite; unexpected flavors that went so well together, and I ended up eating the last few bites with a spoon sans bread.
