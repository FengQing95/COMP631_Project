Art Institute of Chicago////I had forgotten just how wonderful this museum is until I went back yesterday.  The Art Institute has a truly incredibly diverse collection, amazing modern art, some good contemporary, great photography, and just about anything else you could want to see.  You can still suggest an admission price until early June, and Tuesdays are free, so there is absolutely no reason not to spend a day here (or two, or three . . .).  Sadly the Chagall windows are not on view anymore (they're being restored for the next FOUR YEARS) but there are still thousands of reasons to visit the AIC.
