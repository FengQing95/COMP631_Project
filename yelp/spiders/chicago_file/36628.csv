Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////the dim lighting and decor was very Mad Men-esque, like a 1960's lounge/sexy office mashup. definitely a place that you take someone special to as there is a huge selection of wines, beers, and liqueurs as well as a great menu for whatever you're feeling: oysters, salads, steaks, fish, chicken - it's all good.
