Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best deep dish I have ever had.  Tried Gino and UNOs, but prefer Lou's by a lot.  Recommend there meat deep dish with their awesome sausage, and their veggie deep dish.  Get butter crust in both.  Only been to Lou's twice, and second trip the meat pizza wasn't hot, just warm - it was still good, but not as good as it should have been.  The veggie was better, and it was hot.  First time visit I had thought sausage pizza was a bit better than veggie.  Can't wait to try the new AZ location.  Now AZ has best deep dish & best thin crust @ pizzeria Biancos!!!
