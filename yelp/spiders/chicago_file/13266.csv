Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great pizza (classic deep dish is the usual for me), great service (as busy as it is at this location, giving free slices for the people during the wait is a great touch) and a great overall vibe makes this one of the best places to go to with a bunch of friends or on a date or even when showing someone from out of town!
