Little Goat Diner////Then came my sammich, Los Drowned. I have to admit, that i do not remember what my gf ordered. Mainly because this sammich consumed all my attention. Upon first bite, my heart melted, then stopped. Cardiac Arrest. I could have died there a happy man. Fortunately, i got to enjoy a few more bites before my belt told me that there was no more room.
