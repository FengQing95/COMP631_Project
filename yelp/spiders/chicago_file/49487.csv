Smoque BBQ////For what they are, I give them mad props. It's pretty good Memphis style que and gets better each time I go. I've not had the ribs yet, as I always go for the brisket (chopped more so than the sliced). The sauce is awesome, but it's all about the meat. Perfectly slow-and-lowed to melt in your mouth satisfaction. Which isn't easy. Especially with a sinewy brisket. The BYOB factor is key as well, that way you can have a couple beers while waiting in the super friendly line. Very nice. And don't go in a big group or you'll never get seated.
