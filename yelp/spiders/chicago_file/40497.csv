Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Walked in to a very dimly lit dining area, but not super loud or crowded but booths were 80%full. I like the nice cozy booth seating & the fact we were able to conversate comfortably. We started with drinks & they were perfect. Â Our bread was so delicious, served warmed with butter we asked for another basket. Our appetizer were the BEST. The shrimp scampi were top notch & off the chain! My husband and I made the mistake of dragging the warm bread into the garlic butter drippings of the shrimp & we both made eye contact with each other & yelled "DAMN!!" We immediately asked for a 2nd order! I just knew after the appetizer, the most amazing wedge salad ever & French 75 drink, my entree would be AMAZING. I started dancing in the booth in excitement.
