Art Institute of Chicago////The first thing you should know is that the place is tremendously large and it's simple to get lost if you make a wrong turn. Upstairs on the second floor there are amazing collections of artwork, furniture and scuplture. There are quite a few by Rodin (famous for his Thinker) and they're amazing. The Monet are not to be missed and the Van Gogh room is breathtaking. Even the lesser known artists are well represented, and I found a new admiration for the selection of the art.
