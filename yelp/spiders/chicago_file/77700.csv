Little Goat Diner////The menu was vast! There were so many breakfast items everywhere that it took forever for us to decide. I ended up going for "This Little Piggy Went to China," and it sure did. Sure, it wasn't a goat, but Szechuan pork sausage and chili garlic sauce gave every bite its own kick. Topped with a fried egg and served with a sesame cheddar biscuit, it was made for me!
