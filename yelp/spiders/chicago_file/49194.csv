Smoque BBQ////Hands down the best BBQ this side of the Mississippi!! My mouth is watering right now just thinkin about it. The ribs just fall off the bone, and the brisket melts in your mouth. Nothing beats that smoky flavor drenched with their home-made vinegar based BBQ sauce. Im gonna have to go get me some ASAP!
