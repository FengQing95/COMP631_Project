The Purple Pig////This place was so good I had tears in my eyes. I would highly recommend the bone marrow, milk braised pork shoulder, broccoli, smoked pork tongue, and the scallops. Each dish was amazing and showed astounding culinary talent; as a home chef I was amazed. The bone marrow was a perfect combination of grease, bread, herb, citrus, and salt. The broccoli was so suprisingly good and the scallops did not disappoint. The milk braised pork shoulder was the star of the night: the melt in your mouth meat combined perfectly with the mashed potatoes. The smoked pork tongue was good, and so was the lamb. You could tell the meat was very high quality. Overall, would definitely come here again, but the price tags are something to be careful of.
