Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////meh is right... came in here to get that "Chicago Style" pizza and it was meh. Was it worth the wait, meh. We got sat right next to the kitchen doors and it seemed as if every other runner/ server was dropping something. Yet the server was a bit slow getting to us and or checking in on us.
