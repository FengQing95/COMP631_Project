Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had "The Lou", which is vegetarian with a garlic butter crust, spinach, mushrooms, and fresh tomatoes. Though it is not the "original" butter crust, the hint of garlic flavor was amazing. It wasn't overwhelmingly saucy or cheesy and had just the right amount of toppings. I can't recommend this enough and plan to look into their delivery option to my home in CA...
