Little Goat Diner////Tried the goat chili which was suprprisingly good!  Followed it with the Los Drowned sandwich.  It was a flavorful mix of perfectly blended textures between the meat, peppers, avocado, bread and Au jus.  That said, the Korean Burger blew me away!  An amazing combination of flavors.  My previous experiences with goat meat had me expecting a dry and tough burger.  It was perfectly cooked and very juicy.
