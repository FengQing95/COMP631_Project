Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////wow, probably the best steak I've ever had.  absolutely perfectly cooked to a medium rare, even on the edge of the ribeye, which normally is cooked well done.  very tasty and a huge 24oz portion!  I was upset I had eaten too many appetizers that I wasn't able to finish this huge beast!
