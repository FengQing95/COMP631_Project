Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Decided to drop by after an excursion in Lincoln Park. It's a dimly lit Spanish tapas restaurant and deemed Chicago classic. A highlight of the menu was the sangria, but seeing as my companion & I opted to brown bag a green apple flavored Jack Daniels for later, we sadly had to forego imbibing this thing that everyone swears is the elixir of life.
