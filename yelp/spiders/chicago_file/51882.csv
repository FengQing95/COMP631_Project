Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I can't speak to the authenticity of the food, but we were definitely impressed, particularly by the sausage-fried paella rice. Still reminiscing about the perfectly charred sausage bits. The poached egg on top makes it acceptable for breakfast, and when mixed in, makes the rice so creamy! We also ordered the pinxtos platter which was gorgeously presented on a wooden paddle, and the buttermilk waffle with marcona almond, nutella and bananas. You can definitely taste the salt in their french toast and waffles, but the sweet syrup balances it out nicely.
