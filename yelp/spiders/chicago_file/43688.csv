Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ba Ba Reeba was my first try at tapas and i was impressed to say the least. We got around 6 plates for 4 people and it still managed to fill us up. The white peach sangria is WONDERFUL. I love sangria and i have to say this place delivered that light fruity taste that im drawn to. My only reason for not giving this place a 5 star is that the squid that we got was undercooked? I wasnt sure if it is suppose to be like that or is it just a mistake but it was very mushy. The flavors were still amazing, but the texture really threw me off to where i had to stop eating it due to my questioning of its cooked-ness. I still would come back and get the tapas here though and i would highly recommend it!!
