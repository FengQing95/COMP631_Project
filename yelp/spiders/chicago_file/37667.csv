Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It has a a cool ambiance with an upstairs part and a downstairs floor. With swanky decoration. The lighting is very dim, at first, we couldn't read the menu. A few customers (including us) had to use cellphone lights to read the menu. After about 1 hour, your eyes adjust, but it was actually a little difficult in the beginning. Not to mention the serves would go to a corner and stand under a light to read their notes.
