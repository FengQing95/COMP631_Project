Art Institute of Chicago////I also liked the collection of Toulouse-Lautrec, the famous French guy who was instrumental in the late 1800's for making Moulin Rouge posters, paintings, and was instrumental in getting Moulin Rouge to its peak in the turn of the century. It was a perfect way to start my trip as I was en route to Paris.
