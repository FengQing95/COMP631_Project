Little Goat Diner////Tried this place on a whim for Lunch. Had Peter as a server and we were simply whisked away with the outstanding service, attentiveness and extremely flavorful/creative dishes. Difficult to match I thought, until our subsequent visit. Shane was fabulous with her energetic "buzz", and spot on recommendations. She even managed to get my favorite dish made with a breakfast twist (two fresh eggs atop the Pork Belly Home Fries - Not To Be Missed). This place is unmatched! No need to wait for the "Guy" in the Red Camaro to shout this one out!
