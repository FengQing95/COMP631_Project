Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////These are my favorite tapas in the city. Make sure to go with a few people so you can try some of everything. Very Spanish feel to the place, and it's really big. The waiter was nice enough, but the service was probably my least favorite part of my experience. I had so many things that let me just give you some highlights of the menu. Starters: the chorizo wrapped dates were awesome. My favorite veggie was the spicy potato in tomato sauce. In seafood, I am a sucker for an empanada, so I loved the ones with scallops in it. The Spanish sausage was a great meat. We really overdid it because after all of that, we ordered paella. Smart idea because the valenciana was awesome. Bad idea because we over ate and the bill spiked. So if you go, either just an app or 2 with the paella or skip the paella and enjoy the menu.
