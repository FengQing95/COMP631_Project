Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went on a Sunday night and we thought everything was mediocre. Nothing wowed us and the service was lacking. We felt that the bus boy did more work than our waitress. We ordered our food in 3 different waves and we saw her a total of 4 times (the last time she brought us our check). Â She never checked in on us or asked how was the food and everytime we needed something, she was nowhere to be found! Instead, we had to the ask the busboy for more bread and more sauce to go with our potatoes.
