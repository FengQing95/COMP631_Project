Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This is by far my favorite breakfast place in downtown Chicago. I go here every opportunity I get to be in town! The food is amazing! I highly recommend indulging in the cinnamon roll pancakes! I have tried their omelets and they are very good as well. Yes, you will wait when you come to eat here on a weekend. I used the Yelp app to put us on the waitlist as soon as we go to the city. It was between 1.5-2 hour wait. I already knew this, so my daughter and I spent some time at Millennium Park and Maggie Daly Park both of which are right across the street, before we had our brunch. It was perfect. By the time she was tired from running around at the park, she was hungry and it was time to check in. The service is fast and most servers have a great sense of humor and readily recommend interesting dishes.
