Art Institute of Chicago////We didn't get there for opening but we did get there before noon.  I figured we'd have enough time to see everything without going too quickly.  This museum is huge and it's so huge that you'd better have both comfortable shoes and be prepared to walk a lot if you want to see every gallery or at least as much as time permits.
