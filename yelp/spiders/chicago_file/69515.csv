Little Goat Diner////The place is really cool, very classy dineresque and although it was packed at 4pm on a Saturday, we were seated immediately at the bar where we could see the kitchen. Â Our waiter seemed to want to be anywhere but at work which was unfortunate for us and also for the girl sitting next to us who's water glass he totally overflowed and sauntered away.
