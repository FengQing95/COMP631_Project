Smoque BBQ////I wouldn't rave about this BBQ. But as far as something that is quick and overall good, that was this. The line was long but it still only took maybe 5-10 mins to get our food. The pulled pork was just the right level of smokey, and the sauces added a good flavor to it. The bread was also very tasty! But again, was nothing to go crazy about.
