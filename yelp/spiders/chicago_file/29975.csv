Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm so glad I listened to the recommendation of one of my Chicago-afficionado friends when I was deciding where to eat Chicago Deep Dish: I was not disappointed! This place is great! I had the Lou in a personal size and it was quite lovely. I really enjoyed the flavour of my pizza, it came hot and was such a great texture. I'm glad this place has personal-sized pizzas as many of the other pizzerias do not have quite as small of options and I didn't want the same flavour as my dining companion (she got the lunch deal which included her sausage pie and a salad). Regardless it was great.
