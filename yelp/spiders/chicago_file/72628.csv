Little Goat Diner////You have to love a trendy, top chef diner that serves some of the more creative breakfast dishes all day long. I seriously love breakfast, so the fact that this place a) will serve me breakfast all day and b) they will serve me breakfast dishes I would never think to make at home myself ever, makes this place a winner for me.
