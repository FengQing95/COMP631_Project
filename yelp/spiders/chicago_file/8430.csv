Art Institute of Chicago////I haven't been here for several months, but today attended the Doctor Atomic talk with John Adams and Peter Sellars, and I am simply awestruck not only by them but once again by the institution and reminded how important and amazing it is.   I just want to come back every couple months and wander, put on my Ipod and listen to music from every similar era....I find that the music makes my perceptions super-sensitive as it did today when I went through just a little bit.  Today is what it is all about: experiencing a mind-shattering opening of dozens of new doors and perceptions, art taking me on new paths of experience and discovery.  Vague ain' it.
