Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When in Rome...well, in Chicago...you've got to try the deep dish pizza once. I'm not a pizza person, really, hardly ate it back home unless someone else insisted on getting one. So, first day out we came to LM's for the famed Chicago deep dish. We had "The Lou" which featured marinara sauce, cheese, spinach, and mushrooms topped with slices of fresh tomatoes. The pizza came out piping hot (so do let it cool a bit, lest you want to burn your tongue and kill all the taste buds along with the burn). The first bite of the gooey cheese oozing and steaming along with the tomato, sauce, etc. did not disappoint. It made my taste buds do a little dance! The crust was light and buttery in spite of its thickness. Loved it, I dare say! A great start for our Chicago experience. Only complaint here was that the sauce was not evenly distributed so that portions near the edge were lacking this deliciousness. This was Sunday lunch.
