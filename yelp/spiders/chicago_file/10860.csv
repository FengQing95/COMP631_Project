Art Institute of Chicago////The museum has an enormous range of periods and styles in its massive collection. If you only have one day, it can be overwhelming to try to fit in everything you want to see, so plan accordingly. I definitely recommend checking out the floor plan online before you visit so you can make the most of your day. Time will fly by during your visit and the museum will be closing before you know it!
