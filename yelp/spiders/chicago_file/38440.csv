Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was based on the server. He was attentive and kind but appear incredibly overwhelmed the entire time we were there. He didn't seem to have anymore tables than any other server, yet he continuously forgot stuff, kept dropping things, and spilling things. It was weird. He dropped my fork, a plate (and broke it!), the water bottle Â (spilled water everywhere), forgot my husband's drink and took literally 20 minutes to give us the check after we asked for it...even though he had to walk by our table every time he needed to get to his other tables. Aaanndddd he forgot we were celebrating a bday. I wouldn't have expected anything had I not seen multiple other tables with candles in their desserts. So. There you have it.
