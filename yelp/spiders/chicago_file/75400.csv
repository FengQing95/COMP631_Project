Little Goat Diner////My first visit with two girlfriends. Lunch time and you will need to be prepared for a 20 to 30 minute wait. Went to bar, bartender a bit disinterested yet we finally got his attention although felt we were bothering him perhaps because we were just waiting for a table. He ended up warming up a bit and got us a table.
