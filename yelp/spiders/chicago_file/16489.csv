Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Anyways, we got a 9" Malnati's Chicago Classic for delivery. We were told that it was going to take 1 hour to cook and delivery to us and it arrived exactly at the 1 hr marker so kudos to them for that. Even though it was delivered, the pizza was still fantastic. The combination of the cheese, tomato sauce sausage and the buttered dough complemented each other perfectly.
