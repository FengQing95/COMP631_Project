Art Institute of Chicago////Deep in the basement is the miniatures section, which admittedly I wasn't too excited about. But, after trekking down there, I was absolutely stunned by the quality and attention to detail. I'm pretty sure most people that visit the Art Institute probably don't head down to the minis area, but make sure you do next time. It's like traveling back in time, all over the world, and getting a taste of what life was like back then. Truly stunning.
