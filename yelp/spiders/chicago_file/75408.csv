Little Goat Diner////I am obsessed with Little Goat. I can't believe I haven't left a review yet. Every time we go we sit at the bar (open seating--grab a drink (start with a bloody mary) while you wait and be cutthroat and you will get a seat). Cinnamon buns and pork belly home fries are my go to starters (pork belly home fries are like meat croutons they're so good!) Amazing bougie brunch, but not too bougie, know what i mean? Great bartenders, food, and atmosphere. And they have goat milk as an alternative milk option, what more could you want?
