Little Goat Diner////The heat and stuggling A/C (they actually brought in portable units to help cool down the room) could not stop my girlfriend and I from devouring mass quantities of delicious vittles.  Definitely check out the goat chili cheese fries.  Rich, hearty and ridiculously addictive.  I went with the Bull's Eye French Toast while she opted for the Dark Chocolate Chip Crunch pancakes.  Looking back , we could have easily split one of the dishes are they run fairly large.  Of the two, I like my selection a bit more (I opt for more savory vs. sweet dishes).  The french toast was accompanied with an egg, strawberries and some of the best fried chicken I have tried all covered by a bbq maple syrup.  Yes-strange ingredient bedfellows but it definitely worked!
