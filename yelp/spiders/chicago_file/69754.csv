Little Goat Diner////Let me walk you through it.  The carryout counter is all the way in the back.  You can't see it when you walk in and need to be directed through the people standing around with no place to go.  Then you have to walk through them again on the way out.  When you get back there, there is no clear line, so it's hard to tell who already has ordered.  I quickly learned that none of the customers milling around back there were waiting to order, but rather all were waiting for their food which, in retrospect, should have been taken as a warning sign.
