Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our drinks took way too long to get even had to ask him to check on them it was not even busy. Â When the meal came I noticed the steaks looked very dark and stiff on the plates..grant it is dark but this was different I could tell. We cut into our steaks and the steak first of all was super stiff and charred on the outside to the extent of burnt thickness exterior no joke. I took a bite and couldn't believe that this would happen not at this so called takes forever to get a reservation and so well sought after to dine in.. literally could not believe I had better cooked steaks at Texas Roadhouse... seriously.. for me to compare the two and come to that conclusion baffles me. I asked my husband how is yours said same as yours. The taste it left in your mouth. I couldn't even...so bitter.
