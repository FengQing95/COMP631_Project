Little Goat Diner////Came here for brunch. Had to wait even though we had a reservation but def was worth it. I got the fried chicken French toast. Was a very interesting and tasty combo. Glad I tried it. Wife got the chicken sandwich which was delicious. We got the chocolate chip pancakes to share for the table and they were perfect. Service was good too. Would come here again.
