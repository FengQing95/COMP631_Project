Smoque BBQ////Everything was super!!!! And the brisket was the best I have ever tried. The rib was also not bad. In terms of the side dish. OMG!!!  You must try the BBQ beans. So delicious to accompany the BBQ sauce.  The mac&cheese was also great. I personally do not eat mac&cheese in daily basis, but this one at Smoque BBQ nailed it.  It will be pretty busy during weekend. I suggest you have a patience for a long line or go there during weekdays.
