Art Institute of Chicago////The museum's website is impressively useful, especially the comprehensive collections search tool.  I emailed them to ask about a favorite work of mine (an etching by Albrecht Durer) and why it had not been displayed for several years.  The reply was not only timely (within one business day), honest, and thorough, but delivered a gem of a suggestion:  apparently any visitor can arrange, by appointment, to view privately any of the 80,000 works in the print and drawing collection.
