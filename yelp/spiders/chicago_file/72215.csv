Little Goat Diner////Went with a few friends for brunch to this place. There is an hour wait. About food, didn't find anything special...the food was mediocre.. I ordered corn beef hash. It came out so greasy, so much potato hash, asked for egg o/e, it was barely cooked! Â My friend got "the little pig went to china" she said it was decent! It's ok for an experience, but don't think I'll go back! Left this place still hungry and not happy! Definitely there are better places than "little goat".
