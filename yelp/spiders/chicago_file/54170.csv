Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is great for tapas. Sangria was not the best I've had, but the food certainly made up for that. Had the octopus, squid, skirt steak, and the buffalo chicken. Everything tasted delicious. Perfect to share if in between two people. Finished off with the caramelized banana desert which was light and delicious.
