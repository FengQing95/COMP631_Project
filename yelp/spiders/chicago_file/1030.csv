Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////What a busy and great spot. Came here on a Sunday, which I'm sure is the busiest day but it was worth the hour wait. We had the pancakes of course, then I had the "all meat" breakfast skillet. It was a tough decision because the Mexican breakfast skillet sounded amazing as well. It was a lot food so bring your appetite for the pancakes and skillet meals. Great place. Definitely my breakfast spot every time I visit Chicago.
