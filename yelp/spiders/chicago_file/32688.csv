Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Amazing!  I loved it.  The atmosphere is dark, romantic, and intimate.  The drinks are fabulous.  The food, my god, the food!  The oysters were delicious, the goat cheese app was perfect.  My filet was cooked perfect medium rare and was seasoned just right.  The sides (we had this delicious spicy corn, fries & creamed spinach) were very memorable.  The fries are fried in pork fat, but they're not greasy and the flavor is not overpowering.  I could go on and on - but basically everything is amazing and I'm going back ASAP.
