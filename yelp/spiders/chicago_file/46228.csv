Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love this place!  Ordered a ton of tapas with a group of four for my Birthday and everything was AMAZING.  They spaced out the food so we were not overwhelmed but by the end I think our eyes were bigger than our stomachs.  We were full and the food we order kept on coming. So delicious.  Recommended for anyone in the area or traveling to the city.  Service was great even though the place was packed.  Free dessert for my Birthday...can't complain there!
