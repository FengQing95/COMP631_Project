Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There is a Spanish aphorism that I love, "Tapas are tiny presents for happy drunks." Â Whether you're drinking or not, tapas does feel like little presents and Cafe Ba Ba Reba knows how to throw a great party. Mercat is more refined and authentic, but sometimes you just want to have fun. Cafe Ba Ba Reba is festive and bustling. And it's Lettuce Entertain You so you get points.
