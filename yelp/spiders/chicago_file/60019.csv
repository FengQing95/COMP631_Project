Smoque BBQ////Similarly, I never even tried pork until I hit my twenties.  I grew up in a vegetarian family, and occasionally had poultry or fish.  And I had never had ribs until I came to Chicago - and it just so happens that I was living in the south side and ended up trying it at joints like Uncle John's, Lem's, BK - in fact, the south side is filled with amazing barbecue joints.
