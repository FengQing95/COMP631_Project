Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We went to Bavette's for our anniversary dinner. Reservations were made requesting a booth which we didn't get and got seated at a two-top along the wall elbow to elbow with other patrons. No acknowledgement of our anniversary either. However, we did get seated right away, which was a plus.
