Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We were on a holiday in Chicago, and were by the Millenium Park when we started searching for a place to have a hearty brunch at. LUCKILY we stumbled upon Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe. The 90 minute wait time did not deter us especially after we saw the rave reviews and the delicious looking menu. And I must say that was the best decision ever! After working up quite an appetite during the wait time at the Millenium Park, we were rewarded with the best brunch that I have had in a long long time! Between the two of us we had the fresh juices, Mexican Omelettes, hash browns, signature pancakes and a panini. And Oh boy, everything tasted legit! Its very rare for a restaurant/ cafe to get such a high rating (with so many reviews) on yelp. And now we can totally vouch for that. Will go back again the next time I'm in Chicago for sure. Totally worth the 90 minute wait!! Didn't think I would ever say that ;)
