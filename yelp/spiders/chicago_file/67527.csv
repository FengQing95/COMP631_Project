Little Goat Diner////This review for the Front Of House. I called in with the legitimate, honest question of whether or not they will have the Bears game on, as we were scheduled for a function there on a Sunday afternoon. I was told with an unprovoked attitude that "We don't like football. Watch it on your phone." While I appreciate that they may get asked this question quite often, a FOH member at any decent restaurant recieves no excuse for a total lack of courtesy and professionalism. If I had been making my own plans to go there, I definitely wouldn't have done so after that conversation.
