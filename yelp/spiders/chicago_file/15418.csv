Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was pretty darn good, I can't lie.  The difficulty eating it detracted from my experience a little, as did my discomfort (damn my ghostly skin!), but I could still appreciate that this was more than just a pie filled with cheese and toppings.  The sauce is flavoured wonderfully, and the crust was fantastic.  It was a bit of calorie-and-artery-clogging-overload for me though, and I couldn't manage more than one slice.  This is definitely a once in a loooong time kinda meal, but it's worth checking out.
