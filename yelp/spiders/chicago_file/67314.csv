Little Goat Diner////Had really high expectations for Little Goat since it was named best brunch in the city, but it wasnt all it cracked up to be. Went around 10 on a Saturday morning and we got right in, the food was delivered very fast. I got the kimchee omelette pancake with "asian thingys", it was just ok, definitely would not order it again. Looking at the price of things on the menu ($6 bacon) not sure if it is worth a trip back.
