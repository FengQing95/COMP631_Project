Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Octopus a la plancha w/ fingerling potatoes and olives was probably the least favorite of the night. Perhaps we got a bad portion due to the fact that it was tough and chewy. No good! However, there were some portions of the dish that were really tender so it wouldn't be wise to dismiss this entirely.
