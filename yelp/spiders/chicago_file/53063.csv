Smoque BBQ////We got a side of brisket. I've only had BBQ brisket once before at a South Carolina style BBQ place in Maryland. This brisket was UNBELIEVABLE. When ordered we were asked "sliced or chopped" we opted for sliced. The flavor of the meat, the smokiness of it and the melt in your mouth tenderness was too much! The side portion of it was generous and I may be a brisket convert.
