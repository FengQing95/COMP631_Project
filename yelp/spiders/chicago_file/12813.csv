Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I consider myself a pizza snob... I've grown up in Chicago on some of the best pizza known to mankind! I'm always amazed that a Domino's or Pizza Hut could possibly make a profit in Chicago 'cause I can't imagine anyone but out-of-towners and transplants buying that stuff. I've read some of the reviews from out-of-towners and I'm not really surprised when they don't like Chicago Pizza.... who knows what kinda pizza they've been eating all their lives--- Â but I can pretty much guarantee that it was nothing like Chicago Style pizza.
