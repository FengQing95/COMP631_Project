Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This review is to comment on the service my husband and I received last night. Several minutes after we sat down, our waitress came over to take our order. We ordered a small pizza and a personal slice. She asked if we wanted an appetizer because the pizza would take 45 minutes to come out. We didn't really want one because we we didn't want to ruin our appetites for the pizza, but we were so hungry we decided to order an appetizer too. We ordered the 3 cheese bread appetizer and were told the appetizer would take 10 to 15 minutes to come out. 3 other groups of people came and ordered after us. 30 minutes passed and we still didn't have our appetizer, but two of the other tables had already received their appetizers and one had received their entree. We decided to ask our waitress when our appetizer would come out since it had been so long and all we ordered was cheese bread. She told us it would be out in a few minutes. My husband jokingly said, "Sorry, we're just starving." To which the waitress rudely replied, "So is everyone else." About 5 more minutes passed and she came by apologizing for the wait and told us that the appetizer would be free. Several minutes later we got the appetizer which was literally just garlic bread with cheese on it and marinara sauce for dipping. I'm not sure why that would take about 40 minutes to make. Between finishing our appetizer and receiving our entrees, it took another 20 minutes. During those 20 minutes, the 2 of the other groups of people received their entrees and one of them had completely finished their food, paid for it, and left. When we received our food, the personal pizza seemed like it had been sitting out for a while because it was not hot at all compared to the small pizza that was still steaming. Despite the bad service we received regarding the time, there were a few good things about the service since the waitress did apologize for the wait and she was pretty friendly except for that one rude comment. However the experience we had is enough that we will avoid coming to this restaurant again especially for dinner. Bottom line, don't make up arbitrary time limits if you can't back them up.
