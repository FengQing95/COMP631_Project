Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you're lactose-intolerant or dairy-free, I'm sad to report that they do not carry non-dairy cheese here. It's probably the norm in Chicago, but I thought I'd mention it for similarly unfortunate souls looking for Chicago deep dish that won't make you shit your pants. The crust is probably dairy-free as long as it is not Buttercrust--duh. I did not ask for a vegan crust as I'm not allergic to dairy, so I don't know if they'll be able to accomodate the request.
