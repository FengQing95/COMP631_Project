Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Their pizza is the best in Chicago. The buttery crust is so delicious. I tried both Lou Malnati and Giordanos and this one beats Giordanos no doubt. The crust was buttery, had the right amount of cheese, the sauce was flavorful. I would come back to Lou Malnati's the next time I'm here. We got the sausage with green peppers added to it. Next time I will probably do Pepperoni based on the other reviews. The only reason I knocked off a star is that their cutlery was dirty and when we told the server she didn't apologize and she almost seemed annoyed at us for asking her to get us a new plate and fork. There was sauce stuck on it! I'm just glad the pizza that came made up for it! We had it with a spinach salad as well. Ps. A small is more than enough for 4 people to share unless you are very hungry!
