Little Goat Diner////My girlfriend got the goat burger, done buffalo style. I thought it was cool they had loco moco as an option, the rice/hamburger/egg combo found in Hawaiian cuisine. It had just enough blue cheese so that you tasted it without it overpowering the burger, and the meat was juicy without being overly greasy.
