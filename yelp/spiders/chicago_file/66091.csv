Smoque BBQ////I ate the brisket sandwich. The bun was very soft and tasty. The brisket thankfully was not dried out or tough. A lot of briskets are. It had the burnt outside crust still on the pieces. They gave us 2 different sauces. One was Memphis and one was Carolina. The Carolina was vinegary and had some kick to it. I preferred the Memphis.
