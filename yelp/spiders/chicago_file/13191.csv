Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Even though some of my friends highly recommend this place I didn't have a good experience. Waiting time is too long ranging from 30 to 45 minutes. You have to order ahead if you want to eat sooner. Also, our pizza was soggy and the sauce was a little salty. Luckily, the girl that took care of us was really nice.
