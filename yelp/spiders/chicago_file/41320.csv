Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I like Cafe-Ba-Ba-Reeba, but I am not in love with it.  I think that the Sangria is really great and it is fun to share the pitchers.  I have been here a few times and my best experience was when it was super crowded, but a spot at the bar cleared, so my boyfriend and I sat there and ate.  I like the decor because it is warm and the meat hanging from the ceiling add to the ambiance. I really like the goat cheese in tomato sauce, but it is something that my boyfriend can make at home.. which he did and it was better then the restaurants.  I feel like a lot of stuff on the menu, my boyfriend can make, and so if I go there its because I want the experience not necessarily the food.  I  do think the atmosphere is fun and on some nights there are flamenco dancers that are entertaining.  I will go back here because for whatever reason I do like it, but like I said, I don't love it.
