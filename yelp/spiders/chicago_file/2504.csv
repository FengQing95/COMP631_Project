The Purple Pig////There's a wait because they don't take reservations. We put in our name and number around 5:30pm on a Saturday. They finally called us at 7:30pm (2 hour wait). Worth it!!!! But I'm pretty sure if you just come earlier you can get seated earlier. It's right on the magnificent mile so you can walk around and shop while you're waiting. This area gets pretty packed on Saturdays so I think more restaurants have a wait. I've noticed chicago isn't really big on taking reservations.
