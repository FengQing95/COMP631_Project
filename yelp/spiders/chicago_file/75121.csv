Little Goat Diner////Pretty good place for brunch. My friend and I were visiting Chicago and heard this is another restaurant owned by top chef Stephanie Izard, and she's a fan of the show. Came close to 11am for breakfast/brunch on a weekday and we're lucky to get there when we did as the lunch crowd started piling in shortly after and a small line formed. Place is really nice and clean yet simple. Has a somewhat modern diner feel to it. Staff was friendly and met our needs just fine.
