Smoque BBQ////I went here a while ago so maybe things have changed.  We were quite disappointed.  The food had a great taste but the brisket was dry and everything was cold by the time we got it back to our table.  I think the reason may be because the place is very basic in terms of decor w/cement floors, etc. and we went during winter.  The door kept opening and closing and I think the place was a little cold and barbecue doesn't always hold its heat.  I think the trick is that if you go here in winter, to get your food "to go" so that you can heat it up when you get home.  When we were there, the food did not survive the trip from the counter to our table.
