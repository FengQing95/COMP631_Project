Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////After starting off with drinks from the well-stocked bar (including an incredibly rich cognac sazerac - highly recommended), we started off with the larger of the seafood platters. The expectations were not high in a landlocked state in the dead of winter, but everything was pretty damn good - the salmon ceviche and west coast oysters were standouts. It was definitely a generous amount of seafood, but we plowed ahead and shared a few dishes afterwards, including the delicious and incredibly reasonably-priced burger ($9.95), the super-tender beef tongue, and the rich foie gras terrine (accompanied by a heavenly sweet blackberry jam).
