Little Goat Diner////Finally got the chance to go to Little Goat after a year! Reservations are a must. The wait can be almost two hours for a weekend brunch without a reservation. I came here on a weekday at 11 and it was still fairly packed. The spacious restaurant boasts natural lighting and white decor. Service was quick and fast.
