Little Goat Diner////This place is amazing and be sure to make a reservation! We went on a busy Sunday morning (actually Father's Day) for breakfast. Since we had a reservation, we were sat at a nice comfy booth within a couple of minutes. The service was outstanding, friendly and gave great recommendations. Upon request, they have a vegan menu, how cool is that? It has many of the dishes with some simple substitutions so I don't have to even ask for them. Sweet!
