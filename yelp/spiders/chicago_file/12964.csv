Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Are the people giving this place good reviews eating different pizza than me or have they never left Chicago and don't know any better?! I went to Lou Malnati's with the highest expectations, given its reputation. We ordered the classic deep dish pizza. Much to my disappointment, my first bite of Lou Malnati's was bland. The crust had clearly been frozen, then unfrozen before baking. The crust was stale instead of buttery. It tasted like a freezer. I might have been able to overlook how terrible the crust was (if I wasn't eating deep dish pizza where the crust is so prominent) if the toppings were great. But they weren't. The sauce needed salt. In fact, the only thing that had any flavor was the meat topping. I've had better frozen grocery store pizzas than whatever this was. Chicago has such amazing food that I won't be wasting anymore time eating frozen dough at Lou Malnati's in the future.
