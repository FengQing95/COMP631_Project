Art Institute of Chicago////After a year long hiatus, I finally came back to the AI and I can definitely conclude that this has to be one of my favorite places to go. I can geek it up for hours admiring the same pieces over and over again, and it's still fascinates me. There are so many positive reviews for the AI already, I really don't need to add my two cents, but I can and I will. Â Because I love it.
