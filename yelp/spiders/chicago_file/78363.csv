Little Goat Diner////All the Goats are in one area and I've actually hit them all up in the same night thanks to mainly my first tip. Little Goat is a great place to start at. It has this fun diner vibe with a mix of breakfast/lunch/anytime/Asian inspired items on the menu. Their menu is also puny (e.g. Cereal Killers; I'm such a sucker for puns) and has a section dedicated to potatoes (Tater Town) so you know this place is already going to be good. And with a name that includes G.O.A.T., it sets the bar high.
