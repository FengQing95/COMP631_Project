Smoque BBQ////It's much better Memphis-style dry-rub barbecue than I'm used to, but if you're more into Kansas City barbecue (where the sauce is the boss), I think there are better alternatives. Seating was very tight, but tables opened up pretty quickly. Portions were very small. A "full" rack of ribs, 2 sides, and a drink was borderline enough for me (I weigh 125 pounds) and God help you if you get the 1/2 rack. At around $25, it was too expensive for the portion size.
