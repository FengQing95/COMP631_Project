The Purple Pig////We opted to sit at the bar since the wait for a table was at least 45 minutes and I was hungry. We ordered this specialty tequila drink which was just the right amount of tequila, not overpowering at all. I had two in fact! My friend and I decided that we wanted to split a couple of dishes from the menu so we could enjoy many things and not get full. Our appetizer was the eggplant caponata which was a party in your mouth of flavor. I even ate the bread! We started with the broccoli which was in this sauce that will wow you. It's saut√©ed well but the flavor was out of this world. Next we tried the pork shoulder (we really wanted the pork belly but it is limited and was sold out by the time we ordered it). It came with polenta and gravy and was so tender it literally melted with each cut. Our third course was the octopus which was very tender and not at all rubbery or tasting or fishy. Finally, we ended with the bone marrow. Now, if you don't know bone marrow or have never tried it, this is the place to give it a whirl. It comes with some bread, cilantro, and a pinch of salt. I ate it straight off the bone it was one of the best bone marrow I've tried, and I've tried it a few different places. Simply melts in your mouth. Perfecto!
