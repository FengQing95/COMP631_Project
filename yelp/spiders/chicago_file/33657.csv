Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The server was also one of the bartenders and was fantastic the entire night.  He offered some real suggestions to us and gave his honest opinion, which was really helpful in selecting our meals.  We went with the duck and goat cheese terrine to start.  It was garlicky, but as garlic lovers we didn't really mind.  I then had the petite duchess cut filet while my husband had the Chicago cut.  Both were lovely.  We also shared some fries and creamed spinach.  Rich and delicious!  And finally we ordered the goldbrick sundae for dessert.  We'd only ever seen this listed on the menu of one other restaurant (The Temptation in Boca Grande, FL) so we knew that we had to try it.  We selected a scoop of vanilla and whiskey ice cream and it came out with a small cup of the chocolate shell that hardened as it was poured over the top of the ice cream.  Yum, yum, yum!  However, by this point we were more than stuffed and so we have to admit that not much of the dessert was really finished.  Though we would've liked to eat more...especially now as I write this and I am hungry again!
