Little Goat Diner////This place is absolutely incredible! The flavors of every dish that I had was fantastic. First time coming last night. I tried their special sesame sweet cream latte, very delish. Also tried the pork belly pancake, little piggy went to China, goat chili & pork belly fries with cheese sauce on the side. Everything was great. Highly recommend and reasonably prices. Our server was perfect, don't remember his name but great staff!
