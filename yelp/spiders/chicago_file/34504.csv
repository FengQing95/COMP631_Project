Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had the dry-aged bone-in ribeye. Had to. It was outrageously perfect. So was the shrimp de jonghe we ordered to accompany. For starters, though, we had oysters, really great. Our server did a fab job describing the w. coast vs. e. coast types. We got a medley to experiment - yum.
