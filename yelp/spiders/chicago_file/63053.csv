Smoque BBQ////I'm a HUGE fan of the chopped brisket. I pretty much always order it, unless I'm going for the pulled pork, which is a rare occurrence. If you're getting the platter - which you probably should be - you can get 2 sides and slaw. I'm not a cole slaw person, so I always sub in corn bread - YUMMM - but I've heard the slaw is pretty good. The mac and cheese is my favorite side to add...so much so I may just grab 2 mac and cheeses. Don't judge, now that we live in Seattle we don't get to enjoy this gem nearly often enough, so I've gotta get it when I can! Other delicious options include: the texas sausage and the ribs - you can add a taste of something to your meal for a few bucks so you can have more deliciousness to devour.
