Little Goat Diner////We had a gift card to use and had a great time, it was gift the migrant workers night off evening, and you could hear the stress in the servers voice when explaining they were struggling with a small staff on, we didn't mind. There was a few thing I would've tried if that hadn't been out of product, but my chicken was good. There was a man that was screaming at people on the way in and out(which was not the establishments fault)and it was so busy we couldn't sit at the Small 6 seater bar, this wasn't a bad thing for the restaurant, but soured the eve a bit for us. All in all would recommend a night here.
