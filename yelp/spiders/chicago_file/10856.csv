Art Institute of Chicago////They also have free wifi throughout and advertise an app..I had hoped the app could also play the audio part of tour but it did not have that feature. I would download this app prior to your visit as it has a lot of useful information, trying to decipher it while walking through the museum halls you will not get the full Â use of it. Download early, get used to the app, then visit the museum would be my recommendation.
