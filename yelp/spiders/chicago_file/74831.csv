Little Goat Diner////The extra star is for the service and ambiance. Our waitress was very sweet and cheery even early in the morning on a Friday. She wrapped up our to go lunches so we could eat them down at the air show practice without issue. Multiple members of the staff were available to grab us extra napkins, keep coffee topped off or just offer a friendly smile if eye contact was made.
