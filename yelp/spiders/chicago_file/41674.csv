Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Solid tapas but missing that little something that would push it into 4 star range. I like the ensalada de espinacas and the patatas bravas the best. The last time I had the sangria, I ended up worshiping the porcelain goddess after getting home. I don't know if it was just me or the sangria itself but it's definitely made me leery about going back.
