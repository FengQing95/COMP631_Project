Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I know it's up for debate as to who has the best Chicago deep dish, but my vote goes to Lou Malnati's.  Gino's East doesn't even come close.  I love Lou's so much that I have their pizza shipped to me on the left coast.  This river north location is sort of small, I prefer the northern suburb location - I forget which burb...but it had a large dining area, great ambiance, and baseball memorabilia.  I wish I could remember which location.  Anyways, every time I meet someone from Chicago, I have to launch into a full blown discussion about Lou Malnati's.
