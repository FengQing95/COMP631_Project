Little Goat Diner////My boyfriend and I visited Little Goat on New Years Day 2014 after staying downtown in the loop. We sat at the counter (highly recommended). We watched the food coming out of the kitchen and chatted with the other customers seated by us, while enjoying bloody marys (the cream cheese stuffed olive was AMAZING). The food was AWESOME and was presented beautifully. The dishes all had slight twists and variations that made them interesting and delicious. Greg wasn't impressed with their pork belly, but enjoyed his omelete of the day (BBQ pork). The hash browns were also excellent. I loved the ambiance and crowd. We will definitely go back when we are in Chicago.
