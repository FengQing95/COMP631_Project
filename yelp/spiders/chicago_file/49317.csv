Smoque BBQ////It's ok. I really can't tell how this place is considered so fabulous.  It seems a tad bit overrated.  I sent my husband to buy me something for take out when I was pregnant and he said he waited in line for an hour just to order.  The food was ok, not great.  I don't understand the hype.
