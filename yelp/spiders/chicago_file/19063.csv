Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my very first time trying deep-dish pizza! I've heard how long the wait can be at this place, but my friends and I arrived just a few minutes after opening so we were seated almost immediately. My friends and I ordered 2 large deep-dish pizzas: the Lou's and pepperoni/sausage. Between the 6 of us in the group, 2 large pizzas was more than enough. Each of us had 2 slices and were already full. Out of the 2 pizzas we ordered, I really liked the pepperoni/sausage.
