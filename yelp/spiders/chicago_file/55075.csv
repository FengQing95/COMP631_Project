Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We were there on a Friday night. Very busy. We called to be on their waitlist and then showed up and then they texted us when our table was ready. Very easy. I am gluten and dairy free and our waiter (maximiella) was awesome about knowing the food. We got a ton and everything was great. And everyone was happy. And for a super busy place, it wasn't as loud as I was expecting. And the service was actually very fast and really great.
