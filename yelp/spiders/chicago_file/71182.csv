Little Goat Diner////My husband and I dined here during a weekend away to celebrate our anniversary and my birthday. We couldn't get into Girl and the Goat, so we were happy to secure reservations at the next best thing. It was loud, it was fun, it was great! It is not romantic or quiet. The food is heavy, although I was pleased with the Goat'o Goat'o salad. We had a blast, but I do think it's better suited for lunch or brunch. Great location, though, and excellent service.
