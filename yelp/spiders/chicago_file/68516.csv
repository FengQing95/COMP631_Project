Little Goat Diner////We ordered the Los Drowned, which was a good sandwich. Not terribly exciting or inventive but enjoyable. The Bulls eye french toast with fired chicken sounded awesome but our eggs were pretty undercooked and the ratio of chicken was a bit lacking. I'm not talking runny eggs either, because I like that. I was uncooked whites that got our attention. On a whim, we tried the mac and cheese and that ended up being our favorite. Really good white mac and cheese with some stink to it. Liked it a lot.
