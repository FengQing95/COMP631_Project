Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////High "pizza craftsmanship". In fact, best pizza I've ever had (sorry New York). Fresh tomato and mozzarella, perfectly seasoned lean sausage make a LOT of difference. Dough has a bit of white wine taste. It is crispy fresh out of the oven and stays crispy till the last piece. I personally like the sausage better than classic. Also if you want to try the soup and don't, you should regret. Wait at this restaurant is insane. Do whatever you can to beat the crowd. But food is worth the wait (normally 30+ minutes). Warm home feeling service.
