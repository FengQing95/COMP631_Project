Smoque BBQ////My friend and I walked in right before the lunch hour mayhem so, we were able to order and sit down immediately.  My go-to is pulled pork and theirs was pretty dry.  The bun/bread the pulled pork was served on wasn't complimentary either.  And their BBQ sauce, aside from being extremely runny, tasted off.
