Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We started with a pitcher of red sangria, which was delicious and a really good deal. You get nearly 4 glasses each out of that and for a good price. Normally gluten free bread is not the greatest and it really makes me miss regular bread, this was actually pretty good! Especially with the olive oil they provide on the table.
