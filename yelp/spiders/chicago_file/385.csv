Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I would rate them OK, not great. The hype is more than reality. Our meal was not bad but not superior either. I tried their signature Wildberry pancakes and found they "looked" far better than they tasted. Too sweet, too berry, not enough pancake taste. Worth trying once. I'll try another restaurant next time.
