Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Back to the pizza: SOOOO yum!! the crust was crispy, Â cheese was enough to be delicious, but not overpowering and not too much. the italian sausage!! the seriously, lined the entire pie with the italian sausage. as you can see from my picture, the entire pie is lined with a sheet of sausage so that you get a heavy dose of sausage in every bite. that was different from giordano's, whose pizza my friends and I exclaimed "wait..wheres the sausage!!?". The saltiness of the pepperoni was perfectly balanced against the juiciness of the fresh tomatoes that filled the top of the pie. When we opened the pie, it was juicy due to the fresh tomatoes, so be careful if you're taking it long distances. (Quick tip: we took it to the portillo's a few blocks away and ate it before we ate their hot dogs and italian beef sandwiches. Sorry portillo's, :P, we know we broke your rules, but 3 hungry girls in a big city CANNOT be expected to wait until we get to our hotel room before we dive into the food :P)
