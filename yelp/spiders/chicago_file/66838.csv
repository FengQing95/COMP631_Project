Little Goat Diner////If you are hungry and truly want to enjoy a unique breakfast experience - you will not go wrong with this venue.  Traveling from Southern CA and on a quest to try all of Chicago's best diners, i ordered the corn beef hash - truly superb!  The only thing better was Morgan, who made the suggestion and served it with perfection.
