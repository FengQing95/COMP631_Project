Smoque BBQ////Great Brisket(shaved/sliced) Great fries, cornbread, mac/cheese, slaw, BBQ sauce. Ribs were very good, and the reason I didn't give it 5 Stars. My issue with them was they were a little inconsistent. Half of my 1/2 slab was great, half was good. If they all tasted like the great 1/2, it would've been 5 Stars!
