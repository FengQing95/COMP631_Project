Little Goat Diner////I've been here a handful of times in the past and it has always been a solid selection. The food is excellent and unique for sure. I wish there was a little bit more for how much the dish cost. This time around, I got the Little Piggy went to China dish and that was a kick of a flavor in every bite. I wish there was some potatoes or something that accompanied it to offset how powerful the taste was. I just stole some of my husband's smoked french fries. :) Others ordered the Bulleye's French toast, cheeseburger, and a cinnamon bun. Everyone was satisfied and was definitely a hit with all around the table.
