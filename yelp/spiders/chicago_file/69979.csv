Little Goat Diner////As for the food -- I got the hash. Don't bother, it is mostly extremely greasy meat. Very little potato! And aside from salt, there was very little flavor. My husband liked his dish -- the Asian breakfast thing, but if I had ordered it I would not have bee able to eat it, there was so much salt.
