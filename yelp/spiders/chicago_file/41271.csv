Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Thursday afternoon I  had tapas here.  The atmosphere is nice enough. The staff was friendly and attentive. The three flavors of sangria were good, kind of like kool-aid... even the pitchers were reminiscent of the Kool-aid man. The bread tray they kept replenishing was too dry or stale or something. Seriously, the bread might have been better suited for soaking up spilled sangria. Of course I was tossing piece after piece of the less-than-fresh bread in my mouth despite this fact. Oh and you know I wasn't spilling any alcohol. Some of the dishes were better than others. The beef skewer was probably the most flavorful of everything I had. The desserts were good, I recommend their mini dessert banana(s foster) or possibly the amaretto/almond sorbet..
