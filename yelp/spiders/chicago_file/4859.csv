The Purple Pig////We got the cured meat pig-platter for $34 and split it. It was cute and came on a pig shaped platter. The platter came with 7 different types of meats as well as some crackers and pickled cucumbers in a gooey mustard seed sauce. I wasn't my cup of tea. The platter had ham√≥n, prosciutto, Spanish chorizo, 2 more pepperoni looking things, and one bologna looking thing with pistachio in it. My personal favorites were the ham and Spanish chorizo. I'm honestly not sure of the names of everything, but everything on the platter was chosen by the chef and they were good. This place is pretty intimate despite it being crowded. There is some outdoor seating if you're into that.
