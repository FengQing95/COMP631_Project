The Purple Pig////The octopus was perfectly cooked with a soft texture on the inside and slight char on the outside. It was served with green beans tossed in a pesto sauce. The pork shoulder was amazing! The pork was incredibly soft and tender and just fell apart as we ate it. It was served on top of the creamiest mashed potatoes!
