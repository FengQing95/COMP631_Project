Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My expectations were met! The deep dish pizza  was amazing!  I was also carded for beer and I'm in my 40's. Too funny.  Mind you, its only beer and wine so enjoy some cold beer and expect to be plugged as the portions are extreme.  This place is 90% tourists so you don't have to worry about fitting in.  The average wait is tolerable because you pre order the pizza and by the time you are seated, its ready. A must do!
