Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Just went back here and still think its a great place - albeit expensive for some of the tapas. (I've heard that the Happy Hour lunch prices are a super deal.... look into this).  The sangria is well worth the trip alone!  I think this is gonna be my new fav spot to meet people for dessert too.  Try out the caramel banana dessert - toasted caramel over a banana with icecream on the side. So yummy!
