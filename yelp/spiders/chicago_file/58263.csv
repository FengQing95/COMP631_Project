Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is our go-to place to take people whenever we have guests staying over in Chicago. The food is good and we always have a good time. The seafood paella is on point and the sangria is awesome. They do breakfast on weekends too and the portions are pretty big for the breakfast plates! Service is generally really good. I recommend making reservations ahead of time because they get really busy.
