Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Can I give you a big hug, Lou?  Pizza is soo mouth-watering, especially with the mushroom/spinach toppings and the butter crust.  Their antipasto salad is also phenomenal and the bruschetta is quite yummy.  And don't forget about the dessert pizza.  That's delectable as well!  Be prepared to wait long on the weekends.  I'm used to it so I try not to let it bother me when I'm inhaling the delicious smell of melted cheese...mmm.  Once in awhile when you're waiting, they give you free samples...probably a pizza that a customer didn't pick up but hey, I'm not complaining!
