Art Institute of Chicago////Pro-tip: purchase admission tickets ($25 for out-of-towners) online in advance. I'd estimate there were 400 people waiting in the cold just to buy tickets. You may have an additional wait if you visit the exhibit (an extra $5) based on the time/day, but also buy tickets in advance for that, otherwise, you'll have to wait in the admission line to get those, too.
