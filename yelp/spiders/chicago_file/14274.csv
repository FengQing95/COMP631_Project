Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I visited Chicago for the first time ever this weekend and had to try Lou's.  I saw him on a travel show once and not only did he seem like such a nice guy, the pizza made my mouth water.  Thankfully, the real pizza was fantastic.  Just enough sauce, lots of cheese and a crispy, not doughy crust.  I ordered a personal sausage pizza and it was enough food, for sure.
