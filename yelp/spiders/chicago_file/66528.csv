Little Goat Diner////For service, our waitress was great - very helpful (she recommended the fish tostadas) and sweet (she made her own concoction of honey mustard because they didn't make/have it).  Glasses were always filled and the food wait was pretty good.  The ambiance was casual and inviting.  I like the open-air feel with the skylight windows and ceilings.
