Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our group of 4 had a reservation on Sunday morning for brunch, and we were seated right on time. My husband and I love brunch and have tried many of the Chicago favorites, but this is our new favorite! There are so many options to choose from, and the tapas style brunch is wonderful for those who are wanting to try a little bit of everything. Everyone in our group was thrilled with our selections. We ordered slightly too much food, but I would recommend 7-8 dishes for a group of 4. The Nutella and banana waffles were my favorite item that we tried.
