Smoque BBQ////Haven't had their fries or ribs, but... some tasty items on this menu. The pulled pork and cornbread are pretty good, the mac and cheese is really great, and the sliced (yes, sliced is always better and more tender in my book) brisket is YUMMY. Most places do not do brisket well, but for some reason, these guys have a handle on it. It's truly a disappointment ordering brisket at most BBQ joints after having had it at Smoque. Not kidding. Nice staff, too!
