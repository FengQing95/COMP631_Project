The Purple Pig////This is a modern, happening tapas (small plates) restaurant with a bar, covered patio, and open kitchen. The restaurant isn't huge, but it's not tiny either. It's popular - at the time of writing this review, it's already got 4,581 reviews (!) - and it was packed during our Sunday afternoon visit around 1pm. They *do not* take reservations. It's first come, first served. We were lucky and were seated immediately at one of the communal high-tops near the kitchen.
