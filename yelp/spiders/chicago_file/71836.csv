Little Goat Diner////Was really impressed.  I'd love to go to the Girl and the Goat next time I'm in Chicago, but it's little diner sister in the form of Little Goat did not disappoint.  If I lived within walking distance I'd legitimately try to eat breakfast here as often as possible.  Top notch stuff.
