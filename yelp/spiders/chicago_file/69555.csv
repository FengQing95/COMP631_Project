Little Goat Diner////There was no charge for the space, we just met a food and beverage minimum.  The food pricing was extremely reasonable for the caliber of food you're getting, and  the space holds about 70 people for passed hors d'oeuvres.  We also had several stationary dishes, but it wasn't a seated service.
