Little Goat Diner////I was so excited to come here. The food wasn't *bad* but it wasn't anything special. I had a club (have had better many other places) -- the meat wasn't distributed evenly on the sandwich, and it was falling apart. It was also salty (theme!) I got a side of sprouts, which were also VERY salty. Fianc√© got nachos. The goat chili was all on one side and it also was salty. The place was busy and very cute. I think they need to cut back on the salt and focus on making sure the plates are nice and consistent. The expediter used the same towel to wipe the plates the entire time. I know because we sat at the counter. I got an up-close view of that towel when he dropped my food off. It needed a good soak. In bleach.
