Little Goat Diner////Little Goat has been on my list to try since moving to Chicago. I was expecting to be wow'ed and I just wasn't as impressed as I thought or hoped I would be! When you walk in, it's definitely a diner feel, but a bit nicer. We had 9pm reservations, but they didn't have any tables ready, so we headed to the back where the bakery/bar/coffee bar were located to grab a drink. Â  The bartender was a bit snotty in my opinion - corrected me twice in the name of the drink... I ordered the "1.21 Gigawatts" and apparently it's really important to him that you include the numbers when ordering. Either way, I thought the drink was OK - kind of on the overly sweet side. We were seating about 15-20 mins later at a booth. One person in our group brought some wine bottles - there's a 25 dollar corking fee and our waitress was awesome and only charged it once for two bottles - super nice. I ordered the patty melt with the veggie burger and it was tasty, just greasy and it wasn't anything super special. We also got onion rings and fried pickles for the table - when I picked one up, it was literally dripping in oil - not that appetizing for me. Overall, I wasn't really impressed and likely won't be back any time soon.
