Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Walked in to find a bustling restaurant, I was slightly disappointed thinking we'd have to wait for a table, but the lovely hostess quickly glanced around the corner to spot an open two top and sat us immediately. I was happy to see that you could order personal sized pizza's, as my bf and I have polar opposite taste in what toppings we like. We put in our order and enjoyed some starter salads in the meantime. Unfortunately the pizza's took much longer to make it to us than we had originally been informed. We weren't going to say anything, and in the end didn't have to. The manager came out on his own with our waitress to apologize for the delay and let us know that dessert was on the house. Yum! Free fresh baked chocolate chip cookie/ice cream for us!
