Little Goat Diner////Crisp Shrimp cocktail, Sloppy Goat and the Hot Crab Dip are my favorites here. The service has usually been good, and I've never had to actually wait to be seated even on Thursday and Friday evenings. If anything, go by the 'bar' or the communal table. The quality of food is, naturally, still the same!
