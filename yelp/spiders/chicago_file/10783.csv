Art Institute of Chicago////One of the grandest paintings in the welcome hall is "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte". I remember the Paris Street on a Rainy Day is normally in its place but it is on loan to a museum in Dallas at the moment. There is a great Impressionism collection with works by Van Gogh and Monet. There are European masterpieces from Dali and El Greco and the Dutch masters. Nighthawks and American Gothic also hang in the Chicago Art Institute. Â In the lower level you will find a photography collections and also the famous Thorne miniatures. The miniatures remind me of doll houses depicting the homes and architecture of Revolutionary and 19th century living. You can truly spend an entire day here in this museum and I would rank it among one of the best in the world.
