Little Goat Diner////Hot crab dip - It didn't taste bad but it didn't taste that amazing either.  It reminded me of what my parents would serve at a party when the Bears went to the SuperBowl in 1986.  The take-away point here is that it is old school and not inventive at all. Furthermore, it was served with Ritz crackers.  I'm not hating on Ritz but seriously, you couldn't have come up with a more inventive cracker than a freaking Ritz?
