Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was good, and the Sangria's were better. However, leaving the place, it left for something to be desired. We tried the beef empanadas, and a few other dishes as well, but that was it. As I walked out, I felt an unsatisfying full. The Sangria's are a definite must though!
