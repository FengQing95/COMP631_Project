Little Goat Diner////Went to this dinner once and cant wait to come back again。Both visits were phenomenal. Ordered this little piggy went to China both times.. it's that good. The flavor combo is out of the world..  Their hashbrowns were so cheesy so crunchy its unbelievable.  The best I've ever had!  Pork belly home fries was a hit too. Cinnamon roll was big, fluffy heavenly ! the only thing I didn't care too much is the bull eyes French toast.. the egg inside is sort of odd. But overall hands down my current fav brunch place. Love love love
