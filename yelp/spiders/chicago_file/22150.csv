Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When I knew I was going to visit Chicago, the only thing I really wanted to do was get good deep dish pizza. I was Lou Malnati's was the place to go, so we went on my first night there. We got two orders of pizza, cheese and pepperoni. Both tasted like magic and happiness. I liked both a lot, but I have to say the pepperoni was better since I like my pizza with more than cheese. The crust was also buttery which made it all the better.
