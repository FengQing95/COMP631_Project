Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's makes a mean deep dish. We split a personal pan and it made a good light meal. The crust from Lou's is reasonably thick, with a great zesty sauce and delicious fixings. We tried 2 of Chicago's many famous pizza joints so I can only compare between those. In the end, my girl enjoys Lou's for the sauce and sausage and I like Uno's because I enjoy the thick flavorful crust. You decide but you can't go wrong at Lou's.
