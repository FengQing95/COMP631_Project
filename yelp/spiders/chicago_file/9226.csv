Art Institute of Chicago////I heard good things about the Art Institute so I wanted to check it out while I'm in town. This museum is HUGE. There's about 4 buildings each with 3 floors filled with exhibits! What I really liked about it is that there are so many exhibits/wings of different eras and styles- which caters to everyone's interests. It's a big place to walk around so I recommend wearing comfy shoes and taking breaks every so often.
