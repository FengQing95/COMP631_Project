Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went on a Sat night. We had reservations very late so we decided to sit by the bar area. The service is spectacular, our waitress was fabulous! The food was just out of this world. We started with cheese plate, grilled octopus, meat plate and a whole order of Blood Sausage. All was so perfectly cooked and displayed!!!! ah loved every bite of it. Then we ordered a seafood Paella, it was so flavorful and delicious! I had many great Paellas in my life, spoiled growing up by the mediterranean sea. But this one is the best you can get away from any coastal area!!!! The best part was it was all priced so well....Don't forget to order a pitcher of red sangria! it was amazing!
