The Purple Pig////You had me at hello--beets, goat cheese and pistachios are favs of mine, so I definitely enjoyed the salt roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter.  The beets were tender, and the tangy creaminess from the goat cheese paired with the nuttiness of the pistachios was great.
