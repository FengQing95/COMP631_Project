Smoque BBQ////Ohh get here early on Saturday and beat the line which can and does go down the block! If your picking up, call ahead...shorter line for pick up. The food, BBQ, is outstanding! The brisket here is just awesome and sometimes there's a brisket chili which just rocks. The pull pork is so good, you'll feel that they didn't give you enough and you'll want more. The ribs are good, but they're smoked, most people are use to local restaurant ribs that are baked or boiled drowning in sauce...not here. Two styles of ribs, both very good. The side are tasty ...I really dig the Mac n cheese and peach cobbler thing a am jig. The place is small, but the staff I'd awesome and will help everyone get a seat, clean place to eat, and napkins. Weekends I drive down a block and park in front of the school, free and plenty of parking...walk the block and you are in BBQ paradise.
