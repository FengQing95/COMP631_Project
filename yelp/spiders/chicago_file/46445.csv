Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A few things kept me from feeling the love. First, it was really, really loud so conversation was difficult. Second, the floor was so super slippery that I almost fell twice just walking to our table--no sexy swagger for me. Heels and a slick floor=bad news. I mentioned this to the hostess who said, "Yes, the floor here really is slippery. It gets worse as the night goes on." Ew. What does that mean? I don't want to know what makes the floor slippery over the course of an evening--especially right before I am about to eat there. Third, the sangria was nothing to cheer about.
