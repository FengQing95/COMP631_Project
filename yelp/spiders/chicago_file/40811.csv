Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Two stars is defined as "Meh. I've experienced better" and I have.  I can accept a decent meal at most any restaurant I'm trying for the first time, but I get bitter and a little depressed when I have a two star experience a a restaurant that is highly recommended.  My peeps from Michigan (the state, not the avenue) even touted this place, not to mention my local Chicago friends...even the doorman at Hotel Affinia was excited to hear about our experience when we came back from dinner.  We tried a lot of the tapas, which were good - 3 stars here.  The paella was 3.5 stars.  The ambiance was 2.5 stars, as soon as you walk in the long narrow hallway to the host's desk may makes it fell like a pizza joint.  It was loud and laid out strangely, you have to weave your way around many tables to get anywhere.  The service was poor - 1.5 star.  The server had too many tables, knew nothing about the wine selection.  The fella that came over to talk about wine told us about this great bottle he had, so we ordered it only to find out that he was out of it.  Chit, that sucks!  I've had much better tapas many places, one that comes to mind is Meritage in Charleston, SC (I think it reopened the fall of 2008).
