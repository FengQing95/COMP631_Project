Art Institute of Chicago////This is a can't miss attraction if you are in Chicago and are an art lover. I was lucky enough to be there for the Lichtenstein exhibit, and it was phenomenal. I was actually not really a fan until I saw the collection which was beatifully and thoughtfully put together. I was equally amazed at the permanent collection. The Impressionist collection is very large with a lot of Monet, Manet, Van Gogh, Lautrec etc. This is one of my favorite museums.
