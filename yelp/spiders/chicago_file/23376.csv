Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ordered classic cheese pizza with extra sauce. Was literally raw and doughy. Nothing but the bottom was cooked. Think the consistency of a dumpling. Sauce was just ok and had potential to be better - I've made better tomato sauce and I'm a 21 year old who cooks for fun in my spare time.
