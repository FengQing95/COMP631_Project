The Purple Pig////@thepigchicago has been acting shady from the start of the pandemic, when they promised a #gofundmecampaign for staff and instead made a store item on their website for "staff donations" with zero transparency regarding how much money was collected, then FIRED an employee when she called them out on it publicly.
