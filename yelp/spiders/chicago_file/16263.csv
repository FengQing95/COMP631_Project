Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Malnati Salad: It was surprisingly a really good salad! Comes with romaine lettuce, diced tomatoes, black olives, sliced mushrooms, salami and gorgonzola cheese. I usually drench my salads in dressing but they don't do that here. They had just the right amount of dressing. It says that the smaller one serves 1-2 people but it could easily have served 3-4.
