Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chicago classic was excellent! Small portion was perfect for 2 people (enough for leftovers). The garlic bread with marinara sauce was delicious and I also enjoyed the fried mushroom appetizer. Service was fantastic! The wait was about 30 minutes on a weekday night around 6, not bad at all!
