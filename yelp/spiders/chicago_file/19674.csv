Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great lunch special for 10.50 you get a soup or salad (small) to start. Then a personal 6 inch deep dish regular, sausage, pepperoni plus a drink with refills. Great deal. It's deep dish chicago pizza and definitely different from NYC pizza I am used to. The pepperoni was my favorite moreso than the sausage, but that's personal preference. Typically needs a knife and fork to eat. Nice crust. Crispy and not soft or soggy. Just the right amount of food for a nice lunch to put you into a food coma. Even ice tea was included in the lunch special for a drink.
