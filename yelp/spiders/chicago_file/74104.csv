Little Goat Diner////Very good, makes me want to try the chefs other restaurants. Had the pancake wrapped goat meat hot dog. Was really tasty. Bloody Mary was spicy, kinda garlicky, it's "kimchee" spiced but doesn't have that fermented taste really. Definitely worth a try and a revisit to try what you didn't get the first time.
