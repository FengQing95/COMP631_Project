Little Goat Diner////This place was excellent!  Casual, lower costs mixed with unique dishes.  My brother had a Bahn Mi burger, and I had a braised beef style sandwich with excellent toppings.  The apps are also great... Fried pickles and onions are highly recommended due to their perfect clean batter and nice big slices.  Good selection of drinks as well, and bar in the back if you don't want to wait to be seated. Situated close to other attractions in the area.
