Art Institute of Chicago////I went to this museum expecting a lot from the reviews and I was more than disappointed. I hated the layout of the museum. It is actually really confusing even when you use a map. I think the map was even difficult to read. I've been to a lot of museums all over the country, but this one has been the most difficult to maneuver through. Don't come here if you have children because they will be bored.
