Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza...deep dish and greasy, of course...but the cheese and sausage...the small is 9 inch, i swear they put a 9 inch thick cheese slice and a 9 inch sausage patty on the dough and baked it. Â I know because when I dropped the pizza on my clothes, the dough, cheese and sausage fell into 3 individual pieces.
