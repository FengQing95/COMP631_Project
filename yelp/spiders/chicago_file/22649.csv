Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Fast forward to 2015, we planned to visit Chicago again, thus made it my life mission to try their pizza. Unfortunately there's no Jay Z posters in sight but the pizza was so damn good. It was worth the pizza blue balls for 5 years. We had the Chicago classic with pepperoni as a deep dish and the thin crust with pepperoni and giardinera. (Omg totally in love with giardinera but that's another story) wow, both pizzas deep and thin were the best pizzas I've ever had. I mentally scanned through all the pizza I've eaten from my home town Houston, TX to my travels to Las Vegas, New York, LA. Nothing compares to the pizza foodgasm of Lou's.
