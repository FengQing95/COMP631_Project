Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I hate to give this place a bad review, because the service was great. The sangria was amazing and some of the food was delicious. Now why the bad review. Well first they seated us on a table outside and it smelled like garbage. They server kindly moved us as he can smell it as well. Next my wife ordered the spanish omelette and when she cut into it there was a plastic bag in it. While they did not change us for the replacement omelette. Still it is pretty bad to have plastic in the food.
