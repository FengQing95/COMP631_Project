Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////In the world of Chicago style pizza, Lou Malnati's has to rank among the top of my favorites. Though I'm not typically a fan of the deep dish pizza, when in Chicago, I must have a slice or two of this style. The crust was flaky and crunchy and served as a feature to the pie.
