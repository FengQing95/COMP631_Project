Smoque BBQ////My boyfriend's meal was the opposite-- his sides were pretty out of the park (baked beans and corn bread), but his sliced brisket was just on the good-side-of-average. I was too full for an order of peach cobbler, but as I do consider peach cobbler to be my true love of the dessert world, you can be sure I'll be back for more.
