The Purple Pig////I've been here both times I've visited Chicago and I've enjoyed my experience both times. The grilled octopus with green beans and fingerling potatoes was my favorite! The octopus was tender, seasoned well and beans were seasoned and charred perfectly. The cauliflower was sliced thin and charred to perfection as well, served with thin sliced baby dill pickles and fresh parsley. The beets were my friend's favorite, seasoned perfectly with goat cheese mousse and micro greens! The roasted pumpkin seeds were a nice finishing touch on the not so sweet (the way I like it) Butternut squash soup. I've had the bone marrow served with buttered toasted sourdough as an appetizer in the past, and it was very good. Service is fast and efficient...great lunch spot!
