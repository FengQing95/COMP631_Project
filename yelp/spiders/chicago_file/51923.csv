Smoque BBQ////Ribs and meats are good. I prefer real urban barbecue to the place but the place is much closer to me. Lines gets busy at times however once you order the wait for a table has not been that bad since the staff is paying attention to waiting folks and directing people traffic. I kind of feel pressured to leave when here but they are busy and trying to accommodate standing customers. Food is ok but not the best. I usually have food that is not as warm as I expect r get from other places. Check your orders as I have had the wrong kind of ribs more then a few times. real urban barbecue is still my prefers overall choice. Btw: no parking and parking near by is horrible.
