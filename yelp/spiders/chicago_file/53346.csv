Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Honestly don't understand the hype after multiple visits. Their tapas are ok, some better than others, but expensive and with bad service. First of all, the last time I was here, it too 2 hours to get our food (and it was not the right order even after they tried to get it). Management was nice enough to cover the missing dishes, but every time I come, it's slow. It's very loud and dark in the place, you have to scream at each other. The drinks are average and there's not a lot of them. The tapas... Some, like the baked goat cheese, are amazing and worth the wait. Others, like some of the iberico pork dishes or their empenadas, are overpriced and meh tasting. There are better and cheaper places for tapas, with better service and where you don't need to make reservations a week in advance.
