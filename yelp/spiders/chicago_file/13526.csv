Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There must be some reoccurring theme at Lou Malnati's where there's some requirement that you have to wait at least an hour to be seated or longer.  Our party of 15 didn't get seated until an hour and a half later since they don't take reservations.  I think this is the way that they get you to order appetizers or drinks before you sit down and order the pizza.  We hung out at the bar for a little bit where Chuck kept us happy with our drinks.  I had a house salad here that was a very nice size that I split it with a friend.  We also had the sampler platter with the fried mozarella sticks, zuccini slices, cheeseballs and mushrooms.  We had 2 deluxe and 1 pepperoni pizza here and it was really delicious.  It was almost enough for all of us since not all of us had 2 slices, but it made for only a $6 meal for each person.  The staff here was pretty friendly.  They also have an upstairs, but they still manage to pack the place.
