Little Goat Diner////We got served pretty quickly and the restaurant was really cute. The food was delicious with Asian fushion in the dishes. This little piggy went to China has szechuan pork sausage. And, if you haven't had it before, it's a very particular spice that changes how your taste buds will taste other foods. I really like it, but it can be a little surprising if you haven't had it before. The breakfast tasty thing had these HUGE slices of bacon. I typically don't care whether a dish has bacon (crazy, I know), but the bacon thick slices were super tasty.
