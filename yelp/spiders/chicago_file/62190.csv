Smoque BBQ////Excellent ribs. I generally get both styles and don't know which I like more. If forced to choose I'd say the St Louis style is top rib in this place. I've never been here when there wasn't a crowd. One of my two favorite rib joints in town. Sides are all winners, too. Hard to not order everything.
