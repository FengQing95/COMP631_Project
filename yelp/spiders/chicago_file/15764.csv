Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Food was great! But,,, I asked for the cold air to be turned off/made warmer 3 times now and it's still not changed! Myself and a few other tables have mentioned it's cold! Waitress says the manager has to change it? Wouldn't be back, as it has spoiled the meal, pizzas got cold so quick!
