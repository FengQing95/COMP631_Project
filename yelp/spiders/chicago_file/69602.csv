Little Goat Diner////I somehow ended up visiting Little Goat twice in the past week. The first time was for a late-night bite after a cocktail party across the street. I went incredibly hungry and was eager to try their burger. I'm a huge fan of patty melts, but was disappointed that their's was served with American cheese (rather than Swiss). No problem, I thought, I'll just ask for a cheese substitution. Bummed out when I learned they didn't even have Swiss cheese, but I ordered it anyway with a "mild white cheese" (as described by the server). I was told they normally cook their burgers medium and figured it would be a thin griddle style burger, in keeping with their diner style, so I said that was fine. The burger was actually thicker than expected and quite a few notches past medium. Sad that the sandwich didn't come with a pickle or coleslaw or anything...
