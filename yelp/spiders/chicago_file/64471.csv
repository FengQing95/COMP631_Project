Smoque BBQ////The meat is so freakin' tender that when you try to pick it up with your fork, it falls apart! So good. Portion size is reasonable for the amount that you pay and every meal automatically comes with coleslaw. Fast service, clean, and you can sample food! Great first meal in Chicago!!!!
