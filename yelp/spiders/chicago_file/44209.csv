Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I visited this restaurant based on a recommendation of a friend who joined me. I am visiting the Chicago area and wanted to do a tapas type meal. The tapas were pretty much hit or miss... The tenderloin with blue cheese is a must have! Desserts were the best part (especially the bread pudding). Service was cordial and prompt. Atmosphere was alright- we were sat in the back room. Overall, I would probably return, but there wasn't anything that I feel I need to go rushing back for. As a side note, my friend admitted the food was definitely better in previous trips.
