Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Loved the food! I came here with three people and we ordered eight tapa dishes and all of the 6 pintxos. My faves of the night were the grilled octopus, the seared scallops, fried green peppers (so surprisingly good), and the grilled hanger steak.  In terms of portion, I'd say I was satisfied after the first five dishes+pintxos (which were bite-sized and not particularly shareable), but my party chose to order more. Everything we had were delicious and we finished every bite. At the end of our meal, the manager (?) came by and presented us with four free desserts because "it was our first time here." What a pleasant & sweet surprise!  All of the desserts were delicious, but my fave was the butterscotch pudding shooters.
