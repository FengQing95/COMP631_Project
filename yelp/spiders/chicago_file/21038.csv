Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I guess this means I'm officially a New York pizza guy. Lou Malnati's was right by our hotel and seems to be one of the places to get good Chicago deep dish pizza. We went for lunch on a weekday, and it wasn't very busy. There was no hostess, so we had to ask the bartender if we had to seat ourselves--he said no, there should be a hostess. Finally she came out and immediately seated us. She was actually very nice.
