The Purple Pig////We got the Seafood Saganaki this time for the second item. Ask for more toast cause the sauce is great and theres never enough to go with it all. Seafood wasn't overcooked and thr flat leaf pasley was a nice flavor in the background (unless you don't like pasley. In that case you can get away from the taste if you don't eat the physical pieces).
