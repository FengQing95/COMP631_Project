Art Institute of Chicago////We decided to check this museum out since it was free for military.  The lady gave me a hard time since my husband wasn't with us and insisted it was not free without him.  I asked her if she could go on her computer and look up the information and she said she was not able to--really?.  A manager had to be called and he quickly got us in for free.
