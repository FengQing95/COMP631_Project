Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza cooked wonderfully with cheesy mozzarella and a golden buttery crust. Â My favorite part/ingredient is probably their tomato sauce: it had chunks of tomato in it!! Unlike any other Chicago-style pizzas I've had in California (Zachary's in Berkeley and Lefty's in San Diego), LM's pizzas are simple yet delicious. They're not so salty that you're gulping water every few bites, and not stuffed with other filler ingredients; you can taste all of the components of their pizza.
