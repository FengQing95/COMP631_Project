Smoque BBQ////Over the years it's become apparent to me that there are two kinds of BBQ ribs in Chicago - Southside ribs and Northside ribs.  You could also say that there are juicy, perfectly smoked, saucy, meaty, succulent, GOOD ribs (Southside) and ribs that make me weep that a pig was slaughtered for nothing (Northside).  But I keep hanging onto the dream that somewhere on the Northside is some miraculous place that actually knows something about seasoning, smoking and saucing ribs.  So when I hear rave reviews about a BBQ rib restaurant on the Northside, I eventually cross my fingers, dive in and try it out.
