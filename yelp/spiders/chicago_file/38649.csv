Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Right when I walked into this restaurant, I knew it was going to be something very special. The ambiance was perfect and I loved the dim lighting. Our service was amazing and the server was very knowledgable about the menu and all its ingredients. I was here with my brother and dad so we were interested in sharing a few items and trying them all as the server suggested.
