The Purple Pig////My bf and I ordered the crispy pig ears, bone marrow, and octopus. The crispy pig ears were my favorite. They were super crispy, mixed with crispy kale and an egg on top. The pickled peppers added a great kick to the dish. The octopus was my second favorite. It was tender and not chewy at all. The salsa verde was a great sauce with it as well as the fingerling potatoes. The bone marrow came with some grilled bread, and was just okay to me. For dessert, we got the sicilian iris, which was recommended by our server. It's like a big donut stuffed with chocolate and ricotta.
