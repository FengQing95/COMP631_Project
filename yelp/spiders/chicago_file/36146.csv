Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Why hello there, new-favorite steakhouse in Chicago. Disclaimer: I am not a huge fan of steak, and I usually find traditional steakhouses to be, *yawn*, dull places with unremarkable food that attract old men in suits. BUT... Bavette's won me over with its Â mouth-watering food and totally sexy, retro-chic decor, completely shattering my steakhouse bias.
