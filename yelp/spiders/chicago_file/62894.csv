Smoque BBQ////It was busy as usual and the line wrapped around the building and everyone was told about an hour wait. An elderly couple both with canes decided to enjoy the food and proceeded to join the line. Well one of the staff radioed in and one of the owners came out and sat the couple down right away. He also gave them menus, took their order, and served them their food and drinks.
