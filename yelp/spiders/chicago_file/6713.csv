The Purple Pig////Perfect menu and items to share with a large group and each entree was a hit! The main winners were definitely the bone marrow, tuna tartare, octopus, and ricotta gnocchi. Out of all the items I would say that I could probably pass on the berkshire shoulder next time since it wasn't the most unique of the items we ordered. Don't get me wrong it's still super tasty and a great option to get if you're craving meat/mash.
