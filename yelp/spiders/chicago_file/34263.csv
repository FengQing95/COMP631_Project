Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Now for the good stuff! For drinks we got the punch and bf got this sumpin sumpin beer. Both good and strong! For food we skipped appetizer and probably should have skipped bread too but I ordered the petite filet prepared like the traditional (I don't like tomato) medium rare and he got the short rib stroganoff. Both were delicious but I won win the better meal. The meat was cooked to perfection and the sauce was divine. We shared elotes which I didn't love because I compared it to real street corn in Logan Sq but he liked it a lot. We couldn't even finish our food completely but had to get something sweet. None of the options looked knock your socks off good but our waitress recommended the dark chocolate pie. My bf doesn't care for dark chocolate but the Oreo crust definitely hides the bitterness. They brought it out with a candle and it was really tasty. The whip cream on top is a bit overwhelming but complimented it well. Overall great dinner from the service to my delicious filet. I can't wait to come back and try the goat cheese app and ribeye!!
