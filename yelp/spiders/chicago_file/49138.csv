Smoque BBQ////First: the sides.  We personally enjoyed the mac n cheese and peach cobbler very much however the BBQ beans and brisket chili weren't quite up to our standards.  The BBQ beans had too bold of a flavor in that they were too sweet and too sour.  It was quite hard eating them alone however perhaps if eaten with cornbread, it possibly wouldn't have been as bad.  The brisket chili was really just average, can't say much else about it.
