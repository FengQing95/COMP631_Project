Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas is an awesome option for date night as you get to share everything! When we arrived we were very happy with the atmosphere for dinner. It was dark and romantic in there, still casual that we felt right at home. We were taken back to one of the many dinning room areas and had a corner table (perfect for people watching). We started out with the croquette! So yummy we hadn't had croquettes since we lived in LA and I think we may have found our new spot for them. Out of the 6 tapas we tried what we decided were must haves were: the croquette, patatas bravas, and the empanada. We realized after we had ordered that we had some regret not going ahead and ordering a Paella as well. The tables around us had some and they looked delicious! Just keep in mind it takes 40 minutes to make! The only downside for us in particular was we were a little cold and needed our jackets for the meal. Otherwise the service was great, the food was great, and we will be coming back for a Paella very soon,
