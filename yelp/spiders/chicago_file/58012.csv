Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The restaurant has an area that is dimly lit and intimate, but also a room with open windows, and a frosted glass roof that allows in a beautiful amount of natural sunlight. We were originally seated in the dark, but our initial waiter was gracious enough to move us over to the brighter area.
