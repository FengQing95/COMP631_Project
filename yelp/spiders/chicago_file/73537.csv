Little Goat Diner////Little Goat is the sister restaurant to Girl & The Goat, which is located right across the street. It's a fun environment with a modern clean look. It's what all diners should look like. Meagan was our server and she was phenomenal - she was engaging, funny, and attentive. Plus, she's from the Bay Area!  My family and I ordered the pork belly and chive pancake, the nachos, the burrito, and the tempura mash. Note before proceeding - portion sizes are huge here!  I am a big guy and normally I can polish off a plate, but these portions were even a lot for me.  All the food was delicious and well balanced, if not on the heavy side. Majority of the dishes had an accompaniment of a pickled slaw or onion, which was a welcome element to help cut the fattiness of the other ingredients. My family and I enjoyed our meal here and the next time I am in Chicago I want to try GATG across the way.
