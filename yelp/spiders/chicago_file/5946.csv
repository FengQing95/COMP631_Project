The Purple Pig////They offered various categories of food including seafood, meet and vegetables, tapas style. The presentation of the dishes were nice and I enjoyed everything we ordered. However, all of the vegetarian dishes we ordered were desserty and too sweet for my taste. More focus on the flavors of the veggies themselves were definitely preferred or maybe recategorizing some of them as desserts?
