Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place was pretty packed, even at 9:30 when we got there for dinner. We sat in the dining room and took advantage of the banquette seating (see below). Wine selection was pretty good. We enjoyed a few bottles of Pinot Noir over our small plates. Overall, a great meal. And not too expensive for the quality of food.
