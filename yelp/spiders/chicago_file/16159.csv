Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were seated promptly, and then helped by three different people. It was kind of amusing. One of the servers explained it was because they were in the middle of shift change, so he wanted to make sure we weren't missed. We appreciated this - instead of standing back and waiting until tables were assigned and turned over, several servers saw our table with no food or drinks in front of us and went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of, even though it wasn't necessarily their table. We noticed, and we appreciated it.
