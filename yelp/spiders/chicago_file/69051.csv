Little Goat Diner////Took me a full two years as a Chicago resident to go here (after numerous friends raving about it) and it did NOT disappoint. Went for a business brunch and the atmosphere was awesome (even at 11 am on a weekday). Split the "Fat Elvis" waffles and the Parathas Burrito with a friend (best of both worlds) and they were both PHENOMENAL. My sister got a veggie burger and loved it. Â Service was warm and attentive but not over the top. I will definitely be back!
