Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is a great place to visit! There is a lot to see,and the place is insanely huge. I recommend it to foreigners all the time, and for the people of Chicago who haven't been there yet,you should go. They even have free entrance for residents of Chicago some days. Everyone there is very kind and are very helpful when you have questions!
