Art Institute of Chicago////Just gonna throw this out there, you house one of the most valuable collections of art out there. Dat Seurat? Amazing. But give residents a free day or a steeper discount. This city needs you, don't make the plebes pay through the nose...come on. The Met will forever be far superior to you for this reason.
