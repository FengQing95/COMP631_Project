Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Amazing food and service! You will not regret! The ambiance is so cozy and romantic perfect for a special night! I began with the wedge salad (small) and while i enjoyed the salad as a whole the star was without a doubt the thick cut bacon. Next came my bone-in filet which melted in my mouth and my side was the whipped potatoes so good!! To end the night I HAD to try this infamous chocolate cream pie and WOW thats all I can say! Tip: The parlor is really romantic for couples or if your looking for exclusivity.
