Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went here for a 8 p.m. date recently.  We were about 15 minutes late, but phoned ahead and still received a table within 5 minutes of being there.  I was a little disappointed about where they sat us.  I'm assuming it's the patio, because there was a plastic roof, a draft and it was EXTREMELY loud, but I was expecting that.  I'm sure it's a lot more enjoyable sitting there when it's actually warm out.  The actual restaurant and bar itself is very nice and tastefully decorated.
