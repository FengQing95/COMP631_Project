Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have sampled almost everything and determined that the best plates ARE: Spicy Potatoes. Beef and Blue Cheese. Baked Goat Cheese. Shrimp with Red Pepper and Garlic. Bacon Wrapped Dates. Caramelized Banana with Pistachio. And you might like the many different kinds of sangria, but truly, the plain ol' red and white is better than anything else.
