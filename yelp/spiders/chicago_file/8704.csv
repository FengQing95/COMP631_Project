Art Institute of Chicago////I love the Art Institute. They have very lovely impressionist and modern collections, as well as the bewilderingly interesting miniature room exhibit in the basement (I know it sounds silly but don't miss it!). Especially if you can make it there right when it opens and you have some extra elbow room, it's maybe my favorite museum in the US.
