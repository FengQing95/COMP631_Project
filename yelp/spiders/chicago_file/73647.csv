Little Goat Diner////I've never seen a menu with a header entitled, "Cereal Killers" before.  Hey now, don't get toooooo crazy.  Cereal is a tried and true good ole' American staple.  Let's not speak blasphemy here.  I didn't have this, but I love the name of the dish, "Fat Elvis Waffles."  It's two simple words put together, but they have SO much meaning behind them..
