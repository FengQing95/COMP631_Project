Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First, I'll start by saying get one of your friends to go early and put a name down as there will be a wait. Nothing against the restaurant as the food was worth the wait; it was more of an psychosis of the demand for the pizza. Great idea is to preorder your pizza during the wait so that it is closer to being done once you're seated. The Lou and the Classic tasted fantastic. The Lou is a flavorful vegetable pizza with mushrooms, spinach, and tomatoes. The Classic was a neat pizza with sausage and cheese. A large easily feeds four as those spices are thick. Yes, you'll want a fork and knife. Staff was pretty attentive with food and drinks but didn't hover so we can enjoy our meal without constantly being asked how everything is. Locals and visitors alike seem to gravitate to this spot and I now know why.
