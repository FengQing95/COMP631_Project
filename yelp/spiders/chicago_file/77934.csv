Little Goat Diner////I love the Girl & The Goat so trying it's sister restaurant was a must. First and foremost the lox and crumpets are the things dreams are made of. Seriously I've gone back just for that dish alone. The rest, has been hit or miss. I totally understand that this place has a completely different vibe and approach than the Girl & The Goat - but it didn't quite live up to the hype.
