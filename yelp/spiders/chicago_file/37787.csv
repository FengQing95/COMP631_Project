Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Let me tell you, perfect for a birthday dinner.  Everything just hit the spot The dry age rib eye was so tender to its taste a butter knife could cut right through it. They even provided melted butter, but to be honest you don't even need it! The crab cakes! Man it was perfect! Not like frozen tasting ones.  Wasn't too much of a fan for the sauce but thankfully you don't need that either, just a squeeze of lemon. & Dessert such greatness the chocolate moose perfect with the vanilla whip on top damn I was full and in heaven tasted like dark chocolate icecream  As a complimentary the waiter forgot the sparkler but provided us with Salted Caramel Ice cream on the house with chocolate that harden.
