Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Inside the restaurant, tables are too close together, probably so they can pack 'em in whenever possible.  The chairs were uncomfortable - I don't think I've EVER said that about a restaurant.  There was nowhere to put my purse, and since it is winter and the floors were wet and muddy, I didn't want to put my purse on the floor.  I tried to stick my purse between two chairs in a dry spot, but the waiter kicked my purse every time he came to the table.
