Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Being huge chocolate fans we ordered the chocolate pie -- crazy good. It's not fair how good it is. The couple sitting next to us was deciding whether they wanted dessert or not and finally decided against it because their favorite was the ice cream whiskey that I don't believe they had on the menu.Amy felt like they wanted it so she packed one up for them on the house to take home -- it was such a nice gesture.
