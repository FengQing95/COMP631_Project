The Purple Pig////The 6000 Yelp reviews are what brought us in to dine at The Purple Pig. Although they claim to be tapa style dishes, the portions are big and one dish can definitely satisfy one person. I got the sweet corn polenta (they seem to switch up the vegetable for the polenta depending on what's in season). The flavours were great and everything complimented one another very well. The cherry tomatoes were the sweetest and freshest tomatoes I've ever eaten! The grapefruit pur√©e was really overpowering, which was the only downside to the dish. I didn't give the restaurant 5 stars because I think the price is a bit much considering the taste of the food: great, but not worth the price point associated with it.
