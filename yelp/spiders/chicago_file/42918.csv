Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was my first time at Ba-Ba-Rebba and it will NOT be my last! I had heard from a lot of people that this was an excellent restaurant but I honestly didn't think that it would be this good. My two friends and I got two platters, 6 tapas, sangria, beer, the works. From the moment I walked in the door and was greeted until the time I left was an awesome experience. Our server was Russ and he made great recommendations from the menu from drinks, food and dessert. One of the nicest servers I've ever had. All the food we had was good so I'm sure that no matter what you get it will be amazing. Can't wait to come back here again. This is literally one of my top 5 new favorite restaurants!
