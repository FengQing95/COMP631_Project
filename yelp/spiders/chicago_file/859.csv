Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////There was an hour long wait. I just wanted to learn the number of people waiting in line. The host said " There is an hour long wait." . I asked "Do you mind telling me how many people are ahead of me." His answer "100". Please, get rid of rude and condescending workers. It is unacceptable.
