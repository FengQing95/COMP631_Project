Smoque BBQ////While I may not have tried every BBQ place in Chicago, I have tried a lot of them. Smoque is by far my favorite. The only knock is that their success has bred a long line (sometimes). The owners and managers are very friendly; they actually want to hear your views (good and bad). The brisket is to die for, as is the chicken, ribs and sides. I highly recommend it to those who care about their BBQ!
