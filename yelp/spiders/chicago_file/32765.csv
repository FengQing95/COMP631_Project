Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The Bone Marrow and Beet Salad come. I love bone marrow, and my husband will partake in a bite, but when he did, he squished his nose in dislike. I then ate a few scoops and it was the worst tasting marrow I have ever had. Maybe my oysters had hepatitis and my cow had mad cow disease. Either way, they were awful (but I was famished and used the great jelly to mask the flavor). The beets were too thinly sliced, not a good chunky beet--lacking flavor for his salad (his complaint not mine).
