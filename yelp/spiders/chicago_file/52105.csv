Smoque BBQ////The baked beans...that was an odd story. My first bite was heaven. They were amazing. But I couldn't take more than 2 or 3 bites at a time before I was bored with them. It's an interesting taste, but they were almost too sock it to me and didn't have much of a 'beany' flavor. Â So it was nibble something, take a bite of beans. leave them alone for a while, go back to them, have a couple of bites etc. Weird, huh?
