Smoque BBQ////We got there at a good time (noon) - it was busy, but they kept the line moving and there was seating available even though it is relatively small inside. You just have to resign yourself to the fact that your chair is going to get bumped every few minutes since it's pretty cramped. Everyone is in a great mood, though, so I didn't really mind. By the time we finished our meal the line was out the door. :)
