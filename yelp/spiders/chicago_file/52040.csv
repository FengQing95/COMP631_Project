Smoque BBQ////People may tell you that the North can't proper BBQ, which, 99 times in 100, they can't.  Smoque is the exception.  Everything I've had here has been fantastic, and I've made my way through most of the menu at this point, even if I always end up back at the brisket (and the delicious smoke ring).  Even the sides are astounding, the Peach Cobbler is not to be missed, and I seem to end up with a side of mac and cheese every time I'm there as well.
