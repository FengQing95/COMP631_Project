Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This location is pretty small, when we walked up the place was literally bursting at the seems with people waiting to be seated.  Since the pizza takes 40 minutes to cook, they ask you to place your pizza order while you wait.  Which we did, and then we went to get drinks at the bar.  Luckily for us, 2 seats opened at the bar, right when we walked up so we scored seats right away.  Bartenders were slammed, but still friendly and immediately alerted the hostess we were now at the bar.
