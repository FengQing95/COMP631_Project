Little Goat Diner////This place serves fresh baked breads from their bakery next door and OMG the breads are good.  The Korean goat burger bun was brioche-like, fluffy, soft, subtly sweet and perfectly toasted.  The clam baguette that was served with the bruschetta was pleasantly ... uh... clammy.  The special bread of the day was a spicy miso bread that was simply magnificent - how do they get that bread so soft on the inside yet full of texture?
