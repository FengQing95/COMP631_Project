Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting Chicago for the first time, my husband and I knew we needed to try deep dish. We tried both Lou Malnati's and Giordano's on our trip, and Lou Malnati's was by far our favorite. Now we know why everyone raves about deep dish. The crust was thick and buttery with the sauce contrasting very nicely. We got a medium and had leftovers for days- would definitely go with the small next time.
