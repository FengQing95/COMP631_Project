Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went here for the first time EVER today! I'm from Minnesota and have been to chicago about 8 times and never have gone to any location of Lou Malnati's. Not only does it have the most delicious, high quality pizza in Chicago, but also has the most inviting, kind staff! Seriously the staff were so attentive. I mean, Chicago is a hit or miss with restaurants, but this one was my favorite. They said our pizza would take around 45 minutes, it took about 25 which was awesome. Our waiter refilled our waters multiple times, and my coke with a lemon. Also, I had the best pizza I have ever had. Best day ever!
