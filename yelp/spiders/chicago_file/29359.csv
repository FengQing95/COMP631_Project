Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So much hype about this place. I tried Giordano's before and was not impressed so I decided to try Lou Malnati's. As expected the place was packed. Got seated within 5 minutes of checking in. We ordered one small thin cheese pizza and one personal "The Lou." Our waiter said that a personal pizza is a decent size and would be fulfilling for one person but it was not. Waited 45-50 minutes to get our food although we were promised a 30-35 minute wait. In the meantime the waiter offered free bread to which we said okay. However you literally get a loaf of bread without any oil or pesto or anything, just bread.
