Smoque BBQ////I went with some work colleagues, always good to get a dinner of grilled meat.  Typical BBQ style with grilled meat and sauce on the side.  It was good and decent for the price.  They control the seating so be aware there's a system.  It wasn't crowded when we were there, but I can see it probably get crazy when the place is busy.
