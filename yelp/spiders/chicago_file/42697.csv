Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I will cut right to the point. This place has a great location and ambiance but the food we had was just average at best. Pinxtos Platter - This was the best tasting choice with a variety of small bites. Nothing stood out as being wonderful, but it was tasty. Cream of Mushroom soup - So apparently the mushroom baby food idea didn't fly and Café Ba Ba Reeba bought the entire stock of this apple sauce textured extremely weak attempt at soup. Good news babies, no "soup" for you! Grilled Octopus - Cooked very well but had a fishy taste which they tried to cover up by coating it in smoked paprika, nothing more here...just an over load of smoked paprika Seared Salmon with Dill Crème - That's about it. Just a piece of overcooked salmon with dill sauce on the side. Just not exciting at all. No additional flavors on the salmon besides "dry" And I think we got something else forgettable, but they did make sure to include that same dill sauce that the salmon had. I mean, why not just cover everything up in dill sauce, right? I do have to say that the desserts were good and our server was excellent. He was super attentive and the best part of the meal. I will never go back here unless they realize that location doesn't mean your food tastes good. I also have to ask all the positive reviews here. Are you seriously smoking crack or just have no idea what good food is? Maybe you were drunk?
