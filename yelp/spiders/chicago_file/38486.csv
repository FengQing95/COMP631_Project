Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////While visiting Chicago, my boyfriend and I made a reservation to celebrate his birthday. I tried to make the reservation online about three weeks before we were going to be there. There was nothing available. I called the restaurant and spoke to a really nice man who said there were plenty of reservations still available. Phew! It's probably worth it to just call to make reservations.
