Smoque BBQ////Chicken - I think this may be the best chicken preparation I have ever had, it originally was taken by the Publican, but I think in terms of chicken, Publican has to take a 2, albeit a VERY high 2. The chicken looks EXACTLY like it does on their site, perfectly moist, smoked and they browned exterior carrying a ridiculous amount of flavor. I will not go to Smoque and ever not get it.
