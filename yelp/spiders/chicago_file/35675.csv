Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As a steak-lover, I used to go to my old standbys and get the usual - but delightful - offerings. However, with a new steak-loving boss, I have been encouraged to open my eyes to the many new and previously untasted (by me) places in Chicago. We decided to try this place a few weeks ago.
