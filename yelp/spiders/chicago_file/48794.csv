Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our waiter was cordial and helpful in explaining the menu to us, as well as how tapas work, after we informed him that this was our first time dining at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba. We ordered the seafood paella for two for starters after our waiter informed us that would take the longest amount of time to be ready (30-40 minutes). We also ordered a glass of the classic red sangria to share. (Okay, mostly for my boyfriend. I don't really drink, so I just took a few sips of his because I had never tried sangria before.) I have nothing to compare it to exactly, but I thought it was delicious and certainly more enjoyable than red wine by itself (in my un-wine-cultured opinion). While waiting for our seafood paella, we did not hold back at all in ordering small plates of tapas. We kept ordering and ordering and the food just kept coming and coming!
