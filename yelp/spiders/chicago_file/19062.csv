Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Everything I hoped and dreamed a real Chicago style pizza should be, I've eating at the other hot spot pizza I forgot the name but the crust is chewy and had a cracker like crust, I've eaten here several times when I'm in Chicago for work and it never disappoints! Just make sure you're near a bed to crash out after!
