Smoque BBQ////I don't know much about brisket. I've had it maybe 20 different occasions during my 63 years, but this stuff right here! I mean the brisket they serve at Smoque!  Beats the pants off any other brisket I've had. My only complaint is the consistency. I don't know the mechanics of smoking but the doneness of a particular  order  can sometimes vary. I've had an order that was a little rare for my taste and I'ver had an order that was overdone. Any time I had a problem though, the staff fixed it with no problem. This is a great place.
