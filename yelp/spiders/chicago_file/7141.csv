Art Institute of Chicago////This place has one of the richest art collections in the United States! We purposely went there to check out the new Picasso exhibit. So worthy!!! The exterior architecture is impressive! I didn't think it was appropriate to charge a $1.00 for the coat check. This is the first museum I've paid for coat check. If you're a student make sure you show your student id for a price break!
