The Purple Pig////Our waitress was very friendly and eager to give us recommendations. We ended up getting the crispy pig ears, pork shank osso bucco, and squid ink tagliatelle. The pig ear came out first. It was crispy, and it came with crispy fried kale, and some sort of pickled vegetable. The fried egg on top was much needed to offset how heavy and salty this dish is. I was surprised since this was probably the most ordered thing on Yelp but it was difficult to finish since every component on the plate was fried and salty. It was okay but wouldn't order again, I would try other apps.
