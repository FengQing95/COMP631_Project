Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////If anyone knows me I tend to eschew restaurants in which, on the surface, lore supersedes the actual experience of a place. Â  Even if i'm cutting off my nose to spite my face, as they often never reach that monumental expectation. But in the case of Bavette's, thanks be to God, or my GF as it were, she took my B-day dinner plans into her very capable hands and made a reservation.
