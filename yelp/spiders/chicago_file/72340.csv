Little Goat Diner////Friend ordered the crumpets and chorizo and also some eggs.  I opted for biscuits and gravy with bacon.  We both really enjoyed both and passed the plates back and forth.  That is why I love S.I.z restaurants, the bread, biscuits, crumpets = all homemade and ridiculously delicious.  We really enjoyed our breffast - and the place has a nice relaxed vibe.
