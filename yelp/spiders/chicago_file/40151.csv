Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce.
