Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm giving this place four, not five stars because some of the dishes came out a little cold, and the fried calamari was on the soggy side. The atmosphere was also pretty loud and crazy for a weeknight dinner, but I guess that is to be expected at a tapas place. The food and people made for a fun night, and I will definitely be back!
