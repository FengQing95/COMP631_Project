Smoque BBQ////For some reason, I have been on this bbq binge trying to find the good ones in Chicago.  I am giving this place 5 stars because it just might be the best sliced brisket I have ever had in the US.  Now note, I am more of a fan of dry rubbed bbq, nothing too saucey.  But I even love eating at this place.  With the guy there to find you a table to eat at, it feels comfortable eating there...which is what a bbq place should be like.
