Smoque BBQ////If you are in Chicago and love BBQ you must stop here.  Line always out the door for dinner, but they get you in and out very quickly.  Mac and cheese, pulled pork and peach cobbler are my favorite.  Hard to eat BBQ anywhere else as we compare it to smoque.  Also another find from DDD, so more for our Triple D tour in Chicago area.
