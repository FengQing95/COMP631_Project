Art Institute of Chicago////This was my first trip to the Art Institute. The cashier at the ticket counter was so nice and that helped set the tone for the visit. A docent inside took some time to explain the layout of the museum to me. When I ran into him later in the day he asked how I was doing and what I liked best so far. I had lunch at the cafe which was good and gave me some time to get my second wind for more exploration. I will be back.
