Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't consider myself to be a food critic or a pizza snob in any way and in fact I do enjoy other pizza so long as it's tasty.  Maybe one has a crust that I like, or a sauce that really tastes good.  And I think that's fine.  But Lou's pizza is my all time favorite, no doubt.  We have ordered both the thin crust and the famous deep dish and the butter crust is to die for.  It is particularly flavorful when the juices of the tomatoes soak in, at least to me.  It gives the butter flavor such a richness to it that I really enjoy, and Malnati's pizza is one of few that I kind of consider the crust to be an actual ingredient rather than just something to hold the toppings on.  It's magic!
