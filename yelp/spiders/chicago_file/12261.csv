Art Institute of Chicago////I've lived in New York, Philadelphia, Seattle, and travelled extensively in the States and Europe visiting museums.  While NYC definitely has some great museums and Philly's PMA and NYC's MoMa/PS1 are up there among my favorite museums, AIC definitely comes in first.  The Hermitage experience was ruined for me due to the overabundance of rude tourists, and I have not been to the Louvre yet, but I've otherwise been to a lot of museums in Europe.  Albertina in Vienna is a close second.
