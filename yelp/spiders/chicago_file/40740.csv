Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It's a fun atmosphere with young crowd.  I like the specialty sangrias they have to offer, especially the mango one.  The dates were unimpressive for me, my friends love the goat cheese with tomato sauce so if you ilke goat cheese, try it.  Grilled octopus was well seasoned, rioja-braised short ribs was fall off the bone delicious. The server was very attentive.
