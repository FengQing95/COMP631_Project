Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Very excited to try deep dish Chicago style for the first time in Chicago. Got a caesar salad that was tasty and 2 pizzas. The DEEP DISH THE LOU (best item) tasted better than the DEEP DISH CHEESE. I think the tomato sauce was different if not it was the veggies giving the sauce more flavor. Don't hate me natives of Chicago but I prefer other styles of pizza. This is a bit too heavy for me. Staff is very nice. Very casual dining. It was busy the night I went.
