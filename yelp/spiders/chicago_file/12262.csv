Art Institute of Chicago////Tourists do flock to this place, but not in the overwhelming numbers that you'll see at The Met, Hermitage, Louvre, et al.  Summers get busy and the featured works of Hopper, Wood, Seurat, Picasso will have crowds around them, but there is so much to see at AIC.  Having a membership provides the opportunity to visit weekly if I choose; each time visiting a different section of the museum.  Try and visit during non-tourist seasons, or at least arrive early.
