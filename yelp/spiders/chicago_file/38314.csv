Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food : large and tender shrimp cocktail. We have found that having both is at times, a challenge to find. Freshly baked sourdough bread. Filet and ribeye, sides of the greatest brussel sprouts Ive ever had, loaded baked potato and then chocolate creampie. All fantastic and I have nothing to add as far as what could have been improved with the food! The best!
