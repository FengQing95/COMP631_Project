Smoque BBQ////2 stars from my first impression of an attempted take-out order.  When you call you have to go through an automated phone system (press 1 for our hours....press 6 for a catering menu to be faxed to your office...press 2 to place a carry out order).  We were told the next available time to come get take out was 7:50pm (it was 5:55pm when I called).
