Art Institute of Chicago////Even though I visit this place about 2-5 times a year. Every time I find many new pieces that touch my heart and surprise how art can be made in many Â inspirational ways, yet I visit those all time favorite pieces. For art history lovers, Art institute has an amazing collection for impressionism especially when you like some famous artists like Van Gogh and Monet. If you like history in general, they offer so much cultural objects from cultures around the world across many time frames.
