Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Elote corn was the only disappointment when it came to sides. It tasted like corns kernels stewed in rotelle and velveeta - kids said it looked like spicy Mac and cheese made of corn. Â Roasted bone marrow was awesome, along with the truffle Mac and cheese. Pomme frites aren't the thin long light fries you'd expect from the name - more steak fries :(
