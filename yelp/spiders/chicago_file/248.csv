Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////LOVE! Wildberry is our favorite place for brunch in Chicago! On top of having the world's best omelettes (fresca and fig are top), lovely pancakes (try specialty), and perfect hash browns, you get more for your money. It would be my favorite dinner too, if they were open!
