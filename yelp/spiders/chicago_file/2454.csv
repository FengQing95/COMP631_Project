The Purple Pig////If you visit Chicago, this place should be on your must go list! I love this place. Awesome environment with wonderful food! Their Bone Marrow is to die for. It's a bit pricy but worthwhile! They don't take reservations so it is a bit tricky! Sometimes you can find a seat at the bar but sometimes you have to wait. I highly recommend this unique place!!!
