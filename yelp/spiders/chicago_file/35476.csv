Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////When it came to the steaks, they were definitely good, but not outstanding, maybe just not living up to the hype.  The lady had a petite filet, and although there's not a whole lot you can expect from a cut such as that (tenderness being the exception), it was disappointing that it actually dried out midway though the meal.  I had the much-lauded dry-aged bone-in ribeye, which just didn't knock me over in any way.  Sure, it was tender, but didn't have that distinctive dry-aged flavor, and also had a lot more fat than I would have liked, even for a ribeye.  For a $60 steak, I just expected more.
