Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Last weekend, we had a friend visiting from Cali, and since I consider Ba-Ba-Reeba a true Chicago staple, we booked a reservation for Sunday brunch. This was my first time here for brunch, and it was just as good as ever. Ba-Ba-Reeba is a huge restaurant, but always super crowded, so highly recommend getting a reservation. For brunch they offered both brunch tapas, and some of their classic dinner favs. Awesome, because we decided to get a mixture of the two. Classics that always stand out are the grilled hanger steak, burrata, brussels sprouts, and octopus. We tried a few brunch items, like the shrimp and grits and sausage paella rice with egg, both excellent! There really isn't a dish I've had here that I didn't enjoy.
