Smoque BBQ////We ordered the ribs, and brisket and also bbq chili (a special they were running).  The melt in your mouth ribs, no-need for sauce brisket and hearty bbq chili made us forget about eating there.  It was actually better for us to get out food to-go - we would have been dreading driving back with full and sleepy bodies.  The mac and cheese we did not like so much, it was kind of bland for our tastes.
