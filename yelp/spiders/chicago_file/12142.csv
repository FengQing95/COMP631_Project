Art Institute of Chicago////The space is nicely designed and has a lot of rest areas, which my feet were extremely thankful for. I didn't realize there were a lot more modern and contemporary content upstairs; I personally would have started there. I was only here for a couple hours but the museum was sadly closing. Try to allocate about 3 hours.
