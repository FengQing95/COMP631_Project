Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Had the fresca omelette, best omelette I ever had. Light n fluffy. Friends had different skillets dishes which were also delicious and a little more heartier if u are looking for a full belly. Buttermilk pancakes were perfectly fluffy. All were generous servings and delicious plus prices were very friendly to the wallet. Will look to come back next time in Chicago.
