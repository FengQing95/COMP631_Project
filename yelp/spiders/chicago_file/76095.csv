Little Goat Diner////It's a great hop & skip down from Girl in the Goat so if your not in the mood for a longer wait there - skip over here. The dishes are lighter and tasty with less of a dress code. The service is on par and the drinks are quickly brought by which is wonderful. Casual and relaxing with realistically affordable prices for prime fair. Most bites taste international - lots of artwork to enjoy and big booths to stretch out in.
