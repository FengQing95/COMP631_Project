Art Institute of Chicago////When I found out last summer that a bunch of my out-of-town friends were coming in, I ran and got the student membership.  I still think that this is one of the best deals in the city.  A membership gets you and a guest in for free, and you can get free coffee and tea in the Member's Lounge.  It more than pays for itself in two visits.
