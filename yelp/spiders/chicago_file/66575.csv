Little Goat Diner////Ordered the Parathas burrito with the "avocado and bean" salad. One sliver of avocado (literally...almost took a picture) and literally 8 kidney beans does not qualify as an "avocado and bean" salad. The burrito shell hardened so much during the time while I ate it that I had to ask for a steak knife (and I'm not that slow of an eater). I really don't mind paying for food if it's good however this place is super over-priced for what you get. There's no guarantee that anything is organic or anything special so why 2 sunny-side eggs runs you $12 bucks I have know idea. And I was still hungry afterwards. My friend ordered the shrimp and grits. She said the flavors were good but the first thing she said was "where are the grits?" Anyway, hope your experience is better. Will not be going back and will stick to my regular favorite breakfast spots.
