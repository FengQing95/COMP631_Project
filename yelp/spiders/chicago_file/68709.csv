Little Goat Diner////I've been here half a dozen times now and every time the food is absolute chunky girl heaven!  Such delicious twists on various comfort foods.  It's quality stuff, no doubt.  And the bloody marys are mouth watering deliciousness.  They have a very unique flavor-maybe due to the hot sauce they use? There is often a decent wait time, but 100% worth the wait.  Head to the bar. Grab a bloody and/or a goat milk latte and your table will be ready in no time! Love love love this joint.
