Little Goat Diner////I wish that Stephanie Izard would decide one day to open a chain of diners all around the Chicagoland area so that I can eat here whenever I want. Parking was a bit hard to come by, though there was valet parking service outside for $14.00. Our recent visit was around 11:30 AM and decided to pop into the diner for a bite. We ended up parking the car on Peoria street and paid for street parking. I hadn't expected the restaurant to be so full at 11:30 AM, but by 11:45 AM,  the restaurant had a line of people waiting. We were lucky we got in before the rush. I loved the open space of the diner, with a bar stool counter top for patrons to dine at. We were seated in a cozy corner by the kitchen. The staff from the people who greeted us from the front door, to the server that took our order, to the busser were all courteous and friendly. I had originally wanted breakfast food, but my girlfriend had raves about the Los Drowned sandwich. I was intrigued by braised beef on a hoagie and decided to go for it. It was messy, delicious, tender, explosion of flavor sandwich I had tasted in forever. The sandwich was a big portion, but I had cravings for fries as well. I was  skeptical at first when I saw that it was shoe string fries, but they were delicately fried to a crisp and seasoned well. It was a wonderful complimentary dish to the sandwich. I'd love to make more visits here and try other items on the menu.
