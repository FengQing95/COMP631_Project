Little Goat Diner////I have heard great things about this restaurant group and was looking forward to trying it. Such a huge disappointment. The menu is full of random fusion dishes, and the descriptions are quite intriguing, but the stuff we ordered just didn't taste good. We asked our waiter for recommendations and he said the best thing on the menu was the okonomiyaki. I felt bad for my daughter who ordered this - it was a greasy mess. Same with my fried chicken - the batter was thick and greasy - makes Popeyes fried chicken look delicate in comparison. And our corned beef hash was inedible - the eggs were over cooked (we asked for over easy and this was well done) and the hash browns tasted burnt, almost like cooking fuel. The only decent things we had were the plain pancakes from the kids menu and a side of Mac and cheese. Our main dishes were such a disappointment that we didn't bother staying for dessert and had ice cream up the street instead.
