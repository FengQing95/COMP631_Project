Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Outstanding breakfast. Huge selection of omlettes, pancakes, french toast, skillets. My omelette with figs, bacon, chives and cheese was realllllllly good. Hash browns were just crispy enough. Blueberry pancakes on the side. Only problem? Walking out without help after eating so much!
