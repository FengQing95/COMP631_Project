Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Pretty good tapas restaurant in Lincoln Park.  Been here a few times with friends.  It's a tad overpriced for the amount of food you get, but the trick is to sit at the bar for their late night menu - which is a good deal.  The paella is good but takes some time to make, so order a few other things to hold you over.
