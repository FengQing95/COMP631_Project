Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was quite disappointing, but the Malnati Salad was seriously amazing. Probably the BEST salad I've ever had. A family portion costs you about $15, so it's pricey but very worth it. The salad redeemed the meal for me with its perfectly proportioned bites of veggies, bits of meat, and cheese.
