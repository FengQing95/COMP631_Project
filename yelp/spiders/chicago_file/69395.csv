Little Goat Diner////The food was very good.  I ordered a Rueben sandwich that had a twist - kimchi in addition to sauerkraut on it.  The service was excellent.  Jake, our server, was very friendly and accommodating when we asked to split a dessert.  I would recommend this place for breakfast, lunch or dinner.
