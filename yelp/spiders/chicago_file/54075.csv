Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////BEFORE you order drinks, place your order for the breakfast paella. It takes about 30-45 minutes to make and serves about 2-3 people. Trust me - you won't regret it! And you'll be so happy that you ordered it once you see it comes out. You might be full from the other dishes that you've ordered because it's the last dish that you will get, but it's an amazing for leftovers.
