Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we arrived, we were seated promptly and our server came to greet us quickly. We ordered 2 blue moon beers, as well as a bruschetta appetizer. We placed our pizza order as well, since the pizza can sometimes take some time to cook. Our starters were relatively tasty, but I noticed that we were waiting quite a while for our pizza, which I could understand that it was a busy Saturday night and the pizza was also deep dish which can take some time.
