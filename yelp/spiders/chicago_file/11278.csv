Art Institute of Chicago////A bit disappointing that none of the pictures moved like in Harry Potter, but it was a good way to spend an afternoon regardless. A few of the statues were naked, very inappropriate, my girlfriend will be knitting sweaters to send over so that the art is more family friendly.
