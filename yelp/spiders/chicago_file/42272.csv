Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Not as good as Cafe Iberico but closer to me and I always enjoy it.  It has the reputation of being touristy, but I dont really care if the food is good, and it is.   We love the garlic shrimp, the assorted spanish sausages,  beef terderloin and spicy potatoes. The atmoshpere is lively and the prices are  moderate.   Im always stuffed and satisfied when I leave!
