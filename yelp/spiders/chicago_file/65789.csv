Smoque BBQ////All the sides are good but I really love the Mac n cheese and the cornbread. You can also get a sandwich or platter with slaw which is also amazing. The place is usually packed and nothing fancy but if you are looking for some delicious meat Smoque is the place to go. There are a few options for sauce and you really can't go wrong!
