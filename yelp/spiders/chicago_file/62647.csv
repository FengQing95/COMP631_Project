Smoque BBQ////There's probably nothing more I can say that the other 4000 reviewers haven't. GO TRY IT. seriously worth it. We shared the 1/2 chicken platter, Mac n cheese, fries, coleslaw, cornbread, and bread pudding. The chicken was falling off the bone. Omg soooo good. Coleslaw was light and tangy unlike the crappy mayo colrslaw you get at most places. The mac n cheese and fries were more on the average side for us. And the bread pudding.... omg get it. You won't regret it.
