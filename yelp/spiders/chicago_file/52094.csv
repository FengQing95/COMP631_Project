Smoque BBQ////While on a baseball trip to the midwest USA my wife and I were interested in sampling the local barbecue in different cities. I have to admit that the incipient violent reputation that Chicago has won was in the back of my mind when we pulled up in front of this establishment. In my naivete I had expected a higher end experience, however, it turns out that the best barbecue is not necessarily found in upper crust neighbourhoods. Once inside, however, I WAS impressed by the cleanliness, courtesy, and efficiency of the largely Latino staff. The room itself houses the kitchen and ordering counter and patrons sit at picnic tables, with a self dispensing soda machine nearby. The young woman who took our order was brusque but pleasant and took the time to explain to a neophyte exactly how St Louis ribs were different from baby back ribs. The whole area is suffused by the mouthwatering aroma of barbecue. My combination platter of baby back ribs, and St Louis ribs with sides of macaroni and cheese and cole slaw was flavourful succulent and of excellent quality. My wife enjoyed her pulled pork sandwich. All the while we were attended by a server who would remove our leftovers and keep giving us a steady supply of moist towelletes. I would not take my glove wearing mother in law here, but the food was simply fantastic. I will certainly return the next time I'm in Chicago.
