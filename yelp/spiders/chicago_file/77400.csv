Little Goat Diner////This place was great for brunch. I had the breakfast burrito. The Indian bread that it is wrapped in is delicious! I loved the sauce that came with it as well. My mom had the special which was a pork belly biscuit. She said it was delicious. It was good but dry. Fries were okay. Reminded me of in-n-out. We also split a cinnamon roll. I wish they would have under baked it a little to make it more gooey.
