Little Goat Diner////Little Goat has the ability to make me cry. Not because of physical pain (even though I was oh-so-full), but I left with an exhausted mind after being incredibly overwhelmed by the sheer size of the menu and the incredible portions provided. My buddy Breanna B & I were practically shedding tears when faced with the decision of what to choose for our meals. I was almost incapable of choosing. But choose I did...thanks to our stupendous server, Carl.
