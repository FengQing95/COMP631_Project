Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Get the wedge salad.  Seems counter intuitive at a Steakhouse but trust me.  It was the star of the show in a phenomenal experience.  The drinks were outstanding.  Service was exceptional.  Everything we ordered tasted amazing.  We had a 1015pm reservation on a Sunday.  I was so concerned we were going to be those assholes holding the entire restaurant up from going home.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  The restaurant was busy and the staff made us feel like we could have stayed for hours.  My friends who dined with me were in town the next two nights and I saw them both nights.  The wedge salad came up everytime I saw them until they left town.  Get the wedge salad.
