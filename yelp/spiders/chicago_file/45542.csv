Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The potatoes are great here, real spicy and the aioli is awesome. The goat cheese is the usual, A+. What I love are the pinxtos: bite sized specials. This time ii was an asparagus/goat cheese crisp something.. all I remember was the deliciousness.. But 4 stars are mainly for their desserts. Don't miss the chocolate tres leches. We ordered about two rounds of all the desserts they had on the menu by the end of the night!
