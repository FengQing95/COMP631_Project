Art Institute of Chicago////Love love love this museum! Spent 5.5 hours there and didn't touch on all the masterpieces.  The Impressionist collection is astounding and the modern art impressive.  There was a great mix of genre. "American Gothic" was on loan when we were there but that was a minor inconvenience. We will definitely keep going back until we see it all!!!
