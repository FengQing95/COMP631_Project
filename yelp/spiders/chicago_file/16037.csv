Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was.... SOOOO good. There was just something about the mix of ingredients that made it taste awesome. The pizza also wasn't overloaded with tomato on the top (which I find on a lot of deep dish pizzas), so I didn't have to spend time scraping it off. Having it overloaded with tomatoes takes the taste away from the pizza. The crust was also pretty tasty, but I have to say that Little Star wins in this regard.
