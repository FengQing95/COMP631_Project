Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite tapas places in the city! Great food, so many options and a fun place to come with friends to try many dishes. Overall I would say some dishes are not great, like none of the chicken dishes are very good and some of beef are over cooked / dry. The other downside is that it's really difficult to eat there on weekends - reservations at normal times are impossible and the waits are so long. But I guess that's not the fault of the restaurant. Overall would definitely recommend.
