Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered two of these pizzas online because a friend was going to order them for me and never did.  She ranted and raved about LM pizzas and I wanted to try them.  I have to say,  I don't know what the big rave is about these pizzas.  Maybe it's because I live in the west, but I have never heard of a pizza where the sauce is put ON TOP of the cheese.  This was the weirdest pizza I've ever had.  Not to mention, I thought $30 apiece was a bit expensive for a 9-inch pizza.  I suspect $10 per pizza went to shipping them.
