Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best Chicago style pizza IMO. Between Lou's and Giordano's, I don't think there's any competition. Lou's wins hands down. There are probably some smaller name shops that the locals know and love. For this out of towner, I won't be able to visit Chicago without going to Lou Malnati's. You already know the pizza is amazing. FYI, the sausage is not crumbled. Instead, it's a like a sheet of sausage that covers the whole pizza. I like it but I can imagine some would prefer the standard crumbled sausage. Just know that the pizza is very filling and takes upwards of 45 minutes to make. Have one of their surprisingly good salads while you wait. Just don't fill up and try to book a hotel with a fridge in your room so you can take the leftovers to go.
