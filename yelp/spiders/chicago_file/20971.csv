Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My family of four shared two small deep dish pizzas - "The Lou" (vegetarian) and a cheese.  Both were excellent and we were all full without any leftovers.  I especially like The Lou after I jazzed it up with some parmesan and red pepper.  The restaurant was visually interesting with all of its historical and industrial decor.
