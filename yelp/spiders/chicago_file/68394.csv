Little Goat Diner////First, we made a reservation for 7:00 PM. We arrived around 6:55, notified the hostess we were there, and she informed us we would need to wait at least 20 minutes if we didn't want to sit at a communal table. What was the purpose of the reservation?! This was a frustrating way to begin the evening.
