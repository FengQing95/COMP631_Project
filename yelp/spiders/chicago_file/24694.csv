Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My first slice was a volatile bag of mixed emotions. I would be torn between disappointment and mild satisfaction as I bit into various parts of the pizza that were still warm versus parts that were now room temperature (and the room was cool. The AC was GOING...summers in the midwest are no joke).
