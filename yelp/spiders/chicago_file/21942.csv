Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We also tried Pizzeria Uno and Gino's East to complete the trifecta of most popular deep dish establishments while we were visiting Chicago, and Malnati's ended up being our favorite. So good that we came here twice for pizza, once on the day we arrived and again on our last day before heading back to California. We also stopped by in between to try their version of the pizookie which was incredible.
