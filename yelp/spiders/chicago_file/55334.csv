Smoque BBQ////Smoque has a well deserved reputation of being one of the best BBQ in the Chicago area. In my family, we ordered the shredded pork sandwich, brisket, and st. louis ribs.  All were excellent.  The shredded pork is meaty, the brisket is tender we cut ours with a fork, and the ribs fall off the bone.  It's clear the restaurant slow cooks the meat for hours.
