Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For visitor's to Chicago looking for classic deep dish pizza, I would recommend going for Giordano's or Piquad's over Lou Malnati's. If you do find yourself here, I advise against the Lou Malnati's classic... unless you like the idea of a solid 2 inch layer of greasy sausage across your entire pizza.
