Art Institute of Chicago////Okay, better now. The collection is fine: predictable, but certainly carefully culled to represent a sort of greatest hits of post-war art; I think another review captured it perfectly--and I did entertain the thought--that this was the "Now that's What I call Music!" compilation of abstract expressionism, with Twombly, Richter, Kelley, et al. all getting their due. My hope is that the curators, once finished with the shakedown cruise, get a chance to run with things, because I thought the photography collection was filled with ballsy choices that pissed off most of the troglodytes in the room--would like to see more of that risk-taking elsewhere in the new galleries.
