Smoque BBQ////We usually call in and order the food to-go, but yesterday we got to eat there.  We got there about 6pm and the line just kept getting longer and longer after that.  Everyone was very friendly and we were happy to get a table right after we ordered.  I woke up craving BBQ and I think it's because my hair still smelt like smokey BBQ, made me hungry for Smoque all over again.  :)
