Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I made dinner reservations on a Tuesday evening for my bf's belated birthday celebration. The only open reservation (on Open Table) was at 8:45pm, but when we arrived, I saw many open tables. We were seated not too long after our arrival, but it wasn't until we were already seated at our table did the hostess ask if we wanted to check in our coats.
