Art Institute of Chicago////Free on Thursdays 5pm-8pm. They block off certain gallery sections, but hey its free! So we had to squeeze this in our trip to Chicago.  Stepping in this place reminded me of all the art history, art classes I took in college.  My favorite section was the asian art...especially the different types of buddhist statues.  So much to see!
