Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.  If you're into tapas and sangria you cannot go wrong at Ba Ba Reeba!  I've been here for dinners with friends, roommates, and family members visiting from out of town and we've never had anything but a great time.  It's fun to order a bunch of different tapas to share around the table and if you go with a large group it usually ends up being pretty reasonable price wise.  I recommend the goat cheese with tomato sauce, and the Passionfruit Sangria is amazing!
