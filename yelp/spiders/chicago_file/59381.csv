Smoque BBQ////I'll confess, the first time I went to this place, the BBQ was a little too charred and Smokey for my taste.  But when I returned.  It was perfect.  Ribs were falling off the bone, the coleslaw was not smothered in mayo, which was good, and the peach cobbler was orgasmic...yes orgasmic.
