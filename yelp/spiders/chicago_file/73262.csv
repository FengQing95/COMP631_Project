Little Goat Diner////My husband and I went there at 8 am on a Sunday with our one year old child. They proceeded to seat us on the community table with a high chair. We asked for one of the countless empty booths in the restaurant. The hostess then told us they were all saved for reservations and wouldn't move us somewhere else. There had to have been 15 open tables at this time. We decided to leave since it would be difficult for both of us to eat with my son with my husband across the long table. I truly hope this never happens to anyone else with children. Perhaps they should be more accommodating to families with children especially when the place is empty. We've gone there for years before we had children and moved out of the city so it's very disappointing. We will never be back.
