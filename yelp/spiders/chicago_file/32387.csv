Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Such a a nice location, staff, and ambiance. The pizza was good and served with care, but I think it didn't live up to the deep dish hype. The crust was a bit soggy and without taste, and most of the cheese falls off as you pull a slice. I definitely recommend for the historic value, and quality since prices are fair and portions are filling.
