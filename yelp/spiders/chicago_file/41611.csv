Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been a few times now and the one word sums up these tapas: GREASY.  Of course, greasy can be good and the food is good---- just not great or something to go out of your way for. Come to Cafe Ba-ba-Reeba for a few of the classic Spanish tapas:  sangria, wine, baked goat cheese and marinara (always a must) , great cheese selection, bacon-wrapped dates, olives, etc.
