The Purple Pig////My least favorites were the deviled egg and cake. I love deviled eggs but I think that I was expecting something different for this dish, I definitely think that the capers brought it all together. And, the cake is one dish that I would not order again. All of the ingredients were layered and I think that the pomegranate was a bit overpowering to the chocolate.
