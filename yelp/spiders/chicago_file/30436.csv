Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's has super great pizza. My favorite pizza anywhere. There, I said it. For years I've ordered Lou "to-go" delivered to my house in CA just before Christmas. The 6 pizzas last until Super Bowl Sunday, and when they're gone, I long for my next order at the end of the year. So it's no surprise that my first stop in Chicago was Lou Malnati's for their great sausage pizza.
