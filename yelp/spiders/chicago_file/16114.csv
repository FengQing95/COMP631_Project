Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first trip to Lou Malnatis, and my first taste of true Chicago deep dish pizza. Our group ordered 2 medium deep dish 1 pepperoni and 1 called the Lou which was "spinach mix", tomatoes and mushrooms- we ordered no mushrooms. We also got a combination app which included mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini, cheddar cubes, and fried mushrooms, and we got one called the dips with pizza chips-3 different styles of dips 1-spinach dip, 1- hummus, and 1- garlic spread. Needless to say our party of 4 had plenty of leftovers.
