Little Goat Diner////Little Goat is not for picky eaters.  My friend wanted a more plain dish than what was offered on the menu and asked for plain French Toast.  We thought the waitress was joking when she said, "the cook refuses to make that," but she was serious.  Another friend was able to order plain egg whites and a side of grits, so there is some room for simplicity, but not very much.  However, *I* came to Little Goat to eat the often raved-about food from the menu and loved it!
