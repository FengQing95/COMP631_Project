Art Institute of Chicago////Enjoyed Target free days for the summer in Chicago at the Art Institute. I love coming here every year and admiring the great work and history of art. Came here with my bf and enjoyed a few hours here with the rest of Chicago. I love the gift store and enjoyed the new wing and love daydreaming here always....ahhh nice moments! Support your local Â museums and small businesses, they make up this great city.
