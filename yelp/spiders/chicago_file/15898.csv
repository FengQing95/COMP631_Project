Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friends all said eat here, so I did.  We made reservations for 5:30 and we were seated promptly.  Good thing we got there at that time, because by 6 it was pretty packed.  We all started out with the Malnati Salad, which is AMAZING!  If you go here, definitely get that salad.  The dressing was just right, a little tangy, a little sweet and the bacon bits gave it a little more crunch.
