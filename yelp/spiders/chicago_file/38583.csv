Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I also had the steak frites and the bearnaise was wonderful.  The steak itself was not my favorite (I think it could have been better seasoned) but the meal on the whole was still successful.  The elote style corn was another winner: seriously what is in those sauces?!?  I didn't leave room for dessert, but I sampled some of the whiskey ice cream and it had a very interesting taste.  I'd come back to try some of the non-steak options.
