Little Goat Diner////Met a friend here for lunch at 12:30 and we were prepared for the 30 minute wait for a table.  No problem there.  After being seated we were given menus, and ordered our drinks.  The nice server came back and took our order after about 5 minutes, and my friend's order for a craft beer.  Fifteen minutes after that the server returned with the info that they were out of the beer, would she care for another choice?  After some discussion she ordered an alternate choice, and we mentioned that we were plenty hungry.  About 10 minutes later he arrived with her beer and a refill on the iced tea -- now a half hour has passed since we ordered two sandwiches.  a little more than 10 minutes after that we received our sandwiches.  I get the wait to be seated, but I don't understand a 40+ minute wait for food after ordering.
