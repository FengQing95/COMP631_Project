Little Goat Diner////Came here for a breakfast meeting with a colleague - repeat visit for him, first experience for me.   We had a veggie omelette and corned beef hash which was dyanamo, aside from the smaller portion sizes.  Washed down with some freshly squeezed OJ, it's like the breakfast of champions.
