Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Can Sodikoff do any wrong? I first fell in love with Gilt Bar, then Au Cheval, and now Bavette's. The decor is awesome. Classy and traditional. Lots of wood and large chandeliers. But the real winner is the food. I ordered the rib eye and it was excellent. The bernaise sauce on the side was a nice touch. The good cocktail selection helps and I'm looking forward to trying one of these seafood specials.
