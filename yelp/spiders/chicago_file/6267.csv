The Purple Pig////For dessert we opted for their popular "Sicilian Iris." I will admit by dessert time, we were already stuffed, and whenever we're completely full we skip dessert. But since it was our anniversary and since it's the Purple Pig, we had to try a little bit of everything. The Sicilian iris, was tasty. It came warm and the fried ball was huge. It came stuffed ricotta, and chocolate chip. It reminded me of a warm gooey ball version of a cannoli. I wouldn't mind ordering this again.
