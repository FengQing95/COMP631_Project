Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////OMG!!! Failed at words.... this is the most amazing steakhouse EVER!! We are in town for a concert and rushed out to make our reservation, walked 3 miles to gran a cab and barely made it on time. Blisters and all totally worth it. We arrived at 10:45 and were still greeted and seated (which is not at all common). The place is amazing, very cozy and fun.
