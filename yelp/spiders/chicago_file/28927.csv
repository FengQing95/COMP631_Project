Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ok.  Not my style of pizza.  We're in Chi town.   Gotta go to Lou's.  Service was fine.  Pizza by design takes a while to cook so no surprise on the wait. House salad to start was terrific and huge.  The whole fam got to try it. Italian beef sandwich good not great.   Roll a bit dry.  Meat same. Au Jus on the side. Should be moist and juicy just pulled from the pot.  Soooo.  Since 1969 they have been serving pizza. Must be doing something right for the tough Chicago market.  Take one set of ingredients for a pie.   Make 'em into 4 Jersey thin crusts and you got me.  Just kidding..ish Chicago.
