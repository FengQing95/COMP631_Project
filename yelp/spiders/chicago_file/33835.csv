Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is my very favorite restaurant in Chicago.  I looked forward to an annual Christmas dinner with  3 friends last night, and Bavette's did not disappoint.  The wait person was knowledgable, attentive...but wasn't intrusive.  I ordered the bone-in filet and it was done a little too well.  The waiter insisted on replacing it even though I said it was fine.  The replacement was perfect.  Best steak in town!  Really love the atmosphere, great service, and food.  Wish I could eat here every night.
