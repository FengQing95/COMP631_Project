The Purple Pig////I ordered the whipped chickpea, mushroom 3 way and the mushroom agnolotti, as well as the butternut squash creme brûlée.  The whipped chickpea (6/10)  is just a fancy way of saying hummus but they added parmesan and rosemary.  It was good, not great, but good.  The mushroom 3 way (9/10) was very good and I really enjoyed it.  The mushroom agnolotti (12/10) was the star though and was one of the best pasta dishes I've had.  The stuffing tasted like a creamy mushroom soup, the agnolotti was cooked perfectly and the sauce was the perfect match.  I would definitely recommend it, especially if you like mushrooms.  The dessert (6.5/10) was also good but not what I expected.  When i read creme brûlée, I assumed it would have a sugar coating on the top that has been caramelized.  This was not the case.  The condensed milk gelato was interesting and it kind of tasted like a sweetened labneh - popular in Levant/Middle Eastern cuisine.  I would recommend you to try it if you aren't expecting a brûlée but nonetheless enjoy these flavors.
