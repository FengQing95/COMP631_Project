Smoque BBQ////Came here with Kevin N. to satisfy my inner white/southern girl (as he would call it). We had the sliced beef brisket, pulled pork, rib combo (St. Louis and Baby Back) with slaw, mac and cheese, baked beans, and cornbread. While I can't say this is the best bbq I've ever tasted, it did the job. The beef brisket was very tender and juicy and the ribs fell off the bones, just the way I like it. The bbq sauces were delicious and gave the meats that extra umph it needed. The baked beans is a must. On a week night, it took about 30-40 minutes for us to order and get a table.
