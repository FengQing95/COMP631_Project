Art Institute of Chicago////A wonderful art installation featuring some of the world's best art. I really enjoyed all aspects of the Institute, including the Asian art, Marc Chagall windows and impressionist wing. The layout flows nicely and it isn't hard to follow. There is a lot of help throughout the Institute for directions. One of the nice things was that they allowed you to take pictures (no flash) of the art, which allowed me to document my favorites. Please know that Wifi isn't easily available throughout the Institute, so using an IPAD would be considered somewhat challenged.
