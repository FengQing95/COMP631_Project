Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Roasted Chicken- Both the server and hostess recommended the chicken so my coworker decided to try it, and she couldn't stop raving about it.  I had a bite, and normally I think chicken is just whatever but I have to say that this was probably the most delicious chicken I've ever tasted. It was moist, tender and flavorful, it was the chicken equivalent of my steak!
