Little Goat Diner////I'm pretty sure I could eat anything off of this menu and think I died and went to heaven. Then, to do so, and be in the presence of such great music (often old school hip hop), makes me want to eat every meal here. The kicker? The place has a great design. I always feel like I'm somewhere fancy, but VERY comfy, if that makes sense. I feel like that's a rarity. I love you, Little Goat, for your wonderful atmosphere, tunes, and of course, your delicious dishes.
