Smoque BBQ////Smoque in my personal opinion is by far the best BBQ in Chicago. Local's love it, and so they should. Offers an amazingly proportionated meal with some of the most hearty, filling, but not over the top food. I loved the peach cobbler. Went there on an afternoon adventure to walk away dying to return.
