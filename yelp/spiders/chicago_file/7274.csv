Art Institute of Chicago////    Why?. Is it to pay for the new and expensive "modern wing" (which I usually try to avoid when I visit), or  because the Art Institute lost gobs of money in an investment scam in 2002? Or maybe the effects of the recession in 2006? I would imagine there are still wealthy donors out there who can easily part with a few hundred thou without flinching -- can't the Museum knock on those doors?
