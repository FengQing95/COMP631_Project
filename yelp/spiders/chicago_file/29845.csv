Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pie was a medium pepperoni mushroom with black olives in 1/2.  They had specialty pies too but we kept it basic.  Something about this pie- the sauce? The crust?  Amazing.  Crust is buttery and light, not very chewy.  And the whole pie had a very subtle undertone of...wine?  I think it was the yeast in the crust?  Their menu specifically states "no alcohol" in the pizza, which tells me they have been asked about it before.  In any case - this pie is a winner.
