Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered the classic red sangria and it was tasty. Good amount of fruit. Too much ice. I wish restaurants would stop putting too much ice in pitchers. Just give me the pitcher with little ice and 3/4 full rather than "filling up" the pitcher with all the ice. The ice waters down the drink.
