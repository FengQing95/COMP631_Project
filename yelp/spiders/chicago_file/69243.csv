Little Goat Diner////My gf and I stopped down to this west loop treasure for a late brunch. We waited about 45 minutes around 2:00pm this past Saturday and found the wait to be well worth it. The service was great and we shared the reuben (which was one of, if not the best one I have ever had) the tempura mashed potatoes (awesome) and the highlight, for me at least, the bulls-eye french toast... price was much less expensive for the amount of food we ate (in addition to the yummy drinks we ordered) and is a place I will be going to often.
