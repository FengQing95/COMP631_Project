Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The food is GOOD here. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was due to the dirty dish rag smell I sensed when I first walked in. I sat at the bar and spoke with the waiter for suggestions. He explained their specialities and suggestions based on our preference (which he inquired about). Â My friend and I ordered two buttery deep dish personal pizzas with different veggies, both very very tasty. For an appetizer we ordered the spinach bread...it was AMAZING! Since I am in Chicago celebrating my bday, David surprised me with their homemade ice cream and warmed chocolate cookie. Overall wonderfully pleasant experience!
