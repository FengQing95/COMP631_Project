Smoque BBQ////As any fat guy does, I have a principled approach to BBQ.  My ingrained religious belief regarding this most American of food crafts is as follows.  You have 3 sorts of BBQ joints.  The first and most common is where the establishment focuses solely on the quality of the meat/sauces.  This is no doubt one of the most important qualities in what constitutes good BBQ, but it doesn't equate to a holistic approach to what makes this a 5 start restaurant.  The second type has amazing side options, think fires, corn bread, collard greens, etc; but their sauces are lack luster and their ribs are often boiled.  I appreciate the attention to the lesser details here, but you can't ignore the meats.  The final and rarest of the three is the BBQ joints that Smoque finds it self in.  They have solid ribs, a good variety of sauces, and sides so good you'll continue eating long after the meat sweats have set in.  Smoque has, in my husky opinion, mastered the trifecta tasty.  I don't like going to Smoque often only because I always eat to the point where I hate myself.  The portions are so healthy they will ensure you won't be.  The sides are so delectable; you'll find yourself sneaking some off your friend's tray.  But the meats, oh the meats, are all simply amazing.  My entire review is about why Smoque is so unique being in this 3rd tier of BBQ establishments.
