Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We continue on our touristy ways, standing on The Ledge at the Willis Tower and after coming down to earth from those heights, we made a route correction on the way back to our hotel to stop at Lou Malnati's.  Neither of us cared for Gino's crust and thought that if that was great deep dish crust, then we aren't deep dish people.
