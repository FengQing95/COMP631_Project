The Purple Pig////After reading all the reviews about the terrible waiting time, we (a group of six) came to the Purple Pig at 11 am on the Saturday of the labor day weekend (the restaurant opens at 11:30 am). Surprisingly, the line was OK and there were only 10+ people in front of us. We were able to get seated in the first round of seat assignments right after opening.
