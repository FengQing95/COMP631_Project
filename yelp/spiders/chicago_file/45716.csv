Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here before a few random times when I first moved to the city. I can't remember those times too well, mostly because I was with people I didn't know very well -- or people whom I no longer talk to -- trying to be social but instead getting drunk off sangria on the patio and having a typical summer weekend day.
