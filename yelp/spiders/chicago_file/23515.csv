Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So after visiting you yesterday and eating deep dish pizza for the first time, I had to get some frozen pies to take back home. It was delicious!! I was so excited to take them home to my husband. However, lo and behold, I was being patted down at the airport. My frozen pies tested positive for explosives!! They had to scan my pies and had me open one in front of explosives specialists. I was so scared they were going to take my deep dish pizza from me! I almost missed my flight back to New York but it was all worth it, Lou Malnati's! Thank you!!
