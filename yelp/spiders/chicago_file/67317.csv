Little Goat Diner////I've been dying to go here especially since I've been to The Girl and the Goat twice already. Their menu is awesome, and needless to say, the food is awesome! Their cheesy hashbrowns are probably the best I've ever had. What I loved most about my first visit was the staff. They really go above and beyond for their customers, more than your typical diner. Can't wait to come back!
