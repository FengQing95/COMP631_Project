Little Goat Diner////I went to this restaurant for a dinner. Probably it's better to go this place for a branch or a lunch!? I didn't have awesome experience there to be honest. It was ok. The atomposher was great as the interiors are pretty modern and fashionable. This is a pretty popular place in West Loop I know that that's why I tried it. I will try going this place again as I might get different impression of Little Goat. Thanks!
