Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Everything is good! You can't go wrong with this place. I usually order the Caesar salad and the garden deep dish pizza- both are amazing. Their deep dish pizza is loaded with cheese and toppings, and not too much sauce. The crust is buttery and crunchy! Couldn't ask for a better deep dish! I always grab dinner here whenever I am in the city! No reservations, but you can order your pizza while you wait and it will be ready fairly soon after you are seated!
