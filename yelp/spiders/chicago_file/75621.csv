Little Goat Diner////We had the sweet kitchen space to ourselves and were greeted with smiles and snacks.  I wanted to scoop the crab dip into my purse for later.  I'm like a tacky grandma in that way.  We tried a ton of family style menu items, the highlight of which was the goat leg.  If you're doing an event there, it is well worth adding.  Everything we tried was great and the cocktails were also fabulous.
