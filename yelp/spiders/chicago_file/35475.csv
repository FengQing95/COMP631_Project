Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Speaking of dinner, we started with the smoked trout Caesar salad, which was absolutely delicious.  The rich garlicky taste of the Caesar dressing was just punched up with that smoky fish.  We also had the shrimp DeJonge, a garlic shrimp dish with a luxuriously rich sauce that we couldn't stop mopping up with the accompanying toast.
