Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Today is a sad day. I have raved for years about Lou Malnatti's. I brought some colleagues to the Wells St location and was SO upset at the quality of the food! We waited for an hour for a pizza that had a HARD crust! I know all the Lou fans can't believe it. Now I have to go somewhere else to redeem Chicago Pizza for this crowd. I told you today is a sad day!!
