Little Goat Diner////Absolutely phenomenal brunch! Been here a few times and it's almost shocking how good it is. Split the okonomyaki and Los Drowned sandwich. The flavors, creativity, and taste - WOW! Both are MUST haves. If I had to pick I'd go with the sandwich but it's so close. Chef Izard and her team are food geniuses. Also, great service as always
