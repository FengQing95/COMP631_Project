Smoque BBQ////We ordered the chicken, ribs, and brisket. The chicken and ribs were wonderful, and the brisket was absolutely amazing. It was even better than mine! The sauces truly complemented each dish. The sides we ordered were all terrific, the mac 'n cheese, brisket chili, corn bread, and fries. Cole slaw comes with every entr√©e. The desserts are to die for, especially the bread pudding. It was worth every calorie!
