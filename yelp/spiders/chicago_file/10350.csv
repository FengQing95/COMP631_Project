Art Institute of Chicago////The modern wing is nice, but I've never been a fan of modern art, and depending on when you go, there doesn't seem to be much on display in this wing. Whenever I come to the Art Institute, I'm immediately attracted to two particular sections. One of them is the impressive collection of impressionist paintings. My French teacher in high school made us study all the impressionist painters and give presentations on them. So I can spot a Degas, a Renoir, a Manet or Monet from a mile away.
