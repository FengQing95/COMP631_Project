Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is our first time at Bavette's and we will be back! We had reservation made and we got seated by the door. We asked them to move us somewhere else (more private), and they were happy to do so. Our waiter was nice and very knowledgeable about the menu. He recommended the crab cakes which was aaaamazing! I had the original ribeye and my husband got the filet. We also had the truffle Mac and cheese and it was so good. Everything about the place was great and I highly recommend it. Do make reservations though.
