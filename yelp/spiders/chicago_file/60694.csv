Smoque BBQ////Free drink refills are a plus. Service is pretty quick for sandwich orders, but I found myself waiting the longest, since the brisket platter orders seem to take the longest to prepare. Still, the orders keep coming and the crew looks very efficient. I would definitely recommend this place to others.
