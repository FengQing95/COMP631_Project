Little Goat Diner////4 stars for the good looking people at this place. The decor and layout are nice. Service is spectacular. The menu is a bit limited and extreme at the same time. The food is really good but I have decided that it has TOO MUCH flavor. I know it sounds weird but while the dishes are creative they taste a little too rich. Dial it down a notch so I can continue to enjoy the ambiance and a couple of drinks..
