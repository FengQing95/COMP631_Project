Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Between the two of us, we ordered and shared the peppered duck and goat cheese terrine, short rib stroganoff, and 22 ounce bone-in dry aged rib-eye. The only "complaint" I have is that there was so much goodness to choose from, but so little stomach capacity to handle it all.
