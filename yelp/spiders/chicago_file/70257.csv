Little Goat Diner////Second visit I got the brandade and belly (so good. I wanted to get it my third visit but I thought I'd try something new) and third was the kimchi bacon pancake asian tasty thingy (literally what it's called). Both were amazing. I also got the ooey gooey cinnamon bun (they don't lie...it really is ooey and gooey).
