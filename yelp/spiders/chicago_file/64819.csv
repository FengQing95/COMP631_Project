Smoque BBQ////Smoque is one of those places that I would avoid during prime time and go during an off hour - the space is small and it gets packed!  I grabbed late lunch here a couple times and my order took about 20 minutes - very efficient and friendly service.  I tried the brisket and pulled pork sandwich combos with slaw and mac and cheese on the side.
