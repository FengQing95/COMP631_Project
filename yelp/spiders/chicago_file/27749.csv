Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So the wait wasn't too bad although we got there early-ish. We waited about 15 minutes but soon after, the wait time was around an hour plus. Then when we sat down, the waitress told us that the pizza would take half an hour to make after we ordered. It took 45 minutes for the pizza to come out and it wasn't hot! Tisk tisk tisk!! I would expect it piping hot if it's made to order... out of the oven and served immediately. That was a bit of a disappointment bc the cheese held together and wasn't melting as expected.
