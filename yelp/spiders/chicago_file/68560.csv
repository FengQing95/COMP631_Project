Little Goat Diner////Went for brunch on a Sunday, about a 45 min wait. Worth the wait - the food was pretty great. The cinnamon roll was covered in icing and nice and soft. The blueberry pancakes seemed to be chock full of fresh blueberries and came w/chunks of streusel topping and cream cheese butter (wow!). The french toast on an egg w/strawberries, chicken tenders, and maple syrup were a bit too many flavors for me, but good in certain combinations.
