Smoque BBQ////I'm not a huge BBQ lover, but I like this place a LOT and get regular cravings. The ribs are really good - their Baby Back ribs are tastier than the St. Louis, but the St. Louis has more meat (so more bang for your buck). They both have an amazing smoky flavor that I love, the sauce is tangy good, but the meat is not as tender and juicy as I would expect. The Macaroni&Cheese side is creamy n'delicious and I think the Peach Cobbler is the only dessert they have, but it's the only one you need, it's so good!
