Smoque BBQ////For years, Chicago was a place where decent bbq could be had at a reasonable price.   I remember  when places like "Leon's," "Curt's" and "J&B's" were affordable treats that my parents and I used to look forward to.  Sadly, times changed and before long, prices went up and quality went down.  For years now, I'd considered Chicago, where I was born and raised a place where BBQ could only be purchased from almost upscale places (Carson's), or from places that have bullet proof glass (Alice's, Barbara Ann's).
