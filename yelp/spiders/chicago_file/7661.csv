Art Institute of Chicago////First time visiting the museum and I loved it.  Sadly, I didn't have enough time to see everything before my train but I'm not the type of person that needs to take a lot of time in museums.  The modern wing is fantastic!  I was there for the Steve McQueen exhibit which was great but, again, I wish I had more time to enjoy it and see all of the films in their entirety.
