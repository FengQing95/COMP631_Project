Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It wasn't for me! I don't quite understand the overwhelming popularity with this spot. I haven't explored a lot of the tapas experience in Chicago yet, but hopefully this isn't considered the best option. For folks from Miami or even New York -- don't bother with the wait. I think this place is a good bar spot to meet up with friends, but I would never recommend it for it's food. The alb√≥ndigas were very disappointing; the sauce and texture seemed totally off. I wasn't expecting authenticity here, but I would have hoped at least decent execution. Even el pan con tomate was a shame and that's pretty basic tapas.
