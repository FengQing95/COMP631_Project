Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Was a huge fan until I found that they disabled the "get in line" option on the NoWait app. I don't understand why they have this app if they are not going to enable this feature. When I called they were clueless. No breakfast is worth a 90 minute wait in the cold rain. Â It's a shame because the food was good.
