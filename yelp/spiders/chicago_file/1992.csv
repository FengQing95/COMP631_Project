Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////AMAZING food!!! Had the Chorizo Eggs Benedict and the Cinnamon Toast Crunch French Toast and both were to die for!!! Too much food but I ate every last bite and then had to walk back to my hotel!! LOL!! I've recommended this place to every one I know who visits Chicago and they are all beyond pleased!! The place gets very packed and rightly so. Get there early!! Will make sure we go back every time we visit the Windy City.
