Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Just got back from Chicago for vacation--from New Orleans, so we know good food.  This was the best meal we had on our entire trip.  My husband and I shared 5 tapas, and the bill was $35.  We were stuffed--paella (could pass next time), ham croquettas (wonderful!), goat cheese and tomato sauce (the best!!), filet w/ horseradish sauce (outstanding!), and spicy potatoes.  We recommend this restaurant to all!
