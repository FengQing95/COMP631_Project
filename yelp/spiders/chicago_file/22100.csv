Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was our second night of deep dish pizza in Chicago.  We decided to try it to compare to the previous night's option as these were the 2 places everyone kept mentioning to us before our trip.  My husband liked it better than the other well known pizza spot in town.  The kids and I did not.  It was not worth how long we had to wait for a table.  Our server was great though!
