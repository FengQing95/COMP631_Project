Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Mmmmm my mouth salivates every time I think of the bone-in rib eye from Bavette's. Too bad it only comes in a 24 oz portion so you'd have to either convince someone to share with you, take the leftovers home (which I don't like to do), or be a competitive eater with the capability of finishing the whole thing. Sometimes, I wish I had four stomachs like a cow so I can eat the many yummy things from the menu. Wait no, that would be cannibalism opps!!
