Smoque BBQ////great bbq. We drove there to get togo food, thinking we would check out the place while we waited.  Line out the door at 4pm on a sunday, so I tried calling in the food since I knew what we wanted.  We were quoted a 1hr 50 min wait time, even after I told her I was outside the building.  Line took about 30 mins and we were on our way.  Well worth the wait.
