Little Goat Diner////Very nice breakfast place!  It uses a Korean spin on many popular breakfast options for amazing flavors that aren't usually found at breakfast time.  The service as always been great when I've had breakfast at Little Goat, but a longer line can develop on the weekends, so I'd advise that diners get there before 9AM if they'd like to experience this West Loop treat with a minimal wait time.
