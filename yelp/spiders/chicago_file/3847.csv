The Purple Pig////If you like pork and meat, then this restaurant is the place for you. Everything we tried was delicious and flavorful but it does verge on being too salty at certain bites. I wouldn't wait two hours for here but I would come back again at around the same time at night when the wait is way shorter and it is less crowded. I imagine that the wait is this long probably because people are spending a whole hour to finish up their bottle of wine.
