Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here on a Thursday night for dinner.  We ordered the Spanish Ceasar Salads, Papas Alioli and the Butcher's Paella.  It was all very good.  The service was perfect and our waiter even brought us out a complimentary dessert even though we told him we were full! The music was great-a mix of Bandoleros and Ojos de Brujo.  Can't go wrong with music like that!
