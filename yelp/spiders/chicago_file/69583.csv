Little Goat Diner////Delicious ! The wait staff was very friendly. The men in the bakery were helpful answering questions about the types of bread available. Bought Peter Piper and a jar of pickled peppers! So glad I did, because I toasted the bread this am and had a fried farm fresh egg and a side of the pickled peppers and it was just a perfect extension of yesterday's visit there! I ordered the Asian shrimp salad. It was very good. It was basically a lot of coleslaw with flavorful shrimp on it. I want the try the noodle wrapped shrimp next time! Will go back.
