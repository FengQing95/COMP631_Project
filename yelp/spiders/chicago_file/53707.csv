Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm addicted to this place! I love the atmosphere and their sangria is the best I've had at a restaurant. It is strong and delicious - not watered down wine with copious simple syrup (sadly the case for so many Spanish places). The garlic shrimp is my favorite, but I also love the bacon wrapped dates and the paella is also worth trying! One of my favorite spots to visit in Chicago!
