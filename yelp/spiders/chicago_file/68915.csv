Little Goat Diner////The Los Drowned sandwich was also great, but it had a lot of flavors going on and I'm not sure they were ALL necessary. Could have done without either the pickles or the slaw but I'm also not a huge fan of either of those normally. The meat on it was awesome though - much better than what's normally on a french dip!
