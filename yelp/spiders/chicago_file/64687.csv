Smoque BBQ////Best BBQ in the city. I was so happy when this spot opened up in the area, since there weren't that many restaurant options when I was growing up there! Their pulled pork is delicious and the mac & cheese is UNREAL! Love the crumbles on top. Cornbread is good as well. I like the vinegary BBQ sauce, I can always dig a vinegar flavor! The staff is super friendly. I would suggest calling to order ahead for pick up during the dinner time rush!
