Little Goat Diner////I don't get the hype.  The best part of our meal was the cinnamon bun.  That was good.  I had the burrito - beware it is not a burrito at all. Rather a quesadilla with a friend egg in the center.  Meh.  Not very exciting.  Our server was completely standoffish and rude when we asked questions.  The space was good.  It seems like all of the positive reviews are around lunch & dinner.  I would skip the entire breakfast menu; or the restaurant entirely.  I don't need to wait 45 minutes for mediocre food and crappy service.
