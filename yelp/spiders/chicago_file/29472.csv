Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Glad I was able to finally check out Lou Malnati's Famous deep dish, boy was it scrumptious. Came on a Thursday and it was really packed, waited about 35 mins and was seated and greeted by our server. Server was very busy with the crowds that swarm in at all times, as I was told they are always busy. Â Ambiance is nice and resembles your typical Pizzeria, this place was packed so people watching at that point. We were really starving so decided to order a family salad to hold us over before the Big Kahuna of Deep Dish was to be brought out.
