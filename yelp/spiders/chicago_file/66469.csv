Little Goat Diner////We arrived for lunch around 11:45 and we just beat the big rush. Because we were willing to sit at the community table we got a seat right away. The interior of this place is absolutely gorgeous. It's an eclectic mix of muted, retro colors with modern furnishings, ornated patterns, mid century elements and natural materials. It's SO bright and airy, just perfect for even a dreary day in the city.
