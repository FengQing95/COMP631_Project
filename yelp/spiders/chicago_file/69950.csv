Little Goat Diner////So between the two, 4.5 stars?  Love the coffee bar!  Great add to the West Loop with  Intelligentsia Coffee and expresso drinks and delicious scones that taste super fresh. On the fence on the bagels - the schmear is inventive and exceptional but the bagel is a little smaller and flatter than I was looking for.
