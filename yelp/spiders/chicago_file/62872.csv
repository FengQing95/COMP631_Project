Smoque BBQ////I was just checking out my Yelps and realized I haven't Yelped any of my Chicago favorites. Smoque is way way up there. When I lived in Chicago I would drive an hour to get some Smoque BBQ. I always said it was 15 minutes because everything in Chicago is 15 minutes away. I dragged everyone there I could and it was always a hit.
