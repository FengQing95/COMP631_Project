Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Adam and I ordered "The Malnati Chicago Classic" and we were so beyond happy with what we got. Since it is a deep dish pizza it does take a little longer to make but the wait to get or food wasn't too bad and in the end we were so full and had so much left over that it was worth it. The sausage on it was perfect. I loved that it covered the entire pizza and not just crumbled around the pizza, it ensured we got a good amount of sausage in every bite. Also, the sauce wasn't over-powering and there was a perfect amount of cheese. The crust was softer but not chewy and it wasn't too crispy. It was literally perfect.
