Little Goat Diner////So many goats on this strip close to the Fulton market foodie area of Chicago and knowing that Girl and the Goat would be a "no-goat" (sorry), we settled for their "diner" offering across the street of the above name.  We waited at the adjoining bar which serves up excellent cocktails and specialty sodas which my 11 year old really enjoyed.  I ordered their craft Manhattan and it was a solid effort, and so too was wifey's gin cucumber lime something or other..... I just call these drinks her "spa treatment" to which she had two!!
