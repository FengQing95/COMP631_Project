Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time being in Chicago, locals say I need to try their signature deep dish pizza at Gino's or Lou Malnati's. I chose Lou's since I was in the neighborhood... btw why doesn't Chicago just have their streets in alphabetical order?!? hahaha But Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza was pretty good. Â Our server 'nikki' looked literally like katherine heigl haha friendly and courtesy! If i'm ever back in chi-town again definitely will be a place I'd want to come eat again!
