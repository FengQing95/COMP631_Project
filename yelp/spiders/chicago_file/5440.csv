The Purple Pig////This restaurant was very close to the hotel I was staying, so I decided to check it out. I was not particularly hungry but still went because we were seated immediately on a busy night and shared the Milk Braised Berkshire Pork Shoulder. It was alright and fails to meet the expectations of all the reviews raving about this dish. Sure, it was marinated decently, but it was nowhere near "melting" or "tender". There were rough patches and pieces that were particularly dry. For a signature dish, I was really expecting much more, especially considering the above average price point.
