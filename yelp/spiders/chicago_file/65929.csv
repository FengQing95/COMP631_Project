Smoque BBQ////Food came out pretty quick. Everything smelled so delicious. Their brisket was juicy and melted like butter in your mouth. I was able to break it up with my fork but also kept breaking apart when I would try to pick it up. Dont be fooled by the burnt char on the outside of the brisket. You cant taste the bitterness of it. I am very skeptical when it comes to burnt food cause I hate the bitter taste but it was so good. Their bbq beans were sweet yet you taste that bbq char taste. Their slaw was crisp and had a great fresh crunch to them. Their slaw sauce is more tangy than usual slaw which is sweet but it's still good. Their mac n cheese was also great. It came out hot and baked with panko or crouton crust that was sprinkled on top. It kind of tasted dry to me but i like my mac n cheese very goopey and stringing with cheese.
