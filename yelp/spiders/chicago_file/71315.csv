Little Goat Diner////Went on a date here a few months back during a weekday for brunch when I took a vacation day.  There was no wait but it was busy.  I tried the Bull's Eye French Toast. It was aight. Lol.  Unique, but not to die for.  The hashbrowns with cheese were good.  The cheese is a strong-flavored white cheese though, fyi.
