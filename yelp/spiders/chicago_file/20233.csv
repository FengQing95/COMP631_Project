Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Not quite as traditional as the standard sausage/cheese variety of deep dish, this glorious pile of cheese and veggies topped with a hearty tomato sauce was quite excellent with a great juxtaposition of buttery, creamy, savory, sweet, and crunchy.  While the sauce wasn't quite as impressive as Art's, the use of multiple cheeses added a lot of nuance to the dish and really set it apart from "other" Chicago Pizzas - the whole tomatoes and garlicky mushrooms were also excellent and I particularly loved the butter crust as it was crisp on bite but gave way to the teeth and nearly melted in the mouth.   While the menu stated a "medium" would be enough for 3, the heft of this pie made that a challenge that took some time to complete - with myself doing most of the legwork.
