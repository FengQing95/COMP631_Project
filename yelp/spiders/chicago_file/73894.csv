Little Goat Diner////I got the Bullseye French Toast both times I went. Basically, you have fried chicken, French toast, strawberries, and (the best part) eggs Are actually cooked into the pieces of French toast. I was blown away by this seemingly simple yet elegant combination. Obviously eggs and French toast taste very well together, and it had good texture and consistency. It's pretty heavy, and therefore rather filling.
