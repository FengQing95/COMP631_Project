Art Institute of Chicago////Don't tell anyone, but I have some snapshots of famous paintings here. I took them when I was 12. With my brownie camera. When one could do stuff like that. Well, since that time. I have been to the Institute many, many times, for permanent exhibits, special ones, lunch in the garden in summer, or brown bag lunch in the corner parks outside. I returned recently to take advantage of the free month-long January admission, which is seven times better than the year round Thursday evening free admission. But mon dieu, anytime you can get in this place for nothing, it's a wonderful day. First time I'd seen the modern wing, and that was so airy and impressive and fun to explore. Â We didn't have time to visit all the exhibits, but it was wonderful to see the place packed with visitors of all ages, and families. I still send the out-of-towners to this little stretch of Michigan ave. for the Art Institute, Chicago Architecture Foundation, The Chicago Cultural Center, and Millenium Park. What better orientation to our city could you find?
