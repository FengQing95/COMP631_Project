Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One member of our party ordered steak, which was perfect once again. This time we also got the fried chicken, which is surprisingly great! The best fried chicken I've had for sure. We also branched out with mashed potatoes this trip, which were fantastic. Every part of the meal was delicious, from the bread to the steak. I also opted for a cocktail this time, and had the French 75, which is am amazing gin drink.
