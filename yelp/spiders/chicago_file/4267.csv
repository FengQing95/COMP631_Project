The Purple Pig////I was visiting Chicago from Baltimore with a couple that lives in the city and they asked if I was willing to try something totally new this trip. Well, definitely totally new. The aesthetic of the restaurant was far from what I thought it was going to be. I honestly thought it was going to be finer dinning sit down restaurant with the small votive candle lit on the table for you and your spouse. I was wrong. It's really more of a gathering. The restaurant is kind of set up in three ways: couples (one-on-one) seating, bar seating, and large high top group seating. The three of us were escorted to the high top group seating. We awkwardly sat close to another group but that turned our social fun into happy hour with the other group from out of town. We made friends through The Purple Pig! Â
