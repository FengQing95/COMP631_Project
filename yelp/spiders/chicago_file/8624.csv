Art Institute of Chicago////The beautiful thing about this little secret garden is that it's not secret at all. It's right on Michigan Avenue. The key is that you step down into it, which removes you from the plane of the sidewalk. Honey locusts (a favorite of Chicago local hero Alfred Caldwell of the Lincoln Park Lilly Pool fame) form a canopy above you- their tiny leaves allowing for sunlight to dapple down onto the crunchy paths. The huge planters that the honey locusts are planted in make for little seating areas, eliminating the need for unnecessary benches. The crowning glory of this little garden is the water feature towards the back of the garden. The splashing of the water, the crunch of the gravel, and the soft canopy overhead almost completely eliminate any sounds from Michigan Avenue - save for the occassional ambulance.
