The Purple Pig////Because we had heard such good things about this place, we wanted to try a lot of the different options. We went for broke trying to explore the menu. We started with the crispy pig ears. This dish was fine, but came with completely too many pickled peppers, and it kind of ruined it for me. The fried deviled egg was disappointing -- one egg that didn't have complex flavors for $8... Â (Apparently, The Purple Pig really likes their pickled vegetables, because this dish was full of cornishes, which again ruin this dish for me. I'm fine with some pickling agent on a dish, but they over do it here.) The roasted beets and goat cheese foam was absolutely delicious, and one of my favorite dishes that we had.
