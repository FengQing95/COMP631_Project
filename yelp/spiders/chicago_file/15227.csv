Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is officially the best deep dish pizza I have ever had.  For those of you searching for a rating actually about deep dish, and not somebody just talking about their dislike of it, this is the place.  The wait staff there was very friendly, and I received my appetizer (garlic bread of course) really quickly.
