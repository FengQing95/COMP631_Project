Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had the pleasure of dining here with several friends this past week and we were all blown away by the food, service, and atmosphere. I have been to several tapas restaurants in the Chicago area and have to say that CBBR has one of the most accessible menus, with items that will please both the experienced and novice diner.
