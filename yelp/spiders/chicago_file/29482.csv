Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We spent about $30 total. Sadly I would not recommend coming here or getting any kind of deep dish pizza. I don't regret coming here because deep dish is so famous and kinda a must try but don't come in expecting something amazing. I liked the bruschetta muchhh better and would definitely recommend getting that.
