Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ate at Giordano yesterday and today I went to Lou Malnati's. Lou is so much better than Giordano! You can skip Giordano entirely. I had Bruschetta for appetizer and deep dish pizza Lou with sausage. Now this is what a fresh made pizza should taste like! Tomatoes are fresh and sauce is tomato-y tasty. Cheeses are nice but not overwhelming the whole pizza. The pizza is juicy yet the outer crust is still crunchy. The crust is good but I wouldn't say amazing. There are parts that taste dough-y.
