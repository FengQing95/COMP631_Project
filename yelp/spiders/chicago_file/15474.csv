Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am not clear on the whole Pizzeria UNO Â claims to formula. All I know is that Pizzeria UNO pales in comparison to Lou's pizza. When you go to Chicago you must remember to not listen to the hype about Pizzeria UNO and go to Lou's there everywhere now. Also you can go to Gino's East, or Giodano's. Both have great pizza pies...!
