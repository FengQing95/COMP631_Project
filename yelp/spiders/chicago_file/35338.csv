Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////absolutely phenomenal. from the service, to the ambiance, to EVERYTHING we put in our mouths. absolutely amazing! we ordered the traditional filet mignon, lamb chops, west coast oysters, and a baked sweet potato. as well as an old fashioned and a French 75. nothing disappointed. our waiter also brought us a chocolate cream pie on the house for my boyfriend's birthday. the food/service was worth more than what we paid. definitely recommend.
