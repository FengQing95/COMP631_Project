Smoque BBQ////OK, so I have heard so much about Smoque that I finally got to try it today for lunch since I was working in the area. I had the 1/2 and 1/2 platter with brisket and pulled pork with a side of fries and mac and cheese. The brisket was good but It was not the best I have had. Many people on here did not like the fries. I thought the fries were crispy and good. The mac and cheese was OK but then again I am from a family that has been making REAL MAC AND CHEESE for decades.
