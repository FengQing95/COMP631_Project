Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My boyfriend and I were in Chicago for the weekend. He had never been to the Windy City and we wanted to get out of touristy downtown. I loved coming to this restaurant when I lived in Chicago a few years back. It was as good as ever! We started with the traditional red sangria. The pitcher was large enough for both of us to drink throughout our meal. We had a cheese plate, which had the perfect variety of cheeses for every taste! The stuffed mushrooms weren't very flavorful, so I would not recommend those. One surprise winner was the bacon wrapped dates. I usually do not like bacon, but these were perfectly paired with the dates. Fantastic! Other great tapas included the chicken empanada, and the cheese in tomato sauce. We sat outside under the lights and had a great evening!
