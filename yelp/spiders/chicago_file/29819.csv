Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's was great. My fianc√©e and I had the famous "Lou" pizza option which was scrumptious. It was our first taste of Chicago style Deep Dish Pizza and it did not disappoint! We also had calamari fritti coupled with a tasty dipping sauce that did the trick. We recommend this spot and will visit again whenever we return to Chi-town. Our bartender (forgot his name) was super helpful as well.
