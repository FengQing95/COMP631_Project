The Purple Pig////Amongst my four friends, we ordered the Tom & Jerry steak, the turkey leg confit, and the pork shoulder. We later realized that it was a lot of meat for a late night meal. Everything was really good but because we chose all meat dishes, it did get a bit salty without some vegetables to balance it out.
