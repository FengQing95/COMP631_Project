Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago is a must stop for anyone on their first trip to Chicago. This museum  rival any in Manhattan and there is something for everyone here. I brought a reluctant friend after a very boozy lunch and he was blown away by the diversity and scope or the collections.
