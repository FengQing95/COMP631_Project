Smoque BBQ////This is some of the best BBQ I've ever had. Service was acceptable, food was ready promptly and taste was amazing. We had brisket- soooo tender, baby back ribs- fall-off-the-bone good and charred just right, pulled pork- good but not as amazing as the other two meats, Mac & cheese- perfect!, beans- flavorful and smoky good, fries-1 order is enough for 2 people and cornbread- very good. Cole slaw is served with everything and it was just okay (it's more of a vinegar based and we prefer creamy type). You cannot go wrong at this place!
