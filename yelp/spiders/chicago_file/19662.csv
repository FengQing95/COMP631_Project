Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now that I think of it this place was pretty small, probably as much seating as Pizzeria Uno maybe a little less. The place was quiet most likely because it was 3:45pm when we got there but the service was excellent we were out of there in a little over an hour which was good because we had a plane to catch.
