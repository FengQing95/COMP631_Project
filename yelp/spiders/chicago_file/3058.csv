The Purple Pig////We ordered the Turkey Leg Confit and the Roasted Bone Marrow, and paired our food with sangria. I love that you can tell when a chef puts a lot of thought into the food. Â You can visually see it in the plating of the food, taste it in the flavors, and how it is paired with the drinks.
