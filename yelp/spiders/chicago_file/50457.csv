Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Poor service but excellent food.. Been coming here for 10 years but last night was a major disappointment as far as the service was concerned. The food was excellent as always but part of the dining experience is your waitress and the overall service. Inattentive waitress after she had taken our order. Had to ask for bread twice... Bus boys had to be asked to refill water... And that's after they had passed by our table a few times. Had to track the waitress down to get the check. Â Short of staff or bad training ? I'll let the MOD determine that. Wouldn't return in a hurry based on last night.
