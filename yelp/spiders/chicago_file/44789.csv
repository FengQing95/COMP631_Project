Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We also ordered seafood paella for 4, and it came a little while after we were done with our tapas. The paella was kind of bland and our scallops and shrimp were way too salty. My mom said we should've sent it back, but half of us were already done with our plates, haha. Definitely not the best paella I've had.
