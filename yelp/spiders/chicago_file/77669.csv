Little Goat Diner////We ordered the okonomiyaki which is apparently a Korean street dish much like a savory pancake. Well worth the try. The tonkatsu sandwich was awesome and were you looking for something sweet? The grape pancakes were to die for. Who would have thought that flour and grapes coming together could be so amazing?
