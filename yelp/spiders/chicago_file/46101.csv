Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went out with a group here, I was expecting some sort of 50's diner from the name, to my surprise this was Tapas!   I don't do tapas much so maybe I'm easily impressed but I thought the place was great:  very lively and crowded, good serivice, reasonable prices, and a wide variety of interesting flavorful choices to pass around the table.  I can see how this is a better place for a group just to share a taste of all the different dishes.    I talked everyone else into the bacon wrapped dates but it was a popular item once digested.   Fun place
