Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Huge fan of Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! I really like the paella and all the tapas are really great. I'd say the only downside is that I think the tapas are over priced but still really good. Side note: passionfruit sangria is soo good. I usually ask for ice on the side because it can get watered down! Also the braised short rib - so goood!
