Art Institute of Chicago////The amount of famous artwork located here is unreal. Took me back to all my art history classes. You could easily spend days here but we managed to see all the major pieces we wanted to see in about 3 hours (the museum was not very busy when we went, so that made things easier too). Highly recommend!
