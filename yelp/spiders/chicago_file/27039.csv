Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I love pepperoni, but I was with a friend who keeps kosher. We got mushrooms. I was already skeptical it was going to be boring, but heavens no. It was cheesy goodness. In correct proportions of sauce cheese crust. I can't wait to drag my husband to chicago to get this again, but with pepperoni. My husband and I went last year on Chicago pizza tour (see my precious yelp review). We got to try amazing places, such as pizanos and pequod. I've been to giordano's too. All good but the malnati's take the cake!
