Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////After a delightful little trip to see the in-laws, my beau and I were on our way back to the East Coast and we stopped here for brunch before catching the blue line to O'Hare. We stopped in around 1pm on a Monday and were seated right away at a four person table. Which was a good call on the hostess' part since we both had a little bit of luggage in tow.  After perusing the menu the boy landed on one of the daily specials, The Firehouse Omelet, and I gravitated toward the Rocky Mountain crepe (sans ham). Both entree's arrived in about 10 minutes, a fact that I was pleasantly surprised by. Then again they are really is just eggs and crepe batter, neither of which take very long to cook. The food was great. Hands down, just what we needed after a four hour train ride. The service was great, friendly  and prompt. Perhaps a little too prompt, one eager-as-a-beaver busboy tried to swipe my honey's plate twice before he was actually finished with his omelet. This was something that we found rather amusing, but I van see how others would find that aggravating. All in all good food and nice service, you should check them out if you get the chance.
