Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great ambience. Terrible service. Waiter was hardly around. Â Long waits for ordering and food. Never asked us if we needed anything. Just ran from table to table. Overpriced for the quality of service. Food was okay for something rated so high on Yelp. Don't waste your money.
