The Purple Pig////Our friendly server took our order and the food came in a reasonable time. We ordered the grilled cuttlefish, pork and charred cauliflower. All of the are delicious and impressively flavorful with nice combination of Teton each dish. The cuttlefish was grilled perfectly and the charcoal bread added a nice sweetness to the dish. The Coppa pork was cooked perfectly and greatly seasoned. The shishito peppers, lentil and pomegranate gave a nice flavor and texture to the dish. The cauliflower dish are delicious as well. It's tangy with a hint of charred flavor.
