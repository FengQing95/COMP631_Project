Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is a festive and energetic venue to have a date night or share tapas among friends. The other night a group of ten of us got together to celebrate successfully completing marathons; while OK eight of us completed marathons - one in the group had a good excuse (she was eight and three quarter months pregnant) and one not so good (I am too lazy to train for a marathon, so settled for a half).
