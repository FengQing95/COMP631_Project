Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What exactly can you not brag about in this place??  The only other thing I wanted to do when I came to Chicago, other than go to my concert, was eat Chicago style deep dish and this place seriously delivered.  It really was a no-brainer since it's advertised so many times on Food Network shows, etc. on where to eat in Chicago so I was a bit worried about the touristy feel of the place.  No problem.  It may be where the tourists go, but it was also quite obvious that it's also where the locals go.
