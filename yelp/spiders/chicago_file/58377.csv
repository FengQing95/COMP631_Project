Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don't worry, there's a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.
