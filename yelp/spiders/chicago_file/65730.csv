Smoque BBQ////I worked with Smoque to cater a backyard rehearsal dinner and was so pleased with their food and service!  Peggy, our catering representative, was always responsive and knowledgable with my many questions.  We ended up over-ordering (it's a bad day when you run out of bbq) and really should've gone with Peggy's numbers, so definitely trust their recommendation.
