Little Goat Diner////Everybody's dish looked pretty good as I got the Biscuits & Gravy along with a side of chicken tenders (Nick M decided to share "plates" with me). The chicken tenders were very crispy and delicious, but the biscuits & gravy definitely hit the spot. The gravy was very tasty and rich as the biscuits were quite fluffy while covered in creamy goodness. Eventhough there are other goodies on the menu, I would love to get this again. The bloody mary is pretty decent as well.
