The Purple Pig////Butternut squash soup: I don't know how long this on the menu but I hope it always comes back. Incredible, melted in my mouth, served at a perfect temperature with mozzerella, pine nuts and whatever else. Incredible. I will think about this every day and butternut squash soup will never taste the same.
