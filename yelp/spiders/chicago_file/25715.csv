Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It is shocking to me that a restaurant chain would be so dismissive and rude about a dairy allergy. Every staff member we interacted with were unprofessional and dismissive, and we were absolutely not impressed. They offered us a gift card (we gave it away because we don't live in Chicago) and offered to comp our meal.
