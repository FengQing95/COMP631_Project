Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The crab and avocado salad was a standout--the dressing delicious and the serving size generous enough to share.  The salmon was perfectly cooked--flaky, just a little under-done in the middle with a crispy top.  The roasted chicken was very good, but on the heavy side.  The sweet potato, while seemingly basic, stood out as a favorite side.  The elote was surprisingly in a creamy sauce--very flavorful and while not the light vegetable side we envisioned, it was worth it.  The baked goat cheese was very good but the least stand-out dish.
