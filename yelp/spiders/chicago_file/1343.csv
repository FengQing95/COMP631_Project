Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////When we tried to have lunch on Friday 1/2/15 at about noon, there was an hour and a half wait, which we couldn't do with our four year old at that time. We decided to come back the next morning at an earlier time and were seated right away. The menu was impressive, as were the childrens' offerings. My husband and I ordered the Wildberry Pancakes and a Corned beef skillet and shared both. Everything was amazing in both taste and presentation. Service was excellent and the booth was comfortable. Though the portions were pretty hefty, we all cleaned our plates. By the time we left, the line was forming and the wait was pretty long. I would definitely revisit, and recommend. But arrive early!!
