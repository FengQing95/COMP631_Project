Little Goat Diner////WOW. Ok, I don't know why I don't have photos of them  but the PORK BELLY HOME FRIES. SO. GOOD. I'm salivating right now just thinking about them.  There are so many choices at Little Goat, I'm always struggling to decide if I want to get the same thing I ordered last time (because I came here craving it) or if I should order something else that sounds equally amazing. Also not pictured, but I'm always coming back craving the Bull's Eye French Toast as well.
