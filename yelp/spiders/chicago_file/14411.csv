Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////To their defense, perhaps the personal sized pizza is not their forte. Our office ordered several thin crust pizzas a few days later and that was totally acceptable. I also tried an Italian beef & sausage sandwich here for dinner one of the nights too and did not have any complaints nor praise.(Our office is a block away)
