Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I consulted Yelp for the best Chicago deep dish pizza and Lou Malnati's was the answer. We came here on a Saturday night and it was packed, which was expected. While you wait, you can put in your pizza order, since it takes a while to make, so we did this. When we got seated (about 30 minutes later) our pizza was at our table the same time our beer arrived. We got the traditional Chicago pizza, and it was everything I expected. Definitely worth a visit when in Chicago!
