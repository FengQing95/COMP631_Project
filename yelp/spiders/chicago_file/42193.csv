Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For dessert we had the tres leches cake, the truffle chocolate cake, the butterscotch custard, and the caramel marcona almond tart. My favorite was the caramel marcona almond tart but I have very biased towards caramel, but the caramel was really chewy just the way i like it. My second favorite was the butterscotch custard, but it is a bit on the sweet side but really was extremely butterscotch flavored. The tres leches and truffle chocolate cake were nothing to rave about and I would not order them again.
