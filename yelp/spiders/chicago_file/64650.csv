Smoque BBQ////I have heard about this place through the book "Eat. Shop. Chicago". I have always wanted to go as soon as I read the review. I ended up going for lunch and I was no impressed. I thought it would be amazing, seeing how the line was out the door... but it was very standard BBQ. I am not going to totally knock this place for 2 reasons: it was PACKED, and I did not order their ribs [which i imagine are probably the best thing on the menu]. But the pulled pork sandwich came out and it was just luke warm.. ugh. Â Anyway, worth trying, but get the ribs.. and tell me how they were. haha.
