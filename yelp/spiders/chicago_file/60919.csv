Smoque BBQ////I had the 1/2 slab + chili + cornbread (b/c cornbread is where it's at, dawg).  You can add on to this meat fiesta w/ your choice of pulled pork, brisket or some sausage.  I'm going that route next time.  The slaw was definitely unexpected.  I'm usually "meh" when it comes to slaw but the slaw here was pretty much a B-Side gem.  It's nothing too fancy but the taste really complimented the meal well.
