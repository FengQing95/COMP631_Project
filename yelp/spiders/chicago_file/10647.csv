Art Institute of Chicago////One of the premier museums in the world. A must-see for any visitor to Chicago with remotely any interest in art or artifacts. World-renowned medieval, European, and impressionist collections, together with numerous artifacts, and some oddball collections for good measure. Don't miss out on the miniature rooms on the bottom floor.
