Little Goat Diner////This was a great experience. The staff were extremely friendly and there was plenty of seating (Monday morning at 8:30am). It was really nice to see people smiling etc. It seemed as though they were genuinely happy to see us there. Beyond the hospitality, the hash with a fried egg was very good- the best corned beef hash I have had. The coffee was good and the mugs were big. I liked the space very much too- Its got great light and the decor is a blend of diner meets living room. Plus, I also really liked that the owners were walking around meeting with customers- its a nice touch when you get checked in on by a person with a real interest in your experience.
