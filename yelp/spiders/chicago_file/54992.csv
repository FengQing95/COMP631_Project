Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////On our last visit here, we did the rioja-braised short rib, summer melon salad, buttermilk fried chicken with piri piri sauce, seared Spanish sausages, grilled octopus with potatoes and olives, & porky paella (pork shoulder pork belly, chorizo, & chicharrones). Overall a solid meal. If there were items I could live without, it would be the seared sausages and the buttermilk fried chicken. Sausages were good but nothing that really stood out for me and the buttermilk fried chicken was tasty but kind of out of place in my opinion for a Spanish tapas bar. My favorite was probably the braised short rib due to how tender and flavorful the meat was. The melon salad I really enjoyed the serranos and the smoked vinaigrette they used. The grilled octopus was good, but some of the pieces of octopus were had a bit too much char in my opinion. And lastly, for the pork paella... be ready for a mouthful of pork flavors and textures. Really good, but after a few bites I was definitely overwhelmed and needed to balance it out with other bites from the other dishes. On a final note, their classic sangria is my go to and goes great with any of the food here.
