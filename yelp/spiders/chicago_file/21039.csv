Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We settled on each getting a lunch special--a personal pizza with a small salad. The special meant the pizzas only took about 15 minutes to make as opposed to the normal 35 minutes. Our salads came out, and they were exactly what you'd expect from a pizza place. Nothing special, but at least they were something to eat. The pizza eventually came out, and they only cut it one direction, so I had to wrestle with it to cut normal sized pieces. It was okay--the crust good, but some seemed underdone. It was very filling--no need for anything more than a personal. My dad's pepperoni was better than my plain.
