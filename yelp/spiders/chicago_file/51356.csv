Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was recently introduced to this place when visiting town. We were told the reservation list was full, but we could call ahead and put our name on a wait list, which we did. We arrived a bit earlier than they had told us to and they were able to seat us within five minutes. The place is huge and knows how to manage a busy Fri night!
