Little Goat Diner////We ordered the Fried Pickle, the Patty Melt with a veggie burger, and the smoked fries.  The fries were DELICIOUS.  Crispy, with a hint of smoke and a generous portion for sharing.  These came out first and the line manager asked if we wanted them before our food, we were hungry and the food wasn't super quick so we used them as an appetizer.  Both sandwiches had good flavors and tasted good but just sort of missed the mark.  The bread on the Fried Pickle was soggy and the veggie patty on the Patty Melt was crumbling and luke warm at best.
