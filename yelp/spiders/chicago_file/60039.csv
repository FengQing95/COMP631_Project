Smoque BBQ////The brisket was perfect: nice pink smoke ring, still moist, and full of flavor. Some of the best Brisket I've ever had. The sauce was a perfect compliment to the beef. The sides were very good, but the best part of the whole meal was the Texas sausage. The finest spicy pork  sausage I've ever eaten. Hands down. Nice balance  of spice, fat, and smikey meat, wrapped in a natural casing and smoked just right.
