Little Goat Diner////I loved this place. My review is mainly for the atmosphere as I only had an appetizer. The place is a nice "diner" look with lots of booths. It's cute. The prices are good for the west loop area. Hot crab dip was AMAZINGGG. The chocolate malt shake tasted a lot like malt but I think that I don't like the malt taste as much as I thought so I don't fault them for that
