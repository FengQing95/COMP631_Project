Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////SO. GOOD. I ducked into Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba before a show at Second City and sat at the bar with a yummy Mezcal Mule and dinner. I ordered: deviled egg (pintxos--good), grilled squid (tapas--delish), marinated boquerone anchovies (tapas--amaaazing) and 2 desserts: sea salt caramel custard and natilla flan. The flan was just like any flan but the custard was to die for. I would order the squid, anchovies and custard again in a heartbeat. Next time I'd like to try the croquette pintxo as the person next to me had it and I was jealous. Dining for one, it was a little too much food. I recommend 1 tapa, 2 pintxos and 1 dessert.
