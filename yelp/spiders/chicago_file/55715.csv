Smoque BBQ////I've been here twice and the first time was 3 years ago. I don't usually critique food that harsh because I'm not a picky eater. However, if there is a place that serve the same food, then I usually reference that and make a judgment. I'm really picky about BBQ food because the most amazing BBQ place I have ever been to is 'Phil's BBQ' in San Diego, CA. That place is heaven on earth for BBQ food. I've had everything on the menu here and everything's good... but not great. With that said, this place does get crowded I guess cause for Chicago there's not many BBQ place. Overall for me though, this place is ok but don't take my word for it, try it yourself cause your palette is probably different from mine.
