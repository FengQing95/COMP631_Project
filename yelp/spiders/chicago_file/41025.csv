Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////but my absolute favorite was the escargot now you might not like escargot but they put it on top of like a toasted bread you have to try it., the desserts are all so good as well, all and all I loved it I am a frequent flyer at this restaurant, the atmosphere is awesome waiters all always around great place kudos
