Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Two words. Tourist. Trap. This tastes like Pizza Hut and is as underwhelming as it is a waste of time. Spent 3 hours waiting for a pizza I will never remember. Once you get in, it's another 45 minutes for the food to cook. So make sure, if you decide to tourist it out, order before you sit or take out.
