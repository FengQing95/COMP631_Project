Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I can see how some people would say it's too expensive, but I like to think you're paying for the experience. The outdoor seating is fantastic and the place just has a life to it.  I liked the noise, I liked the action...it's tapas with a decent bar (and insane Sangria), that's what you should be looking for.  We were seated quickly, and our waiter was informative and helpful.
