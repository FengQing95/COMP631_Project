Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pepperoni we had our pie topped with was tasty and though not exceptional, worked as a good complement to the rest of the pizza. Â And that really is the story here; A bunch of different components working together to create something great. While some of the flavors weren't home runs, all the textures were, and the different components coming together made this a great meal.
