Little Goat Diner////Was expecting a lot considering the tie to Girl & the Goat. The rooftop was beautiful and enjoyable. However, the food overall was really disappointing. Service was good, but on the slower side. We waited over 2 hours for a table, and given the food/service, in the end it wasn't worth it. I think there are a lot of other restaurants in the area (au cheval, the girl & the goat main restaurant, etc) that would've been much more worth it!
