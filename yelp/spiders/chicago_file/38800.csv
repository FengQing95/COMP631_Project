Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm not sure what's happened here, and I don't care--we're in. Once seated, I have time to take in the atmosphere. Epic chandeliers throughout, dramatic lighting, rich seating, they've really gone all out on the interior--I'm giddy at the prospect. This place is jammed with beautiful people, we walked by a dozen people milling around in the front. I have no idea how this happened, probably don't want to know--he has a certain set of skills you see.
