Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Definitely my favorite steak place in the city. It's a hidden gem over by the Merchandise Mart, packed once you're inside. I like my steak medium well and it was cooked perfectly without being too done on the outside. The brown sugar sweet potato - wow! Amazing. Great atmosphere and our server was fun (thanks John!). Highly recommend. Get a reservation though- it's busy!
