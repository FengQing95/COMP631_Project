Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Their deepdish was definitely one of the best pizzas I've ever had. Me and my friend had chicago classic and the lou as a personal size and both were amazing! It was cheesy but at the sametime didn't taste greasy at all. Malnatis classic pizza had bunch of meats on it which was delicious and lou(which I prefer more) had a huge tomato in it which was juicy and OMG so gooood. I usually get tired of pizzas after having two slices but here I finished the whole thing. Btw personal size can be smaller than you expect it to be!
