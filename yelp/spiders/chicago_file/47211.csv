Smoque BBQ////as i stepped inside the building, i quickly realized how supposedly "well known" the place was. there was a picture of "that guy" i saw i think on food network? i was never a fan of the guy and never thought his attempts of being funny was working. anyway, so yeah the guy probably visited this place, big deal. give me the ribs and let me decide for my self.
