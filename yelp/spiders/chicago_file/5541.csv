The Purple Pig////The Purple Pig was crowded even around 9 p.m., and we had to wait 15 minutes for a spot at the bar.  There is a patio area, and the main dining area consists of a good sized bar and several high tables.  It looks like they have an extensive wine list and a good number of beers, but I just wanted a quick dinner.  I ordered the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes.  The pork was so juicy and tender that I didn't need a knife at all during dinner.  The pork was well seasoned, and the mashed potatoes underneath had a perfect creamy consistency to round out the dish.
