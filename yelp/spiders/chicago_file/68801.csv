Little Goat Diner////They take reservations which is awesome because this place is always packed on the weekends.  I've only been there for breakfast and am always impressed with the yummy twists on breakfast favorites.  We had blood sausage that tasted exactly like my great grandparents used to make fresh on the farm.
