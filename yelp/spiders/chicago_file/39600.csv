Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went for my birthday this year, and had a great time. Had a couple of issues initially with setting the reservation online. Beautiful speakeasy type steakhouse with an upstairs dining room and a more exclusive parlor bar downstairs. Food was excellent, and the bartender had some A+ recommendations. Would absolutely like to go again when possible.
