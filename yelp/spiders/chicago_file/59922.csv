Smoque BBQ////I was a little late to the party since this was my first Smoque outing. We got a little bit of everything and LOVED the sausage. Two different sauces although the flavors were similar. BYOB, always a plus. Good place with nice options to sample different styles. It's no Salt Lick but what is!
