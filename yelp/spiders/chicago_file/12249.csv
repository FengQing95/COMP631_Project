Art Institute of Chicago////In terms of art, you can spend your entire day at the museum and still not see everything. I think somewhere on the walls, it said that becoming a member easily is worth it with two visits alone and I have to say I agree. The museum is massive, and with the exception of the first floor, nothing connects. You will get lost in here. Guaranteed. If not lost because of the floor plan, you will get lost in the paintings as you wander on through.
