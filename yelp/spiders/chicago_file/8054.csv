Art Institute of Chicago////The outlay of the museum is spacious and well organized. The docents are extremely nice and helpful. The flocks of little school kids running around looking at the exhibits were a nice touch as well, as it added an additional degree of credibility to the museum, to see that schools would want to field trip there.
