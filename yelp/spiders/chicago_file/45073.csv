Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here on a date and although I won't be going back with him I definitely have brought my family and friends here afterwards... The beef with horseradish sauce is amazing and i love the sangria pitchers... They had a delicious ahi tuna dish that they no longer make which is so disappointing because I loved in and got it every time.. I was obsessed.. Bring that back Caf√© Babareeba loll.
