Smoque BBQ////Not certain to what degree reviewers take their bbq but this place is ok at best. Perhaps its because there aren't a ton of joints to choose from in the city. This is a small and cozy spot that will fill your plate no doubt. Definitely worth a try considering the options around the neighborhood.
