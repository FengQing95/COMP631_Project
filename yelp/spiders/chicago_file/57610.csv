Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////As for the food, you'd think with a menu so big, everything might be one note and taste the same. That's definitely what I was expecting going into it. That was not the case AT ALL. We probably sampled 12-14 dishes between the six of us and each dish was unique and had its own flavor.
