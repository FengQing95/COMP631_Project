Little Goat Diner////We watched the sandwiches being made because there is a viewing area in the back after you order.  Stephanie herself was there wrapping up sandwiches.  I'm so glad we were able to watch because it turned out there was this thick white stuff going on the shrimp sandwiches that wasn't listed as an ingredient.  I got worried it was cream cheese because it came out of a tub labeled "CC spread." I asked a staff person what that was because I hadn't seen any dairy listed as an ingredient.  The staff person said it was the "spicy mayo, no dairy" but then Stephanie (bless her) piped up and said "no that's cream cheese" and then offered to make it without that cream cheese.  Not sure if that was like spicy-cream-cheese-mayo or if they just ran out of the spicy mayo that was listed on the menu, but appreciate Stephanie's attentiveness.  Finally, after 25 minutes of waiting, we were out with our sandwiches!
