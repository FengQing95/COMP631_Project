Little Goat Diner////The nachos couldn't have been better. The homemade masa chips were perfectly crispy and hearty while still tasting light and flaky. The pork melts in your mouth and all of the fixins on top just added layers and layers of flavor. I went to town on these nachos for about 15 minutes and still couldn't even put a dent in them. You definitely get your moneys worth here. And a dish like the nachos would be perfect for sharing. I was so happy with my choice but it was hard for me to decide on what to eat, so I cannot wait to go back and try more fabulous food. We had a really sweet server as well, wonderful service here.
