Little Goat Diner////Went back this morning for the second time to try a few more things on the menu and I wasn't as wowed as I was the first time.  For starters, we were forced to sit at a communal table because we needed a high chair.  Last time it was no problem to sit at a booth with a high chair.  I hate communal seating...I know it's the new thing but I'm not a fan.  Especially if my kid is being a menace which happens from time to time. And then right after we were seated a guy was seated at a small table with a high chair....I had even asked to be seating at the exact same table he was and was told it was a fire hazard.
