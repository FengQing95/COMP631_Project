The Purple Pig////My #1 favorite shared plates here is the Saganaki seafood for $22, (which I enjoyed last time). This time we also enjoyed the shared Caesar salad for $10 and the calamari for $14. I felt the pizza for $14, bavette steak for $20 and meetballs for $13 were not as unique or as tasty. We all felt the saltimbocca for $16 was tough and our least favorite shared plate. The four of us agreed.
