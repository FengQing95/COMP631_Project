Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////In the heart of trend we had a very fun and funny tapas experience.  Each plate was really good. And you can forget how fast a small plate dish can be developed in on the table.  The sour cream that comes with the roasted chicken empanadas was good enough to eat with a spoon (and I don't like sour cream).
