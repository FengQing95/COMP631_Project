Smoque BBQ////Atmosphere: If you're like me and don't mind embarrassing your partner by eating like a caveman (who eats ribs with utensils anyway???), this place is perfect for dates IMO. Service was good, food was ready fast, dining area was clean, bathroom smelled like roses, decor is nice, portions are generous, and the price is right. I think I went on a Thursday evening and the place wasn't too packed. Not so sure about Saturday nights or anything like that.
