Art Institute of Chicago////This is a gem of an art museum. Everyone recommended that I drop by while in chicago so I was expecting that it would have a decent set of exhibits but was not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. I visited in April of 2016 while they had a special Van Gogh exhibit (which my friends and I skipped because there was a long wait to get into the exhibit and we felt that there was plenty to see elsewhere in the museum), half a floor dedicated to impressionist work, and a great collection of contemporary art that had a lot of pieces on cities and urban living. I broke off from my group and walked around for 2 hours taking everything in but think that I could have spent even more time looking around. My only complaint is about the cafe which serves coffee that tasted like dirty water- yuck.
