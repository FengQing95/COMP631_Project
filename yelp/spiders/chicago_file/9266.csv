Art Institute of Chicago////This really is one of the most incredible art museums in the world. It's also enormous and you definitely need those maps they hand out at the door. But even with the maps, the place is really easy to get lost in. I was there for about 3 hours, and I probably spent at least 30 minutes of that just staring at the map trying to figure out where I was and how to get to where I wanted to go. Don't know how they can make that aspect better, but even wandering around lost is fun since every room is filled with amazing things.
