Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best pizza ever I had tried in Chicago. Great service as well. I left my new camera at the table and once I got back,realized someone who seem to be the manager of the place had taken the camera to a safe place only within minutes of my departure there. This showed a great care they had for customers and I was really appreciative of that.
