Little Goat Diner////I was not impressed with my salad when it arrived at my table.  The menu describes the salad's ingredients as the following: cabbage, bok choy, radish, red oak, crisp wonton, and ginger maple. The waiter also told me the salad came with kimchi.  My salad consisted of a bowlful of coleslaw, a handful of spring green lettuce mix, and 8 baby shrimp. The shrimp were tasty but I could have done without the mountain high pile of coleslaw. I did not taste any bok choy nor kimchi.
