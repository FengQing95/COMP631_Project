Art Institute of Chicago////Art History lectures with Joe Cunniff (thru Art Institute Cont. Ed. division) is one of the best things Chicago has to offer! Â I can't remember ever being so excited about a class before. Joe is amazing! Knows everything about art, music, Chicago history and architecture, great storyteller and quite a personality! Class is happening right in the museum galleries, and that's what makes it so fun and unique. I would highly recommend this class on Saturday afternoons to anyone, not just fine art buffs. Great thing for couples to do together. The people in my group were great -- fun to talk to, well traveled, friendly, and going there was a highlight of my week. Taking this class is probably the best present I've ever given myself.
