Smoque BBQ////Don't get me wrong, this place is quite good, but I must admit I don't understand the giant lines. It's not *that* overwhelmingly awesome. I feel like a lot of people from out of town Google for "bbq joints" and this place comes up first. Which i suppose is fine but there are plenty of other places in the city that are just as tasty. Fat Willys & Pork Shoppe come to mind.
