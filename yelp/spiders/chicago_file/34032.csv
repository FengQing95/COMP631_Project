Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Decor is beautiful. Very spacious seating and perfect sound/ lighting. We started with the Garlic Shrimp De Jonghe and fresh oysters. Both were perfect. The oysters were very fresh. For entrees, the Chicago Cut Ribeye, (ordered medium rare, perfect) Steak Frites and Pork Chop. Everything was amazing, but the pork chop really stood out. So tender, a must try! Elote style corn was a great side. Not too heavy and full of flavor.
