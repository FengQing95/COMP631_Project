Smoque BBQ////Delicious!  Best bbq in Chicago!  The brisket was delicious, moist and tender.  The mac and cheese was some of the best I have had (and I am quite a connoisseur of the dish!).  It is creamy and cheesey, topped with bread crumbs.  I can't wait to go back and try the ribs or chicken, with the mac and cheese of course!
