Little Goat Diner////We had a 45 minute wait when we got there at 11am on a Sunday morning.  We had the crab dip, the Mac and cheese, the goat burger open face with fries and chile, and the pork tenderloin sandwich. WOW.  Everything was delicious and I don't think we finished any dish, as the portions are large. The service staff were all very nice and helpful.  We would return one day, although its hard to justify the wait when there is Au Cheval at the other end of the block.
