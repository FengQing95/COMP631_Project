Smoque BBQ////Unfortunately Smoque only has one register and I had to wait for a good five minutes for my order to be rung up...meanwhile my food is getting cold. I also had a $10 A La Card to be deducted from the final total of my order. I didn't know that giving them the $10 A La Card would cause all kinds of problems. Apparently a manager had to come over to handle the transaction which took additional time and then caused everyone behind me to wait since they only have the one register. My debit card was charged; I thought the amount still seemed high after the discount was applied but after being there so long, I just wanted to get the hell outta dodge.
