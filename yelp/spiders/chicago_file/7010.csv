Art Institute of Chicago////I have been to many museums but this one is quite outstanding. Such an amazing location full of wonderful art and history. I loved the impressionism wing and could have spent all day there but wanted to try and see it all. Everyone there was helpful if you look even remotely lost. There is a little bit of everything for everyone in this museum. Definitely worth spending at least a day wandering through this wonderful museum.
