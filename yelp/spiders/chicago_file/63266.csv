Smoque BBQ////The best BBQ I've had. The place is busy but even with lines outside the door they got a great system to get your order in and food to your table. Want to look like a regular? Here's some advice. Let them seat you. Stay in line to order and they'll get you a seat. I've been there before where someone would get a seat on their own and would cause issues. Don't be that guy. : )
