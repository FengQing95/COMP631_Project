Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service:  Absolutely horrible.  Horrible horrible horrible.  I've never been so rushed in my life.  After ordering drinks, our waiter wanted to take the wine list.  I asked to keep it because we wanted a bottle and he was taken aback.  I later learned it was probably because he wanted to get us OUT.
