Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas tapas and tapas!! I love Â this place bacon wrapped dates! Empanadas goat cheese & sangria! Ive been here plenty of times. Either for a sit down for two or quick bite to eat at the bar or make it a family affair for a table of 6 or more. Good staff. Always call for a reservation. Summer or winter your taste buds will be satisfied :)
