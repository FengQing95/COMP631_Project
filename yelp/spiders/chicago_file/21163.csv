Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I thought the garlic bread was delicious, very tasty and cheesy just like I like it. However, the sauce of the pizza was just too tart for me, and the cheese was not as melty as I would like it to be. I think I also expected the crust to be more buttery than it actually was. I get that this is how Chicago style pizza goes, but I could never move there :P It was also a different experience because most pizza places in NY are family businesses and not a chain, but the staff was really friendly and accommodating.
