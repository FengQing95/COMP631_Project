Little Goat Diner////The food was delicious.  We enjoyed the patty melt, the chili fries, crab dip, and the seafood dish.  The crab dip was my favorite, served with traditional ritz --- probably could have a better compliment than ritz.  The seafood dish was mediocre.  The salt was overwhelming and I couldn't eat very much of it.  I wouldn't order it again.  The other two dishes were well prepared and tasty.  I think I would like this place more for breakfast and will try and go back during the breakfast/brunch hours.
