Art Institute of Chicago////I really enjoyed my visit to the Art Institute of Chicago even though I only got to see the Impressionist part of the museum. I was here with a conference group that held a social afterhours, thus we were only granted access to part of the space. However, Impressionists are my favorite and the Art Institute has quite the collection on display. During my visit, I got to see a few Renoir's that I had not seen before featuring flowers and portraits. There were plenty of Monet's work, as well. Not his typical water lilies but rather landscapes. I was also surprised to see van Gogh's "The Bedroom." I have never seen it in person, and having studied it art classes it was the highlight of my visit. Additionally, there was one of van Gogh's self-portraits that while still using van Gogh's style of thick brush strokes, also exhibited a bit of pointillism. The reception was downstairs from the gallery and outside in the courtyard. The Art Institute's staff was wonderful and made sure that when food ran out it was quickly replaced. There was a lot of options to eat and drink, making the event held here perfect for socializing.
