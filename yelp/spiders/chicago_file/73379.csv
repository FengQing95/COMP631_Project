Little Goat Diner////The hubs went with the beef burger made wing style.  Wing sauce, blue cheese & celery topped with crispy string onions on fat potato bun.  It's served ala carte so that's all there was; a burger, no fries.  The man was a little bummed bout fries being extra.  While there's a lot of diner vibe reverberating in the atmosphere, diner prices is not one of them.
