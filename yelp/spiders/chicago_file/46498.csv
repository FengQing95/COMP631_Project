Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I did order the pork skewers and they were just so dry and lacked the juiciness you get from the meat in Spain. The sangria and chocolate cake were good, but by the time the desserts had arrived I was too disappointed in my two tapas I had just had. Â Too many "tapas" places lose their authenticity to Spanish cuisine and I hope ba ba reeba won't be a victim.
