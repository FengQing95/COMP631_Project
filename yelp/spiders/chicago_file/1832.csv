Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I ordered the Denver skillet with cinnamon roll pancakes and a side of fruit, all to share with hubs.  For something fairly simple, it was all so delicious!  The hashbrowns were cooked perfectly, not soggy at all, just the perfect (for us, anyway) amount of crunch.  Flavorful veggies, chunks of smoky ham, and a nice amount of melty cheese topped with perfectly cooked eggs.  The cinnamon roll pancakes were awesome and even though we were full we had to finish them off.  It's making me hungry just writing this review.
