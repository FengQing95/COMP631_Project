Smoque BBQ////The brisket, either chopped or sliced, and the pulled pork, are both excellent as well. The meat is lean, which may be why some reviewers find it dry. It's also why I choose the ribs over the brisket and pulled pork every time. The Texas sausage and the chicken, which I've only had in the salad, are also very, very good.
