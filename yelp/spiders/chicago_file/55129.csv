Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Always a lively, upbeat and delicious experience! My boyfriend and I had our first date here and go back every now and then for drinks/apps. Try to snag a table outside if you can (inside can get extremely loud). Great place for a date, so you can sample different small plates and have fun trying new things - incredible menu and sangria pitchers!
