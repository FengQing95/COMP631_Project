Little Goat Diner////We came in at noon on a Saturday and waited an hour and a half, which was to be expected I suppose. I had the "Kimchee Bacon Tasty Asian Pancake Thing," or whatever it's called, and it was very tasty indeed, and managed to fulfill the hype around this place as a "creative re-imagined diner" or what-have-you (though my wife claimed it was too salty).
