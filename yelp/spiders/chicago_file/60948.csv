Smoque BBQ////I have been told that there is usually a line out the door but we arrived around 2:30/3pm on a Sunday afternoon and, while there was a small line inside, it wasn't a very long wait. Also, I appreciated that they seated us at a table for two instead of the long communal tables, because I wasn't minding my table manners. At all.
