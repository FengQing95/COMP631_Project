Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was traveling around the US and got the opportunity to stop in Chicago for a night. I knew the one food I wanted to get was deep dish pizza. Having lived in NY tje past 3 years im pretty used to great pizza but have yet to have a deep dish I enjoyed, untill going here. This was one of, if not the best pizzas I have ever had. The crust is not so deep that it is ober powering like normal deep dish in other places. It was a normal sized crust, perfectly cooked. Then it was pilled with an entire layer of sausage, then a layer of cheese, then finally a layer of tomato sauce that was amazing. We got a small size and it was perfect between the two of us and im a big eater. We also got the bruschetta appetizer and it was delicious. I have never had bruschetta like this or with fresh parmesean cheese and basil. We also got a family size chicken cesar salad and not only was it good, it was huge. If you are traveling through chicago you need to make time to stop here and get some of this amazing food!
