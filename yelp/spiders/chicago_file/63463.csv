Smoque BBQ////Smoque is one of the most popular barbecue restaurants in the city.  They don't take reservations, they seat and move people in and out.  If you are going during dinner plan on standing in a line all the way out the door and weather will not scare people away.  They will ask you how many are in your party if you are dining in and you will have a chance to order before being seated.
