Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I was taken here for my last birthday and I must say happy birthday to me!! The service was impeccable and the food was nothing short of completely satisfactory and delectable. I have 0 complaints on the entire experience other than don't let the hostess talk you into settling for a crammed spot...once we made it clear that our party of 4 was not going to sit at a little table smack dab in the middle of the upstairs room right next to the bar when we had made reservations awhile ago, luckily a few minutes later a "reserved" table downstairs opened up. Much more space, more dimly lit, stylish French decor, and not as bustling and loud as upstairs, so much more intimate in my opinion. We each ordered a different cut of steak, at least 4 different sides for the table, drinks, and 2 apps. Our drinks and apps came out quickly and we were checked on by our waiter regularly. Since we had been waiting a little bit for my steak because there was a mix up in the kitchen, our waiter brought us a wedge salad on the house. Probably the 2nd best if not best salad I've ever had in my LIFE. The waiting situation was handled gracefully and promptly to the point where I barely even noticed we were waiting any longer than need be because we were enjoying the salad and ambiance of the place so much. Main entrees came out and everything was perfect to the tee. After dinner our waiter proceeded to offer us dessert cocktails, I originally said no but he insisted and got me a very nice dessert drink on him. We also ordered the lemon meringue pie and the mango sorbet. Both were incredible and later we came to find he also covered the desserts. Such a perfect experience, and such class! My mom's top 3 steakhouses in the city and for good reason (trust me, this lady knows her city stuff)!
