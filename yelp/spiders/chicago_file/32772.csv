Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Really wanted to like Bavette's.  The space is beautiful, and they make one of the best Old Fashioned that I've ever had.   They may be on par with Aviary for that drink, although my wife's negroni was not great, and we have had better at many places in the area.  The goat cheese appetizer is amazing, and their in-house baked bread is delicious.
