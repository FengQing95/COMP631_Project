Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Hello, Elizabeth! I am sorry for the long wait for your pizza. How the pre-ordering works is that we begin making your order as soon as you're seated. We are unable to do it prior to you getting a table because we're unable to properly time the wait precisely enough to ensure that your pizza arrives to you fully cooked and still hot. I apologize that the pizza was forgotten causing an additional wait. I'd like to have a manager follow-up with you to discuss your experience and restore your faith in our quality of service and food. Please provide us with your contact information by filling out our contact form at
