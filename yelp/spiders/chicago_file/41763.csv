Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////All I can say is.....SANGRIAAAAA!!!! They have the best around. Its very lively, very welcoming and warm. The serves are wonderful and very knowledgeable on all of their entrees. The music is great, you feel like you are in argentina and want to start dancing with your neighbors at the next table. Definitely a place to go to to put you in a great mood. If you go in a group make sure to call ahead, I dont remember them taking our reservations, they had long waits (which obviously shows they are popular) but trust me, its worth it. Its a great experience!
