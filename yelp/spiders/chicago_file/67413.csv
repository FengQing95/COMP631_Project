Little Goat Diner////Oh how I wished I lived in Chicago!!! Not that Atlanta has good food but I loved eating at Little Goat. I would eat here every day and every week! My friend and I came here for breakfast on a weekday morning. So it was great the place wasn't too crowded and we were able to get service very quickly. Our server Joanie was super sweet and very energetic for 7:30am! I am not a morning person. So not sure how she could be so perky that early in the morning. ;) The place is a cute little diner yet with little vintage touches.
