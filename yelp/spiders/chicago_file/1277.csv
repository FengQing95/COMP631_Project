Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We followed suggestions of others and added our name to the wait list so when we arrived we only had a 5 minute wait. Servers were attentive and food delivered hot and fast. I had an omelette and upgraded to have fig pancakes and well worth the $. Â Great location delicious and fresh. A must do!
