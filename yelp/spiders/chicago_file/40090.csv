Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Substantial sides:  Buttery garlic mashed & Truffle mac & cheese. For entrees: Chicago 16 oz ribeye med rare; added bone marrow. He had the 22 oz 45 day dry aged bone-in ribeye med rare.  Garlic mashed potatoes had roasted garlic throughout.  We both loved it.  A little decadent even. Garlic did not overpower this buttery, fattening delight.  Truffle mac & cheese was average, nothing mind blowing.  Nice balance of truffle.
