Little Goat Diner////The portions are way too big, and I sort of wish they had at least ONE light beer option (Coors Lite, perhaps?) to accompany the gigantic portions (I would have drank more over lunch if so!). There are lots of things I plan to try on my next visits, and I'll probably always walk away with bread to go.
