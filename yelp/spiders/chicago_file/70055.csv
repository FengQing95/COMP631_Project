Little Goat Diner////My parathas burrito was tasty and inventive, and I enjoyed it quite much: Indian flatbread, eggs, an avocado and bean salad smothered in chili pepper sauce. At $12, it's on the expensive side of things but not overtly so. But my friend and I decided to split a plate of hashbrowns sprinkled with goat cheese as our indulgence of the day, and for $5 we received a serving so small that it wouldn't have been enough to feed a child. $5 for what was amounting to 3/4 of a a potato with 1/4 ounce of cheese (at most) is outrageous in my book.
