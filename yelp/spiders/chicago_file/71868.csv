Little Goat Diner////First time here after recommendation from my daughter. So fun and delicious! Had the cauliflower rice bi bim bop. What an amazing dish. Guilt free dining. The sauce is tangy and not too spicy. And I would love to go back and eat the corned beef hash. Ordered a little goat latte with my dinner. Love that too.
