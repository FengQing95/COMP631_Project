Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Phenomenal doesn't even come close. My drink which was a French 75, fantastic! The sourdough bread with salted butter, holy smokes! The wedge salad with a thick piece of bacon on top, literally blew my mind. Then to top it all off if I wasn't stuffed to the brim already ... the STEAK! I ordered the 6oz filet and requested it be rare plus with peppercorn. It was hands down perfect. Anything closer to perfect is in actual heaven. The ambiance was so cool and eclectic but refined. The staff was so kind, attentive and on top of their game. I truly appreciate their attention to detail, especially when it came to checking the wine glasses to ensue there were no streaks after drying them. It did live up to the hype and for sure exceeded it!
