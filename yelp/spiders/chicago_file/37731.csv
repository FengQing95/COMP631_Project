Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Hit it out the park across the board. The service, food, drinks, atmosphere..outstanding. We were at the 1st sitting greeted at the door w/a smile & seated right away. Barbara our server took care of everything, from checking coats to wrapping leftover shrimp for our mom who couldn't make it. My niece had a Shirley temple she loved & my Whisky sour was so beautiful I almost didn't want to drink it. The food..my god the food! We all ordered different entrees and sides Â grazed on each other's plates. The steak was so juicy & tender..the roast chicken was crisp & seasoned served on a roasted garlic aujus was life altering. DO NO LEAVE without tasing the shrimp dejonge..you will not regret it. we decided to share a slice of lemon merengue
