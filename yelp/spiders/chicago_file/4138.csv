The Purple Pig////The milk braised shoulder is DELICIOUS! We were encouraged to get the broccoli and we were NOT disappointed---I could've just eaten that alone and I would've been a happy woman the entire night! The pork shoulder and tenderloin had such great flavor too! There wasn't a bad bite from start to finish!
