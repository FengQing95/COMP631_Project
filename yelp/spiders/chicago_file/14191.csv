Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We came for dinner and waited an hour to get a table, a sign of a good restaurant. The deep dish, butter crust, sausage pizza was soooooo good. I love pizza and that one knocked my socks off. My husband shared the pizza dip appetizer with another guy and that seemed to be nothing great, but their house salad was a great no-frills dose of veggies. Our server forgot our drinks, but once we reminded him he was right on top of it. We left in a pretty large food coma, but it was well worth it.
