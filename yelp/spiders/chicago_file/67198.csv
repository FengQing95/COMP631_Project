Little Goat Diner////My sister is is in the service industry and knew some pretty important people here...so many that we got free desserts: the choco taco and the smoked pork and toffee crunch milkshake.  The choco taco was sour cream ice cream with some chocolate covered potato chips.  It was weird but it worked for me.  The milkshake...well it tasted good, bacon-y and weird, but good, until the server said it was made with pork fat ice cream.  Now I love bacon as much as the next guy, but there's something a little wrong about indulging in a dessert that is mainly made up of pork fat.  A few sips was more than enough.
