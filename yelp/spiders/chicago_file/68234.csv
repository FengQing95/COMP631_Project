Little Goat Diner////After pleasantly waiting for our table at a coffee shop down the street, we were notified via text (wonderful feature) that our table was ready after only 50 minutes (be careful not to go to far as it took us about 5-7 minutes to walk back and our table was given to another group... but I didn't feel that bad about that).
