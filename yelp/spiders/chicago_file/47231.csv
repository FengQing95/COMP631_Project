Smoque BBQ////let's keep this short and sweet.......great place to get your bbq fix.  pulled pork is nothing special, i suggest you go for the beef brisket.  if you aren't going to order the fries, you should just forget about the whole meal.  the fries are crispy little spears of perfection.......... let me explain:  perfectly crisp on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside.  hurry up and go eat!
