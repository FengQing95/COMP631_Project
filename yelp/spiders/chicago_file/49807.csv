Smoque BBQ////I *finally* made it to Smoque after how long?  I will say this - it is the best BBQ that I've had in Chicago, so I will definitely be going back.  I'm happy to finally find a place that makes me want to say that.  Three stars just because I have my BBQ favorites, all of which aren't in Chicago, but Smoque will do the trick when I have a hankering.  Their sauce is a little bit more vinegar based that I'd like (I'm a sweet fan), but that didn't stop me from eating as much of my pulled pork sandwich as I could.  The mac and cheese and cornbread (and my friend's fries) were really good as well.  We go there around 6 on a Wednesday, which happened to be perfect timing - we got a table immediately, but by the time we were leaving, the place was really starting to fill up.  Is it work an hour+ wait on the weekend, maybe not, but you can call in your order for pick-up!
