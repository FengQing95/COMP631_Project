Little Goat Diner////My friends had the fried chicken which has 1/2 Walter's chicken (a local farmer), with Â mashed potato and slaw salad. The breading on the chicken was nice and when my friends asked for hot sauce they served to home made sauces which were very very tasty. We wished they sold the sauce in their shop. the mashed potato and slaw... Those are hard because everyone has their own taste. I am not a mashed potato fan so I can't comment on them, but my friends thought they were ok. The slaw lacked a lot of dressing. Maybe this is what Little Goat was going for, but we all found it to be dry.
