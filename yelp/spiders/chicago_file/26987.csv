Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They don't take any reservations, but you can preorder your pizza so that when you get to your table you don't have to wait for that long for the pizza to get ready. They also keep the pizza at your table in the pan to keep it warm longer unlike Giordano's. If you like a lot of dough then go to Giordano's. That's too much for me, which is why I think I liked Lou Malnati a lot. Also their food tasted really authentic and homemade like their marinara sauce.
