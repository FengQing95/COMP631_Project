Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Awesome experience! Came on a Monday evening in a party of two. We had the duck and goat cheese appetizer which was delicious. My date ordered the classic chicago ribeye. I ordered the roasted chicken and we shared the Brussel sprouts and the truffle Mac and cheese. The chicken and Brussel sprouts were amazing! I could eat them both all day. The atmosphere was really inviting, warm and cozy. I would definitely come back. Our drinks were also Delish!
