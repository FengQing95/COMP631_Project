Little Goat Diner////This is a milkshake. They have to do something about pork fat and then take it across the street where they turn it into gelato or something, and then bring it back for the toffee. Ok, straight up, this is disgusting. The description made me want to gag (I asked for the description after I ordered), and you taste vanilla smokey pork fat! EW! I had some people try it, nobody liked it, and since it cost like $6, I had to just down it, so I did. The toffee crunch was very good, but the rest of the shake was disgusting! Never again!
