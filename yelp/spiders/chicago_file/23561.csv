Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was visiting Chicago for work and figured it was only right to try deep dish pizza while in Chicago. So I found a Lou Malnati's near by and went in for dinner. It was packed!! A very long wait, luckily there was one seat left at the bar. I had drink and ordered my pizza... overall really good pizza but I went in with what I think was unrealistic expectations for my deep dish pizza and was expecting something out of this world. Don't give me wrong, it's really good deep dish pizza but I thought it was a doughy and not the best I've had.
