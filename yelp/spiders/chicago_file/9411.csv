Art Institute of Chicago////After moving from San Francisco to Chicago last August and being super sad about leaving CA, my saving grace has been the Art Institute. Â I love it there & anytime I feel pangs of remorse for leaving nice temperate weather for winters from hell I go there and think to myself, "They don't have the Art Institute back in the Bay, now do they?"
