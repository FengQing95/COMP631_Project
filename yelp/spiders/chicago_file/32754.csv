Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great dining experience! We started with oysters that were very fresh & tasty. Then we split the smoked fish caesar salad. It is definitely big enough for 2 people to split before the main meal. The salad was fantastic, flavorful - the best caesar we've ever had - highly recommend. For dinner - steak frites with a side of bone marrow, roasted chicken and a side of the creamy mashed potatoes. The steak & chicken were both tender, juicy and again, full of flavor. Â The chicken & potatoes both had a lot of garlic!! They serve a huge portion of chicken so you can easily share some. The frites had a great seasoning on them. For dessert we shred the whiskey ice cream w a side of hot fudge. It was a really good sized portion. Very creamy. Finished with French press coffee which is fantastic! Our server was helpful and attentive but not hovering so that we felt rushed to eat & leave quickly. It was a nice relaxing meal. Dishes were cleared quickly. The decor, lighting etc. give the room a perfect ambiance for a great meal!! We will definitely go again.
