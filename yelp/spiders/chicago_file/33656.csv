Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The upstairs area has a slightly more lively feel to it, but don't expect a dance club.  It has some softly playing music in the background and multitude of people buzzing around the bar, but it didn't feel crowded (this was a Thursday evening).  We ended up downstairs, which is a much smaller area filled with U-shaped booths.  It's VERY dimly lit (study the menu before you come).  But, this area was perfect for a date night together!
