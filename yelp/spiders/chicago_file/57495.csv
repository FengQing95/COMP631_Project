Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Definitely a great place to come and enjoy pitchers of sangria- fabulous tapas choices. We enjoyed the potatoes, octopus, berry waffles, Brussel sprout salad, dates wrapped in bacon breakfast sandwich. All were excellent and definitely a fabulous place to experience. The server was great. .
