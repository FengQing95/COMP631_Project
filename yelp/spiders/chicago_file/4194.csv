The Purple Pig////As far as restaurant experiences go, this one had to be the worst. No reservations, so you have to stand and wait. We landed on a Saturday, made the list at 7pm, and was told it'll be a 2.5-3 hour wait. You only have 10 minutes to get back to the restaurant by the time they text you that the table is ready. If you have the yelp app, you can keep tabs on your place on the waiting list so you don't miss your table. If you come in later in the evening, you run the risk of dishes being sold out. They sat us on a 2 person table, so the table was pretty tight. The restaurant is very loud and our server was hard to reach at times because of the number of tables she was serving. I personally don't think this place is worth the 3 hour wait on a Saturday night.
