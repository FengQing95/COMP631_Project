The Purple Pig////The purple pig is one of the most reviewed restaurants, but also ironically onem alot of people dont know about. Maybe because its in this building thats kind of hidden, or maybe non pork eaters stay away. The food is pretty special here pork or not. Infact the tuna tartare was one of the best i ever had. We also had the pork shoulder and pork belly, all great! The Sicilian Iris was a little disappointing. Really wish the restaurant was in a stand alone building. But other then that pretty solid..
