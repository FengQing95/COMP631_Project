Smoque BBQ////Loved this place so much that when I moved very far south I still used their catering service. Celebrating a graduation from law school for my boyfriend, the food stayed delicious and warm for the 45 min drive. There was a mishap with the order and while it inconvenienced me, they addressed it and made sure to remedy the problem quickly. For the food, the service, and especially the follow up with amazing customer service- 5 stars is an easy rating. Highly recommended.
