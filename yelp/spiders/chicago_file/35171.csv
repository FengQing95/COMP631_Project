Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////All of the positive comments about the food and atmosphere are correct. There were 4 of us and we shared oysters, shrimp in garlic sauce, salad, filet and salmon. The restaurant is beautiful and the music so varied. We brought our own wine and had no corkage because we shared a glass with another table. We only received 1 glass back and we were disappointed that the server did not mention anything about that. Just took the glass of wine away. My biggest disappointment was when I asked for the salmon to be split in the kitchen. It was not and I was given a bread/salad dish for my entree and everyone else had a full size plate. Same thing happened with the salad. At a restaurant of that quality and price the patrons should not be serving and splitting their own meal.
