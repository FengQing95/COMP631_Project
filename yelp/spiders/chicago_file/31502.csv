Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Smack dab in the middle of great restos in the River North,  Lou Malnati's (many branches in Chi-town and the burbs) does not suffer from a lack of a loyal following.  It helps that social media has elevated LM to star status and you'll see the throngs here: local and visitor.  After having eaten Lou Malnati's pizza for over 8 years, Ive gotten to feel the love maybe too many times,  but I still like it.  It's not my favorite deep dish pie and it's not the best in Chicago.  It's super popular though, crowded so plan for a 3 hour event. This time I tried something different which is to add sausage (made exclusively for LM) and jalapeño to their veggie pie and loved it ....immensely.
