Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The menu is pretty extensive, but they make it pretty simple to pick what to order, since all their house favorites are marked in red. We had the shrimp, spicy potatoes, and short rib (all marked in red), and the chicken empanada. All really tasty, flavorful, etc. My favorite was probably the shrimp--it had garlic and hot peppers, oil, all that good stuff. Plus, once youre done eating all the shrimp, it makes for a great dipping sauce for the complimentary bread they give you!
