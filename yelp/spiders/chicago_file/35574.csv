Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Dinner was amazing.  We started by splitting a wedge salad (which was too much even for two) and each had a filet.  The filets were perfect.  They offer steakhouse-style sides designed to be split and we ordered the corn.  I would highly recommend it -  creamy yet with a bit of a spicy kick.  Sadly, we had no room for dessert.
