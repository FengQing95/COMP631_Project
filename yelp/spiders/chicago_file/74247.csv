Little Goat Diner////They used to have this asian breakfast thingie which was delicious. Sadly it's not on the menu anymore but I got the breakfast bibimbap and it did not disappoint! I loved the cauliflower "rice" which made this healthier. The eggs were perfectly cooked. And I highly recommend asking for the habanero hot sauce. It is very cravable!!
