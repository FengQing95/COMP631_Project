Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The lower level is definitely more quiet and intimate than the upper level. It feels like you are in a speakeasy, but the part where they hide all of the liquor. It is very dark downstairs, and everything is lit by candles. There's a mixture of couches and booths to sit at. There's a small bar, and the ambient soundtrack helps to set the mood. It is a pretty stark contrast from the upstairs, but the levels complement each other, nonetheless.
