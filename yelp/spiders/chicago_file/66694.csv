Little Goat Diner////Seriously, this place is no big deal.  It's a high priced greasy spoon.  Food is decent, but not what you'd expect from the brains behind the Girl & The Goat across the way.  That alone will keep the place packed and the wait long, but do yourself a favor and find somewhere else to dine if you are expecting to be "wow'd".  If you want a simple, maybe boring meal then this is the place.
