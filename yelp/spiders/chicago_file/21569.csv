Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I did not like the atmosphere very much.  It was very 90's chain restaurant and also a bit touristy in terms of the clientele (myself obviously contributing).  It sounds like I should give this experience 2 stars.  But I decide to give a 3 by default until and if I have tried more similar places on future Chicago visits.
