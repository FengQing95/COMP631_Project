Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Very disappointed! Â I could have gotten the same or better pizza a Pizza Hut. I ordered a small personal size pepperoni pizza. The pizza literally had to be patted with a napkin to remove all the water, I assume from the tomatoes and I had a hard time even finding the pepperoni. Crust was so dry it fell apart when cut. Definitely would not recommend or go again.
