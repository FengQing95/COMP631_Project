Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you have had Lou Malnatis, you know.   If you haven't, you are likely either not from Chicagoland or you aren't a huge pizza fan.    Pizza is my go to, and Lou's is one of the best pan pizzas (get the butter crust) out there.   There is a reason they ship this stuff around the world.
