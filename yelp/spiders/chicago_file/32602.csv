Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////delicious, melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. the sides of mashed potatoes and broccoli were perfect. the garlic shrimp appetizer was good, but just good. nothing to write home about. the service was attentive and informative, making recommendations when we asked but not too pushy which was nice. it's expensive, but you get what you pay for.. a good quality meal
