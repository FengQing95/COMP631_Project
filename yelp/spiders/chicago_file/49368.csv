Smoque BBQ////Also when I ate there, I ordered a half slab of baby backs.  Now I will say, I think the ribs here are just ok...Id prefer the brisket over everything else on the menu.  However one cool thing about this place when I ordered my ribs...when I picked up my order from the counter, the person told me I was given a small batch of ribs and that they would give me a whole another batch to make sure its right.  Thats amazing.  Most places would just give the small batch to some unlucky customer but this place wants to make sure you get it right.  I was rooting for the ribs after this, so I was a bit sad it did not live up my expectation for ribs (so far, I have liked Q's ribs the most).  But I definitely felt the urge to give a shout out to smoque for offering this kind of service.
