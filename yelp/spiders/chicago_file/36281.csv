Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This one was doomed from the start. First, I enjoy gimlets for two reasons-I like gin and I like things that are refreshing but not overly tart or thick. This drink was both of those things. Took a few sips and push it aside. The main issue was the ribeye, which I ordered with "au poivre on the side" and "medium-rare plus," obviously between medium and medium-rare. I did not realize that "au poivre" meant it was cooked au poivre, and I assumed it was the cognac-cream peppercorn sauce instead. I'll take some of the blame for that one, but when I said "on the side," perhaps the bartender should have realized my mistake and corrected me, thus preventing the steak from being the saltiest thing on the planet...
