Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I thought I'd seen the height of gastropubs and steakhouses... Bavette's proves that there are always more amazing things that Brendan Sodikoff and his gang can come up with. Fantastic ambiance, great service, amazing cocktails, a great selection of wines, and best of all - some of the best food I've ever had. The bone in ribeye was out of this world, the chocolate souffle was soft, fluffy, delicate, yet deeply flavorful, even the pomme frites were so tasty (cooked in pork fat. Of course)
