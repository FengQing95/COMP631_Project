Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I LOVE this place! One of my favorite restaurants for tapas in Chicago. The food is AMAZING and the staff is friendly. Come in on the weekend and it's completely alive and energetic - so much fun! Make a reservation or call ahead for nighttime Fri/Sat dinner for sure. I really can't point on my favorite thing about the menu - the pinxos, tapas, paella, DESERTS! it's all SO GOOD! And the water guy fills up your water as soon as you take two drinks, so you're never thirsty.
