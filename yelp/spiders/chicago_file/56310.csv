Smoque BBQ////Oh...my...God! This place is by far the best BBQ in the Chicago area. I traditionally get brisket orders for Easter dinner & my family salivates over it. When I picked it up today I noticed they had Pecan Bread pudding. Nobody likes bread pudding as much as me and its remarkable how different it is everywhere. I just got 1 order and ate it when I got home. By far the best bread pudding in the area. You will be very happy with your choices here. Enjoy. Parking can be a challenge, but its definitely worth it.
