Art Institute of Chicago////I know that sounds like complaining but it's not meant to be. I am so glad we have aged, character-ridden buildings to view the art in context rather than shiny new housing which would feel directly contrasted to the ornate gilded frames of El Greco and Rembrandt. The Modern Wing does a lovely job of putting the moderns first, with its sparse architecture and perfect use of natural light.
