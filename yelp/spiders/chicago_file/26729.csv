Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This would've otherwise been a three start restaurant if it wasn't for the horrible service. Our waiter disappeared for almost the entire time we were there (almost 50 minutes). We had to ask for ketchup twice (the first person we asked seem distracted; he was texting in the kitchen when I was going to the bathroom).
