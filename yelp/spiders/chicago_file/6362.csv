The Purple Pig////One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! The food is incredible, but the presentation is out of this world. My best experiences at the Purple Pig have been with groups of around 4-6 because you can order many things on the menu and try everything out. The only thing that threw me off was the restaurant itself is in a corporate office building, so it was not the ambience I was expecting, but I would still go back time and time again for the food!
