Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wish we would've had more mornings so we could've had more breakfasts here! Came across Wildberry while searching Yelp for breakfast places in Chicago, their menu sounded good so we stopped in. No wait with a packed restaurant was a nice surprise. The waitress was nice, the food was delicious! I got the classic eggs benedict, my wife got a skillet with a side of their cinnamon roll pancakes. Next time we go, I'm getting as many of those cinnamon roll pancakes as I can. All the food tasted great, the atmosphere was nice and it'll definitely be our first breakfast stop next time we're in the city.
