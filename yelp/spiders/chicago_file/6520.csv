The Purple Pig////Stopped in for lunch and sat at the counter next to the open kitchen. Fun to see the chefs at work preparing these amazing dishes. Place was packed, we walked-in and got lucky but I'd recommend a reservation. The service was good considering how busy they are. Great place to stop off while walking Michigan Ave.
