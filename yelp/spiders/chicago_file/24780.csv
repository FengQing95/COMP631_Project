Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When you first walk in, it may seem like a "whole in the wall" restaurant but there's roomy seating deeper in. The wait time was LONG especially in 2017 around New Years time when I went. The wait was definitely worth it though! Delicious, hot, fresh, nicely served pizza! Not a lot of options on the menu but still definitely a good joint to try deep dish as well as other favorites. Great service & staff!
