The Purple Pig////The crispy pigs ears were my favorite. I loved the crunchy texture and flavors the plate had. I have never tasted something so delicious and flavorful, yet so simple. My boyfriend was blown away by the chicken pasta. It was just the right amount of pasta and sauce ratio and the flavor was outstanding.
