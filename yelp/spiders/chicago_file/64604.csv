Smoque BBQ////As we settled down to the picnic like tables, we realized the cramped venue was BYOB. People brought in their own beer and even hard liquor and everyone looked very cheery and comfortable! Our food came shortly after and we of course had to take a first bite of the Mac n cheese - holy cheese gods! The flavors and creaminess of this BBQ side staple were absolutely heavenly and though the silver tin it came in was tiny, I was so excited to gobble down the whole thing. But, I have this thing where I like to save the best for last so I moved on to try the cole slaw. The cole slaw was a downer, not a lot of wetness and too peppery for me. Alas! But the crunchiness of the cabbage was a good complement to everything else. My friend's fries came in a huge portion. They were seasoned well, but felt too heavy for a bbq side in my opinion.
