Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The best pizza I have had in Chitown yet. Ambience great. Staff great. Pizza flavors to choose from, great. It would be nice to get traditional Chicago style pizza outside of Chicago. So far, I haven't found it. Will always frequent this establishment upon return to Chicago.
