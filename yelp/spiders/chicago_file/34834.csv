Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Brought a client here for dinner and we were not disappointed. We ordered cocktails before dinner and they were mixed wonderfully. Appetizers were delicious, and the Entrees were spot on. Service was a little slow, but they were very busy. The ambiance is great, reminds you of a prohibition style place. I would definitely come back here next time i'm in Chicago.
