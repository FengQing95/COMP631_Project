Art Institute of Chicago////One of the nicest art museums I have ever been to.  As a fan of impressionism, this museum really appeals to me as its collection is simply astonishing.  Nevertheless, lots of different types of art to suit your interests, I'm sure.  The layout, lighting and overall ambiance is first class.  Definitely check it out.
