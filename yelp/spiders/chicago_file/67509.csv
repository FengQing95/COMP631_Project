Little Goat Diner////Nom nom nom. I've been here twice now and both times loved what I got. The smoked fries are unbelievable though. I would stop in just for an order of those. The staff is well trained, and makes everything on the menu sound amazing. The portion sizes are pretty large. Next time I need to try my best to leave room for dessert!
