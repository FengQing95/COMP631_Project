Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This was the last time we get the Lemon Meringue Pie--which is my favorite pie, but I just don't like their version. It is mountainous, but the meringue, to me, is just like a giant pile of whipped cream. It has none of the stickiness/gooiness or top-crustiness I like. And the bottom, the filling, isn't my type of lemon at all. Not lemony enough for me, and too ... custardy ... is that the right word? I guess it's a matter of personal preference. I greatly prefer, for example, the lemon filling at Bittersweet on Belmont, which to me is spot-on.
