Little Goat Diner////Though the restaurant was crowded, service was fast and friendly. We were able to get in and out in about an hour, and didn't feel rushed by the staff at all, even though the line was clearly building. I'm sure most of the people coming here are tourists, but it's definitely worth the hype!
