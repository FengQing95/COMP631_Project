Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////3.5 stars was just as good as Cafe Iberico, but I didn't get that authentic feel. Wine list was enjoyable, food was delicious, and service was good. It was a quiet night, Monday 9:00PM, and the hostess was MIA we had to wait a while which I did not care for. For LP it was great.
