The Purple Pig////we ordered the hummus, calamari and pork belly. the hummus was probably my favorite surprisingly! the flavors especially with the soft boiled egg worked so well together. and since it's hummus, you don't feel guilty eating it! the calamari was good but not my favorite. i definitely prefer the fried version. :) lastly, the pork belly was good as well - not mindblowing though.
