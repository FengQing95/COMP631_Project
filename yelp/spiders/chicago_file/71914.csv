Little Goat Diner////Josh got the club sandwich which he said was one of the best clubs he has ever had. I went for the pork belly scallion pancake which was a little too salty/one note for me by still tasty. Neither of us finished but that's okay because we brought our leftovers home for when my husband gets hungry around 9-10pm.
