Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am a thin crust, veggie pizza kind of girl, but my boyfriend REALLY wanted to try their pizza and I definitely wasn't disappointed. I had heard great things about the Caesar salad (they add diced tomatoes!) and they were all correct! The regular size portion was great for two of us to share and as they will tell you when you sit down, the pizza takes 45 minutes (almost exactly) and you want an appetizer or salad to help pass the time. If you aren't a pizza fan and indulging someone by going, definitely get the salad. The dressing was so creamy, perfectly cheesed with grated and sliced Parmesan and not tangy like some places can be. We reached created our own personal pan sized pizza and found this to be a good amount for lunch. I tried the spinach, mushroom, pepperoni with extra cheese and light sauce, while my boyfriend did the classic (extra cheese and sausage) with added pepperoni on top. As someone who doesn't love red sauce or cooked tomatoes I would probably as for no sauce next time, but they put the sauce on top so it's not overly hard to maneuver around. We both chose the butter crust option and it was definitely really good. I didn't think the top edges were very flavorful, but the base was definitely good and gave a nice texture and base for all the toppings. Inside was mostly generic for a pizza place with lots of jerseys on the walls and a couple tv's. I would suggest getting a patio table if the weather permits and not being in a rush to eat.
