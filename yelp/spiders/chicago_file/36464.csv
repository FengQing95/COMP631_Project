Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The server greater us quickly, went over the basics and gave us a moment to consider drinks. From that point on the service was very good. Our server was extremely attentive and even asked if we had any food allergies. He topped it all off at the end of the meal with a complimentary dessert since we were celebrating our anniversary.
