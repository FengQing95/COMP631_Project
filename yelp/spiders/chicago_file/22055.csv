Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So, pizza! Deep dish is all about proportions, and they've nailed it. Perfect ratio of crust, tomato sauce, toppings, and cheese. OH MY GOD THE CHEESE. I think they put crack in it. We also had a thin crust that was great. Both pizzas reheated really well in the oven over the next couple days.
