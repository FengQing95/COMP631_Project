Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I feel immediately festive the moment I walk in the door and I love the patio seating in the summer.  This is great for groups who are into sharing and a wonderful place for special occaisions.  Its loud and boisterous as a proper tapas bar should be.  Their Paella is remarkable.  The service is generally attentive and savvy however, there have been a few tragic occaisions where it was less than stellar.
