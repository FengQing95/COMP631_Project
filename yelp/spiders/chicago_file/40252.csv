Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I don't understand how this restaurant has received such high ratings. I'm a regular restaurant goer and I believe I paid the least tips in my lifetime(I pay accordingly to the service and separated from the quality of the food). During my high wait time, I can't help but observed that my table was not helped at all. The waitress interacted with almost every table once every 10-15 minutes(to pour water and talk etc.), whereas, my table did not even get that once. I always give the benefit of the doubt, but it doesn't help at all that that my table was the only Asian group too. I also want to point out that the waitress even asked, "Was the seafood good? It's terrible huh?". I had initially thought that it was a joke, but after my experience, I'm starting to think that we were intentionally treated this way.
