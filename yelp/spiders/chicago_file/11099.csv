Art Institute of Chicago////One of the best museums I've ever been to! It's so big and everything is clean. They offer student discounts which is a blessing!! Â Honestly you spend at least half a day here looking at amazing artwork throughout history and present time. Also, I would like to add: FABULOUS LOCATION OMG.
