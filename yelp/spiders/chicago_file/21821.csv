Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Stopped in during a layover at o'hare. Place was pretty crowded but we had expected that. Ordered a salad and Lou's favorite Pizza. After about 15 the waiter cam back and said that the kitchen had crashed and he needed to put the order back in and just wanted to confirm it. The salad came out 15 minutes later. It was fresh and flavorful. The pizza came 25 minutes later and was well worth the wait. This is Chicago pizza at its finest. Buttery crust loaded with toppings and cheese. Heaven in a deep dish
