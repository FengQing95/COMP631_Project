The Purple Pig////At 10pm on a Wednesday, the Purple Pig was still bumpin. The ambience is fun and lively. Â The menu is drool worthy and it was hard picking an entree. I had the pork belly and tenderloin with a ginger glaze, carrot and espresso, and boy, was it good! One of biggest slices of pork belly I've ever had served with 5 slices of tenderloin. It was beautifully plated and absolutely delicious. My friend had the milk braised berkshire shoulder, and was equally satisfied. The wine pairing suggestions are also a nice touch. Can't wait for the next time I'm back in Chicago to try more dishes!
