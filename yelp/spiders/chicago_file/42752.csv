Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Seriously?   People love this place?   I don't get it.  Service was impersonal and barely sufficient.   We ordered 3 dishes.  The Grilled octopus was tough and greasy, the fingerling potatoes burnt, and the pimenton vinaigrette tasted of way too much smoked paprika.  And that was the best of the 3.  The Grilled Hanger steak came to the table 2 minutes after we ordered it.   It was obviously a "kitchen mistake".  It was cold, sauce was congealed and absolutely awful.  We sent it back and the new one tasted marginally better.   I can't recommend the handmade beef empanada as it  had a greasy, oily dough and the beef had absolutely no flavor.   Giving 2 stars just because we had only 3 dishes on a large menu.    We decided to go home and stop the disappointment.   Hungry.   Thank god for homemade cookies.
