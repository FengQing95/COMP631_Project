Little Goat Diner////So I had the Korean burger and I wasn't too impressed by it.  I should've got something else.  But the service is good quality and the aesthetic of the restaurant is pretty also.  Just make sure when eating here, you don't mind the Korean x American fusion of cuisine because I wasn't expecting it.
