Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Awesome service & food! Nice cozy decor with exposed brick walls. Started off with peppered duck goat cheese terrine appetizer which turned out to be Â our favorite item from menu! We also ordered beef tongue & beef stroganoff for entrees and corn & fries as sides. Food was a little on the heavier side but all were pretty good. Still the appetizer & sourdough bread were the stars of the night! I would definitely return next time I'm in Chicago!
