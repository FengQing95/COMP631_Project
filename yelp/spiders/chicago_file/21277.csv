Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So Chicago is a great city that I just started getting used to last year because of work. I mean, how can you hate a city that has awesome pizza, steaks, and popcorn (Garrett). But let's jump right into why you are reading this review to begin with. When I first got here, I was searching for the best deep dish pizza I could find and I was excited. I had ordered Giordano's originally and it was solid do not get me wrong but there is nothing like a Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza.
