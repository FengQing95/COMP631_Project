The Purple Pig////Purple pig is where my partner and I had our first date, and we've made a point to dine here every time we visited Chicago, until we moved out west. Didn't have a Yelp account back then haha. I was sad to see the location change and consequent change of interior design, as I loved the previous wooden walls, dark ambiance and quirky art. We were here for a quick lunch before our flight, and I'm happy that they have kept majority of their menu. I'm happier that the dishes were just as great as I had remembered them, maybe a tad saltier but overall consistent from four, five years ago. Still the best roasted bone marrow I've had and a truly amazing pork shoulder that melts in your mouth. Grilled broccoli is tart snd tangy so skip if you're not into that! Perfectly cooked scallops with the tagliatelle, could use a little more marinara though. Can't go wrong with foie gras - creamy and buttery.
