Art Institute of Chicago////This museum is huge. It is the first time I felt relieved instead of cheated upon seeing closed wings. Having no time limit and a slight compulsion to finish whatever I start, I was exhausted at the end.  Among the permanent collection, the Monet Haystacks made me fall in love with impressionism again. On my visit the special exhibitions included Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity; Undressed: The Fashion of Privacy; and Zarina: Paper Like Skin.  My impression of the modern art wing: piles of crap on the floor. At the same time, I loved Zarina. One of her works were approximately 20 sheets of paper, each pricked by pins numerous times. May you love this museum as well. Enjoy.
