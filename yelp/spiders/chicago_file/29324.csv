Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First timers! At suggestion of staff, came for Saturday early lunch and we were immediately seated vs a 2 hour wait afternoon the day before.  Estaban was our wonderful server. Keeping a conscious mind toward Chicago food plans for the day and trying to be somewhat healthy, we started with a cup of delicious minestrone soup. So flavorful.  We then each only had room for a single slice of Lou's traditional butter crust pie bringing 1/2 the pizza back to in room hotel refrigerator. Estaban packed it in foil and plastic so it didn't dry out in the box. We are happily taking it home to Pittsburgh for dinner tonight. Our fellow passengers on our flight may catch a whiff of our leftover pizza, but let em be jelly. Thanks, LM and Estaban!
