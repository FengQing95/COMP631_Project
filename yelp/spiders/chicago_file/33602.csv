Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////There is a reason this place is impossible to get a reservation at. First and foremost, the food is excellent. The peppered duck and goat cheese terrine (very large portion) is a great start, or the goat cheese terrine. The smoked whitefish ceasar is the most amazing salad in existence (in fact I will just order like 3 of those when I go there next weekend). The classic ribeye was cooked to a beautiful medium consistency, and paired nicely with the elotes side dish (A MUST). The roasted bone marrow, which I was hesitant about at first, was seasoned nicely and actually quite amazing. Even the thick maple bacon was incredible. If I didn't have a shellfish allergy, I'd be trying all the oysters because they look phenomenal and all the tables around us had them. Add a few shots of the Jameson shot with spiced pickleback (I know it sounds strange, just get it). Leave room for plenty of cocktails. Possibly even dessert.. although I have yet to try this.
