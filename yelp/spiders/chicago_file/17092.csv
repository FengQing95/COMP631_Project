Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's okay.  Exactly like Gino's East, Uno, Due, Giordano's (who sold out about 4-5 years ago and is not so great but has incredibly long lines so go figure!). The place on Wells and the new one on Rush are both nice. I like Connie's, (so that may be a guide for Chicagoans). It's the Chicago Pizza.  Just do not go to their other place, Pizano's on Rush. Ugh! Not nearly as good, in fact, not good with crumby service. Now, if you are looking for delicious Chicago pizza that is not deep dish or pan, which are exactly the same thing here in Chicago, ... you must have Pompei.  They spell it with one 'i'. The one on Taylor is the best! The original owners, well, his grandson.
