Little Goat Diner////While waiting for our food, I noticed that Kanye West was blaring on the sound system. The music was a little loud for my taste, but I did like the contemporary selection on the playlist. The restaurant had warm lighting and high ceilings. Although our table shared a partition with another dining party, I was not at all distracted by their conversation (probably because the music drowned them out). The attire of the staff gave me a country western vibe. Our server was attentive and I loved how often my glass of water was refilled.
