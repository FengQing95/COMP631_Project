Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Keep in mind, this is my first and only experience with deep dish pizza (West Coaster here) but I have to say that I thought it was delicious. Being from the thin crust coast, it almost isn't like pizza. It's kind of it's own amazing entree.... but in Chicago this is what pizza is meant to be!
