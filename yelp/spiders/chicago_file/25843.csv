Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There is a massive amount of cheese and bread, causing most human beings not to be able to finish a small pie. I was able to get through three out of the four slices. But those three slices were absolute perfection. Everything mixed perfectly. And just when you think it can't any better, you get to the crust, which is crispy buttery goodness that is seriously almost as good as the pizza. I'm not a crust guy at all, but this crust is amazing.
