Little Goat Diner////I was so ready to give this place 5 stars but sadly, I think this place is all hype. Â The service is ok at best. The food leaves much to be desired and is hit or miss. I understand it's a goat theme, but some combinations in this restaurant just didn't work. It seemed like some of the dishes were just thrown together just for the sake of being creative, while compromising quality.
