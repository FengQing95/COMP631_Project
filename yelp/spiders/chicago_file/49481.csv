Smoque BBQ////Finally got to try the fantastic Smoque and it did not disappoint.  I tried the beef brisket and the Texas sausage and they were both great - not overpowering, just pleasant and tasty.  And the sides, oh man, the sides.  The mac and cheese is excellent - next to Kuma's and Handlebar on my favorites list.  The peach cobbler, slaw and corn muffins are also wonderful.  I doubt you can really get anything bad on the menu.  What's funny is that this place is actually kind of high-end, but it is modeled after more earthy and grubby places with the trays and paper place mats (no plates) and tins of sides.  The only problem is, like most above-average spots, this place gets really busy after 4pm most of the time, especially on the weekends.  I'd recommend going at off times if you can.
