Little Goat Diner////I will definitely go back to Little Goat! I ended up venturing out to LG on a last minute date (1AM) if you want to call it that. I had the Los Drowned and my "date" (super flakey female) had the Bull's Eye French Toast and both were absolutely delicious. So many different flavors all married together so nicely. I had a cocktail as well and it was also very good. I definitely will recommend this place if you're up for waiting for a table. I hear they have long waits during the day and in the evening. Just make sure you have good company!
