Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Beyond the delicious pizza, the three cheese bread here is a great appetizer to munch on while you wait for your pizza. The service here is just great. Our server was friendly and very accommodating. The most annoying thing that you might run into here is the wait to get a table. Basically, when we left, there was a line around the street corner, which is pretty crazy. If this is your only time visiting Chicago, it probably is worth the wait. Otherwise, I would highly suggest coming at an off-time before the dinner rush or just take out.
