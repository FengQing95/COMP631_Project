Smoque BBQ////Great place to eat.  Food is amazing.  You will usually have to wait up to a half hour but they keep things moving.  They will try to keep you happy when you are waiting to be seated.  It's byob so that's a plus if you enjoy an occasional beverage.  This is a must eat place if you live near or have easy access to the blue line.  I always take out of town visitors here and they are never disappointed.
