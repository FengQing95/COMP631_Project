Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is definitely worth the wait. My boyfriend and I waited for about an hour for a table for two. It was very crowded but the atmosphere was good and time passed by quickly by the bar. The pre ordering of pizza saved so much time! It was ready within 15 minutes of us sitting down. Our server was so nice and everything tasted so good! Will definitely be back!
