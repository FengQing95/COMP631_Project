Smoque BBQ////I went here for lunch with my husband .  I had the pulled pork sandwich with corn bread and slaw.  I thought it was very tasty!   The slaw was fresh and vinegar based, if you like that.  I found it very refreshing on a hot summer day and a good balence with the smoky meat.  I can't  say enough about the meat, Wow!  My husband had the brisket and ribs, he is now addicted to both.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  like a dummy I ran out when our Uber showed up without my purse.  One of the staff came out and chased us down.  Thanks for saving me from myself, you guys rock!
