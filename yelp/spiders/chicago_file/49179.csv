Smoque BBQ////The best part of the evening was that, near the end of our meal, another couple asked us (very politely) if we were almost done, so they could have our seat (the place was very packed and there was a line outside the door for seating).  Apparently, the staff thought that their intrusion was worth giving us 2 free peach cobblers to go, even though we did not complain or show any hint of being offended.  This is service at its best.
