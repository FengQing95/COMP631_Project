Little Goat Diner////Little Goat is a fun casual place to grab a quick meal. The diner has an open and airy feel with great natural light. Prices are reasonable and portions are good sized. Service was quick and attentive. The hot crab dip was a definite winner, make sure to get extra crackers. The burger and Low Drowned sandwich were both tasty options, but I do feel not serving fries or a side with sandwiches is a little cheap. Having to order a $6 side order of smoked fries seems a bit much. The fries are big enough for two luckily, but we did not get any real smokiness from them.
