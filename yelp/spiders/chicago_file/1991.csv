Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Everything was awesome. Some of the best pancakes I've ever tasted and with fresh berries on top and a vanilla bean custard sauce! My husband got the waffle with berries and again: so good. The hashes looked amazing too, we are thinking of coming back before we leave Chicago and trying one of those as they looked like what everyone was ordering and so good! You can't go wrong eating here. Big menu also, so most everyone will find something they like.
