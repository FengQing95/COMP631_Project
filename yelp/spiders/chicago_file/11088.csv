Art Institute of Chicago////I fell in love with this museum. They have quite a selection, I just wished I had enough time to visit the entire place. I checked out the contemporary and architecture and design section the most since that's what I enjoy, but I also visit some of the other great work. The museum is beautiful. I loved how friendly the staff was and the fact that they have several cafe stands through the museum just in case you want sometime to relax.
