Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////While our server was great and super sweet, I find it completely inappropriate that the restaurant has a policy where they led us to a "clean table" with the previous table's credit card receipt on it. We told staff to take it, and the hostess and busser both said "that's not for you. Leave it here for your server." We were able to see the customer's cc info on it. As a customer, I feel completely unsafe with this policy and find it completely unprofessional. This review is purely on this poor policy.
