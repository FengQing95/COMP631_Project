Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Spiritually this place reaches a level of intoxication via food in me that I cannot fully describe. Yeah it will take a lil bit to get to you if you ask for it delivered but oh my goodness is this the clutch meal when seasonal depression kicks in. Bless yourself and order some dew dish from ya boy Lou. The cheese will fill the void in your empty heart.
