Little Goat Diner////We were seated at the worst table in the restaurant- a booth next to the hostess stand at the end of the row. First, there is a clear panel that separates it from the table next to it, which was extremely distracting, but I can get over it. What I can't get over is the fact that EVERY staff member who walked by bashed into or slapped the back of my bench, which was extremely disruptive to my meal. Seriously, if you get seated here, ask them to seat you anywhere else- even the counter!
