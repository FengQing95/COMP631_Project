Little Goat Diner////We got here at 11 am on a Saturday and put down our name for four people.  We were told that the wait was an hour and ten minutes if we were okay with cafeteria seating, and an additional ten minutes if we wanted our own booth.  We asked for a booth.  We ended up waiting an hour, and an additional half an hour for our food after we ordered.  Had to run outside and feed the parking meter, because we only put two hours in.
