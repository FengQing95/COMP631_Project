Art Institute of Chicago////I'm no art expert, but I came away from the Art Institute in awe of the level of human creativity found within those halls.  To be honest, I was overwhelmed by the amount of pieces that I under appreciated or simply was not able appreciate because of the museum's magnitude.  This is a good thing, however, because I am yearning to go back for more.
