Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am normally patient with restaurant during busy hours but if you are short staffed or whatever reason it may be .  The restaurant needs to let the customers know better approx of when they can expect their food.  If the food will take 2 hours let me know it will take 2 hours and not 1 hour 20 mins.  The staff was not apologetic that the food was delayed after asking them for updates 5 times for foods and being told the food would be ready in 20 mins. No matter how good the food is there needs to be better management.
