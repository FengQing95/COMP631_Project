Little Goat Diner////The second time I wanted something small, so just had some cheesey grits and a biscuit. I had seen someone get the grist the first time around and just had to go back for them. They were very fluffy and defintely cheesy. The biscuit was square, flaky and good, but it was more like a pastry than a biscuit. I still enjoyed it though.
