Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ordered two pizzas for to be ready for pickup at 7:30. At 7:45 they told us there was a mistake and one of the pizzas had to be "remade", taking 20-25 minutes. At 8:05, they told us a mistake had been made again and the pizza would take another 20-25 to be ready, when it finally came out at 8:35. Manager made the order free and gave us free deserts, but I would rather have paid for the pizza to be ready on time.
