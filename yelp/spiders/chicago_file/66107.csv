Smoque BBQ////This place only does outdoor dining for the time being. My husband and I went here for the first time for dinner because we will be moving to the area in a few days. It was delicious and the weather was nice, so we had an enjoyable experience. Something to note, we were obviously having a brain fart because we thought the mac and cheese was the cornbread, but it just looked super similar. Regardless, the host Henry was super helpful with helping us and even after we realized our mistake, they still let us keep the extra mac (so sorry!). Truly though, everyone working was so involved, friendly and efficient. You don't really see that nowadays, especially with working outside. We are excited to keep on going here. Â
