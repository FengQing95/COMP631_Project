Smoque BBQ////It never ceases to amaze me how BBQ is truly the great divider.  I did lunch at smoque with a group of co-workers when it first opened.  Like most BBQ places smoque specializes in southern style comfort dishes in this case memphis and texas. The brisket seemed to be a favorite and one of my coworkers was immediately in love with it. The sides are standard- mac n cheese, cornbread, coleslaw, bbq beans.  I had the chicken entree- which was tender and moist.  The sauce was great ( I'm no bbq purist).  The baked beans were thick and sweet- really baked!  And the coleslaw was cold and fresh and tangy.   The service is fast and the food is fresh.  I couldn't afford to come here for lunch everyday but it was a nice treat. It's a good meal that will leave you full, comfortable and ready for a nap.  After the meal I came back to work and made a cup of black tea to stay awake at my desk.
