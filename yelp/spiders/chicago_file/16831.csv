Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is an outstanding pizza place to visit in Chicago and this is coming from a New Yorker. The deep dish pizza was unbelievable the ambience and the waitstaff was incredible. Make sure you go there with a big appetite because for four of us it was very hard to complete one pizza pie.
