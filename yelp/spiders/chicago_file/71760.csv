Little Goat Diner////Service was slower than expected on a Saturday morning. We were waiting for water for what must have been close to 10 minutes after we were seated. Overall a pretty underwhelming experience that doesn't leave me craving a second visit, especially given the incredible array of great food Chicago has to offer.
