Smoque BBQ////Now that you understand how the place runs let me tell you the food is nothing like fast food. The who meal was amazing and I suggest you get one thing and everyone else gets something else so you can sample a little of this and a little of that. Be aware though that they run out of stuff fast due to the fact that they make bbq the way it should be made, over hours or days of cooking. So when they are out, they are out til tomorrow.
