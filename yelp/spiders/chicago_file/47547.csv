Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was my first visit to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba and I will definitely be going back. I went for a date night and this was the perfect spot for that. We made reservations and were seated right away. I enjoyed the atmosphere - very cozy and well decorated. We ordered sangria, the marinara with goat cheese, and seafood paella. Everything was delicious, and we received generous portions. I highly recommend this for a special dinner out!
