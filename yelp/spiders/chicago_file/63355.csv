Smoque BBQ////I have had this place several times and I'm very torn. The key to BBQ is the sauce and for me that's #1 most important thing. The sauce just isn't here for me here. However I will say all of the sides are banging. The Mac and cheese, cobbler, chili and fries are soooo good. I would highly recommend the chili. The chicken is fall off the bone juicy. But again it brings me back to my original point I don't totally love the sauce. Definitely worth a try
