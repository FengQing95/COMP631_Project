Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I went to Bavette's for the first time last night. The atmosphere was beautiful, every bite of food we had Â was INCREDIBLE. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because we were seated somewhat close to where the waiters took care of the bills, and although everyone was very nice to us, we could hear them complaining about various things. It really brought down the experience.
