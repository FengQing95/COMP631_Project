Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My friend loves this place because of its Tapas styled food. The ambience is ok, although I felt the food was overrated and the space is a little crammed. But this place is in high demand and many people frequent it. So like my friend, many people love to visit this place. So if you are into Tapas food, you will love it, if not, then you like me will not be a huge fan.
