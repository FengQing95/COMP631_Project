Art Institute of Chicago////One of the best museums in Chicago, maybe even in the entire country! I spent 3 hours in there and didn't even see everything. Their impressive collection is very vast and massive. The information people there are very helpful and knowledgeable. One thing to note is that they rotate their pieces out, sometimes for months at a time. They said it was to loan the artwork out, or sometimes it was to preserve the pieces. It is a bummer when you come from out of town and can't see some of your favorite pieces. Other than that I have nothing to complain about. This is one of my favorite things to do in Chicago.
