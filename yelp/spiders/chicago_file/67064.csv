Little Goat Diner////Went to Little Goat on a Tuesday night around 6pm and surprisingly no wait for a table of two. We ordered the fish tostadas and the "fat club" sandwich, both of which were great. The fish tostadas were my favorite, the homemade tortilla chips were super crispy and I could have eaten more of those on their own. The dessert menu is also not to be missed, we ordered the choco taco and peppermint patti sundaes, both were very unique. The choco taco was made with sour cream ice cream and had layers of chocolate taco pieces. I loved the taco pieces but was not sure I really love the taste of sour cream in ice cream. The peppermint patti sundae had a Vietnamese chocolate ice cream that was somewhat spicy, layered with chocolate cake and chocolate fudge. Again, the ice cream choice was somewhat strange and the spicy aftertaste was not something I was expecting, but the chocolate cake layers were amazing. I think they should start selling slices of that great cake!
