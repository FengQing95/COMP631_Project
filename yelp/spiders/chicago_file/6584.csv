The Purple Pig////Another place in Chicago where the wait is long, so here's my tip: GO TO THE BAR and see if anyone is leaving or is on their last course/paying bills and wait nearby for them to leave and get in contact with the server who is taking orders for the bar- she will help you grab those seats after! When you only have a few days to spend in Chicago- time is important- we saved an hour of waiting by doing this!
