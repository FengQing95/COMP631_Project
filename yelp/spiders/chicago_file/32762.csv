Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We went back upstairs b/c I wanted to be visible as it had been over 20 min and I was starving and annoyed. A reservation in my book means, you have a table you are holding that is OPEN. Not one that you hope opens up 30 min after I get there. We sit at the now empty couch and a waiter approaches us asking if we want a drink. I furrow my brow and tell him we just want our table, since we have been waiting over 20-25 min. He asked if we wanted a mgr to come over and I said no, I just want to order food as we are supposed to be meeting friends at 9:30pm. About 5 min later the hostess seats us in the waiter's section who initially approached us, he was the ONLY positive about our evening.
