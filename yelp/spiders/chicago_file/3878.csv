The Purple Pig////Man alive, this restaurant just gets better and better (and it was pretty great to start with). Came a few years ago when I was last in Chicago, was blown away by the terrific dishes. New location but dare I say they've even stepped it up a notch beyond? The beet dish is divine - get it. The pistachio cream underneath is the most ingenious and spectacular foil for the sweet and sour beet and creamy feta. The pork shoulder was melt in your mouth tender and sooooooo flavorful. Properly seasoned juice pork is like a once in a lifetime experience and this one couldn't have been better. Delicious gnocchi, fabulous octopus, great cocktails, superb service EVEN WITH KIDS. There were dozens of dishes on the menu we would have been thrilled to try - it was so difficult narrowing down to a reasonable list and seriously, everything we tried was incredible. If only they would take reservations! I hate having to worry after a spot in line - just let people reserve!! Make em pay if they don't show up.
