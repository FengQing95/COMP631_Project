Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is one of the best steakhouses I've been to in Chicago. I came here to celebrate an anniversary and everything was amazing, including the service! My boyfriend and I split the 22oz bone in dry aged ribeye, which was a perfect size for two of us, complemented by two sides. We ordered the Brussels sprouts and elote corn (both sooo delicious). Our waiter Ben asked if we wanted dessert and we told him we were thinking about the carrot cake but had to ponder it for a few minutes because we were pretty full. A few minutes later a huge slice of carrot cake with a sparkler came to our table, courtesy of Ben! Also, you can bring your own bottle of wine as long as you send a glass to another diner :) Definitely would recommend coming here if you can get a reservation and don't mind splurging on a great meal!
