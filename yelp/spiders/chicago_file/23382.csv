Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first time here. I ordered mozzarella sticks and a deep dish pizza. It was a Wednesday night I gave my number and only waited 15 mins for a table. They let me put the pizza order in early, so it would be ready by the time the table was. When I asked the person at the door if they had beef sausage he said yes. When I got to the cashier they told me it was mixed with pork. Also when we were seated no one informed the waitress that the pizza was pre ordered. Personally I like Giordano's better but their pizza was still good. I think the staff should communicate better though. Overall the service was good and everyone was nice.
