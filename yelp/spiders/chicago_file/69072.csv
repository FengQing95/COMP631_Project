Little Goat Diner////Inexplicably, even if you've had a dish a million times before in a dozen other diners, you've never had it like this. Beef ravioli. Doesn't sound like much, but there is nothing simple about the mix of flavors once the sauce hits your tongue, combinations of spices that, for some reason, no one has thought to put together before. Just amazing. Get this. You won't regret it. I will somehow have to convince myself to give another dish a try next time, but I may lose all willpower to do so when I see that beef ravioli on the menu.
