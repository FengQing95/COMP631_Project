Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My family was visiting from Los Angeles and was told this had great pizza. I was alarmed that the staff was so rude and unprofessional. The meal took over an hour to prepare. We ordered drinks, but as the only black couple in the place we were told we must consume our drinks outside on the side walk. Our chairs were taken away from us while white customers were allowed to sit. I give this place a zero rating. I would not suggest that black people not patronize this please.
