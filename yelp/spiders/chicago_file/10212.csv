Art Institute of Chicago////If you are visiting town, you will want to add this to your agenda. If you are local, get yourself a membership and explore this collection regularly. Members get discounts on audio guides and exclusive access to special exhibits for the first hour after opening. This is a great way to pop in and see something new and we always take advantage of this perk.
