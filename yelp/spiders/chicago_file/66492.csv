Little Goat Diner////Stopped in for breakfast on our last morning in Chicago, and it did not disappoint! We were seated well within the suggested wait time, but while we waited we grabbed a coffee and pastry next door. Stumptown was delicious as always, but the house-made Sweet Cream took it up a notch. My friend and I were seated at the Diner bar, which was fine by us; it offered a nice (and appetizing) view of the kitchen. We ordered the Bulls Eye French toast (a little egg-y but overall delicious), biscuits and gravy (best biscuit I've ever had), and hash browns. Portions were generous, wait staff was friendly. All together a great visit!
