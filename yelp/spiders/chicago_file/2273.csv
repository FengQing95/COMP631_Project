The Purple Pig////My friend and I split the JLT Pork Jowl ($13), Squid stuff with Prosciutto ($15) and Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with mashed potatoes ($13). We weren't starving when we came but still hungry and we're full by the time we got our last dish. Everything we got was amazing!! I think the flavor that was definitely most intriguing and memorable is the Squid. The black sauce that it comes with brought the dish to a whole other level! Wish I could eat it again!
