Art Institute of Chicago////What I really like about this place is that they also give you a 1-hour map to hit up some of the famous exhibits, like Andy Warhol, Picasso, Budda scuptures, and etc. My absolute favorite was the miniature room display. I could have spent an entire day, mesmerized by the intricate designs of each furniture piece, background art and mini-tapestries. I'd get the Citypass, since it comes with the audio tour.
