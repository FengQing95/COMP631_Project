Smoque BBQ////Luckily, I always seem to miss the ridiculously long lines here.  I've been here a few times now and I always at least get the brisket as part of my meal.  The pulled pork is good, but I've always preferred some good smoked brisket.  I've had the brisket chopped and sliced and I personally prefer it sliced.  I like to see how juicy the meat is and the defined smoke ring near the edges whereas when it's chopped, the consistency is more like shredded beef.  Smoque's sliced brisket is definitely top 3 in Chicago.
