Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ordered for delivery to my hotel. Easy ordering, delivered quickly, was at the right temperature, and they even brought me a plate, silverware, pepper flakes and Parmesan! I ordered a personal deep dish and it was good. I highly recommend getting the butter crust because you can taste the difference. It came with lots of cheese and abundant toppings. The tomato sauce was bland though. It tasted like it's missing something like maybe some salt? That's why I gave it only 4/5 stars. Overall it was a good pizza and I'd highly recommend!
