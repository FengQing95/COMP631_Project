Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The appetizers/tapas were fairly good, and the desserts were great (special shout out to the Macrona almond tart, baby you rocked my world).  Nice atmosphere as well, although it is very hard to hear past the person seated next to you.  The reason for my three star review was how utterly disappointed I was in the main course (we ordered both the seafood and the chicken paella).  The rice was far too short on the saffron and far too strong on the tomato, and paella should never be overwhelmingly tomato.  If I came back here, I'd skip the paella and just do tapas and dessert.
