Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////this is a great place to go with friends.  Of course if you're going to get a large portioned meal, this is not the place to go!  This is a tapas restaurant, and for those who do not speak the spanish language, tapas means "little portions!"  They also have great sangria selections to choose from.
