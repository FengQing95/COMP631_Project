Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Horrible! I was expecting greater things from 'Chicago's best pizza', and my god! Did it disappoint! I took my out-of-town friend here to show him what the big fuss about Lou Malnati's was. First we got an appetizer of Garlic bread. I would expect some fantastic dish from this place, but what comes out? COLD pieces of Garlic bread which tastes exactly like it came from the frozen section in any supermarket. When we complained that it was so cold, the server doesn't even ask if we would like to replace it. All she says is 'I can toss it into the oven and reheat it for you". I was like 'Whhhaattt?' Which restaurant does that?And doesn't she know that bread loses it's moisture and gets more crisp if re-baked! Frustrating!. We then got a veggie deep dish pizza with mushrooms, onion, olives and spinach. The pizza takes over 40 minutes to come and when it does, it's like this big goo of marinara sauce over a buttery crust. The crust had no salt, the sauce was like fresh tomatoes with no seasoning and we couldn't even taste any of the vegetables. I will definitely not be there again. I rather have amazing pizza for half the price and various other local pizzerias in town.
