Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We shared a personal sized pizza and side salad. It may seem like not a lot of food, but it was the perfect amount for us. Being tourists, we didn't want leftovers, as we were continuing our day in the city and didn't want to take food with us. Â The pizza was very filling and rich. I'm not a huge fan of deep dish pizza in general. I am more of a thin crust person. However, this was a good deep dish pizza experience. The crust was crispy and buttery, sauce was tasty and not too salty. The cheese was good quality, not too rubbery. I liked the long string of cheeses that come off the pizza when you try to eat it. The server gave us the heads up that the pizza would take 30 minutes, which we were prepared for and fine with. Good quality food takes time.
