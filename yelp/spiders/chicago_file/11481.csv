Art Institute of Chicago////I could have spent an hour staring at this thing because it is memorizing and amazing at the same time.  From far and near scanning different areas of dots it's like being hypnotized.  The edge of the painting even... it's also "self framed" in dots too.  Crazy and mysterious and genius all at the same time... and this is just the FIRST piece of art of the day.  Mind you this one of the hallmark pieces and one of the ones I had wanted to see so much time was spent viewing this Seurat.
