Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Favorite Chicago pizza. Make sure it try the Lou or the sausage pizza. Deep dish is a must at this place it will change your life. Also I love ranch and giardinara with my pizza so ask for them on the side. Some restaurants have different appetizers I love the mozzarella sticks they are baked perfectly. Also adding the butter crust is a must to every deep dish order.
