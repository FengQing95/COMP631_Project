Little Goat Diner////-Horseshoe: eh. It's a burger, chili, cheese sauce and fries (much like a famous Springfield dish). The smoked fries had a weird flavor and the burger had too much seasoning. The seasoned burger, seasoned chili, and presumably seasoned cheese sauce just made for too much seasoning in this entree.
