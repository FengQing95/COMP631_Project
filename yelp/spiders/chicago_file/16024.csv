Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We stopped in before heading back to Michigan, getting seated right before a line started forming at the door. They sat us right in front of the window and there were people lining out the door around 6 pm. Foursquare users suggest you place your pizza order on the waiting list if you have to wait -- your pizza will be ready right about the time you get seated.
