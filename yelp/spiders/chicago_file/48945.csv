Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Seriously, this place is worth going to even just for the passionfruit sangria. All of the food dishes were on par with the drinks though, which is rare! The bacon-wrapped dates are a favorite of ours and the croquetas (and the garlic sauce they come with!) are the definition of comfort food. We've been here a few times and will definitely keep coming back.
