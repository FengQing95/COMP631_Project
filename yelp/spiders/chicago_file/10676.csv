Art Institute of Chicago////If you're more of a loser and plan on moving through slowly, I HIGHLY recommend paying the extra $7 to get the audio tour. There was a lot of helpful information in this. You just entered the three-digit code on an item's placard and your walkie-talkie started telling you a 30-second description, indicating what you should be noticing about the work, or things to look for in the background or from another angle.
