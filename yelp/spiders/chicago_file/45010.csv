Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The asparagus salad was tasty but not terribly impressive. The scallops with couscous and the beef tenderloin with blue cheese  were the best dishes - they were well cooked and had good flavor, but the temperature was off.  The chicken and chorizo was very plain - basically just meat on a stick without a whole lot to make it special.
