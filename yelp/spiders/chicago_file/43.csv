Au Cheval////Indulgent, elevated diner food that can't be found elsewhere.  Service was on point when we went on Friday night.  Arrived around 6:15 to a 30-40 minute wait, were encouraged to wait near the bar with a menu in a space with a dedicated server who would take care of our drink orders.  No trying to weasel past people sitting at the bar to get an order in.  I was impressed with how they handle the crowd at the very small restaurant.  The beer list is impressive with lots of drafts.  The food was all real tasty (burgers, bologna, fries, foie terrine, not for dieters) and reasonably priced.
