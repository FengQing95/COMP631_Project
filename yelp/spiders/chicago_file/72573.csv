Little Goat Diner////My partner and I grab coffee and pastries from the bakery almost every morning before I drop her off at work and we love it. This morning, we decided to take a look at the full menu, because I walked by a table on my way to the toilet and their food caught my eye (turned out to be the This Pig Went to China meal). We didn't have time this morning, but we went back for lunch this afternoon. We've never been so disappointed by a meal before. After enjoying countless breakfasts in the bakery, we've now come to find out that the hype about Little Goat's menu is unfounded. Both of our meals were essentially just plates full of grease. I ordered the China Pig thing, and she ordered crumpets. Huge letdown.
