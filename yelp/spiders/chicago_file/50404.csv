Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Since there are hundreds of reviews, my lowly review won't offset their rating.  (I've been waiting for this.  LoL. )  I've given the cafe more than one opportunity to wow me, but it hasn't.  I've walked in solo and with groups but haven't had a wowerful experience yet.  Is it me?!  I don't know. Were they off days?  I don't know.  Are the chefs ever changing? I don't know.  Too many I don't knows.  The one dish I do know I like, are the bacon wrapped dates and one time the house made sangria.  Beyond that..
