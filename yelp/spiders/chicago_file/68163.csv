Little Goat Diner////I wasn't blown away by this place. The service was slow in all aspects from someone taking our drink Â order to bringing the check. The food was okay. Ive had a lot better. People seemed to have hyped this place up that's why we stopped in. Doubt I'll come back. Way over priced and not worth it at all.
