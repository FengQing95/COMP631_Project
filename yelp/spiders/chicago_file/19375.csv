Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time visiting Chicago. The concierge at the hotel recommended this place and said it was the best for pizza. I'm not a big fan of deep dish pizza in the first place. I tried the "Lou" and it was just alright. It didn't have a lot of flavor to me. It was kind of bland. I also got the Malnati Salad which was amazing. That was the best part. Salad was on point. I would go back for the salad but not the pizza.
