Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Here's the kicker, I'd come in a few days prior to ask for a pizza box to take a picture with it in front of the Millennium Park bean. They wanted to charge me $2 for an empty box. I exclaimed shock at the price to which they responded "do you want us to charge you more?" I stated I'd prefer if they didn't charge for empty pizza boxes. It was pretty audacious of them to have given me such a hard time for an empty pizza box but I thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt.
