Art Institute of Chicago////Our true cost, however, was $2.50 above what we would have paid at the door.  How do I figure this?  Well, on our Sunday afternoon visit at the Art Institute of Chicago, there was no line at the side entrance off of E. Monroe Street.  We easily received two tickets for showing them our app - 1 Fast Pass Admission ticket, and 1 Audio Guide Rental ticket.  We did, however, have to scoot ourselves through the museum to the front entrance to exchange our 2nd tickets for the Audio Guides.  We all thought that these were great by the way!  It was interesting to hear the background to some of the pieces of art.  Honestly, we probably would not have thunk to rent these if not for its automatic inclusion with the Go Card admission.  This fact, and the ticket sales line we bypassed at 360 Chicago, and the possibility of bypassing any long general line at the museum was worth the extra $2.50 ($20 General Admission + $7 Audio + $20.50 360 Chicago = $47.50, which is less $2.50 than the $50 spent) in my book.
