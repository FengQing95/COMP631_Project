Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Not a place to go if you are looking for a "chill" or sedate environment but a great place to go when you want high energy, fun.   Reservations are usually accommodated within a reasonable time frame, say twenty minutes, but then again, the wait at the bar is usually a highlight of the evening.  The bartenders here are outstanding and pour some mean cocktails!  They are fast and relatively entertaining.
