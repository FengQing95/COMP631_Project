Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great decor if a bit uncomfortably and dangerously Â dark when navigating the stairs (especially at 6 pm on a sunny day...too dark to early!). After a rocky start when the manager miscomunicated about avaialbility about an immediate/early table despite no reservation, and a barely warm steak with equally not warm bear wise, the recovery was excellent. Great service from Tiley, Eric and Cailtin (spelling), in a beautiful decor and setting. God wines by the glass and delicious nouvelle French with some unusual but simply delicious flavored. their steak salt made me a salt lover. I had heard a lot about it and now i get it, I will be back.
