Smoque BBQ////My first BBQ place in the Chicago area. It was completely impromptu decision to stop here for lunch. Parked like two blocks away at the edge of the neighborhood by the highway. They had their own parking lot but not sure if its open to customers. They also have a large designated area for curbside orders and pick up. Of note, no burnt ends on their menu, no cash, BYOB.
