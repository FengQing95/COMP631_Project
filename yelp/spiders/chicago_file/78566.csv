Little Goat Diner////07/06/21: Very poor customer service! We requested a table outside and wanted to be separated a little from the crowd given the tables were SO CLOSE plus Covid and the scare regarding the delta variant. We asked very politely but they refused to budge and the guy was rude and stern with no apologies at all.. so we walked away. The table we asked for was maybe 2 extra feet away from the crowd, not proving an inconvenience to the establishment at all. For a Stephanie Izard restaurant, this is truly a shame, especially since their attitude has rubbed me the wrong way there and at Girl and the Goat before too. I'm a long time resident of the west loop and with so much competition around, I'm going to choose to not go here anymore.
