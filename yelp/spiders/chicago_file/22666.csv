Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Anyways, so it's really nice that they warn you that deep dish is made to order so takes 45min so obviously allocate time! I got myself the house salad ($6) and a beer ($5-7) so I wouldn't eat my friends hand off during those 45min hehe. Salad was good but if you aren't hungry, just wait to eat your pizza cause you don't need any sides!!
