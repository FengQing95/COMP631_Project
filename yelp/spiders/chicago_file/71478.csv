Little Goat Diner////First off, this place kinda intimidated me.  It's really cool.  But a comfortable cool.  The staff looked like they could tell I am way not cool. (no matter what my mom says) Turns out the staff is really nice, no comments about how not cool I am.  Really helpful.  One of the highlights for me (besides the food) was the sound track being played.  How often do you eat at a restaurant and get to hear "I left my wallet in El Segundo" by Tribe Called Quest?  Just makes everything taste better.
