Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Sinsational!!  One of the best meals ever !! They do things to the food that take it to another level. The Classic Ribeye was perfect.  The fried chicken is the best I have ever eaten. The truffle Mac and cheese is highly addictive.  We also had the Bibb salad with crab and Avocado that was fantastic and a meal in itself.
