Smoque BBQ////Two of us tried a half-half plate of brisket and pulled pork and one tried brisket and smoked sausage. Very tender with excellent smoke flavor - just the right amount! For me the BBQ sauces were ok, but this is such a personal choice it's hard to find any fault with them. We tried three sides. Slaw, which was good. The mac and cheese was average. Kind of soupy and thin. Nothing special. Fries were home cut. Good, but again nothing that spectacular compared to other places that offer them. Now the bread pudding was excellent. So a big plus for that.
