Smoque BBQ////It ain't no Texas bbq, but it sure is good for the midwest! I'd have to say - best bbq in Chicago. Ok fine, not that I've tried all of them in Chicago (I swear), but still, this is really good and legit stuff guys. Tried most of the meats on the menu - pork ribs fall off the bone, brisket is juicy, pulled pork melts in your mouth, and the bbq chicken was perfectly cooked, just about! Char grilled skin and errrrthang ;) Comes with sides - baked beans are amazing! Cole slaw and fries aint too shabby either.
