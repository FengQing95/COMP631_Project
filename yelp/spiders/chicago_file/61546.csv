Smoque BBQ////Saw on Diners, Drive In and Dives. Had super high expectations and was let down. We got there about 2:30 on a Saturday. No wait at all. I can understand why people say the wait is super long. Very small dining area. But it is quaint and nice. Service was very friendly. Why 3 stars??? Â I have had better BBQ at many other places (I love BBQ). The brisket should almost melt in your mouth....it didn't. Baby back ribs were tough. I did like that their neat was dry rubbed and they face you two wet sauces to dip. Two lunch entrees and soft drinks (no alcohol) was $40.00. I would opt for a better BBQ establishment in Chicago.
