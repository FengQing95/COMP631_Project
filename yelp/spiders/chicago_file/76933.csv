Little Goat Diner////There needs to be more oversight in the kitchen on what is being served to the customers. And I guess the expectation here is that since this is still a diner, the quantity of food is valued over the quality of food (or maybe it's just me). Well if that's the case, I'll probably go stick with the more well-known sister restaurant across the street for a tastier meal.
