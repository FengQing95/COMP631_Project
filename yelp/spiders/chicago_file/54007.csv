Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Okay, checking on us is good. But coming and asking too frequently whether we need anything else/ whether we're gonna order some more is a little uncomfortable. To me, experience is the second important thing (of course, the first thing is food) when I evaluate a restaurant but it was bad today. It felt like she wanted us to either order more or eat quickly and just leave. Yeah, more people started to come in for dinner but it wasn't that busy like last time when I came during the weekend. There were still empty tables. Also, when we got out receipt I wrote down my LettuceEats number on the receipt but it seemed like she didn't add it so I asked her and she said she'll add it later. I checked and it's not added.
