Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Fabulous! Early reso(5:15)...only time available, so I knew it would be crowded later. Sat us in a quaint corner table. Ambiance is masculine & sexy. Good vibe. Service was an A+! Ricky & Brandon were delightful...definitely a match made in heaven:) Food was delish. Started out with the 2# lobster cocktail...fresh...firm & sweet. Served with clarified butter, cocktail sauce and a zesty dijonaise. We shared the Southern Fried Chicken, Elote...and the Chocolate Cream Pie! Say Whatttt? That effing pie made me cream in my panties...just joshing...but I was close...ha! Thanks for a lovely experience, we will be back with a gaggle of ladies...who love to eat, drink & have a good ol time!
