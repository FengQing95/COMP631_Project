Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The only 2 reason's I will give Lou's 1 more chance & not walk an extra block to Gino's is because of our long relationship. I've been in love with Lou and his pizza at various locations all over Chicago for over 20yrs. You can't throw that history away. I don't know Gino.
