Art Institute of Chicago////If art is not your thing then don't bother. But if art is something you are interested in then The Art Insitute of Chicago is a must see. This place is huge, and I still haven't managed to go through everything. They have a nice impressionist collection, which is my favorite to be sure. I am looking forward to exploring the new wing. I still have a certain sense of awe that such great masterworks are hanging out right here in this city. Fantastic!
