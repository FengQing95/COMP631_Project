Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Excellent place. The decor was exceptional and the food was fantastic. The steak bone in ribeye steak was made to perfection and the shrimp de jonghe was very tasty. The atmosphere was very romantic and soothing. The jazz music was the perfect choice. I would definitely come back.
