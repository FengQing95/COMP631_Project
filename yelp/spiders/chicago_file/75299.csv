Little Goat Diner////This place is fun! I've had their absurdly giant multi meat burger that's still under $20 and their patty melt. They mix a pleasantly low key diner atmosphere and vibes with the high quality and creative cuisine we've come to expect from the West Loop. They tend to take an existing classic and add some twist that makes you appreciate it in a whole new way. I love fries far too much, and their Pork Belly Home Fries are unbelievable. Turns out adding pickled peppers. cilantro, and a fish sauce vinaigrette was just what fried potatoes needed!
