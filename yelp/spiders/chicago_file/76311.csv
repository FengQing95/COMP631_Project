Little Goat Diner////The French toast was pretty good. Flavorful with maple syrup, strawberries, and cooked well. I wasn't expecting the Bulls eye to be sunny side up eyes in the actual bread. It was interesting since I usually overlook my eggs. I will return for another meal in the future but probably won't order that again.
