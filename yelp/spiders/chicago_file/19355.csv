Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Months before my trip to Chicago, I was extremely excited to try Lou Malnati's pizza. I had read several great reviews and was convinced that this was where I wanted to try some classic Chicago deep-dish pizza. Although my family from Chicago advised me that UNO Pizzeria was better, I decided to still try it out. We ended up ordering a classic pepperoni deep-dish pizza and I was fairly disappointed...It was good, but it didn't meet the high expectations that I had expected. Particularly, the crust was my favorite part about their pizza. It was very nice, flakey, and buttery, Â but I guess I was expecting a thicker pizza with more sauce/ less cheese. Personally, I prefer a fair amount of sauce on my pizza and the Lou Malnati pizza had a lot more cheese vs. sauce. So, I will say that the pizza from Lou Malnati's was good, but the pizza we later ended up getting from UNO was GREAT.
