The Purple Pig////Had high expectations Bc this place is super popular and well known in Chicago but I felt it was pretty underwhelming. We ordered the tuna tartare, broccoli and Berkshire shoulder. The tuna tartare was so pretty in presentation and it was delicious as well. The cracker/chip was super flaky and crispy at the same time and the tuna tartare was flavored very nicely. The other two dishes were pretty heavy and were mediocre in my opinion.
