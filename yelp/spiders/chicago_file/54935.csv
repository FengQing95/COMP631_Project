Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I realize that technology does evolve and it changes the way restaurants can operate, but I was so disappointed that this restaurant decided to adopt the, "We will text you when your table is ready" format.  The hostess (Not Anita- Anita is the best ever) barely looked at us and barely spoke to us except to take our name for the reservation and confirm our phone number.  I don't want to keep looking at my phone, I want to look at my husband and enjoy our date night.  I want to people watch and enjoy the ambiance.   No- please take your attention away from all that and check your phone.  I don't have toddlers anymore and I DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT MY PHONE.
