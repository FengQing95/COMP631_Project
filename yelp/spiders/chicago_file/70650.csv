Little Goat Diner////Eating is a way to enjoy Chicago's winter Life. I went to LITTLE GOAT for brunch today, price range is around $25 per person. There was a short wait when we arrived at 11:30 A.M., thanks for the tip Kelsey Che , we get seated within 30 minutes. The atmosphere was trendy and classy, perfect for brunch. For entree, we ordered Brandade and Belly, and the BULL's eye french toast. Brandade and Belly, which served with brandade, pork belly, sunny side eggs, biscuit and kimchi. According to wikipedia, brandade is a dish consisting of salt cod mixed into olive oil and milk. This dish was very interesting and unique. It was similar to Benedict, maybe Korean one? haha The pork belly cooked perfectly and very juicy. It went well with Kimichi. Glad that I ordered it. For BULL's eye French toast, it caught my eyes which had eggs, CRISPY chicken, sweet onion brioche, and bbq maple syrup. The egg cooked perfectly with yolk once you cut through. You could taste egg, onion, chicken, syrup, and fresh strawberries all at once. It is a mixed favor with sweet and savory. It was absolutely delicious. Lastly, for the drink, "THE LITTLE GOAT", it is espresso, chai species and goat's milk. Also you will find the little goat logo is hidden inside the coffee cup, which it was very cute ! What a casual place with quality food. Once again, it is a Perfect place for BRUNCH.
