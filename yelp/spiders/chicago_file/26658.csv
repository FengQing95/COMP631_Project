Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm a lifelong Chicagoan, so I take deep dish pizza very seriously.  In my mind, the two best places are the original Uno's and Due's, and Lou Malnati's.  Lou Malnati's has a little bit of a sweeter crust--especially if you ask for butter crust, which makes it richer and crispier.  I would ask for extra sauce on their pizzas--I think the standard way they do it doesn't give the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese.  They also do a decent Caesar salad to snack on while you wait.  Full bar and good beers on tap.  Service is always friendly.  Prepare for a long wait if you go at a popular time.
