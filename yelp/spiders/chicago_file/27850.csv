Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's Pizzeria was okay. Just okay. It was insanely busy - we had to wait 2 hours. The food was mediocre. Our group of 4 was seated at a tiny table. Our appetizer plates were never removed off of our table, so when our pizza came, we literally had no where to eat. The staff seemed nice, no problem there. However, the whole restaurant was over hyped and disappointed us in general.
