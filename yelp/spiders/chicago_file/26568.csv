Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't like the go-to chain in Chicago for Chicago-style.  I do like Lou's, however, because the crust has some flavor and the toppings aren't overwhelmed by too much cheese.  You should always order ahead of time if you don't want to wait for 75 minutes once you've placed the order.  You want to get the disc of sausage for at least one of your toppings.
