Little Goat Diner////I ordered the Pork Belly Home fries and the The Little Piggy Goes to China (I'm totally making these names up from memory, so don't quote me on these dish names) and I was highly impressed. I'm always weary of Asian fusion places, but the cooks execute the mixture of flavors PERFECTY. To simply describe it, I was essentially having Asian comfort food.
