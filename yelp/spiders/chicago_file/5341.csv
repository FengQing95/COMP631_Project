The Purple Pig////Onto the food!  The menu is constantly changing but one dish we ALWAYS order is the Chicken Thigh Kebabs with smashed fried potatoes and tzatziki.  So much yumminess!  Their veggies are also surprisingly good, and the grilled octopus we had the last time we went was also very tasty. Food is served tapas style, so it's technically smaller, shared plates, but priced a little higher than typical tapas.but it's so good it's worth it!
