Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was so excited to run to Lou Malnati's for my 1st Chicago Pizza experience in Chicago! First of all the wait for pizza was over an hour and when it came it had zero tomato sauce on it so we had to wait another half an hour for them to heat up tomato sauce for us. The crust was kinda hard and not buttery like I like it. On the up side the ingredients did taste fresh. It was a very sad experience, so we went in search for a better one..
