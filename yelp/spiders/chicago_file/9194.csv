Art Institute of Chicago////I love coming here.  AIC has such a fantastic collection of cool, brilliant and/or famous stuff from nearly every period. The place is huge with lots of stuff to see for whatever time frame you have available. The building doesn't feel overwhelming big though, it feels inviting.  The two shops are also great, and there's a cafe to grab a bite to eat or a drink.
