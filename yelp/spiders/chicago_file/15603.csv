Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had already tried Giordano's, wasn't too impressed. So we decided to go to Lou Malnati's. We ordered take-out because the place was PACKED!! I ordered a small deep dish with italian sausage and pepperoni. Apparently, the italian sausage is most popular, and really could see why. The size small is 9 inches, was enough to feed 3 girls, and came out to be $13.50. REALLY!? $13.50?! soo cheap!!! i was seriously shocked at how much quality and taste was in the pizza for such a price!
