Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were hyped to try this place out since all our friends told us that it's a place to stop by when we are in the city. However, it was beyond terrible. We understand that it is a pandemic season and we have to be extra cautious, but the cashier was unbelievably rude to us. They told us to wait outside until THEY were ready to take our order - we waited about 20 minutes to finally order our food when there was literally no one in front of us. I was informed that it will take about 35-40 minutes for our food to be ready & yes of course, since it's deep dish. But of course, it did not. We waited for an hour, and there it was. We hate to complain, but we had to express our dissatisfaction with the service. Instead, we got yelled at by the lady manager for not understanding their busy schedule during COVID. As you probably assumed, the classic malnati was not even warm.
