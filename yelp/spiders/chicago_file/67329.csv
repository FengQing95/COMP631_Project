Little Goat Diner////Unfortunately it took my partner and I two visits to actually get the opportunity to sit down and try their food.  On the night prior to my birthday we went to Little Goat for dinner, but were told at the door that they were closing early due to the water being shut off on the whole block. It definitely bummed us out, but we stopped into Au Cheval and luckily they weren't experiencing any problems - which is weird as Au Cheval is literally on the same block as Little Goat, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.
