Little Goat Diner////Went here twice, once for breakfast and once for dinner and both times the entrees were to die for. Ordered the parathas burrito for breakfast and I wish I could eat that every day of my life. It was so incredibly flavorful and the textures of everything were just perfect. For dinner a friend and I shared the goat chili fries were meh (why I gave this place stars instead of 5) but holy moly the pork belly pancake was incredible. I will have dreams about that perfectly crisped scallion pancake and buttery melt in your mouth pork belly.
