Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here as the first stop of a River North food tour. The slice was a simple sample but it didn't lack flavor. I can't give it 5 stars untill I get the real Chicago deep dish! Coupled my slice with a Blue Moon. Coming back for a real slice soon! Great service and good food. Bust spot and worth getting. One lovely lady I sat with during the tour mentioned she had a pizza shipped to Nashville Tennessee! If that doesn't tell you how good it is.. Not sure what Will! Yes, they will ship out of state! Get yours or one for a friend!
