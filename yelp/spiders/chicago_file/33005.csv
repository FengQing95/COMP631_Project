Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I don't write many reviews as I normally trust yelp reviewers.  We live in the area by Bavette's.  Got an OK meal. Figured it was because they were new.  Went back this past Saturday.  Service was slow.  Cocktails were awesome again.  Food mediocre to average, again.  We have now ordered 6 different meals. Average at best. Space is great, but if we go back it will be for cocktails only.  Only way to explain the high food reviews is the younger patrons enjoying the room and the experience not knowing any better about quality food and pricing.
