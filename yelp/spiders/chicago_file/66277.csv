Little Goat Diner////The nachos were great! I share them with some friends and had the dip as an entree. The dip was ok but nothing extraordinary. I would have given 4 stars but the service was lacking. I don't know if it was because they were short handed but we rarely saw our server and when we did he seemed determined to make it a short trip to our table. Still, I'd go back for another try.
