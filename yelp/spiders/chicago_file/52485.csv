Smoque BBQ////Coming to Illinois from North Carolina I was anxious to find some decent barbecue. Smoque gets me through my cravings. The meat had a nice smoked flavor. The sauce is lacking, but that is always a matter of preference. I miss the vinegar tang of NC style. Smoque's sauce seems to straddle a few different styles of sauce so it never quite lands anywhere I like.
