Little Goat Diner////For me, Little Goat has become the "overflow establishment" - the last in line after being rejected by every other restaurant on Randolph: Au Cheval - "2 hrs"; Girl on the Goat - "1 hr"; ok fine, let's try to find at seat at the Little Girl bar. I know I should give it more love and gratitude (it's been a life saver on a number of Friday nights) but I find it hard to get excited about this place. The food has always been sufficient but always a let down after I've deluded myself with the off chance of maybe being able to get into au cheval...
