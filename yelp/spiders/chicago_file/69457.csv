Little Goat Diner////Nothing not to like! Met college friends here for a Roommate Reunion lunch, and was pleasantly surprised. Not being a fan of Girl and the Goat ( shut up, it's overhyped ), I didn't know what to expect. Upon entering, the place is adorable! Very beautiful, funky place. Love it. We were mistakenly sent up to the roof to find a friend, and it's awesome! We dined on the patio, enjoying the last beautiful days of fall.
