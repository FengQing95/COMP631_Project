Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Oh--a couple things about this location. Holiday weekend, marathon... it was packed. Our wait for 5 people was over 40 min. There didn't seem to be too many places nearby to hang out, although we were too tired to walk anywhere. The 40+ min. did not seem long. You can order your pizza while waiting and get drinks from the bar. Really nice waitstaff; totally accommodating when we had to split the check 5 ways (this is annoying, so I don't recommend it. We just didn't have cash). I didn't get to try any of the other pizza places, but you won't be disappointed with Lou's!
