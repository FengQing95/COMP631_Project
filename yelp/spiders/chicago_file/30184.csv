Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Gordiano's have a thicker body with more cheese, which a lot of my friends like better. I personally like Lou because it's the right proportion of crust, meat, and sauce. It's almost like eating a burger on a pizza (if you order the sausage, that is). They have good vegetarian options, too.
