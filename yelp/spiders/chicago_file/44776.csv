Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ok, here's my first problem and I might be a little picky about this but I like what I like.  The menu has numbers next to the items. Ughhhh! That seems so cheesy to me. Part of the experience of going to a Tapas place is to experience the culture, food and language.  So as I'm trying to pronounce the name of the dish to the waitress instead of helping me to pronounce it correctly she says to me, "Oh, number 44". It took all of the excitement out of imagining I was in a different country.
