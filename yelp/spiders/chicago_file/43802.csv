Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The amount of food you get for the amount of money you spend really depends on what you get. I think the meat tapas could be a little less as well as some of the seafood selections. My friend and I split a paella which was already about $30 bucks... we added shrimp thinking it would be a couple dollars, it was $9!
