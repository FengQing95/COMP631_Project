Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great food and great service! I have an unusual food allergy (garlic) (I know Spanish food is almost impossible to find without garlic). And the waitstaff accommodated it in a good natured way. I really appreciated that and the flexibility they showed in accommodating me. The bacon covered dates and citrus cured salmon were especially delicious!
