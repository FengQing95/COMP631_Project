Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There are families and children everywhere. (One overzealous father even rearranged the chairs at our table, without apology or remark of any kind, when their double-wide stroller couldn't clear the aisle.) We were reminded of a dining room in a resort hotel or (we imagine) Disney World, rather than one of the best breakfasts in the city. I've always sneered at people waiting 45-minutes for a table at Lula Cafe, but now I feel their pain.
