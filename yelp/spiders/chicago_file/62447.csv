Smoque BBQ////Mac n cheese is great. Meat is cooked really well, very tender, but the flavor wasn't impressive. Customer service is great. Fries are crunchy, decent taste. Corn Â bread was a little stale, a little bland. If u like a more vinegar Bbq sauce vs sweet you'll like it here. Fair price for good quality of food.
