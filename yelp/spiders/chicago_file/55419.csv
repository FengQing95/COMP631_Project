Smoque BBQ////Of course, that isn't necessarily saying much. Many Chicagoans have considered a full slab of ribs cooked in an oven and slathered in sweet and sticky BBQ sauce to be actual "BBQ". As a result, there are very few restaurants that serve REAL BBQ, which requires several hours of slowly smoking various types of meat (Pork Shoulder, Ribs, and Brisket) at a low temperature.
