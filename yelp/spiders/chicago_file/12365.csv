Art Institute of Chicago////So, spoiler alert, I got my degree in art from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. That meant I went waltzing through the museum nearly every day. I've seen their best, studied it and seen the hidden works the public hasn't. Plus, I've been to hundreds of museums around the world. To qualify it as one of the best in the nation is easy. It has so many famous works (made famous by the board game Masterpiece). Plus, it rivals the museums on NYC and The Smithsonian. Chicago is an excellent, world-class city. The museum is so worth a visit. Or, maybe 1000. Plan to spend at least 5 hours there. The fish across the street will wait.
