Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As for the pizza itself, I was a big lover of the marina sauce. It had just the right amount of sweetness and acidity, with larger chunks of tomato that cut through the fat of the cheese. I was not a huge fan of the sausage, there was simply too much of it on the pizza and it became overwhelming. The crust also was nothing special. Overall it was yummy pizza, but nothing life changing.
