Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The highlights, in my mind, were the curry chicken salad (very creamy, but tastier than I expected), the mango sangria (went down really smooth), grilled squid (not too rubbery), chicken & ham croquetas (deep fried but delish), spicy potatoes w/ tomato aioli (surprisingly good for something so simple). Â A definite recommend!
