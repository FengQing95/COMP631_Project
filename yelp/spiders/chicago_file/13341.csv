Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was imagining "deep-dish" would be thick, doughy crust with a bit of toppings, but I couldn't have been more wrong.  The crust, itself, was a decent (not too thick) thickness and super crispy that easily held up to the toppings - not chewy or doughy at all.  There was a good amount of cheese and topping, but I would have been pleased eating just the crispy, buttery crust (and I am a die-heard thin crust pizza lover).  A small pizza was more than enough to fill up the Hubs and I, and it was definitely worth the wait.
