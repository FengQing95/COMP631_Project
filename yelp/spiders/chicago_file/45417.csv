Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have always had a good experience here.  The atmosphere is cozy and fun, never had any problems with reservations or service, and the food has always been good.  there have been things I did not like that much, but that is because I simply did not like it, not because of the way they prepared it.  And that is the real reason to go to a tapas restaurant.  To try small plates of new things you would not otherwise.
