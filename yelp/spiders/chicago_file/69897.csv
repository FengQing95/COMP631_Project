Little Goat Diner////They also had a cocktail list. The main part of the restaurant is a diner, but they have a bar/coffee bar/bakery attached. Good to stop by after or before if you have a wait. The peanut butter sandwich cookies were recommended by our waiter, and man was he right that we needed to try them. We were full after lunch but grabbed a couple for the train.
