Smoque BBQ////I've gone to Smoque on quite a few occasions and I can't say that I was disappointed in any of my experiences with Smoque themselves, just with my decisions.  The first time that I went to Smoque I decided on the baby-back ribs because that's what I'm used to.  Don't do that. Not that they aren't good, they're great.  But another of my family members got the St. Louis style ribs and I haven't steered clear of them since!! The St. Louis style ribs are just as tender and wayyyyy meatier.  You also cannot go wrong with the brisket at Smoque, they do a really good job, so be sure to get yourself some ribs with a "taste" of their brisket.  Don't forget some sides either, I'm a huuuuuge fan of their mac and cheese and baked beans! I know baked beans aren't for everybody, but these are really great!!
