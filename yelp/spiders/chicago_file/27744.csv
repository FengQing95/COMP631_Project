Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Very solid pie. Won't change your life, yet it is respectable. 4+ on the pizza.  Wings and service a 4. I'll be back when Im in the area. Be prepared for 45+ minute wait for deep dish even when not busy....which is needed to get it right.  Yet if you are accustomed to 3 minute ultra thin crust napolesian style pizza cooking time, plan your time accordingly.
