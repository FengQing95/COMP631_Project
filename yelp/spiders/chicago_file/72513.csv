Little Goat Diner////Between 4 and 5 stars I often don't know exactly which one to choose, but they are very similar. Anyways, the Little Goat. I enjoyed it so much. Being in Chicago occasionally for business (whish I had the pleasure so much more often, but hey, better than not at all, right?!) I am always interested in enjoyable breakfast joints, because when it's up to me that is my main meal for the day til dinnertime.
