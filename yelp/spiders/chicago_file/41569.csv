Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Can't get enough of their red wine sangria with freshly chopped apples and oranges!!!   We've eaten at Cafe Ba-Ba Reeba many, many times, and always leave satisfied!    Their seared salmon with peppers and cucumbers is delicious, as is the goat cheese and pepper chicken over flavored rice.  From 4-6pm their have a $2 happy hour in the bar area- where 12 of their menu items as well as bottles of beer are priced at only $2.   Whether you sit inside or outside, you will enjoy the ambiance, service, and appetizing menu!
