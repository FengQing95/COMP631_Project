The Purple Pig////Deliciousness! The ambiance is inviting and there's beautiful European culture and design seen throughout the restaurant itself. The restaurant does not take reservations and is first come first serve. Luckily we walked in and we were greeted by a friendly face and sat immediately. The menu itself is divine and we look forward to coming back and trying more items. The service was informative, passionate and friendly throughout our dining experience. We took our servers suggestions and ordered 3 shareable menu items. The cauliflower Caesar salad, Octopus ala plancha and 1/2 duck. Each plate delivered flavors and textures that were new, exciting and beautifully executed! This is a must do when we visit Chicago again and we cannot wait to come back!
