Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was just me so I ordered the Chicago Classic in personal size. It was delicious. The crust had a great butter flavor and it had me wanting more. I just wish it was bigger as it left me hungry and I'm not a big eater normally. Plus it looked a little pathetic and not exactly deep dish. Either way, I'll definitely be back for the delicious taste and ordering a larger size next time.
