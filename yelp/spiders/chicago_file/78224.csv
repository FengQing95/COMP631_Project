Little Goat Diner////Made a reservation for my husband's birthday dinner. Confirmed outside seating as one child is unvaccinated. Rain predicted so I called pre-dinner to confirm seating. Was told it would not be an issue because outside area is covered. Arrived only to be told outside seating was closed due to (light) rain and that person on phone has misinformed me. Robotic and unsympathetic manager delivered the news. Really disappointing. Thanks for ruining my husband's birthday dinner. We would not have come if we knew the outside area would be closed. So much for phoning first.
