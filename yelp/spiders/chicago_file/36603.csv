Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My wife and I continued our tour of steakhouses in Chicago with a visit to Babette's Bar and Boeuf.  After reading reviews, my expectations were high.  Reservations were made in September since we were celebrating a birthday on a Saturday night.  We arrived and were seated immediately in a U shaped booth which was very nice seat.
