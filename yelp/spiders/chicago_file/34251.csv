Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Two of their *very weak* signature Old Fashioned cocktails --  highball glass poured half-full with ice cubes roughly equating to the size of avocados,   -- will set you back $26.  That's $13 per single shot, folks.  (What is this, an airport?)   I presume the brandy-marinated grape garnish was included.
