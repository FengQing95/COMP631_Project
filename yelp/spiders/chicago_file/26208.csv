Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As you can see in the photograph I made it about halfway through slice 4/4 and that was it for me. Perhaps I should not have ordered minestrone soup, without it I may have made it through my iPod. They also have a full bar on-site, a nice touch; I had a few glasses of red wine to go with my pie.
