Art Institute of Chicago////I mean if you like art, just go already. It is as fantastic as everyone said. It is totally worth the $18 ($9 if you come for the last hour like I did). And the people working there are extremely helpful. If you just want to see Picasso's old-man-with-a-guitar-painting, they will tell you how to get there. Done and done.
