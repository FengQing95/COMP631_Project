Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first trip to Chicago and my first taste of real deep dish pizza... It was the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had!! It was like my heaven in pizzeria-dome. I got the regular deep dish, Malnati's Chicago Classic. It's made with fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, and perfectly seasoned leaned sausage. Best choice ever. The cheese was rich and flavorful. It's just so dang good oozing out of the loaf. There's something about the pizza dough that made me instantly fall in love with Lou Malnati's. The buttercrust pizza was so so delicious, crunchy and oh so buttery. I quickly began to devour the beast. I'm not a deep dish expert but Lou's definitely served a high quality pie. I can't believe how good that pizza was, way better than anticipated... The pizza was very filling. I couldn't eat more than one slice, sadly. I WANNA GO BACK!
