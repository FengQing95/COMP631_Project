Little Goat Diner////We had an amazing time at LG. Out of town visitors to Chicago, we had heard (herd) about it and wanted to try it out. Reservation was slick, seated right away on a busy Friday night. Ordering took a while, as we needed to be walked through the extensive, eclectic menu. Our server was really cool though and offered good suggestions. We also had a local couple with us and they helped out, too. Scallop special was beautiful and done to perfection. Simple with some greens and light sauce. Pork belly pancake was fun, with shredded cabbage and the pork patty. Great sauce, too. The highlight was the Goat Almighty Burger--at least 12 inches high with 3 meat patties, etc etc. The duck leg confit was very tasty and nicely presented. We were talked into a slice of the cake of the day--mocha! Very dense, rich and icing with a hint of coffee in it. Very yummy, but even the 7 of us couldn't finish 1 slice!!
