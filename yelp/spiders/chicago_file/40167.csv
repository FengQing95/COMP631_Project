Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came here recently for the first time and I was extremely impressed. The photos did not do this place justice. The customer service was wonderful and the staff is very calm and relax. They don't make you feel rushed at all and the food came out extremely fast. I was not expecting it. I definitely would recommend this place and I would go there again. Thank you again for the great night out :)
