Little Goat Diner////It's REALLY as good as everyone says! I had the "Bull's Eye," Chicken and French Toast with maple syrup and egg in the middle, topped with fresh strawberries.  It was a beautiful symphony of flavors from the warm cinnamon of the french toast, with a slightly crisp edge and soft center highlighted by an egg coupled with savory and juicy fried chicken breast sweetened by maple syrup. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Mmm, mmm good!  For dessert,  we had the cheeze-it sundae, yes,  cheeze-its! 2 scoops strawberry sorbet, one scoop cheeze-it ice cream, topped with peanut butter infused caramel drizzle,  whip cream and of course, chocolate covered cheeze its! Surprising it worked and flavors blended nicely.  Must go here and try.  Can't wait to come back.
