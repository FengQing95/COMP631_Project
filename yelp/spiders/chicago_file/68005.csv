Little Goat Diner////Chicago favorite! I love the crazy menu Little Goat has to offer. My absolute favorite is the nachos, it usually makes me full before the entree comes (although this does not stop me from eating more). The food is very flavorful, full of surprises, and just a lot of fun to eat. The ambience is very upbeat and playful, I feel comfortable going with friends or a fun date night, nothing too serious. The price range is clearly above any regular diner, but the place really tries to maintain the light, comfortable ambience of a diner and I really appreciate the amazing food that comes along with it. I've definitely never had a dining experience like this place!
