Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Not sure why this place was so hard to get a reservation at. I'm just not understanding the hype...but maybe that's all it is. Yes, the food was good, but nothing particularly breathtaking like everyone else seems to be claiming. Maybe we just had a mediocre experience. The service wasn't bad, but I found myself glancing over my shoulder way too many times in anticipation of catching the waitress's attention. (Which I never successfully did. Just had to wait till she eventually came back.) Overall we had a nice time...Will I come back here? Probably not, but I'm glad I tried it.
