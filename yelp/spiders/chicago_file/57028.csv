Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There's nothing wrong with Cafe Baba Reeba except Spanish Square on Belmont and Southport exists. Baba Rebaa's pintxos we're good, especially the Chorizo wrap dates (which were amazing) but nothing else stood out. I can feel the quality but the parts don't add to the sum, it's missing that extra notch, like they're trying to play it safe. Some extra salt and/or MSG might have done the job. The paella was generous with shrimp but that's it. I didn't see any other seafood. The bacon wrapped dates and the paella at Spanish Square are better.
