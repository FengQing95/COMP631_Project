Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had to get deep dish pizza before we left Chicago! We came to chi town for MLK weekend and hours before we had to be at the airport going home, we stopped by Lou's. We ordered "The Lou" and it was phenomenal. It was the perfect temperature, cheesy but not too much, and I loved that the vegetables still tasted like vegetables.
