Smoque BBQ////Really enjoyed our dinner tonight. Brisket and chicken platters with brisket chili, cornbread, mac&cheese and coleslaw. The brisket was very tender and served with 2 sauces. We ordered one of each dessert: peach cobbler and bread pudding. Both were good but I preferred the bread pudding. BYOB- we brought beer and wine. The wait on a Sunday at 6:00 was not bad, about a half hour for a party of 5. Not a place for a leisurely dinner since the tables have to turn quickly.
