Little Goat Diner////I got the Los Drowned (I think) sandwich which was basically beef brisket, havarti, avocado and lots of other yummy ingredients in a hoagie - plus a dipping sauce. The sandwich was great and we were absolutely stuffed by the end. Slightly on the pricey side but really yummy food!
