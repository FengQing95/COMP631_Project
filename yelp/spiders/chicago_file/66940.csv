Little Goat Diner////As for the diner side, I am one of those who tends to test a place like this with a simple order the first time out. We went for breakfast, so I feel like if a place can't make good scrambled eggs, well...I'm not sure if I will go back for eggs.  So ordered my scrambled eggs and bagel. Bagel was good as usual, of course.  The scrambled eggs were basically dry diner-style scrambled eggs.  Now I realize that eggs are very personal, and one person may like them barely cooked while another would like them dry and in sheets.  I like mine more on the cooked side, but other than that I'm not terribly picky as long as they taste good.  Well, these were cooked even for me.  There are plenty of other diners that make better scrambled eggs than this.  To me, if you can't scramble an egg well, maybe it's time to revisit the basics.  My husband ordered the Spanish omelette, which was massive.  It comes with tomatoes, peppers, cheese, and tortilla chips on top.  It wasn't bad, but for $14 we were both expecting more. Not in quantity because it was huge, but just in terms of quality execution.  Again, the eggs were pretty overcooked.  I'm fairly sure I could have made that pretty easily at home, which is not a good thing to think about a $14 breakfast dish!
