Art Institute of Chicago////This is one of my very favorite places in the city. If you live here and work in the Loop, a membership is essential. I prefer to take in this vast collection in 30 minute increments over the span of a few months than try to do the whole thing in one day. There's that much to see! If you go on the free night (Thursdays, I think it is), and you take your kids, be forewarned that there is no food for them, except at Terzo Piano which is pricey and a little chi chi. Even the little cafe in the modern wing only had potato chips.
