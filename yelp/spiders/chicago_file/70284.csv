Little Goat Diner////As a side-note- the cafe/bakery next door that serves sandwiches at the bar... totally awesome. The Kale salad is simple and delicious and the rest of the lunch spread is great. Perhaps they should allow some of those items to the diner component of the space to add variety, taste and better options.
