Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////And the pizzas came. Everyone on the table was doubting that 2 pizzas would be enough. And when we were looking at pizzas, we still doubted that it would be enough. But then we all had a slice. And the table went silent. We were too engrossed in the cheese and butter crusts and just the general amazing-ness of what a chicago style pizza should be. I don't think any New York style pizza was able to do what these pizzas did to us. Everyone had 2 slices and were in pain by the time we called uncle. But we still had half a pizza left that we left with the only person that lives in Chicago (he just moved there from DC).
