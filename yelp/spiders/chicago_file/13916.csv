Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza was worth the wait.  We ended up eating at the bar. David the bartender is very helpful, professional, and made our dining experience a pleasure.  The malnatis salad is soooo tasty.  I wish I could recreate the dressing.  I would like to try thin crust next time but since this was my first Chicago visit I had to go with their classic and veggie. Not as greasy as I thought it would be.  While waiting they take your preorder so your pizza is half way cooked by the time you sit down. Very clever.
