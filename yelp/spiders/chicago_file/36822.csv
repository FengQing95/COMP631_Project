Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////WOW- ate here for my boyfriend's birthday for the first time last night. I cannot remember our server's name but she was wonderful and the food was beyond amazing! We ordered the crab salad, brussel sprouts, steak, and lamb chops- it did not disappoint. Everything was great and our server was phenomenal. This might sound strange for a steakhouse and seafood place but they have the best brussel sprouts I've ever had. Hands down one of the best dining experiences we've had as well. We were also too stuffed to order dessert, but they even brought out a complimentary sundae (with a sparkler) because it was his birthday! The atmosphere was definitely speakeasy, 1920s vibe. The drinks were fabulous. It was a packed house on a Monday night and I can see why. Will definitely go again and highly recommend!
