Smoque BBQ////We got there just before lunch, so there was no line to speak of.  After flying up from Texas I had to get the brisket, right?  I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor of the meat, it was really good, as good or better than a lot of the hole-in-the-wall places here in Texas.  The beef was tender and had a good smoke flavor.
