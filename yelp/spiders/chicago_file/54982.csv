Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Citrus french toast best item we had, nice thick toast with a great goat cheese and honey spread.  It also came with some maple syrup but didn't need it.  The meatballs were delicious, and the sauce was great on the free bread.  Paella is large and takes time, but seems to be worth it if you know that's something you like.  Skip the papas bravas, looks tasty but the seasoning and the aioli are both bland.
