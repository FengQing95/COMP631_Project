Little Goat Diner////Came in here for lunch on our trip. We sat at the bar by the kitchen. My husband ordered a burger. I ordered a mac and cheese along with Chilly. My husband's burger sat out for about 10 minutes before they brought it to him with my food. We asked if they could take it back and make another as it was cold and the girl that organizes all the food for the servers (wears glasses has dark brown hair and asian eyes) said yes. We were watching them for a bit and the burger was then brought back to my husband after about another 10 minutes and it was still cold. We are positive they didn't do anything at all to his burger so we are very disappointed with this restaurant. Nevertheless- for being a diner - it is pricey. Go get brunch some where else like the BombaBar.
