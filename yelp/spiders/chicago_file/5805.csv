The Purple Pig////I have an excellent experience here at Purple Pig! Their staff is so attentive, helpful, and decent. They served my orders so right and the food plating is so creative. All of their dishes here are so delicious and phenomenal, their portion is so good, and all of the food is worth the price. Their pricing is so fair and reasonable. You can literally order and try everything on the menu without breaking your limits and your pockets. This place is so easy to find and to go to. They are located in Michigan and they are so near to other well-known places around the area. Their place is so huge, so clean, and nice. Very welcoming and relaxing place. Perfect to treat yourself and even bonding with friends and family. Purple Pig is exceptional! Thank you for giving us such an amazing and unforgettable experience and also for showing us how great and outstanding your customer service is. Thank you Purple Pig! Will definitely visit again soon! Also will recommend your place to all the people I know. Thank you! Please keep up the good work! Kudos to all of you!
