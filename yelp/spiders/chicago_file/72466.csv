Little Goat Diner////This is the most legit foodie experience I've had in Chicago. This is how it goes, I was trying to book a group dinner for the girl and the goat and that was was booked 3 weeks back, lord! So I decided a week in advance to come to do a late brunch here with just 2 friends, reserved on open table just in case. I'd say the biggest complaint I have is this place is a bit lacking on customer service. If I can recall from top chef, a great restaurant is superb food, service and ambiance. This place is lacking in service. I made a reservation on open table but I might as well not have. When it was our time we still had to wait, they also would not seat you if you made a reservation until everyone in your party is there.
