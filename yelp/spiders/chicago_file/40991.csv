Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This tapas place is one of a few really good ones in the Chicago area. One of my favorite items on this menu are the sangrias which are infused with vodkas and give them a nice little kick. The tortilla espaniola is delicious from the cold side and the goat cheese warm appetizer is great. They offer a nice assortment of paella, but nothingq too exciting on their, maybe I am comparing it to the authentic thing from Spain, but still not what I want, the caramelized texture that I am looking for. Worth a try.
