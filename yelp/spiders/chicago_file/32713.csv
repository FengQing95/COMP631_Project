Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Can't go wrong, if you can get in! Such a great place to eat in the city. Has to be one of the best steak places. Wonderful food. Shrimp cocktail is a must. The bread they start with is amazing. Crab cake is great... salmon is also a good entree option. Just a wonderful place!
