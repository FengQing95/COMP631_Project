Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great Chicago deep dish pizza. I will now make sure to stop here each visit to Chicago. Great sauce. It is flavorful and zesty. I don't like sweet sauce. The real standout is the crust. The crust is tender and buttery but also crispy. I generally don't eat the edge crust on a deep dish pizza but this is different much better than I have had before. I highly recommend.
