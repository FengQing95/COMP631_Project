Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First of all the greeters are rude and impatient and rush you to order. I'm from out of town and didn't know what to order and the staff was not friendly at all.I will not return because of the service . Also what is the point of preordering if it's still going to take 2 hours to be seated and when you do get seated it still takes 45 minutes to get your pizza.We got the thin crust it was okay.
