Little Goat Diner////I've followed Stephanie Izard's career since Top Chef Season 6. Two years ago my boyfriend took me here as a surprised and we've been back countless times since. I don't have anything bad to say about this place. Regardless of time of day we go the wait is always reasonable or short. The food is stellar. It's all food you're familiar with but just with an elevated twist. I'm not sure what is in the gravy but I could put it on anything. Waitstaff is always pleasant and cheerful. I recommend Little Goat to anyone visiting Chicago and everyone has nothing but rave reviews.
