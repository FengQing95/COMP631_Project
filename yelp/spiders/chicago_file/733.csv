Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Absolutely delicious brunch. The signature berry bliss pancakes are a must!! My skillet breakfast was also excellent, with very fresh veggies. Our waiter was fantastic-- well-versed in the menu and very helpful in making substitution recommendations to meet my picky friend's requests. A must stop on all future Chicago trips.
