Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ahhhh!!! This is amazing. Although my first deep dish pizza, it was nothing compared to regular pizza. I got a personal pizza with pepperoni and sausage. The malnatis classic. I also got some cheesy bread! Everything was fantastic including our waiter ( Adriano)!! He was super nice, outgoing, and funny as well as making us feel welcome. If you want some good Chicago deep dish pizza, look no further. Lou Malnati's is the place to go!
