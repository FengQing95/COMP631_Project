Art Institute of Chicago////I have to admit that I am not a big fan of the museum campus in Chicago. I don't care for museums, period. However, I think the Art Institute of Chicago is a world class institution that every tourist to Chicago should go visit. The Art Institute has some of the world's best collection and in order to fully appreciate each of them and slowly take it all in, I would say it is quite impossible to do it in a day.
