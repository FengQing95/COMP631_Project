Little Goat Diner////Came here late on a not so busy evening and we were sat down immediately. The staff is kind and charming. The drinks are absolutely fantastic. The chicken pot pie was the best I've had in a really long time. The prices are super reasonable. I fully intend on coming back to this place in the future. The experience was amazing.
