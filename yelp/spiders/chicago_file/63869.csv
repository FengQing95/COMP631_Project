Smoque BBQ////I originally ordered a small but was convinced by the cashier to get the large as this side "stood up above the rest".  Boy did I make the mistake by listening to her.  In my opinion the properties of quality mac and cheese must include 'ooey and gooey'.  This mac and cheese was goopy and the cheese/sauce had the consistency of creme brulee . Yes, creme brulee.  I love creme brulee but describing mac and cheese as having the consistency of creme brulee is absolutely something you do not want in mac and cheese.  Aside from the baked crust, I could barely taste the cheese flavor and as harsh as this may sound, this was probably some of the worst mac and cheese I've had.
