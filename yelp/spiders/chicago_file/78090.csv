Little Goat Diner////This is hands down one of my favorite spots for a meal in Chicago. I love the diner vibe and that you can get breakfast, lunch or dinner! They have delicious cocktails as well, but definitely not a place for bottomless brunch. Â Little Goat updates their menu to incorporate seasonal ingredients, so the food always tastes fresh!
