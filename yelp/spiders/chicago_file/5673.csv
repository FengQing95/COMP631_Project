The Purple Pig////This is another one of my favorite spots in Chicago that I am a little late on reviewing that definitely warrants some good attention. The Purple Pig is one of the more well-known food establishments off Magnificent Mile that we knew we had to try going as walk-ins. We were there on a weekday in May and were hungry for some good food after a 90-minute long boat tour.
