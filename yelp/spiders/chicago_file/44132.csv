Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We reserved a table for six through Open Table and arrived a bit early to find the place packed.  In itself that wasn't so impressive, because a lot of so-so places seem packet on Saturday nights these days.  We were seated in the outside patio and it was tight but not uncomfortable.  Everyone seemed to be having a great time and that made the ambiance festive and vibrant.  For the most part, the crowd looked pretty young (20's and 30's).
