Little Goat Diner////BATHROOM REVIEW: Except for the sign hovering above, there would have been no way of finding the bathroom. It blended with the wall completely and the only thing that stood out was the door handle. Once you open the door, you'll find 6-private single stall bathrooms. The men's bathroom was nice and spacious. It was super clean, and they had one of those blowers -- not the Dyson once, but one of those ultra clean microban type ones. Surprisingly, the mens single stall bathroom was bigger than the women's, which I always thought was always the opposite. Anywho, sit or squat? Sit, read a newspaper, and let the good times roll as its a single bathroom, the place is noisy, and no one will hear the tunes that come out of your body, or the smell, as there's two doors of defense before you get to the dining room.
