Smoque BBQ////This place really needs a little more room and a better place for people to wait in Â line. Seating was fine - the staff has it together that way, but it was a little aggravating to have all these people stand around me, along with an occasional touch of cold air coming from the exit door about 10 feet away. I was there on a Saturday around 2PM - not exactly prime time - I can only imagine it being worse at other times. Nonetheless, when I'm in the area at an even slower time of day, I'll certainly consider a return to Smoque - savored every bite!
