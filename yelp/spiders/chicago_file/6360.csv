The Purple Pig////Please don't accuse a customer of leaving without paying the bill. It was busy that day and we didn't realize our waiter didn't swipe our card before giving it back to us. We assumed the bill was paid (the waiter came, grabbed our card, left for a few minutes, and returned with a receipt and our card) and left so we can make our next appointment. I was greeted with a phone call with accusations from the manager that "it's illegal to run off without paying the bill." We paid for the bill immediately, as it was a misunderstanding, but I don't appreciate the accusations or how this situation was handled as it was not our fault. I don't fault the waiter, as it was busy and it happens, but please treat your customers better next time this happens and get the full story from your employees.
