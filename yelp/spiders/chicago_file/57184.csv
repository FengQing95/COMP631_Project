Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If you love delicious tapas at affordable prices, check out Caf√© Ba-Ba-Reeba!! We came here for brunch on a weekend day. It was pretty crowded, so I recommend making a reservation ahead of time! We got 4 tapas to share for 2 people. We started with the shrimp and grits. Classic brunch item with a spicy kick to it. Very creamy grits and flavorful shrimp! Then we got the citrus French toast with the MOST delicious butter I've ever tasted. We finished off with the buttermilk fried chicken and the lamb kebabs. The fried chicken was SO good! It came in a huge portion for the money you pay. I was not a huge fan of the lamb kebabs-- they were way too salty. Keep in mind that all of their items come out individually. There was a gap of up to 10 minutes between some of the tapas.
