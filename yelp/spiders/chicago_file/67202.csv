Little Goat Diner////First of all...absolutely love a place that serves breakfast all day...even if I'm not eating it. Came here for a really late lunch so tried out Los Drowned - the avocado makes this sandwich - a goat burger, and the smoked fries - which stole the show. Can't wait to come back for brunch or possibly the rooftop Rose tasting later this month.
