Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It came perfect inside but totally burned outside, I have no idea how the chef could send it out. Maybe he was thinking that we wouldn't notice it since it's so dark in the dining room. But ok the Manager apologized and sent us a new steak quickly which was cooked perfectly and lived up to the expectation. We didn't really have room for dessert but since they comped us desserts we decided to take some carrot cake and chocolate cake for take away. The chocolate cake was great, creamy tasty really nice but the carrot cake was one of the worst I have ever had,it was way too sweet, had barely any nuts and raisins and coconut inside which shouldn't be inside of a proper carrot cake.
