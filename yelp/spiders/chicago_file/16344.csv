Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////had a good time. employees were friendly. Very crowded. Expected a long wait. Put name on list and was told 1.5 hours. Was told to put in food order at the same time because the length of time required to make the pizza. Put name in and went down the street to grab a beer and come back. Took 2 hours to get seated. Not a problem we enjoyed their local selection of beer. Food took another hour to arrive after getting to seat. Not sure why we put in order early. First time eating Chicago deep dish. Underwhelmed with "butter crust". and topping/filling selections. Sauce flavor was good with an interesting red pepper kick. Very filling. We ordered 2 larges for a group 6 well fed men. We had 3 pieces left over. Good to experience, but probably not a repeat.
