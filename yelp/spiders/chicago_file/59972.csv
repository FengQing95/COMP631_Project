Smoque BBQ////Atmosphere: Small town feel in bustling Chicago; always busy but usually in a friendly way.  Cafeteria style seating can be tricky for shy folks, but doesn't bother me any. This place is down to earth and all about the food - which gives me confidence in going back again and again.  I wouldn't bring a date here for the first date unless he/she had moved from Memphis and was feeling homesick, but I would come back to meet friends and family.
