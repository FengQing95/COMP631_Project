Smoque BBQ////Have been to Smoque many times because my husband and daughter love it, but I think it's just okay. I like a sweeter BBQ sauce--their's is a bit acidic. Also, the cole slaw is just average. Again, it's too acidic for me, especially along with the acidic sauce. And the fries are really greasy.
