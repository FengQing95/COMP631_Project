The Purple Pig////We ordered the Crispy Pig Ear, Roasted Bone Morrow, and the Pork Shoulder. The Crispy Pig Ears were a pleasant surprise from what we expected. It had kale and runny yolk to add a creaminess to the crunch of dish. The Bone Morrow was so delicious. It was served with bread, salt and capers and was unlike anything I've ever eaten. You could just soak up the flavor of the bone Morrison the bread. And lastly, the pork shoulder was served on mash potatoes with this delicious sauce! I could have used an extra side of the sauce by itself. So delicious!
