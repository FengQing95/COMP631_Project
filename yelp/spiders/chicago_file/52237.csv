Smoque BBQ////Eat the Brisket!  Eat the Brisket!  I thought it beat out the Pulled Pork.  Love their sides.  Incredible baked beans.  Weird I know, but I'm not really a fan of mac n cheese, but my friends tell me it is incredible here.  Place is small so lines do form at all times, but seem to move relatively quickly.  You can also do pick up too.
