Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I ended up going for a veggie omlette with a side of hash browns and two buttermilk pancakes.  My friend ordered the oatmeal a tropical orange juice remix of some sort.  Most of our food came out rather quickly, piping hot and very delicious.  Unfortunately, my pancakes and her OJ didn't make an appearance.  We called this to the attention of our server, a young hipster with a Bieber haircut and a cheery yet vacant disposition.  He seemed nice enough, but didn't really have the fervor to make sure my pancakes hit my plate.  Three times he visited our table, and seemed to be just as surprised as we were that they had yet to show up.  Dude, it's like, you um, like, job, to make sure, like, my food, like, get to me. Seemed simple. I supposed not.
