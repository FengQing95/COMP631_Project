Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My gf and I took her mom out for her birthday here, and It was pretty damn great. We warmed up with the deviled eggs and they were on point. We always get the queso de cabra when we go out, it's the law, that was baller. You have to get the spicy potatoes. The ibarico pork steak is the business and we finished off with the paella valenciana. The paella was cooked to perfection, with just enough little crispy rice to put all other paellas to shame.
