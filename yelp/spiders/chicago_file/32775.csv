Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////From start to finish... excellent food, horrible service. They made my birthday dinner super awkward when their reservation system had an error and when they finally took 10 people to figure out, seated us in their worst table jammed between two other groups. We had to ask to be moved to another table that had some more privacy. Our waiter was nice but rarely came by, probably would have left 30 min sooner if he were timelier. They have 8 hostesses in the front room and yet not enough wait staff? As we were leaving and paying they remembered it was my birthday and ran out with their ice cream and dropped it on the table and ran back... (the ice cream was so yummy). Then we got up to leave and no one told us where to get our jackets (again bad communication). For such a price, you pay for great food but also great service and it has to be the whole experience from the moment you walk in. Seems like bad management, bad hiring, lack of organization, difficulty communicating, etc. If you don't care about that and just want great food, then you will love this place.
