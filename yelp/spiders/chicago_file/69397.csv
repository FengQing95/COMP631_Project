Little Goat Diner////Even at 2pm on a Thursday, we were told that there was going to be a 40 minute wait.  Bit ridiculous, but we had already trekked over so wanted to wait--they actually use a seat waiting app so was nice to see how many people were in front of us.  We ended up getting seated only about 15 minutes later since there were only two of us.
