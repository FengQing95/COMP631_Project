Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our service was tediously slow and it took over 45 minutes between our appetizers and our entrees to arrive. When we finally were able to flag down our server (hey, what gives?), he said the order was misplaced, awesome. It's now 10pm and there's a steak the size of my head with my name on it on its way...suddenly so not in the mood.
