Little Goat Diner////I finally got in on a Monday night with less than a 10 minute wait after driving by numerous times on weekends and other times and seeing large clusters of folks hovering around out front.  Well now I know for myself what all the fuss is about. The place and the food are fabulous.  Best, most original, exciting diner/comfort food I've had in recent memory. We tried lots of stuff and all were "WOW, this is delicious",  From the grilled cheese, smoked fries, and taco boat desserts, all greatly impressed us , which is not that easy cause we're pretty hard core when it comes to our food.
