Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Four our main we had the Chicago Cut Ribeye.  Our server suggested getting one to share and even offered to have the kitchen slice it up for us.  This was a great idea, because I would have struggled to eat the whole thing by myself.  It was perfect with the Bernaise and the Roquefort cheese.
