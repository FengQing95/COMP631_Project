Art Institute of Chicago////I also love the special exhibits. I saw an extensive and fantastic collection of photographs taken by Henri Cartier-Bresson a few months ago. I highly recommend the Art Institute as a fun place to bring a date. Not just someone who shares an interest but a passion in art or photography. There's nothing more romantic than sharing a moment standing next to each other, mesmerized by a beautiful black and white photograph, or pretending to read a plaque just so you can lean in a little closer to your date.
