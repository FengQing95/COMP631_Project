Little Goat Diner////I went here today with two of my friends who wanted to treat me out to a late lunch for my birthday. The service was great and the waiters were kind enough to give us recommendations and resolve any additional charges that were made accidentally on our tab. Food was also delicious and filling. Will definitely come back again sometime!
