Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The appetizers we had were amazing. We had the buffalo wings and the platter with mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini and mushrooms, and cheddar cheese cubes. The wings had a really nice zing to it and the fried mushrooms were very flavorful. The marinara sauce that came with the platter was one of the best marinara sauces I've ever had, and in my opinion the tomato sauce on the pizza paled in comparison. We also ordered a family size Malnati salad, which was delicious. We got the dressing on the size and drizzled it over our portions. The meat and gorgonzola meshed very well with the mushrooms and lettuce in the salad, the heavy flavors balanced by the fresh lettuce and mushrooms, and the sweet dressing made everything even better. The pizza we ordered was the Malnati classic pizza. The crust was delicious, crispy and overall very good quality. The cheese and sausage were also very good; the sausage had a unique flavor. However, the tomato sauce on the pizza almost tasted like straight tomatoes. There was no zing to the sauce and the taste almost instantly left my mouth. I will say the tomatoes tasted fresh, though. Plus, service was great
