Smoque BBQ////Baby Back Ribs were engrained with spices and pipin' hot fresh from the oven. The fries were also good but I didn't eat any. Â The mac & cheese were also pretty good; just enough to fill the tummy and not become an oompha loompa. The only item that I had a problem with was the beef brisket. Don't get me wrong, it was fall of the fork tender. But I thought it lacked alot of flavor, almost bland some would say. It does come with a water down vinegary sauce and it does taste good with the sauce but I like my meat with some flavor. Nevertheless, I still liked the brisket and I will probably continue to get it but spices wouldn't hurt.
