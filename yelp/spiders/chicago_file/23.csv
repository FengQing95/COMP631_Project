Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////took the special lady here for our one-year and, damn, i wanted another steak for a night cap. rewind: let's start form the beginning. so we showed up a little early for our reso and grabbed some cocktails at the bar. the lady had prosecco, which is what it is. i had tito's up which they drop a little bit of bitters in. it may not be what i ordered but, hey, i love me some vodka. after a few drinks at the bar we got seated at a rather large booth. the place has a nice dim lit Â ambiance to it. we were promptly greeted by michael, the best server i have ever encountered, ever! he went over all the need to knows, though luckily for us, and him, we already had a good idea that we wanted all the good stuff. so we started with the pound of chilled crab legs along with a couples oysters and they were just great. perfectly cooked and cracked which made them extremely enjoyable to eat without the usual labor'. steak choice was easy, bone-in dry-aged rib eye is where it was at. i've had a few dry-aged steaks in my life but this was by far the best. writing this review makes me want to go there right now just for the steak. also, don't pass of the bone marrow, there's nothing like a little bit of gelatinous deliciousness to accompany your already amazing steak. between the excellent service, booze, ambiance, and absolutely delicious food, this place is a can't miss for anyone thats living in or visiting chicago.
