Smoque BBQ////I've been meaning to go here for the longest time but to be honest I don't really crave BBQ. I associate BBq with summer and typically prefer to grill out on my own. Folks, my whole mentality on BBQ has changed after having Smoque. I regret thinking that way because Smoque is LEGIT. We got the St. Louis ribs and Brisket with sides of slaw, mac and cheese, and beans. Everything was on point. Although they are known for the brisket I loved the ribs more. The naturally infused smokiness was delicious and the meat fell off the bones. Mac and cheese was solid. I loved the slaw actually and at first I was hesitant cause I don't seek veggie based items but it was executed well.
