Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tasty and large selection of tapas with a nice atmosphere. However the tapas aren't particularly original and the sangria is lacking. Wish theyd hone the menu down a little and focus on what they do best. The service is slow and they can get very very busy, but the ambiance is fun. We enjoy it but more for the vibe than the food.
