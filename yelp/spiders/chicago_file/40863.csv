Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've had this restaurant saved in my bookmarks since last summer. So I was excited to finally try it. My sister and I had a 4:30 reservation through open table and we missed it because we were stuck in ridiculous traffic. So we finally made it and the hostess seated us right away and we were able to get patio seating even though we were an hour and a half late. I got a free Pintxos platter for my first check in on four square. my favorite the deviled egge with bacon and mustard. We ordered the rioja-braised short ribs, mashed potatoes, meatballs with sherry tomato sauce, and roasted chicken empanada. Still hungry cause we shared everything so we also ordered chicken paella. To drink we had a 1/2 pitcher of passion fruit sangria and next time we are getting the full pitcher cause it was delicious. The short ribs and mashed potatoes had a nice flavor very tender and a nice aroma. Mashed potatoes needed just a dash of salt. The empanada was tasty and the sauce on the side enhanced the flavor of the dish. The meatballs were great, hard to mess those up. I took 35 for the paella to cook and the chicken was tender and the veggies were fresh, and it had an amazing flavor. Â Our server was pretty good and helpful. The decor was cute very old Spanish style. I love the fact that you aren't hot sitting on the patio because it's enclosed but you still get the patio feel. I loved it and I will definitely return.
