Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My friends and I LOVE Cafe BaBaReeba! It is our favorite place to meet up. The food is not too expensive. The sangria is amazing and the atmosphere is perfect to meet up with friends. It's the perfect mix of being a lively place and having your own space. I would recommend making reservations for the weekends but even when we have come without ones they are pretty accommodating with the bar seating. The staff has always been very friendly and attentive without being overly attentive- which can happen at a tapas restaurant. Great place!
