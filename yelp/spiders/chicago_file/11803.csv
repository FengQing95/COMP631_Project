Art Institute of Chicago////We started by checking our the miniature rooms which were super cool - we loved the medieval and renaissance arts. We are not art experts but loved the information presented here - it was short and interesting and I could have easily spent an entire day here. There is a rooftop bar Cindy's that you can check out right by the art institute and of course the Beam , also route 66 start sign
