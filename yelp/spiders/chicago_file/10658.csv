Art Institute of Chicago////Visiting this place was almost unreal. Maybe I haven't been to enough art museums, but I was in absolute awe. So many priceless works of art from all over the world right there in Chicago for everyone to see. To be honest, we only had around three hours to spend there and it DEFINITELY was not enough time. If you want to see the whole museum, I would recommend dedicating a day to it and having lunch there. They have several different restaurants of different price ranges and even a cafe! They have brochures in almost every language you can think of. This place was just simply amazing and I can't stress that enough. They had Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Picasso, etc. If you can think of it, they have it! In the brochure, they highlighted works of art that were featured in the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and you best believe that we saw all of those! The gift shop is also pretty awesome. Not only do they have shirts, household items inspired by priceless works of art, books, jewelry, etc., but they also have cool little knick knacks for kids! If you are wanting a good, affordable souvenir, the Art Institute shirts were on sale for $18 when I went! Keep an eye out for sales. The hand painted ties are also very beautiful. If they weren't so expensive, I would buy one in a heartbeat.
