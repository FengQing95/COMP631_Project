Smoque BBQ////It was quite busy when we were there and the staff kept up with the pace but the eating area was very congested with people waiting to order at the counter. It feels like the counter space should be reversed with the ordering station and the pick up station being swapped. It seems like that would help with traffic flow. Plus, the person taking the order stops in between customers to enter handwritten phone in or take away orders which is kind of weird, just buy another iPad.
