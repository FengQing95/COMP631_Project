Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Pros: I've gotten almost everything on the menu... favorites are the bacon wrapped dates, burrata, heirloom tomato salad, grilled octopus, short rib, hanger steak, and the white peach sangria. They're also a Lettuce Entertainment You restaurant (probably one of the top options, too).
