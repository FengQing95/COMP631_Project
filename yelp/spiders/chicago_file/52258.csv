Smoque BBQ////Now, I am a fan of the CONCEPT of "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives." This, because of my general disdain for chain restaurants and my love of great little-known mom-and-pop places. I do a fair bit of travel for my job and if I was limited to Chilis and Applebees for all my meals I would lose my mind. But Food Network really does its viewers a disservice by featuring places like Smoque. They get away with it because they figure most viewers are unlikely to actually go to most of the places featured, and you can't taste or smell food through the TV set. Guy Fiere, albeit a decent TV host, is certainly no chef of record and all he does is kiss up to these places he features. He never plays the role of true critic, automatically discounting just about everything he features. Not to mention his abortion of a Sushi/BBQ (con)fusion restaurant, Tex Wasabi. Anyone stupid enough to fuse BBQ and Sushi has respect for neither BBQ or sushi. And he should really be ashamed of himself. But the Food Network is the machine which gives people like Fiere a voice to lead us all astray in our cullinary pursuits.
