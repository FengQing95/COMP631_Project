Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered the Burrata Cheese with Catalan Tomato Bread ($11); the bread was toasted crisp and paired with the cheese and sauce well. The Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli ($7.50) is a definite crowd pleaser with its tangy aioli and crispy-on-the-outside potato cubes and fluffy innards. The six of us had to arm wrestle for the three Bacalao Croquettes with Sherry Aioli ($2.50), but halved them and ordered more; this plate had a lot of flavor and good spice. Ba Ba Reeba's infamous "Paella de Mariscos" with Shrimp, Squid, Preserved Mussels & Fennel ($17) was spectacular--true paella, cooked perfectly; you have to order it first, because it takes a while to make and then magically appears. Their Rioja-Braised Short Rib with Manchego Mashed Potatoes, Roasted Seasonal Vegetables & Rioja Wine Glaze ($14) was a show stopper; so tender and delicious, we tore into it before I could snap a picture. The Shrimp with Garlic, Olive Oil, Red Pepper Flakes ($9.50) was a solid plate with fresh, firm shrimp. My favorite plate was the Seared Scallops with Red Kuri Squash Pur√©e, Maple Vinaigrette and Candied Pumpkin Seeds ($14); I would have ordered ten of these plates and been a happy man.
