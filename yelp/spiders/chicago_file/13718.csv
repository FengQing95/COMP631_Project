Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the famous "Lou," with spinach, mushrooms, and sliced tomatoes, with the addition of sausage. The best part of the pizza was the buttermilk crust. Unlike the flaky and dense dough from Giordano's, Lou's buttermilk crust is lighter and more buttery. It is wildly addictive as I found myself wanting more crust than the rest of the pizza (usually I just like to eat the pizza and forgo the crust). I think my only complaint about this pizza is that the excess of vegetables creates a watery composition. This is due to the water loss from the spinach and the pizza becomes not quite soggy per say, but it would be getting there. But I can appreciate that the three vegetarian ingredients keeps the flavors simple and good. Between two people, we ended up ordering a large with 8 slices that feeds four people. I managed to polish off three slices before satiation overcame me. All of this was washed down with an ice cold coke. Last time at Giordano's, I said life was good. Well, life is better at Lou's!
