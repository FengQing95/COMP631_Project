Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I would go here again just to say I am going to a place called "cafe BA BA REEBA!!!!" It is a fairly big space with moody lighting. I went there for dinner and sangria on a Saturday. We got there at 9:30 and it was packed. My friend and I split a pitcher of passion fruit sangria. I loved it! My friend liked the blackberry sangria better. I got a salad and the bacon-wrapped dates. They were both delicious! I really liked the fact that if you checked in on yelp, you got a free dessert! I got the gala Apple empanada. Delish. It is a great place to go drinking with friends and splitting tapas. Would definitely come back some time.
