Art Institute of Chicago////I was lucky enough to attend two live musical performances at Fullerton hall, one outside during the summer and the other was inside of Fullerton Hall. Joan Of Arc performed a live score to old film Joan Of Arc and then I saw Beauty Pill. Such incredible experiences inside and out of a BEAUTIFUL venue. My friend and I could not appreciate the glass ceiling enough. The seating inside is pretty cramped but there is a lot of it so that is a plus.
