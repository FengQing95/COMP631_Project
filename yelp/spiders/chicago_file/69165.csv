Little Goat Diner////Extra: They have a bar connected around back behind (east of) the main dining room. It is a coffee bar/ liquor bar/ merchandise shop. We did not spend any time in there but did notice that from the back wall of this area is a glass wall that lets you watch the bakers working in their bakery. Very cool.
