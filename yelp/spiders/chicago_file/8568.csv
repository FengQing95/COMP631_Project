Art Institute of Chicago////If you visit only one museum in Chicago, The Art Institute should definitely be it.  Even if you're too cheap to fork out the $18 admission, you can still experience some of the best art around by going for FREE Thursday nights from 5 to 8 pm.  And if you have no idea what's inside The Art Institute, go to Netflix and add Ferris Bueller's Day Off to your queue.
