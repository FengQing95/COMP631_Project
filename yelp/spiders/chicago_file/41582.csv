Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been here twice and both times were great.  The first time I came was with a large group of girlfriends- so I got to try basically every tapa on the menu.  I really liked the goat cheese, potatos, and chicken skewers.  The second time I came here for my birthday with my then boyfriend and we had two different types of paella- one was the meat lover's special (not sure of the exact name)- but I would highly recommend that!  We also had a lamb appetizer which was amazing.  Prices are reasonable, the atmosphere is really cute/decor is fun.  I wouldn't go here on a first date as I don't think it's the best choice, but I would go here for a giflriend's birthday party, or with a large group/family and share the tapas family style!
