Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We live near here and I have been wanting to try it out forever! Last weekend we finally decided to do the 1 hour wait to eat here. I got nutella crepes with bananas. It was very good! But I don't think I will wait for an hour again. I love crepes and I don't know of many places that serve it so next time I'm craving crepes, I will probably do pick up. It was a one time thing to wait an hour.
