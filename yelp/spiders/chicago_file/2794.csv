The Purple Pig////The dishes we tried were the roasted broccoli which could make any one who hates veggies fall in love! The pork neckbone smear was a delicious pasta type sauce served with bread, very yummy. The flash fried buffalo wings were awesome and any wing fan should try. The milk braised pork shoulder was amazing, served with creamy mashed potatoes and a lil special sauce on top this tender dish packs a lot of flavor.
