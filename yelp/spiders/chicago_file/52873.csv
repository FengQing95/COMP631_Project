Smoque BBQ////Conversing with locals in line, it seemed the brisket is THE item to get here. If you order one entr√©e, you are able to order a 'taste' of everything else for $3.50. So I decided my plan was to order a 1/2 slab of babyback ribs, and a taste each of the brisket, pulled pork, sausage, and St. Louis style ribs.
