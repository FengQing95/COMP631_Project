Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Well, we tried this place since my fiancée's friend said this is better than Giordano's.  First off, I got us lost getting off Grand on the Blue Line.  We walked in circles until I gave up and spoke to the nearest local.  Finally, I realized that she was right about the Brown Line and saw that there was a line out the door here.  Next, we placed our order for the Lou vegetarian deep dish pizza.  It took about 30 minutes until we were seated with an appetizer salad.  Then, it took another 30 minutes until pizza was ready.  Overall, a good experience but was too full at the end and decided that was all the pizza we could eat.  Would it be worth to try again?  Probably just stick to Giordano's since it will open up in Minneapolis-Uptown late this summer.
