Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////we had brunch here early in 2017.  good food.  the waiter was pleasant and not overbearing.  nothing super fancy, but certainly someplace to get good food, sit and talk and get your money's worth.  it was a holiday monday and busy, so if you can, make a reservation - even for brunch.
