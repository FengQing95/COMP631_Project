Little Goat Diner////Service can be hectic and a miss at times, even during the week - it's an eclectic clientele list of white collared professionals, stay at home moms dining with their verbose 2-month old kids, and hipsters and students alike.  But why rush when you've got a cozy, bright environment to laze about in.  Tinned ceillings, cute and comfy benches, windows that go on for days, and just fantastic people watching all around.
