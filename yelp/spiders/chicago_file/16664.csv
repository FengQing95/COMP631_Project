Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my second deep dish pizza in Chicago and it did not disappoint.  I was here early on a Sunday evening and we were seated immediately.  We ordered a kids meal for our daughter - penne marinara, a root beer that was extremely large, plenty for two people without a refill, and a deep dish with olives, sausages and mushrooms.  We were told we'd have to wait awhile for the deep dish, which was fine.  Our daughter's pasta came out first, which worked out well because she ate plenty of food and practically had food coma by the time our pizza arrived.
