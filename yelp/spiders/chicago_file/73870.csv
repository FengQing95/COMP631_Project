Little Goat Diner////Delicious menu, bright location, worth getting out of bed early on a weekend day! My only complaint is that they're always out of the cinnamon rolls when I'm there! Everything tastes fresh and the service is good and polite. Again, it's worth getting out of bed early on a weekend!
