Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I arrived early and had a Dark and Stormy at the bar while I waited for my +1. The bartenders were all very social and we chatted a bit while he mixed the drink. The beverage was exceptional - mixed strong, but without overpowering the balance of the ingredients and piled high with crushed ice. Shortly after finishing, our table became available and we moved on to the main event. While upstairs has a warm glow and air of regality (without being overbearing), the table we were seated at downstairs had a more intimate feel - the chandeliers, oaken seats and soft light featured on the main floor were largely replaced by candlelight, velvet chairs and broader tables for larger parties.
