Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////D' best thin crust pizza in the midwest! Drove from the gateway arch to have a good pizza, and it's worth the 300 miles to try this deliciousness of a round dough. When we arrived the line was also 300 meters long that we just opted to go, and after the first bite I got a taste of mecca decca pizzeria fantasia. And let me correct my first statement, Drove from the gateway arch to have an excellent thin crust pizza.
