Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was absolutely amazing!  Got the deep dish classic with sausage.  The butter crust could not have been cooked more perfect.  Crispy, buttery goodness.  The toppings were good. Every bite had sausage in it.  The tomato sauce on top seemed fresh made.  It was great.  The only thing that could've been better would be more cheese and thicker toppings. It was definitely tastebud blowing goodness though.  Absolutely must try this pizza. As for the restaurant itself, it was very small and overly crowded. Not enough seating. Had an hour wait so we just ordered for pick up instead. They said an hour. Pizza wasn't ready. They said hold on, let me see where it's at and then never came back to tell me. It was fifteen more minutes then they brought our pizza. It was totally worth the wait though.
