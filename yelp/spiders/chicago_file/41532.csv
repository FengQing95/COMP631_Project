Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is a unique dining experience!  All the dishes are medium size in portion, but everything is meant to share!  We love their sangria and the bacon and dates, everything is really good from the nuts to the olives and the paella!  The potatoes in the aoli sauce are also a must have!
