The Purple Pig////Wow..despite being such a busy environment the staff are very welcoming. We waited appropriately 45 minutes for a table but servers came around and gave us drinks and hors d'oeuvre and were amazing ..The menu is great with small plates that can be shared. We had so many great recommendations from our waiter. We loved the variety of food on the menu. We had the Scallops which were perfectly seared, the pork belly and pork shoulder...all very delicious. The desserts and drinks were also yummy. We had such a great time here..Kudos on o the top notch staff!!!
