Smoque BBQ////As someone who has lived in North Carolina, Kansas City, and Oklahoma and has spent considerable time in Texas, Memphis, and other BBQ immersed areas, I would say that Smoque is average at best. I honestly don't get the hype? I'm definitely not saying that it's not worth eating, I just think we need to be honest about the quality of the product.
