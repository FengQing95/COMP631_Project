Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite tapas restaurants in the Chicago area. The potatoes with tomato aioli are outstanding, but the best thing in my opinion was the paella. The paella option with multiple forms of delicious pork is to die for. I would say it's a must when coming here. To top it all off, the flan was rich and dense, some of the best flan I have ever had. Disclaimer: it is a lot thicker, almost more of a dense custard, so if texture is not for you, maybe steer clear. All in all, it is a great restaurant, with a cool atmosphere.
