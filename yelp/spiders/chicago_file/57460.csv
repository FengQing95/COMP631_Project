Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This restaurant was a great place to visit after a busy day of exploring the city. Â We arrived in the late evening on a Saturday night. The restaurant was very busy, and there was a wait to get a table. Luckily, since there was only two of us we were able to grab a couple of seats at the bar.
