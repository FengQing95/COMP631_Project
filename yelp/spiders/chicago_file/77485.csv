Little Goat Diner////As a huge fan of Girl and the Goat, Little Goat has been on my radar ever since it opened. It seemed like a more casual restaurant with a way broader menu that included breakfast stuff, sandwiches, tapas style snacks, and also heavier dishes. Little Goat was a place I wouldn't really plan ahead for and make reservations in advance like you have to for GaTG, which is probably why I haven't checked it out until now. Every time I would drop by to try to get a table there would be a huge wait, and with all the other great options on Randolph, it just never seemed worth it.
