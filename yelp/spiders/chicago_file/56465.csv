Smoque BBQ////We finally decided and, again, were able to approach the counter immediately.  The counter help was beyond friendly.  When I asked her how the brisket chili was, she offered me her opinion, mentioned she likes it with Tabasco sauce and offered me a sample.  Sample? Sure!  Except that the sample was an ala carte sized side of the chili which we devoured while we waited for our actual order to be ready.
