Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Recently came to Chicago to celebrate my birthday-week, and this place was highly recommended. Everything about this place is A-1. LOVED our server, Erik -- all his recommendations were spot on (garlic shrimp de jonghe, traditional filet mignon and bone marrow, creamed spinach, truffle mac & cheese, and mango sorbet). Also, their fresh sourdough bread is excellent. I can't say enough good things about this place. If I ever find myself in Chi-Town again, I'm coming back here.
