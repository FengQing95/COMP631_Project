Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After viewing all the competition for best deep dish pizza in Chicago, my girlfriend and I decide to try Lou Malnati's. We went here on a Wednesday night around 6pm, so it wasn't too crowded. However, around 7pm, all the booths and tables were filled, so try to get here early if you can. The booths are extremely comfortable and the service at Lou Malnati's is quite good because the waiters are attentive and even slice the deep dish pizza for you. The GF and I ordered a medium sized Malnati Chicago Classic and the chocolate chip pizza for dessert. In regards to the deep dish pizza, the Malnati Chicago Classic was amazing, it came loaded with sausage and the crust was out of this world. The cheese was well melted and extremely flavorful. Initially, the medium size pizza looked too small for us, but after consuming that beast, it was a total hunger buster! My only complaint about the deep dish pizza at Lou Malanti's is that it is a bit oily (also the 30 minute wait for the pizza to be freshly prepared), but other than that this deep dish pizza was out of this world and I would come back to Chicago just to eat here again. Lastly, the dessert was also pretty good, we got the larger portion of the chocolate chip pizza and it was loaded with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. I would tell them to go easy on the whipped cream because it was an overload. However, the chocolate chip portion was warm and soft, which complemented the ice cream very well. Overall, I highly recommend trying Lou Malnati's if you want some high quality deep dish pizza at an affordable price.
