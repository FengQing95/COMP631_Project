Little Goat Diner////Decided to go for brunch to get out of the same ol northside neighborhood. Had been before, but not in a few years, and it did not disappoint. We started with drinks, which is always the right idea, and the nachos. The nachos with the house-made masa chips are a meal of themselves. Incredible! They need to sell those chips by the bag. You've never had chips like these!
