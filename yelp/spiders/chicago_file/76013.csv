Little Goat Diner////I've heard a lot about this place and I was really excited to check it out. I was honestly disappointed. Everything was average (specially the food). I ordered the 'Fish Tostadas' and all I could barely taste the fish, I only tasted the fried batter and the fried tostada. In short it was heavily fried with minimal flavor. I had to order chill sauce to make it eatable. I also ordered the 'Veggie Quesadilla' which was a little better than the tostadas. In all, it was just an average meal, probably gonna be a pass for the next time.
