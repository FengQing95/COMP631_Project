Smoque BBQ////This place is way overrated/overpriced and you don't get much food at all (except if you were going to feed a toddler). The service is sub-par and they just don't give you any volume of food for their high prices. Basically you are paying for overhead and the servers, that is all I get out of it. Shame me once, but not twice, I will not return. I have gone to many other places and they give you quality bbg (and mounds of it) at a fraction of the cost. Perhaps their patrons have not been to other places for comparison, however, once you have, you will give this place a pass like I did only after 2 tries. I'm out!
