Smoque BBQ////Lived in Chicago 12 years, probably been here 3-4 times in that span and just don't get what the rave is about this place. Ribs aren't that great. Im looking for fall off the bone juicy ribs, maybe i'm not ordering right??? Nothing special about the mac and cheese and cole slaw sorta sucks. Think im done trying this place.
