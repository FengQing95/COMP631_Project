Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I could not have asked for a better place to celebrate this very special occasion. Our hostess checked us in, sat us, and welcomed us to Bavette's --- a restaurant that I swear feels like pre-war Paris with a twist of classic Americana. We read online about this amazing beef stroganoff, but it wasn't on the menu. Bummer. It's fine, but our mouths were definitely set for this "special" stroganoff. We ordered the fried chicken, elote corn, and steak frites. The steak (we ordered it medium well) was fabulous. A place known for its beef... well, it better be amazing! And again, it was. Now, lemme rush to talk about this pork fat fried chicken. Holy... I better watch my language here. The fried chicken was incredibly memorable. The batter was fried perfectly and (I'm not sure if this will turn you on or off but...) the seasonings made the chicken taste like breakfast sausage. I know this sounds a little "low-brow" of me to say that, but it reminded me of those spices... This is good for me at least! The chicken was still moist and the portion was very reasonable for the price. Eat this chicken with the slightly spice-sweet-tangy elote corn, and you're in gastronomic paradise! Their cocktails were delicious as well. I ordered a kir royale, and well... who doesn't like champagne and cassis? Psh. They also had very tasty artisan crusty bread. Bread is my downfall, and they were nice enough to bring more out even though I had already eaten basically a whole chicken and a cow.
