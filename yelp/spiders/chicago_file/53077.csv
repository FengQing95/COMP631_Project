Smoque BBQ////Smoque is a good solid BBQ in Chicago. First time, lines were winding around the building, and seating was impossible. Second time, about 8 months after opening, earlier in the evening was a little more manageable. Still packed but not overwhelming. The brisket is delicious, roasted chicken as well. I don't like BBQ all over the meat. I like to taste the meat and add the BBQ from the side. They do this their meats really well. Decent sides, nothing stands out as amazing, but the cobbler is good.
