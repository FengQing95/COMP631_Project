The Purple Pig////I love the fun items on their menu; I ordered the duck prosciutto, roasted bone marrow, and burrata cannoli. My favorite was the duck prosciutto - sliced incredibly thinly and truly melted in my mouth! The bone marrow was also stellar, so much umami! The burrata cannoli, while still good, was my least favorite of the three. Most of its pricetag is probably the osetra caviar, otherwise it was small for the price and I actually prefer the texture of fresh burrata over the whipped burrata in the dish.
