Art Institute of Chicago////The layout is a bit tricky but which museums aren't? I did like the Islamic Art wing (just wish there was more to it) and the Impressionist wing. I don't get why they displayed Seurat's "A Sunday Afternoon" since it was a reprint. I don't get why museums do that. Couldn't they just do that for any art piece? Well, whatever the intention, I would only like to lay my sights on the real deal. Otherwise, I can look at my art history book and have the same effect.
