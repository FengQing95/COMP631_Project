The Purple Pig////The 6 of us shared an octopus asparagus dish, duck confit, pork malnati, a pasta dish, and the bone marrow. The bone marrow and the duck were to die for!! The bone marrow wasn't too oily, and it wasn't overcooked. The duck was juicy and tender as if it would melt in your mouth! The octopus wasn't chewy at all, and everything tasted great.
