The Purple Pig////Then, we got talked into ordering the duck. This was a dish I didn't intend on ordering but the server said that they braise it for days/hours. I guess we couldn't say no. haha. It ended up being amazing. There were giant pieces of duck meat, unlike many other places that have ducks with more skin than meat. You put it in a fluffy bun and the white sauce on the side really compliment the entire entree. It's a mix of fun and umami flavors all together.
