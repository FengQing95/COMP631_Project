Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The sangria menu is extensive - and they were featuring a white pear as the special of the day. Seeing as we like red wine - we went with the Classic red. Unfortunately of the 6 or so sangrias on the menu, 5 of them are white... that's probably the only complaint I can find about this place.
