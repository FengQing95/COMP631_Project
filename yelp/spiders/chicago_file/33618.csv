Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////3.75 is what I would rate this venue. I was not able to get a reservation (first available was a month away) so I did sit at the high tables near the bar. Service was great. Food (halibut, bone marrow and dry aged bone in ribeye) were good but nothing out of this world. Now the dessert (chocolate cream pie) was a solid 4 and a must try!
