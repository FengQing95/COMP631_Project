Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Delicious, fun, and somewhat adventurous eating (if you want it to be). I went here with a large group (9 people) and we had a great time splitting pitchers of sangria and trying a BIG variety of dishes. The atmosphere, when crowded, is loud and fun but still somewhat refined. The waitstaff do a great job keeping up with the constant rotation of dishes, and the open kitchen when you walk in makes you extra excited for all of the delicious plates to come. I'd highly recommend this for any outing/ group.
