Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Upon our impromptu arrival at 10:30ish, our group was told that we could be seated at two different tables as there were no optimal seating for us.  Some members of our group were met with some attitude from the manager, a young lady whose name I did not get.  I then perused the dining room and discovered a spot that would be more ideal from our group.  When I tried to request this spot, the manager tried to sway me to another spot, which we ultimately accepted.  However, her tone was condescending, inflexible, and downright inappropriate coming from the manager of a fine establishment.  I found her to be combative and short and it was NO way to start our experience, which for many in our group was our first at Bavette's.  NOTE TO THE OWNERS / MANAGERS - CLEAN IT UP.
