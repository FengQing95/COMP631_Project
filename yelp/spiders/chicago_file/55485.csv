Smoque BBQ////Delicious very smokey ribs. Fantastic and tender brisket. The brisket chili was a zesty and light yummy chili. The Mac and cheese is among the best I have ever had. Very creamy with a crunchy crust. And the final great mark was the salted carmel bread pudding. They put toasted pecans and a streusel topping that adds a great crunch to an otherwise soggy treat. And the salted caramel on top sets it above the rest. Check this place out if you like BBQ. At 8.00 a sandwhich and 4.00 a side, you won't be disappointed.
