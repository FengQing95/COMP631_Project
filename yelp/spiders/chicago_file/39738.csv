Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started with the Roasted Bone Marrow to share and I've never had bone Marrow like that before. We spread it on the bread like butter and topped with the caramelized onions and parsley leaves. The combination just felt like pure decadence! You taste the creaminess of the bone marrow absorbing onto the bread and the onions add a hint of sweetness that just made the combination work. I wasn't sure if the parsley was just there for garnish but that helped balance the richness of the bone marrow.
