Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a cheese pizza, Â the Lou pizza, and the calamari. Thought the Lou pizza is better that the cheese pizza. The fresh tomatoes that they put on the pizza make a big different. Without the tomatoes, the pizza crust is way to dry. I think the more toppings you have in the Chicago style pizza is the better.
