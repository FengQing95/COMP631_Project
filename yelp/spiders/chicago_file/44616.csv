Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Fantastic food, drinks, and service!!! The price is a little more than other tapas restaurants. That is why you are getting what you pay for. The best dish to share was by far the seafood paella! It was huge to share with six people was enough! It had lots of flavor and tasted excellent! The best small dish was the bacon wrapped dates! Anything wrapped with bacon is so good! The small portions of different dishes were very flavorful and had excellent taste! Get anything on the menu is great! Service was good, even with a party of 15. I was surprised! All of the drinks were excellent too! No complaints here! I would come here again and again!
