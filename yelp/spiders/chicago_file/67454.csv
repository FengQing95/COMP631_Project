Little Goat Diner////I think I've tried everything savory so far. My favorite is the bulls eye french toast and my husbands favorite is the bacon toffee milkshake (chocolate is infused with pig face drippings from across the way!). Great coffee. Fun kids cups. Bakery is awesome. I think the only disappointing thing I've had here is the oatmeal.
