Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Malnati salad was slightly overdressed. It was a tad on the salty side but that's probably due to the cheese. This can feed 3-4 ppl i think (not just 2). We def ate our share of salad and couldn't even finish the bowl as we had to save our stomachs for the star of the show.
