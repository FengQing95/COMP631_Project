Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After walking the streets of Chicago, we ended up here because of all the reviews. We thought this place was alright, pizza took 45 mins to make. I really enjoyed the buttery crust but i dislike how the pizza is watery. I believe that's due to the tomatoes that is in the sauce, not bad of a place, i come back if i'm in the area.
