Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love the food here, and always recommend to my friends this place. The low rating for today is from the 10 second service I received when picking up my to go order. When I entered, I went to the host stand and said "I have a to go order" and the host pointed to it and said "go get it". It was the only order there, so I picked it up. Out of no where, another hostess snatched the order out of my hands and demanded to see confirmation. I understand she has a job to do, but as someone from the industry, I would NEVER forcefully grab anything from a guest's hands. Again, I get you have a job to do, and there's ways to do it, but that was straight up rude.
