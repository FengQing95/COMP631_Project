Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visited Chicago for the first time and of course we had to try deep dish pizza so we went to Lou's. Warning: be prepared to wait for your food. It took about 10 minutes to seat two on Friday night and after being seated and ordering we waited an hour for two small deep dish pizzas. My friend enjoyed the Classic and I loved loved loved my Lou pizza - the tomatoes on top really added a great sweetness (but it also made it wet... so just be aware that your hands will get dirty!). You can pre-order your meal while you wait for a table so I definitely recommend doing that so you won't get too impatient for food when seated.
