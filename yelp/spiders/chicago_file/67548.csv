Little Goat Diner////went here for a little bday celebration and decided to be brave and order the goat almighty. was i in for it or what? 3 kinds of meat: goat burger, braised beef, and bbq pork. Â goat burger tasted a bit funny, for a first timer. would i order it again? no...too much meat and not enough anything else. ordered some tempura fried mashed potatoes...not bad. but the fries deep fried in bacon fat? idk what they do but BEST FRIES by far....holy cow....crab dip, also delish.
