Little Goat Diner////I'm really glad we were able to experience both the bakery and the dining room at Little Goat, and it's definitely a place we'll be back to on our next visit to Chicago. Oh! And don't forget to pick up a loaf of bread to take home from the bakery as well - it's pricey, but well worth it!
