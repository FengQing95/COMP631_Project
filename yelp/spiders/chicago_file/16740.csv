Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Over the years different offices I have worked in have ordered from here. Everyone raves about the pizza, and locals love it. It's a solid choice, but nothing outstanding. Â I have also been in the restaurants, and the catered food is consistent with the food in the dining room--again, a solid pizza choice, but no "wow" experience.
