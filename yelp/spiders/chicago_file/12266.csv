Art Institute of Chicago////Some of the Modern and Contemporary Art and the American Art wings were a bit hard to find as some of the floors are not connected and a bit confusing. My husband was most excited to see Picasso's The Old Guitarist and Edward Hopper's Nighthawks, so glad we were able to find them as it was our last stop before leaving.
