Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Since I was by myself, I sat at the full-service bar. The restaurant was quaint with red leather seating, tightly packed tables, and dimly lit lights and chandeliers. Just about every seat was taken on a cold Wednesday night and there was lots of activity. The bartender who attended me, Michael, was very attentive and responsive and made me feel right at home.
