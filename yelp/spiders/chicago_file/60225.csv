Smoque BBQ////Be prepared to stand in line, and sometimes they are sold out of an item (mostly, brisket).  Seating can best be called communal, but that's not a bad thing at a BBQ joint.  Outside seating would be great in the summer, but I'll not hold my breath on that.  Street parking is as good as it gets, but I have always been lucky to find a spot.
