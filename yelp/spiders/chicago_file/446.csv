Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////For the price, I'm just not convinced it's worth the wait time and extra price.  Service was great, the food was just good.  Nothing out of this world.  It's obviously a desirable location for tourists, but I'm not sure why locals are so obsessed with it.  I've been to much better places in the city.  Cinnamon pancakes were yummy.  Could have used some more topping.  It was kind of skimpy and the bottom pancake had nothing on it....which was a bit disappointing when you pay extra for specialty pancakes.  I probably would only go once.  We won't likely be back to this one.  Too many other choices.
