Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////4) Bacon: It pretty much goes without saying that I have to get the bacon at any of Brendan Sodikoff's restaurants. The bacon is some of the best that I've had, being thick cut, house cured, maple goodness that melts in your mouth. I found that bites of the bacon went very well with the steak, but then again what doesn't bacon go well with? Just go ahead and do yourself a favor and get this.
