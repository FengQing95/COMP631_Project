Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Brought my four daughters here for a pre-holiday dinner. Just as in my prior visits here - food is amazing!! Service is fabulous!!! And the pitchers of sangria were delish! Such a fun place to come to with a group to try an array of interesting flavors and tastes! This place is always solid!
