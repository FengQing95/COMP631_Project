Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was the first stop when my friend and I arrived in Chicago. Literally, we got off the plane, put our luggage in our hotel, and then walked here. This place is an institution in Chicago, so we knew we had to go there. We got the Lou Malnati's deep dish, and while it was good, it was a little disappointing. The crust was just ok, the toppings were a little sparse, but the marinara sauce was great.
