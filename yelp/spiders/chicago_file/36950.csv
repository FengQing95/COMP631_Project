Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We stopped in after dining next door at Gilt so this review is just for the bar.  the space is warm, classy and welcoming (albeit maybe too dimly lighted) and the bartenders were extremely personable.  Drinks are your customary craft cocktails and I will admit that their old fashioned is one of the best that I've had.  Living in Wisco I am a sucker for a brandy old fashioned but their rendition with Old Overholt was top notch.  One highlight of the night was trying the pickle back.  A shot of Jameson followed by a shot of pickle juice.  I don't know if I would slam these but the brininess of the pickle juice did a great job tempering the heat of the whiskey.  Their menu looked great as well and will definitely be checking that out on another weekend when we are visiting.
