Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were visiting Chicago from out of town and was told to go here (instead of Giordano's). There were four of us and we ordered a small Classic and Lou's, bruschetta, and garlic bread (with cheese!). The Classic was amazing! The sauce they used was so tasty, it didn't even need any of the extra seasoning some sausages have. The cheese was thick and the sauce was just the right amount. I would, hands down, recommend getting the Classic over the Lou if this is your first time here :) to me it was just the better pizza!
