Smoque BBQ////Sides are also good, I particularly recommend the baked beans which are studded with chunks of porky goodness.  My husband hated the mac and cheese, I loved it.  In fact, I loved it even more on the 2nd day, it's good stuff.  The coleslaw is of the vinegar/pepper based school, not my fave, but has very finely shaved bits of red onion in it that really makes it shine.  In fact, the only thing I've had here that could even be qualified as a disappointment is the pulled pork.  Delicious, but not nearly as good as the rest of their menu.  That fantastic smokey flavor you find in all of their other offerings is lost on this dish.  It's still tender and good, just lacking a bit of oomph/flavor.  It is the one item here that I actually needed to put sauce on. The sauce, btw, is fantastic, but I definitely prefer the lighter Carolina based one.  My one quibble is the lack of white bread - god intended us to eat white bread with our BBQ, dammit, could you just dole out a couple of slices of wonder bread with the cue, please?
