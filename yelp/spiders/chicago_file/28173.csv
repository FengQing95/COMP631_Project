Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For dinner on my first night in Chi-town, I knew it had to involve pizza. Deep dish pizza. I've heard the saying that only tourists seek out the famous Chicago-style pizza, but this spot looked like a local's favorite. Lou Malnati's looks like a tavern or pub and has a welcoming vibe. Very patriotic with their sports team memorabilia decorating the walls. The staff is great: super friendly and attentive.
