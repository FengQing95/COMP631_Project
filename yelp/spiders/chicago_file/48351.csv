Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! I've been here countless times for dinner but last time I went here with someone I met on Bumble BFF. Â It's a good place to take friends to and such a nice atmosphere to get to know each other or catch up because the food is made to share! Just make sure to get a reservation because it's really busy a lot of the time.
