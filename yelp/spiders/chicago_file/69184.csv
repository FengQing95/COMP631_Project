Little Goat Diner////I called up my best friend Toby to see if he wanted to come but he got city regional rollerskater tournament next month so he said he needed to re-tie his ropes and polish his pads so he can finely win one and make it big. So it was settled - me and Big D went alone like the good old days (January 2012 - August 2012), and man it was just like 2012 all over again.
