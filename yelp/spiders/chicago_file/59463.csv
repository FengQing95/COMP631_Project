Smoque BBQ////I realize I'm in the minority here, but I swear, I've had better cole slaw at KFC & pulled pork at bars. Everything tasted either too bland or overpoweringly of smoke. Their sauce was too thin, too sweet and did have way too much cumin in it, as someone else mentioned. Everything's too pricey for what it is, too.
