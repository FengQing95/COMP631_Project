Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is just amazing. The food is so good! The buttermilk crust in the deep dish pizza just melts in your mouth and the flavors are ridiculous. A very homey Italian vibe to this place and you won't leave here without being in a food coma. This is my go-to every single time I'm in Chicago. Even thought the lines are long and the wait times can be rather ridiculous, I'm not complaining because it is ALL worth it. Everyone that works here is friendly and the best part is you can purchase the pizzas frozen and bring them home if you're traveling domestically! They also have their salad dressing for purchase. Everything here is simply delicious!
