Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What can I say! The deep dish here is way better than New York style pizza. The location was very convenient, only a couple of blocks away from the hotel I was staying at. Upon arrival, there were plenty of tourists doing the same thing we were doing which was waiting patiently  to try the deep dish pizza Since it was dinner time, there was a wait time of 45 minutes but our waiter advised us to order before getting our table because the pizza would take thirty minutes to bake. Def a heads up in my book. Though the wait was not to shabby my group of three was seated within 15 minutes of wait time. We ordered the infamous stuffed spinach bread  and a medium deep dish. The stuffed spinach bread was baked golden to perfection with ooey goey mozzarella in every bite. As for the deep dish, words can't describe how amazing it tasted. The crust was crunchy but not to hard to bite into, everything else in the inside was soft and marinated perfectly. Even though i was a bit full from lunch, I wanted to have seconds.  Overall, the service, atmosphere and food was up there , so def a 5 in my book.
