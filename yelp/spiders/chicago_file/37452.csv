Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've been here twice. Both times we got the dry aged bone-in ribeye, which was absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked (and definitely big enough to share). The first time we ate here, however, the steak not only took 45 minutes to arrive after we finished our starters, but also came medium (when we had asked for rare). We felt horrible sending it back, but when you're paying $70 for a steak, it better be perfect! Â When the steak finally came back the 2nd time properly cooked rare, the restaurant ended up comping the entire steak (very generous, especially when we never asked!) and giving us a free side of mashed potatoes, which were full of butter and super yummy. Our waiter was also extremely nice about it, and just fun to talk to in general (so was our waiter the 2nd time we came).
