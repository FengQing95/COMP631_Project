The Purple Pig////Sooo hard to decide which dishes were my favorites. I pretty much enjoyed them all. If I had to pick, well...the milk braised pork shoulder was especially memorable. Had a great time here-what a gastronomical experience with great friends!! Would definitely come back when I get the chance!!
