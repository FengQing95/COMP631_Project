Little Goat Diner////Upscale comfort food in an upscale diner setting. Friendly waitstaff. Pork belly home fries had delicious potato hunks but the pork belly itself was dehydrated and unpleasant to encounter. Awesome juicy and messy Reuben. Macaroni and cheese was well-done but nothing special. Our experience managed to be greater than the sum of its meal parts - the reasonable (read: options under $20) prices for this part of town probably helped.
