Little Goat Diner////Loved the vibe here. We did not have a lunch time reservation but the wait was only about 20 minutes on a Saturday. I got the reuben (who knew kimchi could make a sandwich so complete?!?) and my husband got the bull's eye french toast. My reuben was very hearty, I only ate half of it and brought the rest home. The french toast dish was good but a little too sweet for my husband's taste. If we are ever back in Chicago we will give it a shot. Portions were extraordinary! So big!
