Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I ordered the chili omelette special, which was fluffy and delicious.  The cheddar cheese was fried inside the omelette, then topped with chili and more cheese.  Each omelette is accompanied by hashbrowns or fruit and toast or pancakes.  I got hashbrowns (standard) and pancakes, which were perfect!  I would go back and order them as an entree.  (Small pet peeve: they don't butter the toast for you, which means by the time it hits your table and butter it yourself, it's too cold to melt.  Glad I didn't get the toast)
