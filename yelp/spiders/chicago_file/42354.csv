Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The beautiful love of my life took me here for my birthday, and I must say, it was hands down one of the best birthday presents a man can get from his woman.  We returned here again, and the service is still as good as it gets, and the food is absolutely amazing.  I love how you can select from different flavors of sangria, and that you can order a pitcher of it at a reasonable price, for both you, your date, or group to casually consume.  I'm quite honestly hooked on this place, and I wait to introduce Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba to other friends and family.
