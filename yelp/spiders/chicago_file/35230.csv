Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The wedge salad was massive with two giant pieces of bacon, hard boiled eggs, ranch dressing, fresh dill, and chopped red onion. It was wonderfully flavored and plenty for the two of us. We also shared the short rib stroganoff and a side of brussels sprouts. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. The short rib was flavorful, however, some of the pieces were more like dried out stew meat. Not all melty and decadent as short rib normally is. Overall the dish was delicious but it could've been more so. The side of brussels sprouts were served with bacon and a rich horseradish creme fraiche sauce. They were cooked perfectly. Â
