Little Goat Diner////So if you want to be super cool and hipstery, hit this place up in your skinny jeans on a Friday night and be prepared to wait 2 hours for a table.  But if you don't care about other people actually seeing how cool you are by going to this restaurant, seriously go at an off time and have one of the best meals of your LIFE without a significant wait.  Mark my words -- you WILL be back.  And I will be jealous.  Guaranteed. ;]
