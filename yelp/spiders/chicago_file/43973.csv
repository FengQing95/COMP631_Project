Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////To top it all off, I got to tell Â the story of me dropping a water glass that cut my toe in Venice and subsequently taking a water ambulance to the hospital that was one block away... jeeez. Why did I tell this embarrassing story? Because an entire glass of water slipped out of my hand spilling all over the place... yes, the pomegranate sangria did it's job.
