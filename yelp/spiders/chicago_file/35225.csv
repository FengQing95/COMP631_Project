Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Simply amazing! A place I will always suggest to anyone looking for a romantic, tasteful, elegant dinner. We tried the elotes style corn, the goat cheese and peppered duck, the shortrib stroganoff and the 16oz ribeye steak. Everything was so enjoyable even the water! The ribeye, from my fianc√©'s standpoint, was "the best in town" and I don't think I could even begin to disagree. The staff was so nice and very attentive to anything we needed. A place I can't wait to go back too.
