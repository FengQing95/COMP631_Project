Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The vegetarian skillet was delicious.  I almost ordered a side of hash browns in addition due to the complete absence of this this style of hash browns on the East Coast.  Service was prompt and appropriate and water glasses filled with alacrity.  There's not much that Wildberry gets wrong in terms of breakfast.
