Art Institute of Chicago////World Class in all respects, You should plan out your visit and prioritize what to see as you will never cover the whole place in a day and remain coherent. Start at the impressionists on the top floor, probably the best collection in the US of this period, and work your way down. We spent about 1/2 day there exploring, early 20th century American art to Modernism .Good furniture selections too, especially Shaker pieces. We caught America after the Fall: Painting in the 1930s, with the American Gothic and classic Hopper pieces also Abstract/Object which explored Maholy Nagys influence. We took a break for a lunch in the cafeteria the salads were very good, and gave us enough energy to cover all we intended.
