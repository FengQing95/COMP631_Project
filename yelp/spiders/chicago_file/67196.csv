Little Goat Diner////Stopped in the other day for a late brunch and let me just say, Stephanie Izard should probably be known as King (Queen?) Midas, as everything she touches turns to gold.  An hour plus wait at 2:00 on a Sunday...who else can do that? At least she knows her shizz.  I love Girl and the Goat and Little Goat lives up to its namesake.
