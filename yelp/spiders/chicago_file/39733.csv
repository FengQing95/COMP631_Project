Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////They have a downstairs, which I haven't been down to yet, but would love to try out next time. I've heard it's quieter and more intimate. You can make reservations through OpenTable, which will save you the wait! Also, know that the bar has full menu for food, just in case you don't want to wait for a table!
