Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When the pizza came out, it was intimidating and it was still bubbling from the oven! Our server cut it and served us which I thought was a nice touch because I honestly wouldn't know how to approach it to cut it myself hahaha. I'm really not a fan of deep dish pizza but I knew I had to try it while in Chicago and I'm happy that I did! The flavor of the pizza itself is very good & I loveeeed the crust. But I don't think I'll ever crave it again and that's simply because I don't prefer deep dish.
