Smoque BBQ////What I learned from the show is that the guy that opened this place had little restaurant experience and no professional cooking experience.  He was just an IT guy who decided he'd "rather make ribs".  So he and a couple of his buddies traveled around the country figuring out BBQ.  They decided not on one style, but a variety of styles from the likes of Texas, Tennessee, and the Carolinas.  Kinda cool, I thought.
