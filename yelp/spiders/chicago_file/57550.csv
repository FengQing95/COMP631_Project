Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Always a go to when folks are visiting from out of town or to just ball out on tapas. Love this place. Best to go with a large group of people so you can try everything and share. But I've definitely gone with just my girlfriend and we'll indulge ourselves. Food is impressive, and delicious. Fun at atmosphere. Won't break the bank either. Can't think of another restaurant that has better value compared to price
