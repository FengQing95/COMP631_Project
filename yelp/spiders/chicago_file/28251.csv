Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was very disappointed with the way we were treated on Saturday. Having been a few times we knew there was about an hour wait before being sat so we called to ask about the process or if there was a process for getting sat without doing a walk up. We were told to call on our way to be added to the list, so we did and were told it was 35 minute wait. When we arrived an arrogant individual said it was now an hour and 15 minute wait. How is that possible if the restaurant is a 15 minute walk from my apt? When posed this question, he smirked and said "Well as time passes, it takes longer. Just the way it is at Lou's" (WOW!!)
