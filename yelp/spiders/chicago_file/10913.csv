Art Institute of Chicago////This place is a must when visiting Chicago. Beautiful building with famous works of art of all types. You could spend all day in here if you walk through all the exhibits. Be aware, you can not take pictures of all the art- those which are prohibited will have it noted on the info plaque that is next to the piece of art.
