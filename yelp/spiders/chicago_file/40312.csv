Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Starting with a disclaimer that it's probably been two years since I've been to Bavette's, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine's Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette's a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later.
