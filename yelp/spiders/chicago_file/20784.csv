Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Although we were seated immediately upon arrival, we were severely disappointed with our service after we were served our pizza. Our waitress never stopped by to check on us after we received our pizza. Our cups were completely empty throughout our meal because the pizza was so dry. After a 45 minute wait, our waitress finally stopped by to give us our check and to refill our cups. As if this wasn't bad enough, when the waitress returned, my credit card was completely covered with oil.
