Little Goat Diner////Been here several times over the past couple years. 90% of the time I get the pork belly pancake ($16) because it is just so satisfying and although the portion looks small it is quite filling. Plus it has that little salad on top so yay for veggies. I've also gotten the shrimp and grits ($17) and this little piggy went to China ($16) - the former was ok but not as good as the pancake, the latter interesting but too salty (and no veggies!). I love getting the desserts, too, which are always 9$, I believe. The "open sesame" one was eh but the lemon curd one was a must-order!! I got the cinnamon bun once and while it was good I needed something more to make it worth the hefty 6$ price tag (maybe more cream cheese frosting? Idk). The wait is always long so be smart and make a reservation. Also there's a vegan menu now.
