The Purple Pig////It's a really popular restaurant in Chicago and appears in many restaurants recommendations. But actually I don't feel it really impressed me, maybe I'm not a meat lover...? It's just an average restaurant that is suitable for lunch/dinner/brunch for me, nothing really special. Maybe next time I'll try their signature dishes with pork
