Smoque BBQ////Absolutely the best BBQ meat place in the Chicago area. We got the St. Louis Pork Rib, the Brisket platter and the peach cobbler. They are all perfectly done.  I have had BBQ meat multiple times in Kansas and St Louis. This is definitely comparable to the best places in these areas.  I stuffed myself full just a day ago and now I am already missing this place.
