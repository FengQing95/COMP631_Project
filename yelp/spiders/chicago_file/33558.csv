Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is my new favorite place. The staff is so helpful and delightful, and the atmosphere makes you feel like you have time traveled back into a romantic restaurant during the twenties. I look forward to going back over and over again. AND the caesar salad is one of the most unique I have ever tried. AMAZING!
