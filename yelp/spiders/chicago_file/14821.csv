Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////On our visit to Chicago we tried Lou Malnati's on N Wells St & Giordano's on E Lake St. I really enjoyed Lou Malnati's & the service was superb. I had the "classic" with sausage, yum! I uploaded a deep dish photo of the classic. But....I preferred the crust of Giordano's. So on my return to Chicago, I will be going back to Giordano's :)
