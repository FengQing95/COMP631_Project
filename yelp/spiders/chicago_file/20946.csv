Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So good! We stopped here a few months back on my husbands first trip to Chicago & he had to try Chicago style pizza. I love Chicago & have been to Uno & Giordano's and Giordanos is my fav... I think they still have a slight leg up on Lou Malnati's (first loves die hard). We arrived shortly after opening bc we had an architectural tour early afternoon (again, hubs first visit so we had to do the tourist stuff). We ordered a salad which was large enough to share for two. We also ordered a small deep dish pepperoni. Good thing we didn't get anything else. We were so stuffed after a piece each! I felt so awful leaving behind our leftovers bc it was so good! It's a bit expensive, but it's Chicago so everything is. It's a great spot!
