Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is, without doubt, the best steak in Chicago. You can harp about Gibsons, Mortons, Primehouse or RPM all you want, but nothing is going to beat the deep flavor that is so perfectly encapsulated in the prime bone-in dry aged ribeye. Seriously, this is the best steak I've ever had, and I do not say that lightly. Please come prepared for this experience, and please take your time. Such decadence is not to be rushed.
