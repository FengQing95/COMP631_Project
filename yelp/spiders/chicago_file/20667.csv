Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////That order there has been a staple since I was a kid and now that same order is for my family.  Have had this meal picked up or delivered at just about every location they have.  Now some might be better than others but still darn good.  If the whole sausage patty is a little to overwhelming or the crumbled sausage instead.  Who's ready for another slice?
