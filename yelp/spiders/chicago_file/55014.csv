Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Definitely one of Chicago's BEST restaurants. This is one of those places where the menu can seem overwhelming. You will have no idea what to order. Trust me that you will love anything you try. Make sure to get the meatballs and the blue cheese steak even if you don't like blue cheese.
