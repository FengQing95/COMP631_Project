Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So this was pretty much the best pizza and bruschetta I'd ever had in my life...This was my first time having real Chicago pizza, and it did not disappoint! I loved the butter crust. It was like a pie crust, but not crumbly. On top of the crust was a thick layer of melty cheese. On top of the cheese was a layer of REAL tomato sauce (with some chunks) and sausage. You could taste the quality of ingredients! I was very impressed! And the bruschetta! Oh man...the tomato/onion/basil mixture was sitting on garlic bread slices! What was there NOT to like??? Made me wonder why I hadn't thought of that myself at home...the service was fantastic and we had a great time overall. If we are back in Chicago we will be returning and bringing all our friends and family with us.
