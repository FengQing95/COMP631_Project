Art Institute of Chicago////Sections they could improve on include the Asian art and Art of the Americas, but lots of other museums specialize in that sort of stuff, maybe they aren't worried about trying to match a whole museum in their comparably small galleries. The Modern Wing is also nice, they keep it very shiny and new looking and you can get a BIT closer to this art than they really old stuff and some of the exhibits are even touchable and edible!
