Smoque BBQ////Unfortunately Smoque always misses the mark. Maybe my bbq palate is slightly different from everyone else, like having a preference for certain beers over others. But the thing that bugs me every time is the dry, bland brisket, and flavorless pulled pork. The food always smells amazing, but the flavor is just not there. Having to drown your bbq in sauce is a sign of bland bbq...sorry.
