The Purple Pig////Smoked tongue - We were frantically looking through the menu to find something else to get, and our waiter suggested we try the tongue. Good call. The smoked tongue was delicious and a must try if you're a fan of salty meats. It reminded me of an Italian deli meat with a smokey twist. Each bite almost tasted like a cross between pepperoni and bacon. 2 for 2 so far with the dishes.
