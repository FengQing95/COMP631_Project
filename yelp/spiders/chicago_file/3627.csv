The Purple Pig////Ok, Back in Chicago and had to return to the Purple Pig.   Has another absolutely over the top awesome meal.  This time we were 6 people and it was dinner at 7-prime time. So...the place is insanely popular so i happened to be downtown at 5:30 and decided to swing by to see the situation.  Glad I did.  At 5:30 on a Friday night it was 90min - 2 hr wait.   The rest of my group would not be ready for that time, so I put our name in and they took my cell number.  It worked perfectly.  I messed around downtown for a while and by 7:15 everyone showed up at the restaurant, we waited 15mins and sat down to this amazing meal (we were treated like kings BTW.)  couldn't recommend the Purple Pig highly enough - definitely go there if you are in town.  We will go there at least once every time we are in town.  Pork Shoulder and the broccoli are insane.    BTW - big call out to Ty and Josie - they are awesome!!!!!
