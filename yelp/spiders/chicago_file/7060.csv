Art Institute of Chicago////The Modern Wing is a beautiful work of art, in and of itself.  The architecture & design of this wing is stunning.  Since it's still so new, I can still get a bit turned around in the galleries of this wing, but it's a lot of fun.  I am enjoying getting to know this wing, and feeling more comfortable around its art.
