Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute has the best special exhibitions. A few years back I went to the Picasso exhibit, but recently I went to the Van Gogh exhibition on opening day. The Bedrooms exhibition for Van Gogh was breathtaking. I was't sure what to expect since the main focus was going to be on just three paintings. But I was pleasantly surprised it encompassed much more work than I expected. Each additional piece of art and letter served as timelines and snapshots into this small period of Van Gogh's life.
