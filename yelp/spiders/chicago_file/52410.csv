Smoque BBQ////Inside, the places is pretty no frills. Long, communal seats. Order at the counter. Awesome smell of meat wafting throughout. To see the place, pricing seems a little on the expensive side- until you taste the food. Clearly a ton of time and attention has been put into smoking the nice selection- including ribs (baby back/st. louis), brisket, pulled pork, chicken and sausage. You can a sandwich, but I'd recommend going with a platter- if in a group you can get a hearty sample of the different meats, served on paper/cafeteria tray. I've had the baby backs, brisket and pork, and all were fantastic.
