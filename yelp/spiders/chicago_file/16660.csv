Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm really on the fence about lou malnati's. Maybe i caught them on an odd nite of delivery amid the super bowl craziness.  I want kind of want to like it because it's a little bit different, and not as over poweringly heavy as full on stuffed crust pizza.  I think if it had just a little bit more cheese it might be passable, but as it was it seemed fairly plain and dull.  (updated) More tragically it made pretty much the worst cold pizza I've ever had, which is always for me a testament for good pizza. (it should still be pretty darn good cold).
