Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Apparently you have to be in the Illuminati to know how things work here. There's a large line outside where no one is actually in line. There's a host there taking names but since I just wanted something to go I didn't figure I'd have to do all that. I go inside where there's another line with people everywhere. Not knowing what to do or order. I got up to the woman and she said what name did you give the hostess? I said I just want something to go I didn't talk to her. Which she said no matter what you give a name. So you wait in line to give your name to wait in line only then to wait for your pizza. Now you know, enjoy it because it looked amazing but the lack of direction is truly disappointing
