Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's has been the best steakhouse I've experienced in the Chicago land area. I ordered the dry aged ribeye with the garlic topping and it was phenomenal. I prefer Bavette's over RPM steakhouse when it comes to steak and it is half the costs. However, Bavette's menu was pretty simple. But, they do each dish very well.
