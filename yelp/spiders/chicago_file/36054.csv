Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////A big speak easy with a french twist. Seafood towers are delic., although I wish they wouldn't chop up the crab leg meet for you (ahem, first world problems I know). Booths downstairs are kind of low, you sink in.. Feels awkward. Whiskey ice cream makes everything better though.
