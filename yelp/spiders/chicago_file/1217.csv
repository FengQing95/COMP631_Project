Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Best gluten free pancakes ever. We eat here every time we stay nearby (Palmer House or Radisson Blu) and have always had excellent service and great food. It's very busy on weekend mornings so there is usually a wait but the Intelligentsia coffee helps. If you are gluten free you will think they made a mistake and gave you regular buttermilk pancakes because they don't taste different at all! The wildberry juice is yummy and the bacon is thick... Will be back soon!
