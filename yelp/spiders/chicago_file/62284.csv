Smoque BBQ////Over my visits, I have tried the brisket, ribs, hot link, and pulled pork.  For a place called "Smoque", I am kind of surprised at the lack of smoke flavor in the meats.  While very tender, I find the brisket to be lacking in that smoky flavor that I am used to getting.  Something tells me it is because they do not have enough time to dedicate to the smoking, while accommodating the thousands of people they get each day.  Same can be said for the pulled pork and hot link.  Where this place has truly disappointed me though, is in their ribs.  I have yet to have a batch that wasn't dried out and chewy.  The sauce they serve with the meals is very good, and if you remember, ask for the spicy version as well.  Very good in its own right.
