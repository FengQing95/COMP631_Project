Little Goat Diner////We've driven past Little Goat Diner many times, and held off on coming because of the 40 minute wait or line out the door. Tuesday night, I came in on a late flight, and we were driving down Randolph, and seeing as it was 10pm, we decided to see if there would finally be no wait-- score! We even found street parking next to it!
