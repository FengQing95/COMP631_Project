Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////5 stars for the meal I just had. Disclaimer: I am not a Chicagoan nor do I consider myself knowledgable about deep-dish pizza. But this was a damn good meal. Lucked into it on a short trip with the family to see the sights around the Chicago Loop. We knew we wanted to eat the local version of pizza and were staying close to several spots that make the lists for being "the best". I thought our decision was down to choosing between Pizzeria Uno or Due but the hotel front door guy told me to go to Lou's. At first I thought he was kidding because I couldn't find a place for pizza named "Lou's". He took pity on me when he realized I had no idea what he was talking about and told me it was short for Lou Malnati's. He told me that it was further away but the walk and wait in line would be worth it. His endorsement sold me when he said, "I think it's da best and I'm from Chicago." Found it without too much trouble and it had a 45 min wait for a table. Thought I was going to die from hunger while waiting since it smelled so good when we checked in. The wait was worth it. Got a great Malnati Salad to share and the Malnati Chicago Classic pizza which is described as extra sausage and tomato on a deep dish butter crust. The description does not do it justice because extra sausage in this case came out looking like a deep dish pain with a sausage manhole cover over it hidden by cheese. Unbelievable, huge, and tasty all at the same time! It was so over the top that I could only take down 1.5 pieces in my hypoglycemic state. The setting is loud with a lot of sports memorabilia on the walls and the wait really sucks. But who really cares about that stuff when the real attraction is getting to stuff your pie hole full of that amazing pizza.
