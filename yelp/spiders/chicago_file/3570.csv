The Purple Pig////The food. The pork belly and chicharronea were great. The food was still sizzling when it arrived. The pork belly was very tender and tasteful. The vinegar gave the chicharronea a Â great taste as well. They were a good size order but we still ordered a second one. We also ate the fried pizza and the spare ribs. Once you get past the balsamic sauce on the ribs, the meat was great. The balsamic was just a little too much for me. (And they were cold). The pizza got hard real fast and was ok. You have to eat it as soon as it hits your table.
