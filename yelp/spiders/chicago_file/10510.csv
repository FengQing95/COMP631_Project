Art Institute of Chicago////I love this museum and have been here tons of times.  I love all the impressionist stuff as well as the photography museum.  I've never been to the new modernist wing, which is new and fairly interesting.  Entry has increased over the past several years but $23, I guess, is still not a bad price to see all of the amazing works of art there is there.
