Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Was out here for a conference and just had to try the famous Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza. We came during the lunch hr rush, surprisingly as busy as they were we got seated in about 15min. We wanted to order one of the fun custom pies but when we found out it would take over an hr for it to come out, we settled on getting the 6' lunch specials which would be ready in less than 15min.
