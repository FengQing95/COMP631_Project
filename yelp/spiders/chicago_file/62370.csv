Smoque BBQ////Hands down the best BBQ joint in town. Consistently great with everything they make.  Ribs, brisket, pulled pork, chicken, sausage, sides. If you really want to win over a customer, use them for catering.  I always call ahead as there is a wait and watching everyone else eat makes me restless.
