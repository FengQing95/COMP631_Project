Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The butter crust here is much better than the cornbread crust at Giordano's in my opinion. The wait is long but that's expected with a Chicago deep dish pizza place. The deep dish sausage & pep pizza was really good & we had a baked cookie with ice cream for desert that was sinful! Portions are huge! A small or medium pizza is enough for two people for sure!
