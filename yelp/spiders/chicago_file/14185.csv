Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza was good but not great, liked the buttered crust. I sat at the bar and ordered a personal pan pizza and wings as an app. Wings were excellent nice portion spicy and lots of celery. Server was polite but 40 mins between the initial order and the pizza arriving - pizza just didn't live up to the anticipation.
