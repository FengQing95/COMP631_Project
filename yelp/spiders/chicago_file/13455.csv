Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I should say first of all that I've been an Uno's girl from my youth.  That said, I prefer a denser crust and slightly more flavorful toppings.  If you prefer your Chicago style with a lighter, more buttery crust and lighter toppings (well, excpet for the cheese - this place loaded it on), Lou Malnati's is better for you.  For more flavor, go Uno's (the one downtown on Wabash, NOT! the crappy Uno's Chicago chain in the burbs and on the coast!!!)  Of course, if what you need is just a filling pizza then this works too.
