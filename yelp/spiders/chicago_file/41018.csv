Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love Ba-Ba-Reeba!!! The fried calamari, the bacon wrapped dates, the desserts, the shrimp in olive oil with sliced garlic. My mother and I go here all the time and are never disappointed. She loves the steak with blue cheese. They have a pretty large menu and there is something for everyone.  We have even had birthday parties here and the hospitality was on point! M-F they have happy hour specials 4pm-6pm for $1 & $3....super worth it!  Highly recomended! Oh and peach sangria...very nice!
