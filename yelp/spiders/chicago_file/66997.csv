Little Goat Diner////We ended up being there for 2 hours and 45 minutes and wasn't offered anything for having to sit there and wait for their credit card machine snafu. It was a little disappointing that we were inconvenienced like that and they didn't do anything to rectify the situation. As I said, the food was alright but I won't be coming back here.
