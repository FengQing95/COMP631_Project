Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////hands down the best in the city ( dont miss out on the thin crust too). While the crust is better than any of the competition (crispy and not too thick (like Giordano's), or burnt (like Pequads)), the sauce steals the show! Â Great seasoning, fresh chunks of tomatoes,not a ground up paste like some of the other guys (i always ask for extra sauce) dont waste your time going to Giordano's, Unos, Gino's or Pequads; come here!!!
