Little Goat Diner////My co-workers and I stumbled upon The Little Goat and had such an amazing lunch on a Friday that we made a point of returning for brunch the following Sunday and were ecstatic with the whole experience. The atmosphere is super fun diner chic. Everything we ordered was beyond delicious.
