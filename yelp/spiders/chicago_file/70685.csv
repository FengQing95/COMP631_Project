Little Goat Diner////Little Goat always has a wait time, and for good reason. The offshoot of Au Cheval by Top Chef winner Stephanie Izard, its menu sports a delicate assemblage of American comfort food, noticeably lightened in trans fat but more than supplicated with ingenuity and creativity. Little Goat provides a recognizable meal with an artisanal flair, chef Izard not taking the concept of a sandwich or a waffle on face value.
