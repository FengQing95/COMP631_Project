Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////10oz Traditional Filet Mignon - We split the Bone in Ribeye and wanted to try the bone in filet, but they were out of them for the night.  Which I don't really understand, because why should you run out of a steak on a Friday night?  They aren't going to go bad overnight if you don't sell every single one with the rest of the weekend coming.  So we went with the plain filet to compare to ribeye, and it was very uninspired.  Perhaps unlike it's aged counterpart, it needed a little more seasoning than just salt.  Nothing remarkable about this steak to make it stand out from any other upscale steakhouse.  In fact I'd put this filet at the bottom of that list.  3 stars
