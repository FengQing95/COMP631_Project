Smoque BBQ////My Mom was in town for her birthday.  We went to Smoque.  She had the chicken and said it was the BEST that she has ever had.  She spent the rest of the afternoon trying to figure out how to take dinner for 8 on the plane back to Tucson.  We'll have to figure it out in time for her next visit.
