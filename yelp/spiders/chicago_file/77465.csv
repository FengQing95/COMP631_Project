Little Goat Diner////Next, my friend and I split the breakfast burrito and the goat Almighty burger. The burrito was excellent; it had a great sauce, greens, eggs, and a lovely wrap that was more like a fold over than a burrito. It was a good mix of salty and a little sour. Would love to get it again. Next, while the goat almighty looked impressive and sounded delicious, it was sort of a disappointment. There are 3 different meats (beef, pulled pork, goat patty) and onion rings + pickles, cheese, and sauces. In theory it should've been incredible but it was honestly overwhelming and sort of impossible to eat. The only way was to deconstruct the burger and at that point it was just like eating different meats. The flavors weren't as great as other items on the menu and it didn't meet my expectations.
