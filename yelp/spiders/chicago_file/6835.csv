Art Institute of Chicago////Yea this place is pretty much amazing!!!  I went there and only had about 2 hours and couldn't see everything.  I would suggest getting there earlier so u can see all the amazing things. We saw alot, but only because we basically ran bc we had only 2 hours. Wish I could have got there earlier. I was so excited when I finally saw " Georges Seurat, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte" painting.  So iconic from ferris bullers day off movie.  I will go back. Great place.  Instagram and twitter @Leeispooping haha
