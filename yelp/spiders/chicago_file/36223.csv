Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Now, I totally understand, and can appreciate, sharing a glass of wine with someone from a bottle you picked up at Binny's before heading to dinner on a run-of-the-mill Saturday night. But this was a special bottle, and a special evening, and it baffles me that the waiters here aren't trained, or equipped, to explain the corkage policy in full, before taking 1/4th of your very costly bottle away.
