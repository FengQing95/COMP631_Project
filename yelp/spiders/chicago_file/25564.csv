Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had the classic personal size deep dish. I think it's so much better than Giordanos. The crust is crunchier and not oily or soggy. The only downside is the wait time for pizza. Keep in mind, I'm from NY. 45 minute wait for anything is just unacceptable. But since I'm in Chicago, do as the Chicagoans do! But seriously, waiting for this pizza is like waiting on line at Six Flags-45 minute wait and ate that $hit in 1 minute!
