Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our all time favorite tapas place. Despite the challenges finding parking (they have a valet service) the overall experience was amazing. It is our date night place! The sangria is amazing and the service,....great! We are still working our way through the menu and enjoy a new item each time! We keep missing the flamenco performances but it's on our list to do! Enjoy the moment and your experiences here!
