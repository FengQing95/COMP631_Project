The Purple Pig////I was really looking forward to going here for a long time because I saw that the reviews here were all praising this place so much. We were actually seated super quickly which I was surprised at because another night I came with a friend and we were told that we'd have to wait for three hours. It's really not all it's hyped out to be here. What you're really doing is vastly overpaying for mediocre food that is really quite small portions unless you want to dish out enough money to actually be able to be full after eating at this restaurant. Our waiter was actually really helpful--I don't recommend getting the desserts here though. They were nothing special at all. The only dish I would go out of my way to have again was the fried polenta appetizer. Other than that, you can definitely go somewhere better and cheaper to have a more appetizing meal that's better for your wallet overall. Glad I finally went though, so now I know and can tell other people not to believe that it's one of the best in Chicago!
