Little Goat Diner////My friend and I ordered the Pork belly pancake and Tonkatsu sandwich to split.  They were both pretty tasty and kind of what I expected of gourmet diner food with an Asian influence.  My only complaint was that the Tonkatsu was a little dry.  The fact that it was huge kind of made up for it though.
