Art Institute of Chicago////This place is really big and a lot of to see.  I wish I have more time to stay in this museum.  I love Monet's painting, and they had around 8 painting from him.  Love it!  Van Gogh special exhibit was ok and not too many thing to see.  Dont get me wrong, I love Van Gogh, but I hope there would be more of his painting in this special exhibit.  I will definitely visit here if I come to Chicago again!
