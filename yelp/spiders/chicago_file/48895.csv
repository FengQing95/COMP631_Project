Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////And it keeps going and going...with paella. Order paella right away, as it takes quite some time to make. So decide quickly! I'd say that the seafood paella is my least favorite, and either of the other two are about even. Ask if they're serving specialty paellas that day, too. You might get a secret surprise!!
