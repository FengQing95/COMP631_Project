Little Goat Diner////This dish deserves some praise; it's an update on a classic guilty side infused with the thoughtfulness of Izard's menu. The perfectly fried onion rings were made with pickled onions, which gave every bite an extra bit of flavor. They were served with ranch and curry mayo dipped sauce, which we devoured. Definitely not your average side...
