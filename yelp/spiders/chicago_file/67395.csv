Little Goat Diner////Do you know what crumpets are? I didn't, and I still think I don't know! Essentially, it's a biscuit shaped chewy pancake, though part of me though it tasted more like a biscuit. Anyway, this was basically pancakes with syrup and chorizo. The chorizo was very weak. Not spicy, not flavorful, but really dull. In fact, it added some gamy flavor to it, without hiding it in its seasonings and spices. When I swept the chorizo off, it was actually halfway decent, but this dish is just terrible and worthless!
