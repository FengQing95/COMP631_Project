Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This restaurant is alright. It's highly likely that I'd never come here again. Service is great and the atmosphere/decor is really nice. However, one ultimately returns to a restaurant for the food. And the food just isn't cutting it for me. Not impressed. We ordered a few tapas plates to share. I wish all of the food came to the table at once but that's not the case here. The food is plated very well (although the portion sizes are ridiculously small, even for tapas) and gets you really excited to dive in and taste. But when you do taste the food it's nothing special. It lacks salt, the food is cold, mostly everything was nasty, even the desserts we tried. The only thing I enjoyed was the fried chicken bites and the braised rib (which could still use some salt). I just think the flavor was lacking. Idk maybe a bad night? Also, I think this place is overpriced for the mediocre food :/ eh!
