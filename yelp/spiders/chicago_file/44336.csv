Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There were 8 of us, and when we finally sat down, we did everything family style.  It was pretty funny watching everyone take a small slice of the dates, or a piece of the sirloin, but I really think this is the way to enjoy Tapas.  Have a little bit of everything, if you really like it get another dish.  To be honest, we got a lot of everything so I don't remember what we ordered (ok maybe the Sangrias have something to do with my lack of memory retention).
