Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For the pizza: we ordered a 9 inch butter crust Lou Malnati pizza which comes with this amazing sausage, cheese and tomato sauce on top of this very light and crispy BUTTER crust. For a deep dish, it did not feel too heavy on the stomache (unless you ate way too much of it). After a couple beers, salad and pizza, we were too full for the chocolate chip in a pan dessert but I WISH I had gotten it!
