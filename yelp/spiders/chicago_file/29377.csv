Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Was recommended this location by our Lyft driver. Definitely different style of pizza from what I'm use to in my hometown. The deep dish was awesome. I got the cheese deep dish with fries. It was to die for. Chicago is known for their deep dish pizza and they didn't disappoint at all. The wait was about 30 minutes, however we did go during lunch time and they were super packed, so the wait didn't seem long at all. Next trip to Chicago will definitely eat here again
