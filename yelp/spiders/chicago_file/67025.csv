Little Goat Diner////Flying solo this trip, so I decided to try Girl & the Goat which was near where I was staying. I go to a conference in Chicago every year and love exploring a new neighborhood each time. It was a weeknight, but it was still busy and I didn't feel like braving the crowd at the bar. Lucky for me Little Goat is right across the street! I sat at the counter near the expediter, which was probably the most interesting part of the meal, so I didn't mind the slow service. I ordered a small goat chili, the pork belly pancake, and a glass of wine. Everything is a la carte and there are so many choices! The chili used different spices than traditional chili, nutmeg perhaps? Usually I am not a chili fan, but this was good. The pancake is listed under "sammiches", but definitely requires a knife and fork. It was ok, definitely more slaw and pancake than pork belly. Next time I'd try something from the 24/7 breakfast menu or a burger, many many tasty looking things coming out of the kitchen. Â In my book this would be a splurge, but a good deal compared to its sibling.
