Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service has always been great, just the right amount of attentiveness without being overbearing or smothering. They have a really good drink menu with craft brews and cocktails as well as a great wine list. I would recommend this place to anyone.  I love bringing out of town guests here, it's not your typical Gibsons or Chicago Cut, but it's just as good (if not better) and something different. Pricing of the food is definitely reasonable, not overpriced as some other chicago steakhouses, but it's definitely not cheap either.  Just know, this place is always a hit with my husband and I (as well as our guests), just like the rest of their places!
