Little Goat Diner////Alexander, thank you for the kudos and all your kind words about our team! Hearing that your server was patient, kind, informative, and friendly makes us so happy. We're thrilled that even our simpler dishes had something to offer and that the okonomiyaki hit the spot for you. We can't thank you enough for recommending Little Goat to the people you know and will look very forward to serving all the folks you send our way! Many thanks for your incredibly kind and thorough review, and we hope we'll see you soon!
