Smoque BBQ////This is a happening spot for BBQ in the Midwest. The location in downtown Chicago serves pulled pork or brisquit and is never dry and love the Memphis sauce that accompanies the sand which. The ribs at the primary location were greasy and not really my favorite but I think I got a bad rack. Other than that it is a great place if your looking for some smoked food.
