Smoque BBQ////Wow, I never thought BBQ could be this good. But it can. And it is. At Smoque BBQ just about 15 minutes outside downtown Chicago. I would give it 6 stars if I could. Recco'ed by JL who has never disappointed and really knows her eats. Keep your friends close and your foodie friends closer.
