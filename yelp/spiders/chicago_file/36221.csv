Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I went here last night for our one-year wedding anniversary. Because we are wine enthusiasts, we brought a very special bottle (2012 Ehlers, Cab Franc) that we'd gotten on our honeymoon and planned to drink on our first anniversary. We often bring our own bottles of wine to restaurants and are always amenable to the corkage fee--we've paid up to $50 in certain instances, but to us, it's worth it to have that special bottle to drink.
