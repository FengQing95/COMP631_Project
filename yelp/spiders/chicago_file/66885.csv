Little Goat Diner////Wow is all I can say. Sort of like a night and day to it's mother restaurant. (Food was better and the price way better) The food in here was great. We have been for both dinner and breakfast and were extremely happy with our food. When we ate for dinner we got the chilli cheese fries (very tasty and the meat is goat) as well as the nachos (huge) Both were extremely tasty and fulfilling (we had 4 of us and we were all feeling pretty good when our entrees came out). For our entrees we got theAmerican burgers and Mac and cheese as a side. The burgers were full of flavor and big in size. The Mac and cheese was the hit of the table, very flavor-able. When we came for breakfast we came early (730am on sunday) and the crowd was still not picking up. By the time we were leaving it was starting to get packed (830-845). We each got the breakfast burrito which was extremely tasteful and large in size. We ate early and weren't hungry until after 3 ha. I highly recommend this joint if you are looking for good food and fairly priced budget
