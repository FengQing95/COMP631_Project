The Purple Pig////Overall, I would recommend the bone marrow and the cheese platter. The pasta was the worst dish we had. And the pork shoulder was just alright. We were looking forward to our experience here and it just didn't meet our expectations. Our waiter also wasn't very nice. He seemed too cool to answer our questions and seemed to smirk a lot when taking our order.
