Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So, as far as the pizza goes...I got the small (thank God!) Chicago Classic with a couple of extra ingredients. My family got the The Lou, the large size for three adults. My youngest got a personal cheese pizza. Honestly, the most satisfied person at our table was our 7 years old. The rest of us were very disappointed with our pizzas. Mine didn't have enough sauce, the other adults didn't like theirs because it had TOO much sauce. The pizza looked like a lumpy mess, kind of those failed attempts you see in the internet compared to the pizza that it was supposed to look like.
