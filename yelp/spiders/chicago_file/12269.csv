Art Institute of Chicago////Beautiful museum of art that should be on your to see list if visiting Chicago.    You may remember it from scenes in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  From ancient artwork to modern day artists, you get an up close and personal look.  Unfortunately "Everything woke turns to sh!@."  Please take into consideration that the museum is using skin color and assumptions to run the place.
