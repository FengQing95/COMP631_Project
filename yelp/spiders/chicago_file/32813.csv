Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////All in all the experience was great. Still not a fan of the music or darkness of the restaurant, but we will definitely be returning for the food and service soon. Also, just to give reader's a feeling for the price of a date, our bill was approximately $110 (less tip) for the two of us.
