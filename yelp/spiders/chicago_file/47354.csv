Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a great find and a must visit on the weekends !! A little far away from the Michigan Avenue downtown , however Â it's a must visit as u'll just love the ambience And would love to visit it again And again ! And yes the variety of sangria 's are to die for :D the stuffed mushroom , meat balls ,chicken and shrimp are worth having with the pitchers ! Also they have happy hours for the food after 10pm !!
