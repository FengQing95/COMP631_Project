Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Loved this tapas restaurant in Lincoln Park!  My friends and I ducked in to avoid a rainstorm but found a great restaurant with good service and wonderful food!  We shared a pitcher of the classic red sangria and there were tons of compliments on it.  I also tried the chorizo-wrapped medjool date & cheese, the deviled egg and the spinach and artichoke dip.  YUMMY!
