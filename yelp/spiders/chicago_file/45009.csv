Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There was a trend with all the food - it seemed like it was cooked beforehand, and sitting there waiting for somebody to order it. It didn't taste freshly made, and the hot food wasn't as hot as it should be (nor was the cold food cold enough)! When the food tasted good, it almost seemed like an accident, like it was good in spite of the preparation! The cheeses were very mild and were served with a nice preserve and some nuts, but they had condensation on them when they came out - implying that they'd been sitting out - this was the Spanish Artisan Cheese Plate.
