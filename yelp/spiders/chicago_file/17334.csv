Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Holy cow, this place is amazing!  I ate here based on the reviews on Yelp, and it didn't disappoint.  Service was speedy despite the super long lines, the restaurant was clean, and the pizza is out of this world.  I got the deep dish pizza with sausage and tomatoes on the top, and everything was perfect.  The crust is buttery, but not greasy, the sauce is tangy and delicious, and the cheese and toppings were just right.  I am getting hungry just thinking about it...
