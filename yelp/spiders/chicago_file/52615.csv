Smoque BBQ////Had lunch here. Boy was it busy. They seat everyone in order of when they come in. No seats between people to keep the place packed. I had the briscuit and my girlfriend had the pulled pork. Both were great. Even got to have some butterscotch soda. It was called DANG. Good place. recommend.
