Little Goat Diner////I had the privilege of choosing from a substantial dairy free menu. how awesome is that?! this alone would have earned little goat 3 stars, but my order was delicious! I ordered the Korean beef burger which came with bacon, kimchi and a perfectly fried egg. love. it was delicious and there was zero cross contamination. little goat & her little peeps take care of you!
