Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I must say though, the bacon wrapped dates are absolutely delightful here.  They literally shock your mouth with their sweet goodness.  The patatas bravas beat Iberico hands down as well.  I very much enjoyed their roasted/salted peppers. Watch out for the red ones though, they're spicy.  I am beginning to salivate just thinking about their queso de cabra.  Nom nom nom.
