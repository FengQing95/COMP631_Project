Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////First time visiting and was blown away by the food and service.  They had a dinner special of Chicken Pot Pie. We ordered one and shared it for the table.  It was incredible. They only make a limited number a night so I was glad we got one.  I had the crab cake which was huge and delicious. Also got to try the shrimp cocktail (Exceptional), Brussels (exceptional), steak frites (exceptional), elotes (exceptional).  This is my new favorite restaurant in Chicago.  Thank you for a memorable meal.
