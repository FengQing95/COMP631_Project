Little Goat Diner////The five stars is because you're so very typically excellent. I have dreams of your kimchee reuben, the fact that you carry Stumptown cold brews, the goat milk in your lattes, your blood orange meringue pie (which I always order to go because I cannot live without it), the everything-else-because-everything-here-is-so-so-good, and your roller-derby-goth-punk-princess uniforms that house the friendliest and funnest and most affable staff a restaurant could hope to boast.
