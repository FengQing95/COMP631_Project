Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I can't believe how good that pizza was, way better than anticipated... We got a medium, easy on the tomatoes, gooey with the butter garlic crust. I don't think I've ever enjoyed a pizza this much in my life. The 30 minute wait to get the pizza was more like 20 and it was worth every second. Service was good, and the soft drinks are CRAZY HUGE.
