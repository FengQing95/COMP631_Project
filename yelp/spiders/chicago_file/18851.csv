Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I come here almost everytime I visit Chicago. The deep dish pizza is delicious and ultra filling. I can hardly eat 2 slices because they are so fat and loaded in the best way possible. The wait time was super long every time I went there, but I always leave highly satisfied. Staff was great, and you can order before sitting so that helps save time too. First timers should definitely try it, but after the 5th time for me its starting to lose its MUST GO status a little.
