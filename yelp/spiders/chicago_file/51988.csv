Smoque BBQ////so i came back after 1 bad outing, next five have been meat-alicious... luckty for me my maker gave me the tools to enjoy four legged dinners and i am taking full advantage of the my carnivore tool set at smoque.  pigs must oink their way merrily into the smoker, where their ribs and shoulders rest happily, under a coat of spicy goodness, until they are plattered up for ME to eat.  even better is the cow, who's brisket is spared the irish torture of corning and instead properly seasoned,  put away for most of the day in a warm bath of wood smoke and sliced into mouth watering, glistening morsels of food joy.  eat the sides if you must, they only displace meat, leaving more for ME.  I'm in love. wait, i think they are out of food again, so don't go until i've eaten.
