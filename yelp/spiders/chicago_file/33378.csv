Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went here for our anniversary with my fianc√©e. The place was very romantic. The food was amazing. We both had a steak which is definitely the most ordered item here. The sides are amazing. Mash potatoes and the truffle mac and cheese was probably best I had in a long time. Definitely a place I would recommend to anyone.
