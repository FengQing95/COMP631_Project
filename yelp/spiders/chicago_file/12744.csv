Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Just returned from my first visit to Chicago.  One of my goals was to try the deep dish pizza that I have heard so much about.  After researching on Yelp and other sites...I decided I wanted to try Lou Malnati's Pizza.  However, the group I was with told me that Gino's East was the best...and they overrode my vote.  I was not impressed with Gino's deep dish pizza...and in my mind, once was enough.
