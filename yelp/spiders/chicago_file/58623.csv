Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli.
