Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There was a 45 min wait for a table but we were offered to sit at the bar immediately. We couldn't find any spots, so a waiter told us we could sit at any table on that side. We sat, we ordered and were quickly given our drinks and apps. The paella took about 35 min but was so divine. The shrimp and scallops were perfectly cooked, neither over nor underdone, the rice, perfectly moist and tender and the presentation wonderful! I would have loved to have had lemon wedges on the side though, and maybe some peas cooked in- but that's just my personal preference.
