The Purple Pig////Outdoor seating is a must during the summer months and it's absolutely a fantastic experience to sit outside and soak up the gorgeous weather. I sat outside and loved it. Indoors struck me as being extremely loud (I stood inside waiting for the bathroom-only 2 stalls- and could barely hear my own thoughts).
