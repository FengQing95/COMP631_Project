Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////My wife and I were in town for her birthday. We stayed at the Hotel Monaco and to our delight we found Wildberry Pancakes And Cafe only a few blocks from the hotel. We had eaten at their location in Schaumburg this past summer and had a great experience there so our expectations were pretty high. We arrived around 9:00 a.m. on a Sunday and only had to wait 5 minutes. We both ordered an omlette and split an order of biscuits and gravy. The food arrived quick, hot, and delicious! The orders are large so expect to not eat everything. The ambiance was great, the wait staff was wonderful, and the eating area was not too loud so it was easy to carry on a conversation. If you are looking for a great breakfast place to eat when staying downtown Chicago this is the place for you!
