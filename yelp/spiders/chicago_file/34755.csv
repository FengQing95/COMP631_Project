Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We finally got around to ordering those drinks which took forever to arrive (figure another 10 minutes or so). Â My Corpse Reviver No 2 was good, but I've also had much better at other cocktail lounges (e.g., The Whistler, Barrelhouse Flat, or even Bavette's sister restaurant, Maude's).
