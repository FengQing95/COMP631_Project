Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The waitress was so slow and rude. I kept asking for our waitress, finally she came, did not apologize for being late. The food took too long, ppl came after us, sat after us and were served before us, The service and food taste were below average, don't waste ur time, Chicago has plenty of other nice places to have breakfast at. This place is not one of them. They are so overrated.
