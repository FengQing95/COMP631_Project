Little Goat Diner////Great American diner. The food was pretty good. Have the Spanish omelette. Â It had a nice kick to it. The little goat coffee was alright. Decent well pulled. Couldn't really tell it was goat's milk. A little pricey but I'll be back for more delicious food. The line is a little long though so be prepared to wait.
