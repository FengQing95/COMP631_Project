Little Goat Diner////I thought I took a pic of the incredible shrimp and grits but I must have eaten it too fast.  Seriously fantastic.  Lots of fresh shrimp, mouth watering sauce, and cream grits.  Excellent portion.  The little goat latte was innovative with masala and caramel.  The hash-browns were the best I've had, chopped finely like little noodles.  Don't think twice about dining here.  Open table takes reservations!
