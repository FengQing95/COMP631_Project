Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For food we received complimentary fresh sourdough bread which was warm and toasty. We started with the baked crab cake which was phenomenal, the sauce was perfect. We ordered the classic ribeye chicago cut and it was cooked perfectly (we asked for medium rare). The meat was tender and juicy. The loaded baked potato was the perfect side, I am surprised it came out with two potatoes! We also received a free ice cream since we were dining for my birthday.
