The Purple Pig////My first stop after landing in Chicago and checking into my hotel. All my fellow Yelpers had raved about this place and it was even mentioned in a food magazine left in my hotel room. The place was kind of hard to find - my Uber probably dropped me off right in front and I still didn't realize it. The restaurant entrance is a pathway that leads into their patio, which has a door to the host stand. Once you notice the huge sign that says "THE PURPLE PIG" it becomes pretty obvious though.
