Little Goat Diner////The pork nachos were huge, but they arrived tepid which means they were sitting around for a while before they got to us.  They came served atop house made flour tortilla chips which as a personal preference is not my fav as they lacked flavor but the table seemed to like them so I'd call them adequate.  As a main I ordered the signature "goat almighty" burger.  Refer to photo.  When this beast arrived I was immediately reminded of the many "Guy Fieri" food stops where he marvels at the size only to take a huge messy bite thus pleasing his masses of culinary dotards that love that sorta thing (cue eye roll).  The burger comes with three layers of meat: beef, pulled pork and goat brisket" in between a fresh bun and adorned with onion rings, cheese and jalapeños.  All this silliness aside, I enjoyed the meat combo which I paired with a light Grenache.  This is a good shareable sandwich and worthy of a photo op for you food bloggers out there.
