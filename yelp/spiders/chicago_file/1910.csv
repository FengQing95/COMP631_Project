Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////YUM YUM YUM. Everything on the menu looks delicious! There is a bit of a wait time to get in, so make sure to plan accordingly, but it is also definitely worth the wait! Everything is delicious and tastes so fresh. Be sure to try the bowl of fruit, it tastes as though it was freshly picked right then and there.
