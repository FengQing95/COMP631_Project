Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Once they reheated our The Malnati Chicago Classic pizza, the waitress cut into the pizza and scooped it out for us to munch down on. Let me tell you, it's cheesy. And you have the option to add parmesan cheese to it, if a lot of cheese still isn't enough. I thought the cheese got to be overwhelming at some spots that I had to scoop the cheese out. We got the small and because of how thick it was, I wasn't able to finish the two slices designated for me so we ended up taking one home. Don't get me wrong, I thought it was still good, very well seasoned but the cheese kind of put me over the edge.
