Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The last time I was here my daughter was 4 months old, this time she was 4.5 and I was able to take my son and husband (who has heard about the place for over a decade).  The original menu changed 11 years ago. Rice balls were added, the fantastic gazpacho and seafood ceviche, gone. Gabino's hand-laid brick patio has been gone awhile too, as are the terra cotta sangria pitchers and cheap goblets.  It's certainly more chic now, which I'm sure appeals to the local Trixies.
