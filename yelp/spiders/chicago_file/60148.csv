Smoque BBQ////I had the pulled pork with fries and cornbread and I split the St Louis ribs taste with my girlfriend.  I think we could have split the pork platter as well and just bought an extra bun.  The pulled pork wasn't very warm and a little more fatty than I would have liked - I think they might have been scraping the bottom of the barrel.  The ribs were fantastic and I would love to try a half slab of each next time.  The sides were all great, especially the Jiffy cornbread that reminded me of eating BBQ chicken at my grandparent's.  My girlfriend picked up the mac and cheese and loved it.  I really wanted to try the peach cobbler but I probably would have exploded.
