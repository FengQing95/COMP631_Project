The Purple Pig////I'm visiting from NY and this place was recommended to me by several friends and they did not disappoint! I had a party of 5 and we ordered 8 dishes, 3 cheeses and a bottle of wine. Majaority of the plates are moderate size, decent for sharing and getting your satisfaction for each palate.
