Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Went here for breakfast on a Friday, was packed but we got a table quickly.  The menu is huge, mostly breakfast food but I saw some salads etc.  Portions are huge.  My cafe americano came in a 20 oz mug.   My wife and I both ordered omelets.  They're served with either fruit cup or hashbrowns AND pancakes.   We were able to feed the two of us plus our two kids by sharing the two omelet meals. (one order of fruit, one hashbrowns). There was still food left over!  Food quality was excellent, servers were friendly and attentive.  Price was on the high end but since we fed 4 of us in two meals, it evened out for us.  Very nice location in the prudential bldg, I imagine it's packed on weekends.
