Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had such high hopes for this pizza. From my Chicagoan friends to the yelp reviews I was ready for some awesome deep dish pizza. What we actually got was so far from expectations. We walked up on a Tuesday night at 7:30pm and totally expected a long wait. The hostess told us the wait was 20-25 minutes, we were shocked, far less than we thought. We headed inside to order our pie that must be ordered before you are seated.  No big deal it takes 45 minutes to cook.  We ended up waiting for our table and hour and 15 minutes.  We were seated in the back dining area and were anxiously awaiting our pie. Our server was busy but looked to only have a few tables. We ordered drinks and she assured us they only cook the pizza half way and after you are seated they finish cooking the pie. (I had pictured our pie sitting under a heat lamp for the last 45 minutes) When we  ordered Caesar salad and garlic bread to finish out our meal we were told everything would come together with the pizza. No problem. We sat and waited for our water and drinks......20 minutes later nothing as our server walked back and forth past our table completely bare. Our pizza was plopped down on the table with no plates, no silverware, no water, no drinks, no Caesar salad, and no garlic bread. We all just stared at each other and started to laugh. We couldn't believe it. Two hours after arriving I went to the bar got our drinks (two minutes) as our water and cocktails still hadn't arrived. I get back to the table and now we have garlic bread and salad. Let me first state we have zero problem waiting for great food. The pizza was lukewarm, zero flavor and had a crust similar to that cardboard. Garlic bread could barely pass for garlic,  mostly bread. Now I'm thinking how could so many people be SO wrong? Maybe it was a bad night, maybe not, but we won't be back. Luckily we did find an awesome pizza at another Chicago staple the next night to make up for it.
