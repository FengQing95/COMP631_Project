Little Goat Diner////Went here while visiting a friend in Chicago.  The service was great, but the food was just ok for the price.  They had a breakfast special for something like eggs benedict that looked great on paper but just ended up having a fishy taste to it, despite not having any mentioned seafood ingredients.  We got a side of fried chicken to try and salvage the meal, but the chicken was tough, as if it was not completely thawed before it was thrown in the fryer.  Not a great experience overall.
