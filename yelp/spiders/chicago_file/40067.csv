Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Special occasion or just a night out on the town, Bavette's is an excellent option. In fact all of the Hogsalt restaurants are good to great. I've dined in for birthdays, NYE and to satisfy random steak cravings. Service is consistently attentive and friendly. Certainly one of the best steakhouses in Chicago. Bartenders are top notch too. I vouch for the deliciousness of everything I photographed.
