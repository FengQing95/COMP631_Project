Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Visited Chicago for a weekend and I made sure to make a reservation here 13 days in advance for my second time at Bavette's. This is by far the best steakhouse I've been to in the US. The way they dry aged their beef is phenomenal, bringing out a flavor profile that I have not managed to find anywhere else. I didn't pay attention to whether the beef is USDA prime, because I came here for the absolutely incredible dry aging flavor profile.
