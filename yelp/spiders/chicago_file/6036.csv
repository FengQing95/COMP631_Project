The Purple Pig////Crispy pig ears was good as well. This platter was HUGE. I mean like you could easily share this with 3-4 people and be full considering it's a bunch of fried pig ears. There's also kale and pepperoncini as well as a fried egg on top. Honestly the fried egg didn't really add anything for me, but boy the crispy, lightly porky ears + the sour crunchy pepperoncini was AWESOME. And the kale gave it a bit of fragrant veggie crunch which was really good as well. Definitely would recommend.
