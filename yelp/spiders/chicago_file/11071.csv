Art Institute of Chicago////Also, what is the deal with the card holder aspect to membership? It just seems like it overly complicates the membership process, as well as the in and out process of entering and exiting the museum. For example, say I am in the museum and wish to check my coat at the modern wing. For me to do so, I have to have the card holder with me so I can get back in.
