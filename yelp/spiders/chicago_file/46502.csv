Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The hostess was wonderful and polite, but after being seated our server was another story. Our first interaction was a "hello, be right there" said in passing as he went to other tables. I wrote it off as him being busy, I understand how hectic restaurant week can get. But as time passed and tables left, it didn't get any better. Every time we were ordering, his eyes were darting around the room like we were wasting his time.
