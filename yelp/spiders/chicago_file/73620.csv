Little Goat Diner////Secondly, its not that good! The prices wouldn't have mattered at all if the food was awesome. We got the Bull's Eye French Toast and the Los Drowned, which were good, but for $30? Not really. The Bulls Eye was pretty substantial, you get a lot of food here. But the chicken was dry and overcooked. You really needed the syrup to help it out. The egg was also overdone, it would have been nice to have that yolk to sop up the excellently cooked french toast.
