Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The servers are well informed from offering drink recommendations to their opinion about what will satisfy for pallet. We enjoyed the salmon and fried chicken! Not the best I've ever had, yet I enjoyed every tender bite! The melas were cooked to perfection. I can't wait to go back!
