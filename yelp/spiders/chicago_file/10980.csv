Art Institute of Chicago////How are so many globally iconic works of art just sitting in a mid-tier city in the Midwest? I love Chicago, I really do, but this collection of art is on par with what you would find in Vienna or Paris and that is suprising. I guess Chicago really is the Paris of the Midwest..... and that's only 10% said in jest. The impressionist collection alone is worth the price of admission, round that out with pieces like Night Hawks, sculptures by Dega. Windows by Marc Chagall, an El Greco, etc, the list goes on.  Nice armor collection, overall think of this like a smaller Met Museum,  same vibe and about 1/3 the size, breadth and depth of collection. A must see.
