Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's! Say that 3 times fast! Alright, that deep dish sausage is where it's at! There was no wait to sit down, but just know that it takes about 40 minutes to cook that deep dish! We ordered a small deep dish and a couple of beers and an Arnold Palmer. I've made it a mission to try as many local beers as possible...although I don't remember what I had... I think it was a gose. But we're not thinking about that - let's get to it - the pizza was filling and very flavorful. Deep Dish Pizza is definitely its own animal and great enough to stand on its own as a meal - a legit italian meal with all of the glory that is comprised of the crust that contains the sausage, cheese, mushrooms and sauce. I must say that the sauce was very good.
