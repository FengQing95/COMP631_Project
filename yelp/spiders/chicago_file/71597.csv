Little Goat Diner////It was a Sunday night and everywhere we went in this area was packed and had long waits.  Little goat told us it would be a bit, but we had been wanting to try it so we sat at the bar and charged our phones.  Before we could even get a drink, they got us a table outside (it was a beautiful night in October) and we split a couple of things.  All I can say is YUM.  Sounds silly, but the patty melt was the best I've ever had.  We had amazing service too, even being seated outside.  I was super impressed and felt like it was such a delicious way to end the weekend!
