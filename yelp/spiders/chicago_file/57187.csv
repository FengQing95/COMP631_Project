Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I decided to come here because I work with several people who recommended this place to me, especially Â because we also work for a small plates restaurant. We sat in the bar because to the naked eye, it didn't look busy. When we got here, there were all kinds of happy hour deals going on in which we took part of, ($16 Red Sangria pitchers?! YES PLEASE!!) however, we also ordered lots of other small plates that weren't include.
