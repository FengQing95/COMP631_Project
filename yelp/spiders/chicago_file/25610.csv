Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We waited an hour or so around lunch time to eat inside. The pizza took a while to come once we ordered but once we got the food, it was incredible. It was some combination of anticipation and hunger and the fact that it's PIZZA, the greatest thing on the planet, that really drove the experience home. Deep dish is the best pizza hands down and my review is a reflection of that bias. We ordered the Malnati Chicago classic. I'm not one of those people who doesn't eat the crust and, to me, the butter crust was excellent, one of the best I've ever had.
