Little Goat Diner////I love Little Goat! We visited on a Sunday morning around 11am and waited between 20-30 minutes (not bad for a Sunday breakfast in Chicago!) We were seated outside, which was great because it was beautiful out. We took forever to order/eat, which I felt a little bad about because I know waitstaff like to move tables quickly, but our waitress didn't seem to mind at all, she was absolutely great! The food was also delicious, as always! I have loved seriously everything I've tried here (favorite thusfar has been Los Drowned--oh. my. God.) The reason I dropped it to 4 stars was because I ordered a couple eggs over-medium, had to send them back (which I pretty much never do) for being incredibly runny, I mean like egg-white runny, yet when they came back the yokes were still completely runny.. So unfortunately I had to send them back again, and the third time they came out pretty much well-done. I get it, they were probably annoyed with me sending them back so many times, but how hard is it to cook over-medium eggs? Sigh. Anyway, of course I'll go back because I absolutely love this place, but will probably skip the eggs next time.
