Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Now on to the fun stuff... the food here is just awesome. It's your classic Spanish tapas with some cool twists. We each got an glass of Sangria , Passion Fruit and Black Berry to start and it was awesome. Some of our favorite dishes were the goat cheese tomato sauce with bread, the cheese/spinach stuffed mushrooms, and the shrimp with garlic, oil, and red pepper flakes. These shrimp were REALLY REALLY good and I would get them again in a heart beat. We also tried a Moroccan Lamb dish with a mint cucumber salad and it was on point.
