Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chicago Classic - This has cheese, tomato sauce and sausage.  For being the meat pizza it actually was the one with the least amount of flavor.  The "buttery" crust was a little hard on the bottom and not as crispy on the edges.  Definitely need a knife and fork for this one.  They didn't overdo it on the cheese, which was good and it also wasn't overly saucy.  This of course could be because we took it to go and ate it when it was slightly warm but still.
