Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////THEIR BERRY BLISS PANCAKES!!! Do not order anything else when you go here. ONLY eat these. I had a bite of my friend's berry bliss pancake and I wanted to attack him so I could eat the rest. Just kidding. But really, they are that good. However, the pancakes are ridiculously sweet - like candy in pancake form - but sooo good.
