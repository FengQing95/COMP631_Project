Smoque BBQ////This has become my go-to spot for bbq on the Northwest side. Their brisket is melt-in-the-mouth delicious. Flavorful ribs with right amount of seasoning. I've tried just about everything on the menu and have not been disappointed. Have not tried eating in as the location is quite small, and is usually quite crowded.
