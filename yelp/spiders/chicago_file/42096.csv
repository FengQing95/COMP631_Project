Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of the things I have learned to love about my BF is how he will order for me.  I have to admit, I was a little taken back by that on our first date but he did get it right!  So, I think having someone who really loves tapas and clearly knows how to order off of their extensive menu is the key to tapas bliss.  I gave him free reign of the menu and everything my BF ordered here was wonderful.  I would have to say my favorites were the goat cheese croqueta, endive salad, braised lamb, and last but not least....escargot.  YUM!  I could've probably eaten a whole plate of snails smothered in tomato sauce and goat cheese sitting atop a garlic croquet.  There was one moment where he did order something I was a bit cautious about....flan.  I have had flan before but it must've been horrible flan because, once again, the BF got it right.  The flan at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba made me a new fan of flan.  It was yummy, creamy, and a perfect end to a great meal.
