The Purple Pig////Pork neck bone gravy - This honestly just tasted like regular marinara sauce mixed with some cheese. I actually combined this with some of the milk braised pork shoulder. As a standalone dish I thought it was pretty weak, but it turned out to be a great condiment to complement other dishes.
