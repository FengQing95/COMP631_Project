Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Visited on 9/11/2017.  I should have visited Bavette's last August 2016 with a couple of great friends who had just recently become engaged, but instead of joining them as the third wheel, I chose to feed my Pokemon Go addiction and spend the night catching Squirtles at Pratt Beach.  What a monstrous decision.
