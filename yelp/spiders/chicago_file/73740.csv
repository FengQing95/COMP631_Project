Little Goat Diner////Wow!  This place is incredible.  I have now been to both Girl and the Goat and Little Goat and I have to say this is my favorite.  By far!  It is diner food done right.  Everything homemade and delicious.  We came during lunch and ordered lunch food.  Me a Reuben and co-worker the patty melt.  I tried both and they were amazing.  This is not your typical Rueben.  Thick corned beef and homemade sauerkraut.  It was more like thick cut pickled cabbage.  The sandwiches were huge and we had plenty of leftovers.  The fries were delicious too with a nice seasoning on it.
