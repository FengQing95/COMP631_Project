Little Goat Diner////The mimosas were delicious and the hot chocolate has just the right amount of whipped cream over top! After our experience here, I don't understand how anybody could give it less than 5 stars. This is absolutely what a restaurant should be and the place we're going to be coming back to any time we are in Chicago!
