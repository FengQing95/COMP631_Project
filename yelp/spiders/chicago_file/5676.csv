The Purple Pig////FOOD 4/5: Overall, everything was delicious but not something I'd go out of my way to try again. The food was presented beautifully but in general, it didn't click. Some dishes were too salty for my liking and didn't have enough flavor. Others were excellent. The milk-braised pork shoulder was my favorite and it was fantastic from beginning to end. The crispy pig ears weren't that great, but fun to munch on. The mussels and the robust tomato sauce were alright as well. I also enjoyed their pasta with the ground pork mea; I was unable to find the name of the dish on the online menu.
