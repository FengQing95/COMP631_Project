Little Goat Diner////I had a really impressive dining experience at Little Goat Diner the last time I ate there. I met up with my friends for a late lunch a few weeks ago, and this happened to be one of the first restaurants I went to where I had to order based on a food allergy. Having recently been diagnosed with an intolerance for onion and garlic, I had a difficult time navigating the menu to figure it out. Our waitress was SO patient and understanding. She and the kitchen worked really hard to diligently find the perfect dish for me that did not have any fresh onion or garlic. As it turns out, it's in EVERYTHING, so this was not an easy task. She had me select 2-3 menu items that looked appealing to me, then she checked back with the kitchen to see if they could make a version of it without onion or garlic.
