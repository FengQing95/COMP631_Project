Little Goat Diner////I came here with my friends and got a really juicy burger. I was really craving one for the last couple of days so I wanted to come and see what they offer. Overall the meal was pretty good. I would recommend this burger. the staff there was pretty nice except I think for one person was kind of odd. I would recommend checking this place out though.
