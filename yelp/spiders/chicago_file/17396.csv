Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you knew my mother, you'd know that pizza loving is in my blood. Seriously, and this doesn't disapoint. This is the best deep dish I have ever had in Chicago, the ingredients are very high quality and sets themselves apart from the pack! We had the recommended pizza with sausage and buttercrust- The sauce on top had chunks of roma tomatoes in it, that was my favorite part! We ordered a medium for the two of us and had plenty left over to nibble on ALL weekend long.
