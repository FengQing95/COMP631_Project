Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One word, AMAZING!! We sat at the bar tonight, a busy Saturday night, and it was perfect! Our bartender was Angela, and we couldn't have asked for better. We were celebrating our anniversary and she treated us so well! We had the wedge, Chicago cut ribeye (rare plus)!and loaded potato. The steak was done perfect!! Everything about our dinner was perfect. We even got ice cream with a sparkler! We will be back! Thank you Bavette's!!
