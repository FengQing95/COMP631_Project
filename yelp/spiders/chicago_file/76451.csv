Little Goat Diner////Once my daughter arrived we were seated, our server promptly guided us through the menu and answer our questions.  We order the soup of the day, butternut squash and we shared the Korean Burger (Kilgus Goat patty) with fries.  The soup was outstanding, creamy, thick, and the right amount of spics, topped with crunchy onions.  The Burger, with a fry egg on top, was a foodie's delight.  We closed the affair with Choco Taco, a decadent treat of sour cream gelato, over dark chocolate magic shell, cajeta (milk caramel), and chocolate dipped masa chips.  I think I tasted a little of heaven.
