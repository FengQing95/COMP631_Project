Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////excellent steak house food and ambiance.  started with bone marrow (giant pieces) with a perfect red onion jam and parsley on the bread, like a liquidy foie. also had smoked salmon caesar.  shared Prime Bone In Dry Aged Ribeye -- pretty much done to perfection with easy to slice pieces, prepared as a medium, excellent salting and darkened outside, fatty savory inside.  3 people can share two steaks, as we also had the prime filet bone in as well, which was not fatty but went well with the salt and bernaise sauce.  ribeye is the better cut.  elote corn side only problem was the corn not crisp kernels.  butternut squash grilled with bourbon, sage was excellent.  definitely come here, over David Burke's
