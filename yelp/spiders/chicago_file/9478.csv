Art Institute of Chicago////Millennium Park is right across the street, so you can enjoy the relaxing Lurie Garden and the neat outdoor sculptures there as well. There are plenty of great places to have lunch nearby, although the rooftop restaurant is quite good, so you may not even want to venture out.
