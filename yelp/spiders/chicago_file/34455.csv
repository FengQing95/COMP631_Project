Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I know, I know! I keep reviewing here, I don't care. I will always update this review. Had a truly wonderful b-day dinner here Friday night. Service was superb. I had one of the best meals everrrr. Got the petite filet mignon and honestly, I'm pretty sure it was the best filet I've ever had. Got an excellent sazerac (you don't see this New Orleans cocktail many places, and this one was excellently crafted). My guy got the double-cut pork chop - to die for. What else ... oh, right! The chocolate pie. You must do this, I promise you won't regret. Only drawback? This place will set you back - a lot. So just know that going in. But for a special occasion, it's worth it, and Bavette's is officially my favorite Chicago restaurant.
