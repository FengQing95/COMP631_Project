The Purple Pig////Had a great time here! Stopped in on a whim on a beautiful day and got sat outside immediately, which i was shocked about because the place was extremely busy. We really enjoyed the whipped feta and the milk braised Berkshire shoulder! This is a great spot for a group and super interactive.
