Little Goat Diner////We ate breakfast here. We also have come for dinner. We normally sit at the bar. We ordered the parathas burrito and the Spanish omelet. I was afraid the omelet would be boring or standard, but it wasn't. It had buttery, wet tortilla chips on it. There was a slight flavor of hazelnut that perfectly complimented the tomato sauce they were drenched in. It was a 6-egg omelet.
