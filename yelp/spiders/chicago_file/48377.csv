Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So they had an au gratin sweet potato on special when I went. "this sounds good I guess. Let's try" omg was I wrong. Cuz it ROCKED!!! And the calamari? Ugghh so good. The potatas bravas there put the sauce on the side so you can use your discretion on if you want to douse or lightly coat. It's very delicious so I douse obvi but that's not everyones style so I appreciate the option :) ha. The goat cheese is amazing. One thing I was bummed abt is that I didn't get the spicy shrimp so ba-ba-reeba we got another date coming up!
