Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Every time I visit Chicago, I'm on a quest to find my favorite deep dish spot. On my recent trip, I asked my friends for recommendations and they suggested this spot based on the deliciousness of the cheese. Now when it comes to favorite foods: pizza and cheese top my list, so I was excited.
