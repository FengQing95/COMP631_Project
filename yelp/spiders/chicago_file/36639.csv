Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This was the best meal I have probably ever had. Our server John was amazing, friendly but not obtrusive. I knew he was a great server from the start because he asked me if I wanted vermouth in my martini, which in chicago is not always a given. Anyways the food was fantastic, we got a bone in filet and ny strip, both amazing though I think the standout was the strip. For sides we got the elotes, spinach and Mac and cheese. All amazing but I think the favorite was the spinach, though the Mac was a close 2nd. The chocolate creme pie was literally better than sex, do not skip it.
