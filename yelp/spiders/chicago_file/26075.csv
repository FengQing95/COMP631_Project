Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came here during lunch on a weekday but didn't have an issue getting seated or difficulty with service. My waitress/server was very helpful in giving us suggestions and was willing to have a conversation with us despite it being a little busy. Lou Manalti's you guys are awesome.
