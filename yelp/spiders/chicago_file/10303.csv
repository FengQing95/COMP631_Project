Art Institute of Chicago////If there's one thing you have to do it is the Impressionist wing on the second floor when you ascend the grand staircase. Stare at the huge pointillistic painting featured in Ferris Bueller's Day off "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte" by Georges Seurat, marvel at Monet's water lilies and haystacks, appreciate Renoir's portraits. This place houses once of the largest, most spectacular collection of impressionist paintings in the entire world. I rank this place the same as the Claude Monet museum in Paris and the Musee d'Orsay (all three are #1 in my heart!)
