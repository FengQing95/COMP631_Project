Art Institute of Chicago////The museum has a sweet deal that includes one day admission here and admission to sky deck (doesn't have to be the same day). The museum is very large, very artsy, and very fun. LOL TRUST ME. I really enjoyed a lot of the contemporary art pieces and the photography area. I wandered through all the floors and still felt like I didn't get to see everything yet though because there's so much stuff!!! There's also a library on the first floor which is neat. There's a cafe in case you're feeling a bit peckish also. The architecture area was out of commission during the day when I was there which was a bummer. But they had tons of cool impressionist paintings in the same sorta area so I wasn't bummed for that long. Overall it's a very interesting mix of art from a wide range of styles and artists. There are a lot of interactive exhibits (mostly the contemporary stuff). Definitely a swell place to check out on rainy days!
