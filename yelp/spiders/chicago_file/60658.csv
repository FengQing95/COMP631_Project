Smoque BBQ////Our number was called, "45!!!!!!!!"  and it was time to eat.  The brisket was tender to the point of falling apart when you tried to pick it up with a fork and the sauce was just the right mixture of spice and flavor.  The baked beans had a nice little bite, though my GF didn't think it was enough.  The cole slaw was mild and vinegar based and the fries......well they were just a big bag of fries....personally it was a filler and not spicy or jazzed up and I'd recommend you don't get them, but rather some other side dish, particularly the mac & cheese which is very good.
