Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were warned it would be 45 minutes after you order to get your pizza. Â I would expect it to be perfect, but it wasn't. Deep dish was not piping hot and neither was the thin crust. Flavors were good, but just was not that hot. Server was great, and place is cool. I see the charm just wasn't thrilled.
