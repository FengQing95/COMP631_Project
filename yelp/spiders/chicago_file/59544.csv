Smoque BBQ////We ordered the pulled pork and brisket platters. Both were very tender and flavorful. The portions are not big, but keep in mind that the flavor itself is enough to satisfy hunger. Fries were decent as was the mac & cheese. The beans were a bit too sweet for me, but hey, it's just preference. The coleslaw was really nothing to write home about, but it seemed like a healthier option over the usual cream based.
