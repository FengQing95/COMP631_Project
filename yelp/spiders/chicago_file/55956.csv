Smoque BBQ////ok me and my friends went here on a fat kid adventure and this place was really good. The place has a very relaxed vibe when u walk in. There is a big huge chalk board with the menu written on the board. i got the pull pork sandwhich and a side of mac and cheese. the wait wasnt to long for as many people that where in there. The sauce was really good wasnt to sweet or to tangy the mac and cheese was sooooooooooooooooo good the portion they give u just isnt enough. i would visit this place again and also it is byob so that is always a plus
