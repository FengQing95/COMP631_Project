Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The food here is great! I had the eggs benedict, which was delicious! Went with friends and we got there at 9am and there was already a 30 min wait. By the time we left, the crowd at the door was outrageous. Right by Millennium Park, so great place for a Sunday brunch.
