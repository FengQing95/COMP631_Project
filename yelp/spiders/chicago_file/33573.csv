Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The drinks were amazing the good was top notch! Not as expensive as some of the other steak houses downtown and the sourdough bread they give you was the best I had ever had! I had the filet that was cooked perfectly. I did order the corn that all the other reviews were raving about it was good but not my favorite. I would go back and sample other things on the menu.
