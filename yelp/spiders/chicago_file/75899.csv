Little Goat Diner////I've had only good experiences at Little Goat. I always order the goat chili and milkshakes- so good! Also, somewhat unexpectedly I've ended up getting the scallop special in both of my last two visits and boy were they delicious! Â Would also recommend the Mac n cheese and seasonal gazpachos for starters / sides. It's much easier to a reservation here compared to Girl & the Goat and Duck Duck Goat as well which is always a plus as well!
