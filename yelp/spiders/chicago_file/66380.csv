Little Goat Diner////Um, yes. Do it. Go here. Make it happen. Best breakfast I've ever had?! Quite possibly. I ate the parathas burrito, and it was just the most unique and delicious thing I've ever had with some of my favorite ingredients... SO GOOD. My husband ate the kimchee tasty thing, and it was also amazing. My mom ate the special... A house-made goat-meat sausage wrapped in a pancake with their house-made BBQ syrup. Wow. Dad ate the corned beef hash. Delicious all the way around. When I go out to breakfast, I like to have something I can't make at home. This is the PLACE to fulfill my breakfast dreams.
