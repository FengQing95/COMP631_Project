Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Chicago deep dish pizza here was the best pizza I have ever had so far in the United States. As for the first time we came, and never had a chance to try a deep dish style, the restaurant seemed to offer so many options. Fortunately, our waitress told us it was possible to order half-half. Thus, we came out with Deep Dish Malnati Chicago Classic on one half, and Deep Dish The Lou on the other half. It took 45 minutes to for the pizza to be done, but it was entirely worth the wait. The buttery crust, the topping, the marinara sauce, and a generous amount of quality Mozzarella cheese, all combined deliciously in an excellent pizza. The crust, the edge was scrumptious as it was crunchy and was took out of the oven just at the right time. I definitely will go to this restaurant for pizza craving and bring my friends here. Plus, the parking spot here is private and free.
