Smoque BBQ////Whatever you do, no matter how full you are, please, for me, end on peach cobbler.  It may not be the absolute best cobbler in the world, but there's no better way to complete a good BBQ meal than some homemade cobbler.  I personally ate mine while I waited 20 minutes for the Blue Line in 5º temperatures, and it somehow made the downtime bearable.
