Smoque BBQ////Came here based on the Yelp reviews and I must say, the food did not disappoint! I ordered the Sliced Brisket platter with mac & cheese and baked beans. The mac and cheese was good, the baked beans were great, but the brisket was amazing! It was tender and cooked to perfection. Probably some of the best brisket I've ever had (and this is coming from a girl from Alabama). I will definitely be back next time I'm in Chicago.
