The Purple Pig////Overall, I'll give this place 5 stars primarily for the taste of the food. My only issue with places like this is I spend a lot of money but still leave hungry, which was no different here. I guess my suggestion would be don't come here if you're starving, or plan on emptying your bank account. The food, however, is always high quality.
