The Purple Pig////Why only 3 stars because I am comparing it to the time I was there over 3 years ago. When this place was located on the other side of the river, the ambiance was much darker, cozier and felt more like a chicago restaurant feel to it. Now it feels like a you are in the first floor of an office building, oh wait you are. The other place made you forget that and that made the place feel special. Now for the food. Â bravo on the bone marrow and bread as I remember the last time I ate there. My kids could not get enough of the bread of how soft and full of flavor it had. As for the rest, mussels, Orecchiette, calamari and Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder all good but nothing great. Will I be back, not anytime soon. Would I recommend this place, I use too but not anymore as I would suggest a more special feel to the restaurant. Fyi...No more water view
