Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We saw in other Yelp reviews that the desserts were great, so we took the plunge and ordered the chocolate pie while we app pledged we would just have just one bite.  It is sad to say, but we left not a morsel.  It came topped with some tasty whipped cream and might have been the best chocolate pie I ever ate.
