Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I came here to celebrate my birthday on a Saturday night and they made my celebration very memorable. Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and a great guide for a couple of first  timers.  He broke everything down for us in regards to cuts and preferences. I decided on the rib eye, medium rare and I have to say that it is one of the best steaks I've ever had. I will definitely come again!
