Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The best pizza in the world.  The butter crust and the fresh ingredients are like the pizzas in Rome, Italy.  The deep-dish pizza is difficult to eat.  After two pieces, you cannot eat another.  The service is outstanding and the wait was minimal and worth it for the deep dish.
