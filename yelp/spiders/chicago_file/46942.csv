Smoque BBQ////They do have best brisket in Chicago!   I've had brisket at almost every bbq joint in Chicago and the burbs.   Most of them are not very good.    This restaurant is overall great.  My only dislike is the dining area being so small.  This restuarant  runs like a fine clock..  Extremely organized the way it should be.
