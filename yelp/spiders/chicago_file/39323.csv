Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I have never nor has anyone in my party ever had a bad meal here. I'm not a creature of habit but I also believe if its not broke, don't mess with it. Hence either a seafood tower appetizer for the table to share, or a dozen East coast oysters and a Chicago Cut ribeye (medium rare) are always perfect. Seafood is always and fresh and served proper, steak is always cooked to perfection. Sides we have devoured: Elote, the bacon and the truffle-mac & cheese - All excellent.
