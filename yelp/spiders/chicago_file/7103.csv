Art Institute of Chicago////Don't go there as much as I use to, but I love the Thorn Rooms.  I fist saw them when I was ten and have never gotten tired of looking at them, just seeing all that intricate construction. Another favorite is the marble room where all the figures seem so life like.  There is also the armor and the Asian section that I try not to miss when I go.  It's fun to go in the summer because you can rest by eating in the Garden set in the middle of the museum.
