Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////TIP: Always, and I mean ALWAYS make reservations. Waiting is a bezatch here. Unless you don't mind getting tipsy at the bloody mary bar or ordering a whole pitcher of their awesome sangria for yourself. But be warmed, there will be many at the bar waiting around with you. So save yourself the grief, get a reservation and take your pitcher with you.
