Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wildberry was a good restaurant, but I have a gluten and dairy allergy and all of their pancakes were make with milk! Even their gluten free ones...and they didn't carry gf bread at all--which is always super disappointing and sad for me-especially at such a popular breakfast restaurant in the city.
