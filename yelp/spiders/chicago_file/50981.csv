Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Use the lettuce entertain you app for points and reservations. Also would suggest calling if they don't have the opening you want on the app and they were flexible for me. Came for brunch and It was great- ordered the two Benedict's, the side of homemade sausage, and a deviled egg. It was tasty and I loved the vibe overall. I like the tapas for brunch concept and I look forward to coming back for dinner.
