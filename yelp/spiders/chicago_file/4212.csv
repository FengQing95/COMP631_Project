The Purple Pig////Everything I ate at the Purple Pig was delicious. I am gluten free (minor cross contamination doesn't impact me). I shared charcuterie of coppa, prosciutto and a smoky goat milk cheese. Troy, our server, explained the menu to me marking everything that was gluten free and made sure the crackers were on a separate plate. We also split salt roasted beets and milk braised pork shoulder (with gravy and farro on the side). Troy was very knowledgeable about gluten free dining and gave no indication my food needs were an inconvenience.
