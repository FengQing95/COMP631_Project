Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We just landed in Chicago for a friend's weekend wedding and searched for "best breakfast in Chicago" and wildberry popped up. We were a little worried that there might be a wait based on other reviews but on a Friday at 9am, it's super busy but no wait. I got a honey latte that is the best coffee I've had in a long time. The biscuits and gravy was delicious (especially the gravy) and the gluten free honey pancakes hit the spot. Well, now I'm stuffed and have waddle out of here to do some shopping. Would definitely recommend!
