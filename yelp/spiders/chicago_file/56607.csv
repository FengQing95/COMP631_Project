Smoque BBQ////If I lived in Chicago, I would probably be a regular.  However, after having bbq in KC, STL, NC, Memphis, and Texas, this just doesn't match up.  The sausage was ok, but bland.  The coleslaw was dry and bland.  The baked beans were not memorable.  The peach cobbler seemed like canned peaches with toasted granola on top.  The bbq sauce was average. The best food I had was the chopped brisket, but even that was just average.  I realllllllly wanted to love this place, but I wasn't blown away like everyone else.
