Smoque BBQ////Parking was easy right on the side street. Free for 2 hours. I'm sure, though, it's super busy on the weekends. And, yeah, don't park on the south side of the side street where you will see the "NO PARKING for SMOQUE BBQ' signs; it's permit parking. Smoque's neighbors must be tired of cars taking their spots. Good they're trying to save people from getting tickets.
