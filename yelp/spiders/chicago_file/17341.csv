Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I walked in and sat at the bar. No waiting required. Bar tender was a super friendly guy and really helped make the visit. He knew that everybody coming in that place had never been before. You would think he would get tired of pretending to care, but it never showed! He walked everyone through the process, made great suggestions, and kept my beer glass FULL!! Â Seriously.. he knew what was up. He would slide in a fresh beer before the old one ran dry.... Now that I look back... I might have a man crush.. nah......
