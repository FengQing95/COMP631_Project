Little Goat Diner////I had to start off with this shake, considering my entire dining experience this trip was essentially a gustatory gamut of carnivorous delights. The foundation of smokiness was quite intense, but the sweet and salty elements of the toffee crunch helped to create some balance. There were small chunks of pork interspersed throughout the shake, which was tasty overall, but more gimmick for me than a must-order.
