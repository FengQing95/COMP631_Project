Art Institute of Chicago////Spent a Sunday morning here. There entrance line was really long but seemed to move quickly. $1.00 per checked item seemed reasonable. Plenty to see but finding some specific was challenging. Worst maps EVER! And could use some more seating. A nice cross section of items. Loved the miniature rooms, that was something new and fun.
