The Purple Pig////I started out with a Paloma which was expertly made. We decided to go with the charcuterie board with sopressa and duck procuttio . Both are made in house. I thought the sopressa was excellent and the duck was ok. I think I'll go with another meat next time. The cheese was outstanding, but expected. The surprising Star was the bread....mmmmmmm. This board was the real deal. This seems like the thing to get with wine!
