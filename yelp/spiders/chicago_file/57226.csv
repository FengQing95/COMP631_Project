Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We also got the seafood paella which was sadly not worth the hype. About 1/3 of the rice was so over cooked that I was worried I may crack a tooth on it, there was minimal amount of meat, and the entire dish seemed to be drenched in butter or oil. I've had delicious paella and this was not it. Also, I was a little disappointed that they don't leave the entire pan at the table, but rather dip out the portions onto your plate for you.
