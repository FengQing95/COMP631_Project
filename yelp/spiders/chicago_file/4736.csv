The Purple Pig////-Ricotta stuffed gnocchi w/ rabbit ragu & nettle pesto: Gnocchi is always a hit or miss dish for me but for the first time this is somewhere in the middle. I would've loved a different textural element because the whole dish was just kind of soft. However the flavors for the most part were excellent. The creamy, light ricotta paired very well with the slightly gamey rabbit ragu and the nettle pesto gave everything a delicious tanginess. That being said I did find the ragu just a bit too salty and I would've loved a bit more of the pesto (3.5/5)
