Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We did a day trip into Chicago recently and  one of the things on our list was a deep dish pizza. We chose Lou's and were not disappointed. We got there between lunch and dinner, we did not have a long wait, service and food was excellent!  I would definitely recommend and would go again when in Chicago.
