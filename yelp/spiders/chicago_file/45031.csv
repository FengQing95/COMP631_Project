Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If you like(love) sangria, this place is a must. I recommend getting a pitcher because it is reasonably priced around $20 and pours about 6/7 glasses. The menu is pretty big so if you are adventurous with food, you should order a variety of plates and try as many as you can because I think everything is good. In particular, I love the calamari with aiolli sauce and the warm goat cheese with marinara sauce.
