Art Institute of Chicago////I could see where an interesting rotating exhibit would draw me and many others back.  I also have the luxury of coming here at a non-peak time, a big advantage I would say for enjoying the displays.  For today, I enjoyed just finding paintings I liked for whatever reason, admiring paintings of well-known greats Monet and van Gogh, and just taking in the vast and amazing diversity of artwork available in one place here.  I saw a lot but didn't see it all which I'm not sure is even possible in one visit.  I also enjoyed a little bit of people watching, ha.  Thumbs up, but that's not a very new message is it!
