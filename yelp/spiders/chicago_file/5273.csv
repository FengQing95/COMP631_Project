The Purple Pig////First off, this place is an office building. I walked back-and-forth for quite a bit before I saw a small stenciled sign on a window that said Purple Pig. I sat at the bar, since I was by myself. It was a Sunday afternoon and they were busier than I would have expected. I looked at the menu and wanted to try the gazpacho salad. When I asked about how big the salad was, the bartender said it was Â small to medium salad, so I thought I would grab something else. He recommended the scallops. Ok, way too much food, but very good. Love the salad, but a little over-dressed. The scallops were cooked to perfection. A bit on the pricey side, but it is Chicago. Great wine list and lots of G&T concoctions that I would love to try!!! Will be back!
