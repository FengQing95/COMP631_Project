Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I long ago decided I did not like deep dish pizza, with its thick, bread-like crust, which overwhelmed the toppings. One bite of the Chicago deep dish pizza at Lou Malnati's and I completely changed my mind! The crust is more like a pastry crust, not at all bread-y, but buttery, rich, and crisp on the bottom. On top of that is a thick cheese layer topped by crushed, not pureed, tomato. One slice is so hearty that you need nothing else except, perhaps, the house salad with its truly delicious vinaigrette. I'm a convert to Chicago-style deep dish!
