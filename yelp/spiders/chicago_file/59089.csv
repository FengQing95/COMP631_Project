Smoque BBQ////Their brisket is pure Texas.  Slow smoked, tender, and juicy.  The ribs are straight out of St. Louis with a delicious dry rub.  Have the sauce on the side and try 'em "dry" so to speak.  Don't let the sauce obscure the amazing flavors of smoke, and the lip-smacking unctiousness of the pork.  And the pulled pork tastes almost exactly like the style from my hometown in Georgia.
