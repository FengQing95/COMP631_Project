Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Finally, we were sited in a little corner overlooking the street, but still offered privacy. Then we placed our order. Water came to my mouth when the waitress came in with our deep dish pizza. Let me tell you, it was worth the wait. They have this hot pepper flakes that I spread  over my pizza which give it this little spicy hint. Man!! that pizza was so juicy and  was melting in my mouth. I am telling you, I got much more than I was expecting.
