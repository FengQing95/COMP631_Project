Little Goat Diner////I am glad Little Goat was there to catch the overflow from Girl across the street.  I've been wanting to try Girl & the Goat for quite some time and thought tonight was the night as I've trekked a mile on foot and in the rain with determination to get here.  But alas, the waiting list at the Girl was "uncomfortably long" when we arrived and so we made our way across the street.
