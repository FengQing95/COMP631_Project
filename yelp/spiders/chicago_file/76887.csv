Little Goat Diner////We had dessert plans for later so we stayed on the savory path. My husband getting the patty melt with goat of course, and myself the grilled cheese with guanciale and smoked tomato. Our lovely waitress told us one order of fries is easily shared and she was correct. They were a bit thin for my taste and reminded me a lot of the ones from In n Out. I would have preferred them to remain in the fryer a few minutes longer too, but at least they were fresh.
