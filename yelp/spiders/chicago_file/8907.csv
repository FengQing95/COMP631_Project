Art Institute of Chicago////Best art museum I have ever been to -- more navigable and consolidated than the MET & Getty, bigger and more diverse than the MFA.  Incredible, emotionally stimulating collection of 19th century American landscape paintings (New England and West-- George Inness, Thomas Cole, Winslow Homer, Martin Heade) and East Asian ceramics.  Famous paintings include Edward Hopper's "Nighthawks" and Grant Wood's "American Gothic" (the farmers).  The only thing lacking in my opinion was Roman sculptures.  But wow, I've never left a museum feeling so awakened, calm and happy.
