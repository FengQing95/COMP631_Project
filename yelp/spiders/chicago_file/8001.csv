Art Institute of Chicago////I particularly loved Hopper's work, because his ability to take the seemingly typical and mundane, and turn it into a special, poignant observation is truly a gift. Many of the people in his works are expressionless, but as a result, you can't help feel reactive towards his characters. You want to give them feeling that you can see, but that's what is so special. The way the light creates shapes in an empty room, the interaction between two people in a diner, a lighthouse from three different perspectives on a hill--these are all effortless, yet evocative.
