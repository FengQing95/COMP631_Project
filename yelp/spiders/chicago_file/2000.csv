Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Nice Place for breakfast. The pancakes were perfect. Try the wild berry ones which means the berries are on top of the pancakes instead of mixed in the batter. I also enjoyed the garden skillet with the hash browns on the bottom layer. This dish was delicious! The service was decent and the prices were reasonable for downtown Chicago.
