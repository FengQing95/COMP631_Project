Art Institute of Chicago////I couldn't help but think about one of my most favorite movies of all time--Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and I found myself taking artsy pictures of my brother walking up to the famous pieces of art here, catching him contemplating at each masterpiece....So thanks John Hughes for the inspiration!!
