Smoque BBQ////First off this isn't the best barbecue in the city.  It gets a lot of hype but its really not.  The pulled pork was ok and the ribs were average and nothing to go bragging about.  The brisket was actually pretty tasty.  Their sides were hit or miss.  The coleslaw tasted too mayo-ey for my taste and the mac n cheese was on the dry side.
