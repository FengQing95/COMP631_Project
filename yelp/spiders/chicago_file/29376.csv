Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Everyone knows that the wait here can be exhausting, even on a weekday night, but they seem to have the process down to a science, even when, with so many people filling every nook a cranny while they wait, it makes it really difficult for the servers to get through. So, wait in line to give your order, then wait some more until your table is called, and THEN, tuck into a sweetly satisfying, deep dish pizza. Coming from pizza-centric New York, my husband did not appreciate the sweet, butter-"frosted" crust, nor the somewhat sweet, diced tomato-ey sauce (all of which I loved) for which Malnati's is known. Come give it a try, but prepared to wait and people watch.
