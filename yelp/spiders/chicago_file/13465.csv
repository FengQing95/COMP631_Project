Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came here with a bunch of other academics during a conference. The pizza was edible and thick, but it was definitely not in flavor country. I tried the supreme and veggie versions, and like someone else said it seemed like the pizza was a little undercooked (the sauce and cheese was a bit on the runny side).
