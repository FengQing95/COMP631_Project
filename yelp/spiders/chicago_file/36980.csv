Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It was at this time that a small child entered the basement where all the tables were full of couples that respected the romance of an intimate Valentine's Day. The child processed to sit with a bright iPad and laugh loudly. I made my opinion know the the waiter that the child was ruining the ambience of our dinner where steaks cost $69.99.  While The patrons with the child were obviously not self-aware enough to quiet their child, the tasteless nature of this disturbance resides wth poor management of a premium restaurant. This was my final straw as everyone in that basement area made arrangements have adult diners and  pod a premium for it. I paid for our meals which were over $100 each and left. I wish I had a reason to rate this restaurant higher because with some tweaking and stronger leadership, this would be an awesome place to spend an event with a special someone.
