Little Goat Diner////After being rejected by Au Cheval , we had dinner at Little Goat . The Nachos were delicious especially the mash beans and the pork belly . We had the club sandwich, it was OK. The Ruben was excellent . The fries were a disappointment, too salty and the smoke flavor was too strong . The portions were huge , we ended up eating half of our plates . Our server was excellent and helpful .
