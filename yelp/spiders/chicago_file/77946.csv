Little Goat Diner////We visited for dinner where the menu consisted of American breakfast foods, breads, sandwiches, soups, salads, burgers, dinner entrees, and apps/sides. Desserts included pies, cakes, shakes, and sundaes and drinks included bottled sodas like Cheerwine, spicy ginger ale, and Mexican Coke. They also have a coffee menu. Expect to spend at least $20-25 per person.
