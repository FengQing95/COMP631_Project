Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Valentine's day dinner here was a tremendous success! Heard incredible things about this place and they all turned out to be true! Reservations were made several months in advance in order to get a table and it was definitely worth it. First of all, I loved how the place is super easy to miss from the outside which gives it a "secret speak-easy" type of ambiance. Inside the restaurant is dark and romantic with an exposed brick wall - I loved it!
