Smoque BBQ////I got the pulled pork sandwich with a side of BBQ beans. Everything was out of this world. My girlfriend ordered the BBQ brisket sandwich and she also loved hers. They give you a HUGE cup of BBQ sauce on the side that is so good I could drink it. (LOL!) It's definitely a walk-up order and sit down place, but they're so busy that they actually have someone actively standing in the restaurant to clean the tables off and escort guests to their seats. Amazing place!
