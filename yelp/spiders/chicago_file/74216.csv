Little Goat Diner////For appetizers, we ordered drinks. I got the Old Fashioned, made with George Dickel 8 year Bourbon, and she got the Cherry Smoke Bomb, a mezcal based drink. Tell me if you've heard this story before. Man drinks 375ml of Mezcal, proceeds to play a horrible game of Classic Concentration while being filmed, and then goes on a drunken rant about Half Price Books' buy-back policy. Same man also splits a bottle of mezcal with a girl he picked up at the bar, and after drinking her half of the bottle she begins wailing the lyrics to a Shiny Toy Guns song, and crying while said man drunkenly stares in disbelief.
