Little Goat Diner////Sandwich was soft, creamy, and delicious, with the easy crunch of the masa chip, tasty avocado, and great shrimp salad. It's a perfect sandwich, go get one. The hot chocolate was not very chocolatey, and I wouldn't recommend it. But I really didn't mind that minor disappointment after eating my sandwich.
