Art Institute of Chicago////Though they haven't had much in the way of "blockbuster" exhibitions recently (I think they blew the wad on the Modern Wing) I've seen some amazing exhibitions here in the past: Michelangelo works from the QEII collection, a Chuck Close retrospective, Charles Rennie Macintosh, several Impressionist shows and so many more.
