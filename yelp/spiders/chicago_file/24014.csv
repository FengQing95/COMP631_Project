Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Not impressed, taste wise and texture wise. Our CPK pizza is actually a lot better. I guess maybe how Chicagoans like pizza but not us. In addition, the service is slow and bad, with water not being refilled, no plate and folks on table until food brought out. I think tourists better go to CPK for better food and service.
