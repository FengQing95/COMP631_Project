Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Salt Cod Brandade with Malt Vinegar Chips:  Plain and simple, I love brandade - if it were on every menu I'd order it everywhere I went and with not a single spot in my prior or current home offering it on the daily menu it has sort of become a "destination" dish...and this one is without a doubt worth the trip.  Served as a play on "fish and chips" and entirely rich with cod at the fore while olive oil, garlic, and chives played a backup role the brandade was lightly browned at the top and still bubbly at the bottom while the chips proved a clever delivery mechanism - the vinegar and dearth of salt helping to cut the potency of the dried fish; a turn-off to my sister on her previous brandade experiences.
