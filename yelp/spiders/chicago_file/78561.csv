Little Goat Diner////Hi Sophie, thanks so much for taking the time to leave us a review. I'm happy that you were able to try several of our dishes, but I am sorry to hear that you left feeling unimpressed. I'll speak to my team about your feedback so that we can incorporate it moving forward. I would love the opportunity to have you join us again. I know how great Little Goat can be and would love to be given a second chance to show you this! Best, Tina Majethia - Assistant Director of Operations
