Art Institute of Chicago////I am a huge fan of impressionistic paintings, so I loved the extensive collection of Monet, Manet and Pissarro. Monet's "Water Lilies" and "Water Lily Pond" are pieces that I love! I really appreciate his ability to capture light, water movement, shadows, life and color in deceivingly simple paintings.
