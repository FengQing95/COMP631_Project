Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The second reason is the manager Sam. I decided to call one more time because as a business owner I want to know feedback about employee's. I was very impressed with Sam. She was very nice in listening to my statement that cheese is a given on a pizza, and she agreed. She looked up our order & saw how it was taken down and said she saw the issue. The guy taking order wrote it down wrong. Easy mistake. She did not say what was going to be done about the monster who doesn't get it about cheese & pizza. I hope she has a good long sit down with this individual about how people look forward to the gooey deliciousness of cheese. The 2 stars are for her. I withheld 3 because I am still annoyed that I was cheese blocked on my cheat night.
