Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Sometimes when I read reviews I am reminded that it must be something wrong with me, not everyone else, when I hold back from 5-starring a 5-starrer. I have been here a bunch of times though, and the average experience is usually (and consistently) very good. It's just not OMGWTF. But no tapas place in Chicago is for me.
