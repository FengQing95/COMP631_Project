Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This has been our favorite pizza place since trying it this summer.We have had Uno's & Giordanos but the crust,sauce & sausage is better quality in my opinion at Lous. A large pizza feeds 4 people easy & the servers are always on top of things when it comes to making sure that the pizza comes out hot & the first slices are served by them ,ladies always come first( always a nice touch) & drink glasses are always full. We usually go there between 2 Â & 3 pm chitown time & never have to wait to long for a table.there's sidewalk tables as well for enjoying the constant activity that Chicago is famous for. My only complaint about the place are tables are very close together in the center of the back room but I know that this is to get more true pizza lovers in & seated at all cost
