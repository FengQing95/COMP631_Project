Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Really great Chicago-style deep dish pizza. Sausage is their staple and it comes in patties rather than little balls of meat. I ordered for delivery and it came about 15 minutes early - a welcome surprise! I also ordered the stuffed spinach bread, which I probably liked even better than the pizza. It's a mini bread loaf filled with cheesy, spinach-y, garlicky goodness.
