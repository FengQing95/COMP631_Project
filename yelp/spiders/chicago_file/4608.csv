The Purple Pig////We asked that the second entree be cancelled since it never came out..We were told that luckily another table ordered the lamb ribs so they could give the dish to them instead. My concern was that, the timelines of the dish was not communicated to us beforehand. I don't know if it takes longer to prepare or if it was never put in, or if there was a mistake in the kitchen.. It just seemed like had the other table not ordered it, we would be charged for a dish that came out 30 minutes after the other two plates..
