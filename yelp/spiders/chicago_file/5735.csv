The Purple Pig////My big question coming to this place was whether it was a tapas place or not. It's really an inbetween. Like just off portion sizes, it's much bigger than tapas sizes, but not really enough for a single plate to fill you up. We ended up getting 3 plates and some charcuterie for two people and while we finished it, we were STUFFED.
