Smoque BBQ////Warning: if you go near closing time, just know that they do run out of many popular items. "Sorry folks, we are out of Chicken" was posted when we arrived. By the time we ordered, they had run out of sliced brisket and only had chopped brisket available. Also, out of Peach Cobbler too. I wiped my tears away and ordered up some delicious cornbread instead.
