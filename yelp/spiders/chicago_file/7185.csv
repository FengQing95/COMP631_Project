Art Institute of Chicago////With the rise of the smartphone, I have realized that I am in the small minority of people. The vast majority of people appear to go to art museums so that they can take pictures of themselves standing next to famous paintings. I literally saw people work their way around a room, taking a photograph of their precious little selves in front of _each_ Monet, Van Gogh, etc.
