Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The steak. If you come here and don't get steak, you're doing it wrong. The aged ribeye is definitely one of the best steaks I've ever had. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The sides are huge and definitely shareable too. The creamed spinach and mac & cheese went perfectly with the steak. We also received a complementary dessert with a sparkler on top. Extra tastiness.
