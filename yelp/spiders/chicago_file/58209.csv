Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cool sultry atmosphere meets authentic spanish tapas. We enjoyed the Spinach & Manchego-stuffed Mushrooms, Catalan style crystal bread, ib√©rico croquetas, spanish charcuterie, and the grilled hanger steak. So croquetas are superior, we literally had to get two orders, but I could have ordered at least 50 more. We had the house red sangria, a full pitcher for $28- you can't beat these freaking prices. Make sure to have a reservation, this place is always poppin off. They will seat and take orders til 9 but stayed open past 10. Get there TODAY.
