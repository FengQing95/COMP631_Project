Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It is, by far, my favorite place to get a steak in Chicago. It feels both new and old and open yet intimate. The steaks are unbelievable. The sides were off the charts. The desert was exceptional and the service rivaled some of the best I've ever had. I like sitting in the bar area usually. I like the extra chatter. We sat in a super comfortable booth and drank wine, laughed and enjoyed an evening with friends. This is such a great place and in fact this restaurant group has yet to disappoint- they are as close to a sure thing as I can imagine.
