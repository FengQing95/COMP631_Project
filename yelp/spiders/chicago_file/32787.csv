Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Outstanding as expected. We met someone here and thoughly enjoyed the whole experience. Cocktails were very well done, especially liked my dark and stormy. Very unique and well chosen beer list and some good wine choices by the glass. We skipped appetizers, but they looked good. The steaks were of course excellent, in the top three I've ever had easily. I got the traditional filet, which is always the right choice. Some of the steaks come with toppings, or you can add your own like bone marrow, but I thought it was best unadorned. Dessert was good too, the chocolate ganache cheesecake pie type thing. Just a fantastic meal throughout. Great atmosphere too, chic yet old fashioned. Feels like something from the 1920. Of course all this means they get incredibly busy and its hard to get reservations even weeks in advance, but we got there early, around 5:30 and had no problem getting a table after a few minutes at the bar.
