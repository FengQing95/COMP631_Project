The Purple Pig////When I mentioned it to my server, asking why it was so salty, he told me the ham is supposed to be salty. I asked him if the ham is salty, why all the salt on top, he just looked at me. I told him he could take it away and to please bring the check. Believe it or not, the check came almost instantaneously, fastest I'd seen him move all day. So disappointed.
