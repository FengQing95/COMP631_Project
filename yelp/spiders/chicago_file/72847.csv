Little Goat Diner////Food: "This Little Piggy Goes to China" was a revelation in breakfast. The smoky sausage blended very well with the tangy sauce, cheesy biscuit, and tart gooseberries. I slowly savored every bite, though I could have stood for a side as the waitress suggested. I'm trying to figure out how to construct it myself at home.
