Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For great tapas food try Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!  The white sangria is delicious and the tapas are great.  Not as good as Cafe Iberico but it is my second favorite tapas restaurant.  Favorites include the beef brochette, the goatcheese, the spicy potatoes, or the garlic shrimp.  The desserts are good too so remember to save room!
