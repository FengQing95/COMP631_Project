Smoque BBQ////You WILL get a seat - I promise. I know the line is out the door, I know every table is full - but trust me - they will get you a seat. While you are waiting in line to order, these guys (I call them air traffic controllers) will come to you and ask how many people you have. While you are ordering, they will find you a table. This is one of the most important things to remember, because the line out the door will really put off first timers - but you will get a table.
