Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Awesome Chicago deep dish! This was my first time trying deep dish pizza, and I think I definitely made the right choice. I tried the classic, which had a little too much meat for my taste, but it was definitely delicious! I think next time I would try something with more veggies, but I will definitely return!
