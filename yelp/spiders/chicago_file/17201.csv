Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best Chicago Pizza. All others will be judged against this standard. Fresh ingredients. Their sauce is not sweet. Sausage is issued out as a patty and not chunks, so every bite is amazing. Seriously, I've only met a few Chicagoans that do not rate this as the finest example of deep dish pizza, and those people are crazy. Â Get the pizza uncut if you get delivery, so it stays hot and prevents the sauce from getting the crust soggy.
