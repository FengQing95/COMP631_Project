Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Let me say that I am not a big meat person to begin with but I was absolutely blown away by their filet mignon. It was one of the most flavorful and tenderest piece of meat I've ever had. The baked goat cheese + bread was also a winner for our table. Definitely a great appetizer to share and perfect way to start off the meal. Highly recommend getting the truffle mac & cheese as a side too. It's ooey and gooey in all the right ways. Believe me when I say that I licked the platter clean.
