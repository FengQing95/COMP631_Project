The Purple Pig////Okay so we actually stumbled upon this gem accidentally. It was the only place open late. We didn't realize it was an upscale restaurant. It was difficult choosing what to get on the menu with all the different and out of the ordinary items they had. Checking yelp as usual, I realized that the menu changes often. We ask our waiter what he recommends and he did not disappoint. We got a pasta item and this corn dish (I really wish I could remember the names). We devoured the food!! The flavors are not what you expect from the descriptions in the menu. I really hope I can come back here to try more of their dishes. This place knows what it's doing with their flavors and dishes. No wonder they have so many reviews and high ratings!
