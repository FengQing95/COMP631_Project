Little Goat Diner////- Pork belly pancake with slaw. If I could bring this dish home to meet the parents I would. My dad is a bit traditional so I'm not sure what he'd think, but after a bite I know he would understand. Everyone at the table sampled this dish and there was not a single bite taken without a corresponding eye-roll and sigh at the deliciousness.
