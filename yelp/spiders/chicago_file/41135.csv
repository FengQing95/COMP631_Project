Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was pretty disappointed, with the atmosphere and the food, but mostly the food.  Maybe it was the time I went, Sunday afternoon.  My food was prepared half cold and ultimately just not very tasty (so bland).  Have to give thumbs down on my experience there.  Won't be going back.
