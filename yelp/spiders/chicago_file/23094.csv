Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A lot of research went into choosing the best pizza place to go to on our trip. There are many rivals in Chicago, where people claim X has THE best pizza. I took a chance on Lou Malnati's and it did not disappoint. I'm sure you can't go wrong with the majority of deep dish places downtown, but you can't go wrong here.
