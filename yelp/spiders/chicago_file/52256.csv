Smoque BBQ////The sauce - often the crown jewel of a famous BBQ joint - was forgettable. Our group of four each ordered different meats and sides so we could share and get a more comprehensive tasting. We were all disappointed to say the least. The disappointment was severe considering the journey we took to get there (because of construction on some EL lines, we had to take two trains, a bus, and eventually a cab to get there). The food was hardly worth our Odyssey.
