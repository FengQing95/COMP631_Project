Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love love love Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! We always get tapas and sangria when we come - they are all amazing. The place is usually very busy when we come, regardless if it is a weekend or weekday. I would recommend making a reservation, though the bar is first come first serve. We usually end up sitting and eating at the bar which is great. Must try: bacon wrapped dates, spicy potatoes, deviled egg.
