Smoque BBQ////This place is fantastic.  The sides could be a tad bigger but the food is phenomenal and very reasonably priced considering some of the other BBQ houses I have been too in Texas and Kansas.  Great Food, Good people and well priced.  Can't say enough good stuff about everything they have here.  The brisket and the BBQ chicken is amazing.
