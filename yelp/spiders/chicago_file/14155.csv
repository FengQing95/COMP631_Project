Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Guys, if you are wanting a reserved, high class dinner, this place is not for you...IF however you want Chicago's best Deep Dish Pizza..this is the place.  We got the Lou's special with Sausage and Butter crust.  Amazing flavor.  Service was great.  When beers were near the bottom of the bottle, she had us one coming.
