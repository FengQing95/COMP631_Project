Smoque BBQ////I had such high hopes.  It wasn't for me.  I had the chopped brisket sandwich.  I found it dry....and tasty.  But not as tasty as I've had elsewhere.  Maybe I'm not the connoisseur that everyone else is. My tummy was not right afterwards either.  Oh...also parking is a bitch, over there.
