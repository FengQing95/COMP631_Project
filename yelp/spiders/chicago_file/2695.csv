The Purple Pig////Pretty nice ambience. The staff was very attentive. The food was so/so. Presentation of the food was beautiful. I did love the mashed potatoes that came with the pork shoulder. They were excellent. There was about an hour wait though so make sure to call ahead. My husband had the octopus. He said the sauce was flavorful but the octopus was forgettable. We also had the salted beets. The beets were good but the peanut sauce that came with it didn't really go together.
