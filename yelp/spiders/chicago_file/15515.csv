Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've never heard of this place and it's a shame because I'm obsessed with pizza and I live in Chicago! Once I found out about it we had to go. With tons of reviews, why shouldn't we. Pizza is awesome, fresh sauce and believe me you can tell. The right amount of cheese and the crust was amazing. Not many deep dish places you go to and you actually enjoy the crust, but this place has it going on. The wait is a bit long but expected when it comes to deep dish. I didn't like the shoes and skateboards on the wall, kind of a dirty thing to have in a restaurant. Other than that it would've been 5 stars for me.
