Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great food, great ambiance!  Perfect date night restaurant.  My husband and I went for my birthday on a Tuesday night.  Even though we didn't order dessert (too stuffed), our server still brought out a candle for me to make a wish.  I thought that was such a nice touch and really made my night.
