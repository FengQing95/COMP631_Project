The Purple Pig////Holy geez. This place is great and I sure am glad my sister found it. After going to a museum and before going to see Hamilton, my sister and I stopped here for lunch. It was hella busy but we were seated and Â had a menu quickly. The tables and isles are very close together but not uncomfortably so.
