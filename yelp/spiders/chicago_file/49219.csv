Smoque BBQ////Smoque was delicious! I ordered St. Louis ribs with mac n' cheese and fresh cut fries as my sides. I loved everything. The St. Louis ribs are really tasty with their bbq sauce and have a nice texture to them. The only thing I would have wanted was a more tender, fall-off-the-bone texture. Their sides were great too even the cole slaw and I usually hate cole slaw. Other than the ribs, i hear that the pulled pork is really good here so next time I must try that.
