Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was not impressed, perhaps the personal size pizza that I ordered for one is prepared differently than the other sizes? The Â tomatoes were fresh but the sausage was typical and was one large piece! The place is noisy and did not have an outdoor seating. My search continues!
