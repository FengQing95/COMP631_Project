Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had a good experience here a couple of years ago, so was happy to return for tapas with a friend the other day.  The place was pretty crowded for a Monday night, which surprised me, but we were seated right away at a small table for two.  Upon being seated, the table already seemed crowded with a stack of small plates, salt & pepper, cutlery, etc.
