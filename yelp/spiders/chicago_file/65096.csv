Smoque BBQ////Ms T had pulled pork on her sandwich.  She prefers to eat her barbecue with sauce.  Simply put, you do not want to eat Smoque's sauce.  Neither the spicy nor the mild were worth bothering with.  So she did not enjoy eating the pork.  She felt it was not very smoky and without sauce, well..... live by the sauce, die by the sauce.
