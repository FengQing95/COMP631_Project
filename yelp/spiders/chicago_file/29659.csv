Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I mean damn. I thought the hype was real! Delicious pizza. Â Granted I've only tried two other places that are famous in Chicago but this was one was the best! Got your basic cheese deep dish and half with sausage and I felt like I was floating on a pizza shaped cloud in heaven.
