Little Goat Diner////My mom ordered a glass of the house red wine and it came in a regular cylinder glass...not your standard wine glass. Um...okay..? The wine was just OK. We ordered our food, my mom the drunken sandwhich and me the sourdough pancakes. Everything is a'la carte and it's PRICEY. $11 for 3 pancakes? $6 for a side of bacon? Yikes. Our waitress was slightly unattentive since I had another waitor grab another drink for me. The food is...good. It's OK, nothing special really. For the price I would much rather go somewhere else along Randolph. Then the family behind us with "the beast" started up again and would even stand on the seat, turn towards us, and LOOKS at us. And his parents did nothing. Not to mention there were about 3 other families of screaming children at the Diner as well. This is what I hate about this area, former Lincoln Park singles who create monsters for children who think they're entitled to everything and anything. Definitely disappointed at the whole experience. I think if the menu was updated, more "inclusive" offerings, and a better staff, it may be a better place. However, I definitely will not be back any time soon.
