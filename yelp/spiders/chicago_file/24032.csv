Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////we had a group of about 15 and Lou's made the experience really easy. they booked us upstairs with plenty of room for us to mingle before dinner, with frequent wait service to order drinks. the wine list isn't extensive but the pinot noir was pretty good and was very suitable for a more casual pizza night.
