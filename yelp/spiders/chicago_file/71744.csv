Little Goat Diner////It's not that Little Goat's food is bad. It just feels like it's not worth the cost or the hype. I'm also interested to know what Izard's obsession is with Korean food (see: Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing). Because of the Izard brand, I've been here a few times. From the tasty thing to the grits to the french toast (but, uhh, not the cinnabun), everything tastes pretty good but is just drenched in salt.
