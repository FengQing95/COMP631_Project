Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This pizza is not for the faint of heart, and please take that literally and figuratively. The pie takes a long time to bake but when it comes out your rarin' to eat some good and hearty food.  This ain't no wussy California Pizza Kitchen amalgamation, this is pizza with thick buttery crust and sauce as viscous as car oil.  Don't even try to come up with some BS neo food mutation, this is Deep Dish straight up.
