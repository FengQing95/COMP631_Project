Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We've now eaten here twice over the past few months and have been more than pleased each time. This place is great, from the atmosphere, to the staff, to the fantastic food itself. Definitely one of the best steakhouses in Chicago. Try to get a table downstairs, grab a cocktail, and enjoy the night. But be warned, getting a reservation is hard, but it'll be worth it when you do.
