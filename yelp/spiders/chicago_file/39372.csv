Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The arrival of pearl-handle steak knives heralded our entrée.  We splurged on the 22 oz. bone-in ribeye, dry-aged for 42 days.  Ordered medium-rare, this impressive slab initially arrived at our table so undercooked that I thought I heard a mooing sound.  But after a quick trip back to the broiler, it was sheer perfection.   A pinch or two of the accompanying salt blend further enhanced every delectable bite and made the béarnaise superfluous.  Our one side dish, pommes frites, was not shoestrings but an ample portion of thick-cut, greaseless fries with a ramekin of silky garlic aioli.
