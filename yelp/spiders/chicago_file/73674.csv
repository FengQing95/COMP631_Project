Little Goat Diner////"The Goat" is a metaphor for your peacefulness...("to get someone's goat" means to irritate, annoy...to disrupt their state of peacefulness.) And you can bet I'm disrupted. How can I be in this town and eat anywhere else? How can I sleep when this resto is just down the street!? Open until 1am!? (Th-Sat) Â Serving all kinds of crafty creative culinary concoctions in form of food and drink!?
