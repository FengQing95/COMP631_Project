Little Goat Diner////The Caesar salad is perfectly balanced, unlike most restaurants that go too heavy on the dressing. Fattoush salad is good as well, comparable to landmark authentic Mediterranean restaurants in Chicago like Pita Inn in the suburbs. The burgers are not above average, the "All American" is the one we tried which is basically dressed like a Big Mac. Where the food really shines is the sandwiches. Los Drowned is essentially a drip beef sandwich with avocado, although the broth has a more spice-influenced twist than your typical Chicago-style Italian beef. Very flavorful, highly recommend. Tonkatsu is another must-try, don't let the white bread fool you, it is a great example of Asian fusion done well. The number one item on the menu, however: MAC AND CHEESE. Portion is a bit small for Â $7 but the richness and flavor complexity (from the goat cheese) makes up for it.
