Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Being in Chicago for the first time, there are a few musts that you have to do Having a Chicago dog, and a deep dish pizza was on my list. I decided to go to Lou's since they had the best reviews and it was conveniently located next to a subway station. At it's peak hours, their might be a huge wait, but it is definitely worth it.
