Little Goat Diner////i'm going to start with beer, cause its what i do. i can't believe that i have not seen this before in any of the other places that make craft beer a big deal. but on the little goat draft list, they have what is going to replace the draft when whatever is on tap runs out. it blew my mind. we all have been to the place when the server tells you they are out of the beer your order and the server has to go back, forth, and check the cellar before you give up and order a bud light (just kidding i would never. i would make the server meet their step goal three times over).
