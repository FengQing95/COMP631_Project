Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Granted I don't have much experience in Chicago deep dish pizza but it doesn't take much experience to know that their deep dish pizza is amazing! The crust was so crispy and thin--not what I would have assumed from a deep dish. And their toppings and tomato sauce was so rich and juicy. Every bite is like an entirely new experience. I highly recommend that you try this before Giordanos.
