Art Institute of Chicago////If you're in the mood for a museum or just want to wander around, try the Art Institute.  It's located right downtown on Michigan Ave and you can often find students lolling about the steps or the calm park area that surrounds its exterior.  Inside is a coruncopia of art and sculpture from all sorts of time periods and cultures.  This diversity means you will find something you like, but you will also find something that bores you.  There are also special exhibits that rotate about every few months.
