Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////After an old fashioned and cognac zepherac for me and a dirty martini for my boyfriend we decided to cap the meal off with 2 espresso martinis and carrot cake.  The carrot cake was delicious and the espresso martini was made with ACTUAL FRESH ESPRESSO.  It was the perfect pick me up to a heavy decadent meal.  We will be back soon Bavettes. Thank you for the perfect date night!
