Little Goat Diner////I tried the interesting sounding Parathas Burrito - na'an with eggs and an avocado and kidney bean salad.  I was scared when it was put on the table - the chili dressing had a strong vinegar smell for that early in the morning, but the arrangement of tastes together?  It totally worked!
