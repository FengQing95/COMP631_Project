Little Goat Diner////Delicious upscale diner with great menu and lots of variety! Arnold Palmer was spot on and blueberry pancakes were fantastic... Just the right amount of blueberries adding sweetness & a little tang. You can't forget about the sweet oatmeal crumble on top! The home fries were crisp outside with a soft cheesy center.
