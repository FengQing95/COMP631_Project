Art Institute of Chicago////Hands down one of the best museums I've been to. The collection is HUGE and constantly changing. No matter what kind of art you are into you will be able find something. The entire place is beautiful and the new modern wing is phenomenal! A must see if you live in or are visiting Chicago.
