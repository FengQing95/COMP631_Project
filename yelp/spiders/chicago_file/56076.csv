Smoque BBQ////While this is not the best BBQ I have ever had, it is some of the best I have found in the Chicagoland area.  I tried a bit of just about everything and thought it was all good quality.  The St. Louis ribs were a bit dry, but tasted good, the pulled pork was good as well and the sliced beef brisket was fantastic and will be my choice next time I stop back in.
