Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////YESSSSS. My first legit tapas experience and o can't remember the last time I was that satisfied at a restaurant. No complaints whatsoever. The food, drinks and service were all on point. Valet parking is available bc parking can be a pain in that area. Worth every dime and minute spent.
