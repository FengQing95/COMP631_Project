Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Between my friend and I we shared the paella (minimum serving is for 2) and a few tapas (small bites). Our second waiter didn't seem to know the menu very well. We asked for recommendations because there were so many tasty options, but he seemed to read over my shoulder to recommend the dishes already highlighted in red on the menu.
