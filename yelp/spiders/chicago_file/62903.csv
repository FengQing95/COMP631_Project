Smoque BBQ////My friends and I decided to come here for my birthday since I've heard so many good things about it. How can a Texan refuse bbq? Smoque honestly lives up to the hype. I've heard about it so many times from so many people that I honestly expected to be disappointed but I was not. Absolutely love this place and I'm so glad they have a location in Revival Hall now so I get easier access to amazing bbq. The four of us ordered 1/2 rack of baby back ribs, 1/2 rack of st louis ribs, 1 pound of brisket and 1 pound of pulled pork along with some sides. Didn't eat anything before or after this meal but it was so worth it. In fact, I might make this my birthday tradition from here on out. Just be wary of the wait times; we went around 1 or 2 in the afternoon and there was still a short wait (I can only imagine what it's like during peak hours). Still well worth the wait!
