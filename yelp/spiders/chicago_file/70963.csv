Little Goat Diner////This place is AMAZING! My friend's family loved it so much they ate breakfast here every day of their trip. I was only fortunate to have one scrumptious meal at the Little Goat. Shrimp and grits were a true "cereal killer" as the menu suggests. In addition, my friend and her family ordered and loved the "little piggy went to China, dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes (OMG), and the fat Elvis waffles. I need to clone the menu, steal the chef, and open my own Little Goat in Memphis pronto!
