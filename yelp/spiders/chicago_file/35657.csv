Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This restaurant was a overpriced for food that should not be that expensive. Â We go out to eat quite often and being from the Midwest we know a good steak and they are supposed to be known for meat and it was nothing special. I could have a better $40 steak and have had a much better steak that was cheaper. The environment was very dark and due to this it was hard to read the menu and let alone see the food! the service was a bit slow and the waiters and hostesses had a an attitude.
