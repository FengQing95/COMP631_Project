Smoque BBQ////We get back to my apartment, and 15 minutes later, Barry arrives with my order, and kindly included many extras that I did not order, but that helped to make my event run much more smoothly.  In addition to delivering the order for free, he included a $50 gift certificate to return to Smoque, as an apology for losing my order.  Lastly, they found yet another way to extend their apologies when it came time for me to pay for my order. Amazing!!
