Art Institute of Chicago////The members cafe is smaller than I expected so it was a bit crowded. It reminded me of the newly renovated United Clubs at major airports. There is complimentary coffee and water. But you can purchase beverages as well. My friend had a nice rose. The bartenders were very sweet and checked on us often.
