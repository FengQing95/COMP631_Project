Little Goat Diner////I've been avoiding Little Goat when I heard about the exorbitant wait times, despite being a huge fan of Stephanie on Top Chef. Well, apparently, the trick is to eat alone. Got seated at the bar immediately on Saturday around noon. Took me a while to decide on what to get, so I asked the waitress, and without hesitation she said: French toast. Ok, bring it on! It was definitely unlike any French toast I've ever had: succulent pieces of fried white meat chicken (which I usually steer clear of because they're often overcooked, not here though), sweet and savory syrup and butter-grilled bread. I'm definitely coming back for some of the more adventurous options on the menu. One thing though: try to grab a seat on the left side of the bar. I was seated on the right side, directly in front of the heat lamps. Felt like I was about to have a heat stroke after the meal. Other than that, nothing to complain about!
