Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Finally, got to try the food at Lou Malnati's. Was very busy. We had to wait for like 5 mins even though the hostess said it would be 20. Unlike most of the people who go here for deep dish pizza, my gf and I didn't want that at all. We started with 3 cheese bread, which was really good. Then we ordered a Malnati salad and a small gluten free pizza. The salad was big in size and could easily be a dinner for one. The gluten free pizza was nice and crisp. My gf loved it as she always craves for nice gluten free food. Overall, nice place for family dinner.
