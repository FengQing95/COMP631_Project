Little Goat Diner////Finally had a chance to come here on a Saturday afternoon. Parking was fairly easy, and free if you park on a side street! With a group of 6 at 1 pm, we had to wait an hour to be seated. When we were finally seated, we were unfortunately seated at one of the two long tables that reminded me of a high school cafeteria. We were squeezed in next to other lunching groups, and both I and the girl next to me were uncomfortable and had to be careful to keep our elbows in! If you get stuck at one of these tables, be prepared to hear every word of another groups' conversation. The decor of the place is nice, and the tables are nice if you get a private booth, but it is very loud. It was very hard to hear, and I couldn't talk to the person across from me two seats down because of the noise level.
