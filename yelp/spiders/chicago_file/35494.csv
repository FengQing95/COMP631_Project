Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We arrived a few minutes early, but that didn't seem to cause a problem. The host stand took out coats to check and we were whisked away through the door to the GORGEOUS restaurant that screams Speakeasy era. I was immediately in awe of the whole atmosphere. Dark wood walls with antiqued mirrors, dim golden lighting, HUGE beautiful chandeliers, wooden tables, mismatched floral/antique plates and loud-ish (but not distracting) jazz music playing. Oh and a cocktail list that rivaled the dinner menu. Totally my style.
