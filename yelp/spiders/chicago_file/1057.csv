Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This is one of the popular locations where the line is long and the food looks great.  There were so many people that my bf and I decided to sit outside.  We didn't mind that the temperature was in the 40s and there was a slight breeze.  In the sunlight it was beautiful to sit across from Millennium Park in downtown Chicago.  We ordered the speciality, which was a concoction of pancakes, marscapone and fresh berries.  it was good, but I am not really a fan of soggy pancakes.  I ordered a skillet, which was great.  The eggs were cooked perfectly.  A nice hot cup of tea made sitting outside well worth it.  I would go back to try some more items, but not sure if I would wait more than a half hour or so.
