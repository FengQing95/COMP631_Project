Smoque BBQ////When I was growing up in southern California, my dad, after leaving Tennessee, took it as a sacred mission to introduce me and my little brother to proper barbeque.  When we'd go back during the summers, we got barbeque there, but it took years of searching to find good barbeque nearer home.  He finally found a really good barbeque place eventually, about thirty miles from our neighborhood, but it's unfortunately now closed.
