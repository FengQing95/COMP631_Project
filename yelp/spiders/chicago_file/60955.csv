Smoque BBQ////Ribs: Tried a 1/2 rack of baby backs and a 1/2 rack of St. Louis and both were superb.  They must have a masseuse in the house, because their ribs were obviously massaged with care with a heaping serving of spices that forms a crust bursting with flavor.  On top of all that, they smoke their ribs so thoroughly that if I was blind I'd be convinced I was sitting in front of a camp fire.  Between the rub and the smoke you really don't need any sauce, but I love sauce and Smoque's smoky-vinegary-spiced elixir really hit the mark.
