Little Goat Diner////Update:  A recent return trip, the boyfriend and I had two wonderful dishes, the bulls eye french toast, and the paratha burrito.  Since I kind of believe in redemption, I will update accordingly to a slightly higher rating.  I still dislike paying customers getting sub par products, so I still stand by my original notes and experiences.
