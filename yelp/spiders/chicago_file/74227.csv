Little Goat Diner////So I wanted to like this place more than I did. I've gone in the caf√© door a few times just to get tea because the wait was long. This place is always busy. But we did manage to get a seat at the counter in the dining room near to kitchen to watch the magic. I was kinda surprised by the menu because I was expected awesome diner fare, but I saw that there was a lot of fusion type food to the point that I didn't know what to get. If you're expecting to find a place were you can get eggs, potatoes, bacon on a plate then this isn't it.
