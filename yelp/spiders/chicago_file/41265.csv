Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great place!  The food was really good, and there was a decent variety of options.  I'd be careful of overdosing on potatos, and stick with the tomato bread and manchego - cant be beat.  The scallops are definitely a highlight.  One word of advice - get some of those vibrating devices that call people when their tables are ready.  The ultra loud "TABLE FOR TINA!!!! TABLE FOR TINA!!!!" system has got to go - it's downright maddening....
