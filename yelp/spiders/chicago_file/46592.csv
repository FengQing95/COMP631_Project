Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great food, super atmosphere, reasonable price... probably the best Tapas in the city.  We love the variety and there's plenty of choices even though we're not meat-eaters.  The Brussel Sprout Salad should not be missed and then there's the Shrimp with Garlic that's the one that keeps us coming back to this little gem.  Sometimes the wait staff can be a little pushy trying to turn their tables, but that's the only nick on this place.
