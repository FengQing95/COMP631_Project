Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As for the meal the bloggers where right on for the rose martini and the mojito Â had a tasty twist to it. My son's steak was overdone and easily sent back. The manager came to the table to check up on the replacement steak ( wish I had noticed the seating arrangements by then). I did appreciate the way the asparagus was actually cooked through. A piece of chocolate pie comped for the overdone steak and yes go and try the whiskey ice cream.
