Art Institute of Chicago////I was fortunate enough to visit in February when they offered free admission all month long.  The Modern Wing has its own restaurant and gift shop (definitely had some intriguing design type gifts).  Here you'll find surrealists, modern looking chairs, American Art like Edward Hopper's Nighthawks, Calder mobiles, architectural fragments from modern buildings, and wonderful Gerhard Richter paintings that look like moving images captured by a camera (though they're paintings).
