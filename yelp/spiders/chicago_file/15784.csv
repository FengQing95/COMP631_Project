Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Had never tried deep dish pizza before Lou's, but now I'm wondering why every city hasn't adopted this trend. Sure, you have to wait 30 minutes until you can ingest this oozing pie of deliciousness, but it's well worth the wait. My friend and I shared the fried calamari and the veggie pizza. Both were excellent.
