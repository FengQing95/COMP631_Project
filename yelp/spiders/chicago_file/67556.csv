Little Goat Diner////Great ambience! Not casual. not formal. Great brunch place for hangout over the weekend. I wanted to order everything on the menu. Everything sounded so good. I will definitely return to order the other dishes. I ended up ordering Bull's eye French Toast which is eggs crispy chicken sweet onion brioche Â and in bbq maple syrup. The eggs were part of the french toast. I've never quite tasted anything like this and it was delicious. I ordered a bloody mary....or to say a very spicy bloody mary! I would just go back for a glass again. Again, loved it and will go back many more times.
