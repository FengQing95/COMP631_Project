Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we arrived, the place was packed with people standing around the entrance, waiting to be seated. When we signed in to get a table, they told us we can preorder our pizza. We ordered the Malnati chicago classic, which is the deep dish with sausage and cheese. We waited 50 min to get a table. So when we got our table, we thought that since we preordered our pizza 45 min ago, it would be ready. But we waited another 45 min while sitting at the table before the pizza came. At first i was excited to finally try the famous chicago deep dish pizza. I love cheese. I was just hungry so first few bites, okay. After a couple bites, it's like chewy cheese on hard crust. The atmosphere is interesting inside the restaurant. Sports jerseys of famous players were framed on the walls.
