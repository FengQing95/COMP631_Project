Art Institute of Chicago////It's one of the best art museums in the world.  We're went specifically to see the Manet exhibit, since she loves impressionism.  I personally enjoyed seeing the African American artist whom I had not seen before. It was fascinating to see the periods Manet with threw and expressed in his art.  We're had a great time.
