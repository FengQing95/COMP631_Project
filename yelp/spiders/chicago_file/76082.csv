Little Goat Diner////Knew we did not want a big meal, so we opted for Little Goat Diner.  Really cute interior and great interpretations of comfort food.  I had a shrimp, crispy pork belly and noodle dish that was a wonder of flavors.  My husband has probably had a Rubin sandwich in every city we have ever visited or lived.  This one was special. I think fresh sauerkraut or maybe just picked cabbage; much nicer than the overly sour commercial kind.  The bread richly buttered and I think grilled over wood.  Anyway.  Nice place for casual dinner.
