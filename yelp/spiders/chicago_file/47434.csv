Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Such a fun environment and the food/drinks are amazing. I went with a group on a busy Friday night and we enjoyed Sangria and Tapas (Empanadas, Chicken Skewers, Brussel Sprout Salad, Steak, Meat and Cheese and more but I forget) Would absolutely return - it's always crowded and they have a beautiful patio
