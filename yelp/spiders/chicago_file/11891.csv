Art Institute of Chicago////Today's highlight though was the first featuring of AIC's collection of Japanese Buddhist Kesa (pronounced like quesadilla, without the "dilla") exhibit. In didn't know anything about Kesa's or any other type of vestments before visiting, and now I do. Â The highlight of this visit was Callihan Aduzzi a museum employee assigned to the exhibit who could not be more helpful, sincere and charming.
