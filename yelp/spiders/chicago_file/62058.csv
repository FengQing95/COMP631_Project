Smoque BBQ////Still living, with a mad craving for some good bbq, I finally made it to Smoque before it closed for the night. I walked in at a quarter to 9pm on a Sunday and was greeted by a friendly young man, "Hello, ma'am.' I was afraid he was gonna tell me they were closed, but when I asked, 'Are y'all still open?' he smiled and opened a hand toward the counter.
