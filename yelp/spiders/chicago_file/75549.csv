Little Goat Diner////First of all, I want to mention how happy I was with the atmosphere of this restaurant. Most restaurants blast the air conditioning even when it's not needed. The temperature was cool and pleasant, not frigid. The place was busy when we arrived, but we were seated right away. The staff works hard to keep things moving along. Our food arrived quickly (within about 10 minutes) and was very tasty. I ordered the veggie burger and the patty had nice, big chunks of vegetables in it.
