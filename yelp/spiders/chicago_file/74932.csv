Little Goat Diner////One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! I also love their sister restaurant across the street Girl and the Goat. Service was great and they even have a bakery connected to it. I had the fish tostadas - I loved the pickled vegetables on it. I wish I would have ordered a shake. They looked fabulous!
