Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Chicago. I love it - I have been multiple times for events and dinners. Their sangria pitchers are amazing. My favorite tapas is their short ribs and mashed potatoes - I have even ordered this as take out separately. The ambiance is very cool. It is a fun place to go, great date night. Love it here.
