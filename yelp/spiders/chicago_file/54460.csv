Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here for restaurant week brunch and it was a great deal! The food was well portioned (we were able to get 2 Pinxtos and 2 tapas and 1 dessert for $22) and me and my friends walked out all very full and satisfied! Food was great, service was also very great. I don't know how much value brunch is on a regular day, but for restaurant week it was perfect! The butterscotch custard was incredible!
