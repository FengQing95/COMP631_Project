Smoque BBQ////the ONLY reason i'm giving this one a 4 is because of the weird standing in line situation....i constantly was in the way.  okay on with the good stuff.  everything i inserted into my mouth here was insane.  the brisket, the chicken, the st.louis ribs, the slaw....all of it amazing.  loved the beans, loved the cornbread.  (didn't care about the mac & cheese but that's my own thing...i don't like breadcrumbs really)  & THEY HAVE ORANGE SODY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   can't wait to go back for that brisket.
