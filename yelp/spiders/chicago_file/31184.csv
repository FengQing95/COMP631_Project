Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Okay so I'm from California and I never really had OUTSTANDING deep dish pizza. Of course, when I'm Chicago, you HAVE TO get deep dish pizza. I stumbled upon this place on a bunch of different "must-eat places to eat in Chicago" blogs, and trust me, IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT. The Lou has no meat on it but we didn't realize it until it was brought to the table. My family are huge carnivores but we were not disappointed at all with this vegetarian-friendly pizza. We still had so much different food to try in Chicago so we were actually quite happy to not have that "food coma" type of feeling after eating something heavy and greasy. The crust was honestly the star of the show. Super buttery and flakey, I could literally just eat the crust by itself and I would be happy.
