Art Institute of Chicago////Went here multiple times during the year since it's free for u of c students. (Also for BOA customers on first weekends of every month and Thursday evenings for IL residents) Great building, great exhibitions, never feel tired of its collections. Because it is huge. My favorite American museum after Met.
