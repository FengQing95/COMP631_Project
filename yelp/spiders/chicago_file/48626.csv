Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was really good but they didn't seat us until 35 minutes past our 10:00pm reservation. Then they bus boy was cleaning the table (blowing out candles, taking napkins, threw us dirty looks etc...) as we were winding down our meal and signing the check. I understand you want to leave but you still had guests in the restaurant, that was downright rude!
