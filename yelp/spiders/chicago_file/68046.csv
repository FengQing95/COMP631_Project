Little Goat Diner////Went to Little Goat Diner for a late dinner with a friend on a Friday night. No wait if we sat at the bar (we did), and our server was super friendly, funny, and gave us great service. Unfortunately, the Sloppy Goat I ordered was way too salty. The Tempura Mash was an interesting twist, and the spiciness of the Blenheim's Spicy Ginger-ale added a unique twist to the meal. Little Goat Diner seemed to have everything going for it, but it's hard to feel good when the main dish was drowned in sodium. I do plan to try it again, as this is a quite a popular joint with very reasonable prices. Maybe I just got unlucky that day.
