Little Goat Diner////We went back and this time I had the spiced apple pancakes and my BF had the shrimp and cheese grits with two fried eggs on top. We also had the Dark Matter Coffee. Everything was very good and the waiter was friendly and approachable. The only complaint we had was that we had to sit at the counter, which is right near kitchen. It was very hot and we were both sweating which made it difficult to enjoy our food to the fullest extent. Hopefully next time there will be tables/booths available.
