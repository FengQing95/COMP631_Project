Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I know they are famous for deep dish, and it may just be a CA thin crust style pizza lover thing, but, yuck. Mouth full of sauce that burnt by tongue. Skimpy cheese and other toppings. Tables to close together and too Â heard to hear even the person right next to you. Took too long to be seated with no direction by host.
