The Purple Pig////My favorite dish was the turkey leg... The meat fell right off the bone! It would have paired very well with the roasted beets, however we gobbled those up as soon as they came out! I also loved the half duck! It was superb and substantial. Of all of our plates, the duck, the turkey, and the beets were the most substantial size-wise. The spare rib was tasty, but a bit tart. The lobster cannoli dish was very good, but the issue was it was too small of a portion. We decided to share a bottle of wine at the table, because the price of individual glasses were quite high.
