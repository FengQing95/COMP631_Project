Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago collection of Impressionist paintings is world-class. The collection of modern art is good, as is the collection of American art. Their other collections vary in breadth and depth. Whichever objects I view on any given trip to the Art Institute, I find that every visit to the museum's original building, although not so much the new Modern Wing, is spiritually uplifting.
