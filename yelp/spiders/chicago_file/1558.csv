Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Oh my goodness! This place is DELICIOUS!!!! I was lucky enough to stumble upon this spot during my trip to Chicago and boy was I happy! So happy, I came back the next morning before my flight back home! Do not let the long wait discourage you, trust me it is worth the wait! The prices are very reasonable and the servings are huge! I ordered the Espanola omelet which can easily feed two people. It came with pancakes and hash browns and everything was amazing! My daughter ordered the strawberry pancakes and those looked amazing as well! Robert was the best waiter ever! He took our order quickly and we waited no more than 10 minutes for our food to arrive. I'm so sad we do not have a Wildberry in California. This is definitely one of the top reasons I will return to Chicago!
