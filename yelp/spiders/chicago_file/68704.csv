Little Goat Diner////Easier to get into than its sister restaurant, Girl and the Goat. We came from Saturday breakfast as a walk in and despite the chaos at the hostess stand, we didn't wait long to get seated. The food was good, but it's not what I was looking for. Breakfast, especially, weekend breakfast should be filling, savory and decadent. There wasn't anything wrong with our meals (3 Little Pigs and Blueberry Pancakes), but it wasn't "breakfast." The flavors were just a bit over the top and a bit too complex for me. Others, I'm sure, would disagree. Different strokes, right? The staff in general seemed disinterested and uninvolved. A great diner is constantly asking if you need more coffee. We aren't asked once. Kinda strange. Overall, Little Goat was fine, but nothing exceptional.
