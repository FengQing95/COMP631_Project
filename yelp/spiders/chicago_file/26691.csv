Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chicago, chicago! I've always wondered what a deep dish pizza tasted like, and Lou did not disappoint. As a first time visitor from Atlanta, I found a ton of different options for deep dish pizza while researching food places for the trip, and I decided on Lou Malnatis mostly due to its location in the heart of tourist central (sorry in advance to all the delicious hole-in-the-wall pizza restaurants that I'm most definitely missing out on) and closeness to the subway line we were looking to take after dinner.
