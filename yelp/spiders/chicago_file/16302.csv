Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You could strip each layer of the pizza and you'd unveil the craftsmanship behind the pie. The cheese is in-between the bottom layers of dough, the sausage seems to be one huge slice instead of those balls of "sausage" that's usually sprinkled on top and the sauce--non-existent. Instead you get real pieces of stewed tomatoes. Oh yes, it's heavenly. That crust is proof that butter works wonders. I couldn't get enough of the crispy, flakey buttery crust that seriously could been the entire pizza and I would have been happy.
