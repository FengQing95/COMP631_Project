Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had ordered a dozen oysters, they had 4 kinds & we tried 3. We ordered the truffle Mac & Cheese, Brussel Sprouts, 1/2 pound of chilled King Crab Legs, Dry Aged Bone in NY Strip & lastly the Chocolate Cream Pie. All we're soooo delicious, we don't usually take pics of our food, only videos so I'll attach the best screen shots of the videos.
