Little Goat Diner////Breakfast. Lunch. BRUNCH?! Oh, and dinner too. There is no shortage of meal times for the hungry seeker looking to enjoy some great dining outside of the elusive restaurant across the street. My friends and I had a 5 minute wait for a Sunday evening meal around 18:00. We took on the Pokemon Go gym that occupies the space, and before you know it, we were seated.
