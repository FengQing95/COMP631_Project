Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Want some Chicago deep dish? This is the place. Some say it's the original, or one of them. GOOD for sure. And they've got the wait system down to a tee: order your pizza so the kitchen can assemble it while you wait for your table. Their signature salad -- like their signature pizza -- is just plain ridiculous delicious. The pizza also has a buttery crust, light yet deep. Yum!
