Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had the bone marrow as an appetizer which was divine. My husband had the rib eye and eye had the short rib stroganoff. Both were delicious. I ate the leftover stroganoff cold the next day and it was even better. We shared sides of the elote corn, and wild mushrooms. Both were very good. I actually preferred the mushrooms over the corn. My only negative comment is everything was overpriced. I get that it's a city steakhouse, but I know how much corn and mushrooms cost and $14-15 for sides is high. This is worth it if you have the $200 to spend!
