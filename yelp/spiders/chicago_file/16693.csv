Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friend and I meet up here often enough and we always share an order of cheddar cubes and then we both get the express lunch, which is an individual pizza, salad or soup, and a soft drink. I believe it's $7.25, so even with the cheddar cubes, all told, it's a cheap-ass lunch for the quality as well as the quantity of food you get.
