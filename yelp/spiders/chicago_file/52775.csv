Smoque BBQ////Eating in is sort of a pain, the dining room is tiny.  And takeout is rough because its in a totally weird location, so your food is cold when you get home.  And like all good bbq, it ain't cheap.  Its great food though, and honestly, I think bbq is a food that should be eaten elbow-to-elbow with your fellow diners!
