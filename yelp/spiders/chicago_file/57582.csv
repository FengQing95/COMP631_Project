Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////- citrus French toast with goat cheese butter: I liked this dish but the table was divided on it. It is not very sweet and tastes very much like goat cheese, so if you are not into that maybe avoid it Â  Served with fresh fruit and a good choice if you don't like your French toast too sweet.
