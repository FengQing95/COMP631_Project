The Purple Pig////chorizo, capocollo, and an Italian style prosciutto. The board came with baked pita crackers, an apple puree, cranberry jam, and a nut and honey mixture that tasted just like baklava. Each of the cheese had amazing flavors that truly amazed me. The cured meats paired nicely with the cheese and presented unique flavors of their own. Additionally, each of the spreads paired nicely with the meats and cheeses but I choose to mostly enjoy them between cheeses to cleanse the palette.
