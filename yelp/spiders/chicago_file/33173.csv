Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Cool space, solid food, awful service...and I do mean awful.  The servers should worry less about being a hipster and more about remembering the correct order, bringing the wine in a timely fashion, and providing a general level of acceptable service given the price point.  Went back for a second time in hopes my first experience was just an outlier...never again... unless they start doing delivery.  Not winning.
