Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came for dinner on thursday for my mom's 50th and had a good dining experience. I recently came back from Spain and really had high expectations for the tapas and sangria. The cava sangria was AWESOME, I probably could have finished an entire pitcher. The pitchers are pricey and small so we had 1 glass between three of us, but we could have gotten one more glass out of it. Â The menu is pretty extensive and the food was good. They have a full bar and if your reservation is at 7p don't expect to be seated a minute before that.
