Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I suggest ordering an appetizer while waiting for your deep dish because it takes about 30-40 mins until the pizza is ready. It was fine with us since we had time to digest the stuffed bread. The pizza was cheesy, and filled with fresh ingredients you can taste. It was the most wonderful deep dish I had. If I remember correctly, the small came with six slices, I had two and I was stuffed. I made hubby ate the rest. We couldn't even fit dessert. If you know us, you know we always have room for dessert but not after the great tasting pizza.
