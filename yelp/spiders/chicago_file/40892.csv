Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is how crowded it is ALL THE TIME.  I live very close to here and try to come in often, but the wait is usually almost an hour for a table for two.  Try the bar, if you're not picky about your seating it is a lot faster.  Brunch is great and will probably be a little more reasonably priced and they also serve the full tapas menu.  In the evening, plan to spend a decent amount but I think it is worth it.  This is more of a place for a group or a party than a romantic date, but tapas is almost always like that.  Plenty of drinks, service is ok although I've noticed it being a little slow.  The food is great, one of my favorites are the spicy potatos but there are plenty of other good choices.  Don't try driving, you'll get fed up and end up paying for valet. The Armitage Brown and Purple line stop is nearby, and even North and Clybourne and/or Fullerton on the Red Line is not too far.
