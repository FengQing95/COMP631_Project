The Purple Pig////Our server was friendly and I liked him however I ordered three small plates and he completely forgot one of mine. In the end, it never came but he was apologetic for forgetting to put it in but I was looking forward to that dish the most. Even with my two plates that I ordered though it was more than enough for me and I ended up taking more than half of each plate home.
