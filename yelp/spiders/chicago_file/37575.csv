Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////3 stars. Great customer service, beautiful ambience. Sourdough bread was on point. However... bought the fried chicken entree. The entire dish was way too salty! Only managed to eat one piece of chicken and half of the mashed potato. I'd go again for the drinks maybe but the party I was with also felt the same re the salt. Was a good afternoon though!
