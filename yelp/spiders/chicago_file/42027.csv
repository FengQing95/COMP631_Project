Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Seared Spanish Sausages- my favorite tapa we got, hands down.  You get 4 different kinds of sausages and each are delicious and unique.  It comes with a dipping sauce which, at the risk of sounding like a pretentious foodie, basically tasted like mayo.  But no worries, sausage needs no dipping sauce in my world!  Even taking into consideration my intense love for sausages of any kind (from bratwurst to chorizo and back), this plate pleased my non-sausage obsessed dinner mates just as much.
