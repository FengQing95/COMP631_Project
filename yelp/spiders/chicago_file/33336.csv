Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Absolutely recommend it! The interior is amazing, wood and leathers and mirrors, very cosy and old school, it makes you feel you are in a speakeasy in Chicago in the 40s. Waitstaff are super gentle and accommodating: we managed to get a table within just 20 minutes even without reservation (although that is definitely suggested). Both the food and the wine are incredible as well. I was in town for just a couple of days and it was a bit difficult to find a non touristy spot in the area I was staying (around the Loop). This place is just a real gem.
