Smoque BBQ////Don't believe me ... ask my friends and co-workers.  I introduced some co-workers and it now has a cult following in the office.  It's a special treat!  We will send 2 people out to retrieve the orders as it takes about 20 mins. each way.  We had to limit how many people we ask otherwise we are bringing boxes of food back. One of the managers brings it in as a special thank you for teams working on special projects.  I take my out of town guest here and every time they return, they insist that we go to Smoque.  I'm starting to think they come for Smoque more so than to visit me.  The staff is wonderful!  The parking situation isn't the greatest but if you are anywhere near the L, take the blue line, the Irving Park stop is very close.  A short walk about a block away.  Yes, the lines can be long at times but I have never been disappointed.  It is definitely worth the wait!! My favorite BBQ place ever!
