Smoque BBQ////Tender, juicy, and flavorful while surprisingly not overfilling typically from what you get with most PP sandwiches.  On its own its flavorful, but I do love BBQ sauces, and Smoque has their own brand that has flavor.  A great atmosphere, a great casual date night that's close by my house.
