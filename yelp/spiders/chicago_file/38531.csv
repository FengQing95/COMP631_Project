Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Since it was my birthday, I made sure all of my favorites were present. The crab and avocado salad to start, the filet and the elotes corn for dinner and a slice of the chocolate cream pie for dessert. Our server Joel was on point for the entire meal and I could not have had a better birthday dinner.
