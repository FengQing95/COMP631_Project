Smoque BBQ////This is by far the best place for BBQ hands down. We drive over an hour one way just to eat here. Mid afternoon is the best time that we have experienced. Everything is fabulous. We had pulled pork, ribs, brisket and all of the sides. We were just saying that Smoque is better then most places in the country that we have been to.
