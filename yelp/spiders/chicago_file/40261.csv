Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I finally made it to Bavette's for dinner. I sat at the bar and started with a Bavette's punch. It had just the right amount of citrus and sweetness. The sourdough bread and butter is perfection and the shrimp cocktail display is impressive. I tried the short rib stroganoff for dinner. Sadly, I did not love it. The flavor just wasn't for me. I did not want a box so I think they picked up on that and comped the carrot cake I ordered. I unfortunately did not love this either, as it is heavily spiced in both the cake and the frosting. The decor and service is 5 stars. I got there right when they opened and it took about an hour for the bar to fill up so I would get there early if you missed the chance at a reservation. I would definitely stop in again to try some other things.
