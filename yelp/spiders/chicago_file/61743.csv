Smoque BBQ////The mac and cheese firstly, was to die for. I wish I had a bigger one. The brisket was so tender and flavorful, I highly recommend getting it sliced and not chopped (it stays more moist). I tried both ribs and liked the baby back ones the best. One more thing-- as suggested by the name, the meat is SMOKY. The smoky flavor is what makes it but it can be a bit overpowering as well. Be prepared!
