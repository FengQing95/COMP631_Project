Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This was my first steakhouse since moving to Chicago I was not disappointed at all. The 10 oz. sirloin was tender and cooked to perfection and friends who got the cheeseburger were still talking about it the next day highly recommended. Great variety of seafood and choice steaks for everyone.
