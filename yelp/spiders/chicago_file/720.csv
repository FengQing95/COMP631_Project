Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The reviews didn't fail us. The rutherford omelet was amazing.  Had to try a side of the mixed berry pancakes and I can see why it's their specialty.  Eggs Benedict looked amazing but lacked flavor. Stuffed and it was worth it. 45 minute wait to be seated 10 minute wait for food. Fast service and delicious coffee barista
