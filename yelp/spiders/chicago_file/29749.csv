Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Spinach Salad, $9.25 prior to tax- I asked for the dressing (balsamic dressing) to be on the side, which is how it came. This salad was a good size for 2 people to share and came with thinly sliced pears (added a nice sweet taste), some crumbled goat cheese and sliced red onions. I thought this salad was good, but would have preferred grilled onions.
