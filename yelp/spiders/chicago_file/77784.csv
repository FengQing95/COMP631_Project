Little Goat Diner////The Girl and the Goat has been on my list of restaurants to check out ever since I started my current job a few years ago, which allows me to be in Chicago at least once a month. A combination of the timing of my trips and no reservations available has been the major roadblock in me not dining at the Girl and the Goat yet. Fast forward to a few years later, and I managed to stumble upon Stephanie Izard's Little Goat Diner.
