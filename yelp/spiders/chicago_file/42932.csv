Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The one downside I have, is I feel like I spent a lot of money and did not get a ton of food.  This might be a matter of perception because I never ate a ton of one thing, but I am just throwing it out there.  Overall, it was a great experience and I will definitely be dining here again.
