Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Much like what you would expect from a chain restaurant. The hostess calling reservations over an intercom makes you feel like your at Applebees. A few people in our party compared the chorizo and chx skewer Â to a hot dog from 7-11. Good spot for tourists, but there are MUCH better local restaurants in Chicago.
