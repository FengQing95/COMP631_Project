Smoque BBQ////I would have to submit this place as one of the most white washed places I've been to in a while. It felt really suburban.  On top of that, we had to listen to two guys next to us use the phrase "amazing" at least half a dozen times.  Really, amazing?  They must not eat out much.  If you live nearby, go, and take the food to go.  Otherwise, eat at a place closer to home. Or grill some meat yourself.
