Little Goat Diner////Service: The service was pretty bad. We were sitting on the stools and watched the food pop out. However, it took 20 mins to have someone notice us. All the waitresses were so focused on their tables they forgot about us! Eventually we had to flag someone down to take our order and she passed us along to someone else. She was prompt enough getting our drinks, but the food took longer. Since we had the view, we saw our food sitting through the food window for a while. All she had to do was literally pick up the food turn around and place it in front of us. She must have decided since we weren't a table it wasn't worth her time.
