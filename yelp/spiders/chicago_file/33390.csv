Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The disappointing part of the dinner was the bone in ribeye.  I read about all the good reviews (I believe on Eater Chicago?; someone on Yelp also posted and mentioned this was the best ribeye he/she had ever had) and I may be missing something, but I didn't like the dry aged bone in ribeye.  Why?  One edge of the ribeye was all fat.  I understand that ribeyes are supposed to be fatty (gives the steak flavor) but one edge of the steak was all fat (one inch thick).  The steak was cooked fine but when I sliced through the steak I had trouble cutting it because of tendons.  I kept on cutting using the knife and I wasnt able to cut through one tendon.  It was just disgusting.  Then having to eat it is a whole different story.  I have had ribeyes before and I've never had this experience.
