Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Stopped by here because pizza pot pie was too long of a wait and we weren't disappointed!  Place is large so no wait at 300PM and we ordered the meat/cheese platter which my husband loved.  I had the garlic shrimp which was delicious and not enough.  The gazpacho was also a little heavy on olive oil and had a slightly bitter taste (likely from cucumbers).  The flan dessert was awesome tho and can't complain about sangria!  I'd recommend this tapas restaurant.
