The Purple Pig////Unbelievable experience! I didn't know much about this place before arriving in Chicago, other than it was highly rated... then to find out how popular this place apparently is and that it is a Jimmy Bannos, Jr. restaurant. Tucked away in an office building on the Magnificent Mile, this venue promotes "Cheese, Swine & Wine". Although we had no wine from their grand selection, there were wine pairings with almost every item on the menu.  The exotic menu, itself, was a good size, neither too large nor too small.  Having already looked at the menu prior to arriving, I was intrigued and excited about trying out certain items. I was not once disappointed. In fact, It was amazing from beginning to end.
