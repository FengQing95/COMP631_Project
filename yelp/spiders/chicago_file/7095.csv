Art Institute of Chicago////I'm surprised that there is anyone that would give this museum less than 5 stars.  The Art Institute does a great job of displaying it's world class collection.  It does not have as large a collection as many well known international museums.  However, you won't find as many "lesser" works here.   If you've studied art history at all, many of the famous paintings you studied are hanging in Chicago.  If they don't belong to the Art Institute, they often come through in the fabulous shows.  There are amazing colletions in Detroit, Cleveland, and Milwaukee too.  If you've visited many museums in other countries, you'll be surprised to find that even our smaller cities' museums have better quality art.  Yeah for the New World!
