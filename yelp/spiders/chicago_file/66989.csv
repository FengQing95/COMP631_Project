Little Goat Diner////Hands down the best food I had in Chicago. Came from the suggestion of a local and I am so glad I went. There was an hour wait but it was worth the wait! There is a cute coffee bar attached where you can wait. I had the fried pickle sandwich and it was nothing short of amazing and also unique. My friend had the waffle which was also amazing. No one had any complaints about the food or service. Definitely go here.
