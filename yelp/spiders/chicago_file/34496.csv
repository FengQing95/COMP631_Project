Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We shared the goat cheese appetizer. It was good, but forgettable. Eat the bread and the butter on the table instead. I promise. This butter will make you want to take the little dish, slide it under the table, and occasionally eat it all by itself when no one is looking. Ya know, if you are into butter, and sly about being gross about it, like me. SO GOOD.
