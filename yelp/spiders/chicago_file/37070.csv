Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Like I said many places do great steaks. I personally like mine rare, sometimes cold cut center, purple insides even, but the true testament of a steakhouse is the sides. That is how you separate. The steaks here are a tad cheaper than other places, but they make up for it on pricey, but high quality sides. $8 for pommes frites?, $10 loaded baked potato? Yeah the few bucks you save on a steak go out the window here. I chose the buttery mashed potatoes, obviously they used a ricer, but they were forgettable, creamed spinach and elote style corn. The corn is very much styled, but not very elote to me. They went too far out their comfort zone here, European Mexican side, not really. Creamed spinach is world class though, as was the mac & cheese which was I think mean to be split, I found this out as I was getting very full. Bone marrow really prepped me for the meats and use a very large piece the kind you can't find back in California. I'm very classic with my steak and got everything on the side, but from time to time like au poivre and was happy to see sauce diane offered. I went with The Chicago cut Ribeye, amazing, as expected, thick, juicy, strong beef funk.
