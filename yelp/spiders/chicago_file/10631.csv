Art Institute of Chicago////There is a reason the Art Institute shines bright with 5 star reviews and TripAdvisor ranks this museum #1 in the world. Simple. The artwork here is jaw dropping, awe inspiring, a site to behold. Prepare to be wowed. The Impressionism wing simply can't be missed. It's full of famous works by Monet, Degas, Renoir, Van Gogh, Seurat, and Lautrec Â (just to name a few). Plan to spend some time in the Modern Wing. Even if Contemporary Art isn't your thing you will appreciate the views of the Chicago city line. You can even take a moment to enjoy a very well made cappuccino, homemade soup, or scone in the coffee bar overlooking the Modern Wing. Great place to leave dad or other non art enthusiast. Just a thought.
