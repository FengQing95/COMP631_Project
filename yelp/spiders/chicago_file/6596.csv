The Purple Pig////What can I say that hasn't already been stated about THE Purple Pig.  The meal was absolutely outstanding. We got lucky enough during the evening rush to walk in and grab two bar seats.  The bartenders were attentive and made us several outstanding cocktails.  The whole meal was outstanding, from the pork to the whipped feta (best I have had) but the beets.  I can't say enough about the beet dish which I only ordered because half the bar had them, so they had to be great. They were a perfect dish, and honestly, I could have just eaten that as my meal, but I had to share it with my business partner :(.  Great experience, and I certainly will be back next time I am in town.
