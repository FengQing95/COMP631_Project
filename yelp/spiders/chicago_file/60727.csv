Smoque BBQ////The flavor was excellent. It tasted smokey to me (glad my taste buds aren't burned out). The meat was tender and juicy. I too loved the mac and cheese, had the flavor and feel of a good homemade comfort food. Didn't like the coleslaw, just because it wasn't creamy-but it did taste fresh.
