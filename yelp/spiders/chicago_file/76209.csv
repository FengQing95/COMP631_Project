Little Goat Diner////Our waitress was amazing and recommended the Crispy Shrimp Cocktail. That appetizer had an amazing flavor. For dinner I had the springy shrimp and pork belly, and it was missing something. It was lacking in flavor, and now that I've rechecked the menu I realize it may have been missing the tamarind vinaigrette. The dish disappointed me and it uses the same noodles for sopa de fideo, which has more flavor. For dessert we had the cake do the day, the fudge cake, that was amazing! The layered were filled with cookies! The cocktails we had were ask tasty. The main dish was the only disappointment for the night, but overall I may go one more time to give their main dishes a second chance but to also have that amazing appetizer.
