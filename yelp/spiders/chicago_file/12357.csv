Art Institute of Chicago////Highly, highly recommend! They do a great job laying out the museum. It's a pretty big museum so plan to stay for 3 hours or more if you want to make your way through all the sections without rushing. I always spend whole day here, there are so much to see and learn. It's amazing to come especially in snow or raining days! Great world class art collections. Impressive collection of arts from all over the world, including artworks from Picasso, Van Gogh, Monet, etc. This is a fabulous museum and nice cafe to rest your feet. Also the staff there are very friendly and helpful. It's a must go if you visit in Chicago or even locals. Due to Covid the operation is difference even there is often a line but it goes through very quickly.
