Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////By far the best steakhouse in Chicago. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is perfect. I feel like a lot of Chicago steakhouses go for the classic, traditional vibe and it doesn't give your dining experience much flair. Bavette's is just the opposite. Dim lighting, a bit noisy, mirrors, exposed walls, mismatched plates, wooden tables.... the perfect atmosphere. We had the Chicago cut steak and the bone-in 'Delmonico' strip, elote style corn and creamed spinach. Everything was absolutely on point. Topped off by a bottle of wine that we were able to bring ourselves because its BYOB!!!!! BYOB in river north is a rare thing and should be cherished by all. :) Seriously, I cannot say a bad thing about this place. It is a steak and seafood lovers dream. Thank you for getting it right every time, Bavettes.
