Smoque BBQ////I also would have preferred more variety in BBQ sauce-perhaps a spicy sauce and a sweet Carolina mustard would be great additions. The sides were pretty tasty, though. I thought the mac and cheese was done well. The crunchy topping was delicious. I also preferred the style of coleslaw they serve (more vinegar-y) because I don't like my slaw coated in tons of mayo.
