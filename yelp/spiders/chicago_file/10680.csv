Art Institute of Chicago////Favorite part about being a Chicagoan is my access to this museum. I can spend hours here and always find something new to fall in love with. It's a place that can help fill me deal with whatever is on my mind that day. Hard to choose a favorite part but I am looking forward to continuing my visits
