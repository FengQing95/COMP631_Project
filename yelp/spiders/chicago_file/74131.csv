Little Goat Diner////Which are all very valid points but what's insulting is how this was his initial response. So I suggesed if he can just bring me a more well done egg to the table and for this he agreed right away. So why the fuss when that could've just been suggested by him to begin with? I don't expect every waiter to empathize with their pregnant customers, but not insulting the chef's ego cause I wanted my egg more well done for the safety of my unborn child was a bigger priority for him in this case. He could've just easily solved my dilemma by suggesting bringing a more cooked egg to the table, but he found it necessary to mouth off to a paying customer.
