Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place!  Whenever I have a few days in Chicago I always try and arrange a visit to this restaurant.  You can be dressed in a suit or in jeans, it doesn't matter.  All are welcome and comfortable at this melting pot environment. Tapas choices are many and the food is excellent.  Prices are reasonable and even though they are "small plates" I always leave here feeling stuffed!
