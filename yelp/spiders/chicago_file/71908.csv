Little Goat Diner////I heard about Little Goat from the chef at our cooking class and was eager to try it. I asked the waiter for help deciding, because I saw too many good things to easily pick one. It's a modern menu, so there's stuff you won't get elsewhere and the kind of decor that makes you want to redo your living room. A lot of people very much respect the chef.
