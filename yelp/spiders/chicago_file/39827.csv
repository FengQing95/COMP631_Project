Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Truffle Mac n Cheese - this was baked on top, but also had a creamy white cheddar base.  The pasta was perfectly al dente, which sometimes hard to do with baked pasta.  The black truffle was pretty subtle, but just the hint of it gave it a slight earthy flavor.  I happily ate every bite of this large side.  5 stars
