Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////With the hype, I expected this place to be great.  It was ok and it was no where near Giordanos or Leona's pizza.  Price wasn't bad, delivery was fast, guy on the phone was great.  Pizza is just ok, didn't love it like I thought I would.  I would eat it if it was there but I wouldn't go out of my way to order it again for myself.
