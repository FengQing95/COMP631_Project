Smoque BBQ////We went on a Tuesday night, and the line was out the door.  Expect to wait at least 15 minutes in line.  They purposely slow down the ordering process because there aren't many tables in the place, and they have to manage the food flow against the seating.  You order, wait for your food, and hopefully get a seat before your food arrives.  Whoever said getting carry out is right on the money--skip the wait and do carryout.  I will do that next time.  The brisket is very good.  The pulled pork was very good, too.  The french fries are TO DIE FOR.  I thought their BBQ sauce was just okay.  I was bummed they didn't keep bottles of it on the table.  My friend ordered the St. Louis ribs and she thought they were okay--she definitely preferred the brisket over the ribs.  After all, good BBQ is all about slathering on the sauce!  They ration it out in small cups, so if you are a sauce person (like me) ask for extra sauce.  The cole slaw is a vinegar slaw, not a creamy slaw.  I didn't care for it.
