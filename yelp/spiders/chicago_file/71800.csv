Little Goat Diner////Overall, the service was a bit slow. I understand it was lunch, but I had just fainted at my physical, and I was super thirsty, but my waitress only checked on my once after my food came, so I was a bit parched. My total ended up being 26 dollars. While I understand dining out in the city for lunch at a non-franchise place will be pricey, I felt I was charged a bit high. They are doing something right, though, because the place was full the whole time I was there.
