Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here for dinner last night and left very disappointed. Our waitress was super slow with everything. Waited over 15 minutes before she even came by our table say hi and take our drink order. Good was mediocre at best. I've had better Chicago style pizza in SF! Very bland, and Luke warm. We were seated directly underneath an AC vent that was, for some strange reason, blasting cold air while it was barely 40 degrees outside. I asked 4 times to 4 people if they could lower it or turn it off, each one nodded and walked away, never handling the situation.
