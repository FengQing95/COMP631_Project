Smoque BBQ////This place had so much hype on here, so I was super excited to try it. I'm just going to preface by saying I've been to BBQ places in San Antonio, Houston, and Atlanta -- I know it's not easy to find good BBQ places in Chicago in general. This place is OK. I got the pulled pork, mac and cheese, and corn bread. My friend got the brisket and banana pudding. The brisket was a bit bland/tough and the cornbread wasn't sweet. I did like the pulled pork, it super tender and melted in my mouth. Try it with the sauces!! Overall I probably wouldn't come here again, but at least I can say I knocked it off my bucketlist.
