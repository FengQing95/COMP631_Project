Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The friends I went with ordered the roast eggplant salad with goat cheese, and the roast dates with bacon & apple vinaigrette. They said that their order wasn't all that either, not as bad as my tuna, but not all that good either, so it's not just me....for all you lot thinking I'm just crapping on this place! ;p
