Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ate at like 4 PM, so the place was empty.  We sat by the windows in the bar and it was cold as hell.  The server was the bartender and he was kinda meh, and was gone for significant swatches of time.  So whatever, it was between shifts so I figured we would get B- service, no big deal.
