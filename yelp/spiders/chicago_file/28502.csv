Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Oh the great Chi Town deep dish. We grabbed an Uber to come here and luckily were with veterans who knew that you could pre-order your meal. We arrived and put our names in for the wait, which wasnt horrible. They then allow you to also pre-order your meal so that when you are finally seated things come out fairly quickly. This is the secret. While we waited we grabbed some craft beers at the bar and went outside to enjoy them and people watch. They do have limited outdoor seating but during a heatwave, umm no. After a reasonable wait we were seated, ordered drinks and our appetizer of Calamari came right out. It was very tasty but small. My friend ordered the seasonal drink Red white and Lou which I did not taste because I hate cherry, but she loved it. For our pizzas we got a "The Lou" and a plain cheese, both small sized. Our group had 4 people who were starving and even those 2 small pizzas were too much. Id say we had about half left, so order conservatively. The pizza was awesome. Our service was awesome. Yet again a Chi Town staple you must visit.
