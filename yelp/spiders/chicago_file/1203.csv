Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Cute place across from millennium park. And tiramisu pancakes?! Yes, please! Really nice staff.  Been here a few times - both times I was lucky to have less than a 25 min wait.  Solid brunch place but I'm not sure if it is worth a 1 hour wait.  If I came back, wasn't hungry and was with a fun group - then an hour wait might not be too bad.  Definitely will be back - but on random days and times so to avoid the long lines.
