Art Institute of Chicago////The $18 admission fee is a little bit of a downer, but well worth the cost for a one-time visit--even if just for the criminally short two hours I spent there on a whirlwind Chicago visit.  Conveniently, the museum guidebook contains a "what to see if you have only an hour" section featuring 12 works throughout many of the collections.  I left the museum not only impressed by its works of art but also with a renewed desire to see more art and revisit museums I had not been to in a very long time--certainly a testament of success for the mission of the Art Institute of Chicago.
