Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We enjoyed Lou Malnati's, but found the pizza comparable in nearly every respect to that of Pizzeria Uno. It was good, but nothing to write home about. If Lou Malnati's truly is deemed to be among Chicago's best, then we are mystified by the ongoing debate between Chicagoans and New Yorkers regarding who's pizza reigns supreme. I want to make clear that I do not praise New York pizza simply because it's my hometown. I will proudly wave the flag of any pizzeria regardless of the city, state, country, or planet from which it came (see my review of Grimaldi's in Tucson), provided the taste is worthy of such acclaim, but Lou Malnati's simply isn't that good.
