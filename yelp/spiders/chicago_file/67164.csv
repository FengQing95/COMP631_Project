Little Goat Diner////Biscuits and Gravy: Least favorite dish by far. My date and I are huge fans of biscuits and gravy, but we decided to just get a small plate of it to try because the mushroom sauce did not sound appealing.  After trying it, we both agreed that we were glad that we did not choose that as our main plate. It had a very odd flavor.  We asked the server what was the spice in it and she told us masala and cinnamon.  We did not finish even the one biscuit that was served.
