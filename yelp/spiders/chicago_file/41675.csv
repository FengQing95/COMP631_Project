Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here several times and every experience happens to get better.  It could be the company or the increased knowledge of menu.  So, my only advise is to try several things, from different parts of the menu, and make sure to order the sangria.  It might not be the best but it definitely adds to the experience.
