Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered two of these online, and had complaints about how the first one turned out - soggy and strange.  I've never heard of pizza where the cheese is put on the crust first and then the sauce and toppings on top of that.  I'm from the West.  Well, I guess this must be a Chicago thing where pizza's concerned.  Never seen it before.
