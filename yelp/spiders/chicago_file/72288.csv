Little Goat Diner////The best fusion food by chef Stephanie Izard. We came on a Thursday night. The diner was packed, many tables were reserved. So we were told the wait time would be 1-1.5 hours. We saw some people without reservation walked straight to the bakery/bar and it was first come first served. Nice! We immediately got a table at the bar. We ordered: This Little Piggy Went to China, Machos Nachos, and Sloppy Goat. This is our first time coming to Little Goat, our eyes bulged out when we saw the platters they brought out were humongous!! 3 kinds of food could feed 4 people easily. They mistakenly brought out Fish Tostadas, instead of Sloppy Goat. When we told them about it, they said the Fish Tostadas was on the house and would even order the Sloppy Goat for us. We decided not to order it and thankful for the complimentary tostadas. Everything we ordered were just amazing, the flavors were bursting in our mouths. Chef Stephanie really knows how to marry 2 different countries and creates totally new flavors! We will be back! Make sure you come with empty stomach because the portion is huge, but the food is so good!
