Smoque BBQ////I should preface this review by saying that I eat beef and pork very sparingly, so a BBQ place isn't really my thing. That said, I was excited to try the chicken platter at Smoque when I came here for dinner recently with a group of friends. Unfortunately, the chicken did not live up the restaurant's description and was quite possibly the driest chicken I've ever eaten. I ended up eating about a quarter of it and then gave up. The sides, however, were excellent. I loved the cole slaw, cornbread, and mac n' cheese. If I come back, I would probably get all sides and skip the meat altogether.
