Art Institute of Chicago////I try to visit at least once a year to visit my all-time favorite painting: Picasso's "The Old Guitarist," as well as to catch any special exhibits. Most recently it was the Roy Lichtenstein retrospective and previously it was the Henri Cartier Bresson photography exhibit. Another favorite exhibit is the Thorne Miniature Rooms which I have enjoyed since childhood. I never leave here without feeling better about the world.
