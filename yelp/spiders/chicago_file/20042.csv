Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I went there with a bigger group (9 people) on a Sunday afternoon. It was still hopping, but the wait was only 45 minutes and there were plenty of furniture shops to walk around in the area. We did put our orders for pizzas in, per the hostess' suggestion. We got the large Lou and the Chicago Classic. First of all, they say that a large pizza feeds 4 people. Total bullshit. That thing easily feed like 6 people. And not 6 little petite girls that will normally only eat a salad for lunch. Like 6 people that just did a triathlete and then feel like gnawing their hands off as the hunger hits as the endorphin high fades away (and yes, we were actually in town for a triathlon and we race to eat).
