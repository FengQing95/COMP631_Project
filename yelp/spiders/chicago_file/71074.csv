Little Goat Diner////I love the idea of this place but the food to me is mediocre. Perhaps it's the unexpected flavor combinations that I don't really "get." My husband had french toast with fried chicken, everything was great until we discovered there were over-easy eggs inside the french toast. I'm on board with the take on chicken and waffles but why you'd want to introduce egg yolk into that mix was beyond me. I had the cauliflower rice bowl. Good flavors but it needed something starchy to soak up the pickled flavors and kimchi flavor.
