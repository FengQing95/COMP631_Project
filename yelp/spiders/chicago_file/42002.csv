Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been happy with almost every small plate I've had there, however, I do have some favorites. The spicy potatoes are a must and we usually order two. We love the short ribs with the mashed potatoes, the spicy shrimp is great (and the garlicky oil is great for dipping their delicious bread) and the goat cheese marinara is a great starter. Also, make sure you get the short rib stuffed piquillo pepper. It's a perfect bit.
