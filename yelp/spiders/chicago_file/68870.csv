Little Goat Diner////Came here after we were informed of the 2 hour wait at one of the restaurants nearby. They have a bar with full menu service at the back (next to where they bake the bread & behind the coffee bar) that was open seating, so we hung out for a minute and sat at the bar when seats opened up.
