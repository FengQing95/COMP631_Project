Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ordered a pizza to go tonight 11/3. The pizza was supposed to be ready at the 11:40 (I manage a pizza restaurant so I knew to give some time for error). When I got there at 11:55 and they said the pizza was broken so the new one would be ready in 12 minutes and no problem! Ordering a pIzza at midnight, i had nothing but time. When I got back, i had a discount on the pizza and even though closed, the staff was so nice. A+ To the manager on duty (I didn't catch his name) and A++ to his staff! Great experience that could have gone much differently
