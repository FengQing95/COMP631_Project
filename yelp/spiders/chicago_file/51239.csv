Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////YOU GUYSSSS. My god, how have i never wrote a review of this place?! I will make this and sweet that way you can read it quick and call them to reserve a table. I'm not from Chicago but it's my favorite restaurant of all time. There is not one bad thing on the menu. The braised short rib-HOLY CRAP. The sangria-DELICIOUS. The bacon wrapped dates-WONDERFUL. The service is always top notch and if anything is wrong they make it right. To be fair, the food has never ever been bad, it's just the wait sometimes but it's SO worth it.
