Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My compatriot commented that she could come back for two plates of bacon wrapped dates with the bloody mary bar and be completely content. I couldn't agree more. However, if you aren't obsessed with the idea of an afternoon of bacon and alcohol, there are a lot of other fantastic choices to make a trip here worthwhile. Enjoy!
