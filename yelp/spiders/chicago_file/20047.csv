Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were seated IMMEDIATELY. Our server greeted us promptly and brought out drinks quickly. The appetizer (delicious bruschetta) took about 8 minutes, and the pizza (Lou Malnatti's Classic, also delicious) took about 35 minutes, but our server let us know how long it would take in advance and checked on us regularly. The music was lively but not too loud, and the ambience is bright, warm, clean and very relaxing.
