Little Goat Diner////Their burger is excellent, and reminds me of a larger version of an In and Out burger ,and I lived in SoCal for five years, so I'm an authority. I don't think I've eaten something bad. Love the Sloppy Goat. Order a side of the cheesy hash browns, and thank me later. Next door, they have a great little coffee shop attached, and a bakery with fresh baked bread. Try the sour dough.
