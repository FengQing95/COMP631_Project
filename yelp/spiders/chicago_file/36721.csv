Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The seafood here is incredible! I've tried lots of seafood in many cities! This is the best, especially oysters and lobsters! The steaks are wonderfully, too! They are so big, and I can only finish no more than a half! Everything is just too good to forget! I love this place. I will definitely come again for seafood, steak, baked sweet potato, and ice cream!
