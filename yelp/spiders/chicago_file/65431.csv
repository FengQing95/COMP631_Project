Smoque BBQ////Definitely be prepared to wait in line if you are planning to visit during dinner hours, but the line moves fast and food takes roughly 10 to 15 min to come out. Place is small and not good for big parties, but it's got the rustic cozy vibe with simple interior decor. Price is tad expensive compared to other BBQ places... but the quality is congruous with it!
