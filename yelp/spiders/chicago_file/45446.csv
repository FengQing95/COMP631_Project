Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Both were soo delicious, kind of sucked that it was only a one biter. The goat cheese croqueta had an interesting taste for me at first when I first bit into it, but after a few seconds, that when the party officially begins. Deviled egg was standard but with a little bit of spices into it.
