Little Goat Diner////This place is pretty hip and the menu is very unique - goat meat, pork belly milkshakes, smoked fries, peanutbutter waffle. Some of the combinations sound a little crazy but are undoubtedly appetizing. We ordered the smoked fries which I'm pretty sure were fried in goat fat or duck fat. I got the fish tostadas which were mediocre. My friend got peanutbutter banana waffles with a giant dollop of peanut butter butter, pretty delicious and my other friend got the goat burger. We were absolutely stuffed by the end.
