Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Now, onto the food: We ordered a set of oysters, the 42-day dry aged bone-in ribeye, the creamed spinach and mac and cheese sides, and the chocolate cream pie for dessert. This was my first time having dry aged steak, and I am not lying when I say that it is life-changing. I have never had a steak that basically tasted like beef-flavored butter. It needed no seasoning or sauce at all, it was so juicy and tender and flavorful just all on its own! I will say though that the combination of the steak and the sides became quite heavy, and toward the end of the night I felt like I had inflated to twice my size... but it was all for a good cause! (If you can't finish any sides, definitely bring them home! For breakfast today I had scrambled eggs with the leftover creamed spinach mixed in... Mmmmm!)
