Little Goat Diner////We went for lunch.  We had a reservation but waited about 15-20 minutes before we were seated.  From watching the comings and goings I got the distinct impression that a reservation doesn't get you any advantage over a walk in -- they just seat you depending on when you enter the restaurant.
