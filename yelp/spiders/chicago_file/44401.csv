Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is my favorite tapas place, can't believe I didn't write a review sooner! Everything is great, paella is authentic and filled with meats, goat cheese app is the bomb, sangria is flavorful, bacon wrapped dates are my boyfriend's favorite, and if you sign up for their text and mailing list you sometimes get deals! :) This is pretty much a piece of heaven. Go for girl's night out or on a classy date. Or just because you like good food.
