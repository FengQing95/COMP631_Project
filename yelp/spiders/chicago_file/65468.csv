Smoque BBQ////Coming from SoCal, I've had the privilege to try Phil's BBQ. This is what I kept thinking of as I was eating my ribs and I don't think Smoque's surpasses Phil's. However, that doesn't mean that this place isn't worth trying because I do think they serve up some quality ribs here! Not to mention, it's BYOB!
