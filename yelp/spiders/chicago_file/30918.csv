Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's has been my favorite Chicago style pizza for years. I am not a huge fan of deep dish pizza and compared to others I've had, Lou Malnati's deep dish is just the right thickness for my liking. The sauce has great flavor, and I personally love the slight crunch on the crust. I think their prices are fair and their service is excellent. They cut and serve your pizza to you by the slice, and package up any leftovers you want to take home for you, too. I'll be dreaming of the next time I get to eat at the iconic Chicago pizzeria!
