Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We did make reservations and were very glad we did. The place was jam packed with people. We were greeted immediately and told our table would be ready in 20 minutes. The nice thing is they provide menus and ask that you place your order before your table is ready.  We did so and then hung out at the bar.  We were seated earlier than the 20 minutes.
