Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Well, from all the great reviews I expected to have a great meal. Sounds like we had the one out of one-hundred duds! Everything we ordered was great, except the star attraction...our $38 petite filet! It was gristly and chewy...I actually chewed a few pieces 5 or 6 times and then deposited the rubbery remains on my plate. As I said, most of you never had this experience.. Why did both my wife and I have it??? I am not one to complain in the restaurant (maybe I should), I just don't go back. A $38 cut of meat should melt in your mouth...a cut from Jewel would have been better...they wouldn't have given us two old folks, who have not been here before, and maybe aren't likely to come back 2 bad cuts of meat on purpose, would they??? I don't think so, BUT?? Sorry, but this is what we experienced...hope it is a very rare exception, as many reviews seem to attest...how could both filets have been this bad??? Â
