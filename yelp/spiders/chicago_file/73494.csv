Little Goat Diner////Love this place! Came to Chicago on a family reunion trip and they highly recommended this place. It was totally worth it. We went there on Monday so we can avoid the long line. I tried the little piggy went to China. The biscuit is absolutely delicious! Highly recommended! I cant remember what was the name of the other sandwich my brother got, it was on their special menu but it was tasty too! Definitely gonna come back if we are revisiting Chicago!
