Little Goat Diner////Went here for dinner and had the Korean Burger and a side of fries. The portion of fries was huge - easily enough for two or three people. The Korean Burger was on point. The burger packed a punch of flavor! However, it is a messy eat - the kimchi and the egg sort of drip and get everywhere. So, if you are out on a date hoping to look good, you might want to get something a little more contained than this burger!
