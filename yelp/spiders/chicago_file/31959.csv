Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Always great. Visited this location on the way taking my daughter back home to Chicago. We all wanted Deep Dish Chicago Pizza and she found this location online. Worked great. Very small location but we ate outside since it was a really nice day. Everything was great. Server was friendly and was there whenever we needed her, the food was, as always, amazing, and we had a great time chatting and watching the people go by. Just a really terrific casual lunch. HIGHLY recommended.
