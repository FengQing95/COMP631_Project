Little Goat Diner////However, the busers are WAY too aggressive. One review below mentions asking if a plate could be 'taken out of [her] way' while she still had a forkful of it mid-air -- and we had the same experience. An unfinished bowl of the smoked fries was whisked away along with other empty plates, for example; and the busers came more and more frequently and insistently the more we sat there -- so we felt guilty lingering and trying to catch up with our good friend, which is not the kind of restaurant I want to eat at. I totally understand they have to turn tables, but as far as I'm concerned, just be upfront and say you have people waiting, instead of playing good cop (server) bad cop (bussers) passive-aggressively.
