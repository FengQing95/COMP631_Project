Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Excellent dining experience. Service from Joel was spot on and I greatly appreciated the GF knowledge. Loved the ambiance and the food was delicious. We had the goat cheese appetizer, petit fillet, mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts. All perfectly prepared. A wonderful welcome to Chicago.
