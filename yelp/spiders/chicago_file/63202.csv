Smoque BBQ////Smoque has been at the top of my eatin' to-do list for a long time. My wife finally took me there last night for my birthday dinner. I'll spare you all kinds of flowery language and just say it plain: Smoque is -- by far and without question -- the best barbecue I've ever had. I've had BBQ in all kinds of places, and nothing comes close. This is the real friggin' deal. And BYOB to boot (indoors, not on the patio).
