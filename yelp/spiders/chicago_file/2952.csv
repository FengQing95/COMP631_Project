The Purple Pig////Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes and Puffed Farro: you get a large cut of the pork shoulder on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes. The pork shoulder was tender and the glaze that covered the pork shoulder was well seasoned and balanced. I wanted to savor each bite, but couldn't help but eat quickly. Probably one of my favorite dishes out of all the restaurants I've tried in Chicago.
