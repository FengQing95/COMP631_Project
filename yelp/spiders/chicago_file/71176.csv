Little Goat Diner////The Brandade and Belly and the Parathas Burrito are a couple of my favorite breakfasts they serve. Their menu is enormous, as any "diner" menu should be, and there's a wide range of extra sides, drinks/juices/coffees to quench any appetite. There's lots to choose from and everything so far has been good. Believe the hype. I'm a big fan.
