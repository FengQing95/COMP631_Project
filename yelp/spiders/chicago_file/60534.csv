Smoque BBQ////Wow!  What a great place to go for a good old-fashioned brisket sandwich, I ordered mine sliced, not chopped.  Next time I'll have to order the platter.  I'm not an expert, but I know good BBQ, and I haven't had brisket like this since I went to Texas a few years ago.  It's moist, smokey and literally melts in your mouth!  No wonder there's always a line!!
