Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////While I did enjoy the pizza, I've actually had better in the Tampa Bay area, at Paul's Chicago Pizza. The crust at Lou Malnati's was a bit different than what I expected - it was actually a little bit hardened. I didn't think it was a bad thing, but just not what I imagined it would be. But the primary reason I prefer Paul's in Clearwater is because it's just absolutely swamped with cheese, where Lou Malnati's had plenty of cheese, but it just wasn't quite the level of Paul's.
