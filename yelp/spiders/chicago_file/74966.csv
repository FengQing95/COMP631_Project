Little Goat Diner////--- I don't know where to begin. And that's exactly how you'll feel when the server drops this on your table. This is one of those classic burgers that literally stand 12 inches tall because there's just so many random things within. What I could remember was two huge buns, a goat patty, another meat, chicken, fried onion rings, mini onion rings, and some other stuff. It was big, and I definitely had it for lunch the next day.
