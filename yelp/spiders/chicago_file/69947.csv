Little Goat Diner////Went here for lunch on a Sunday. They told us the wait was going to be 45 minutes and we were seated within 30. My order got mixed up but it was just as much my fault as the waitress's because I fumbled the name of what I wanted and got something Â different with similar ingredients. Our waitress was extremely apologetic, immediately brought me what I had intended to order and didn't charge us for the meal. The service was fast and friendly and the food was great. Have also been there for a wedding event I had another great experience. I would definitely recommend this place!
