Art Institute of Chicago////This visit consisted of viewing the Andy Warhol - FROM A TO B AND BACK AGAIN exhibit. It was truly amazing to me to stand in front of his works ranging from self portraits, celebrities to his later works. This is a must see exhibit and would highly recommend a visit to understand the complex Warhol life and take in his works.
