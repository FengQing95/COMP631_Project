Smoque BBQ////The real kicker was when my plate of ribs came out, they apologized for the half slab turning out a little small. Â I hadn't said a word or complained, or even noticed for that matter, but they gave me a whole new half slab for free. I ended up with a whole slab of yummy ribs, and everyone I was with was stunned at the service.
