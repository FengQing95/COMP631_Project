Little Goat Diner////Without a doubt, one of the BEST lunches I have ever had. This is not purely about hype. These people know how to cook & prove that with every bite. Even my picky three-year-old loved it. I live in Michigan, but frequently visit Chicago. I will definitely visit every time I'm in town. Do NOT miss this place. Can't find parking? Valet it. You won't regret it.
