Little Goat Diner////I would also like to thank Mark, the GM. Without him, none of this would've even been possible. I was in contact with Mark from the very start by email and he arranged for the entire evening including the tour of the bakery, a table being set aside from us, and the pastry department baking Taylor a special "Happy Birthday" cake.
