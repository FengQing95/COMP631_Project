Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came here on Friday around 4:30pm and had no wait bc we were early. We got half cheese half half Chicago Classic(sausage). It took 1 hr to come out once we ordered. The butter crust - amazing. Cheese - super cheesy and gooey without being too much. The sausage was a whole entire thin layer on top so every bite had sausage. The tomato sauce - so flavorful, not a strong tomato taste.
