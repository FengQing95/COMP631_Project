Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For our tapas, we ordered the shrimp with garlic, olive oil, and red pepper flakes (#44), very delicious. We also ordered the calamari (#45), which is some of the best calamari I've ever had. It wasn't too greasy, making you feel too full. Â We also ordered the grilled salmon with herb almond pesto (#47), also very tasty. We also ordered the spicy potatoes with tomato aioli (#30) which I loved! The sauce that came with this one was to die for. We also ordered the rioja-braised short ribs with mashed potatoes (#51) Oh my goodness, the meat was so tender that it melted in your mouth. The mashed potatoes appeared bland but were jam-packed with flavor! We also ordered the spinach and manchego-stuffed mushrooms (#31), which I liked even though I don't like mushrooms. Lastly we ordered the paella with shrimp, scallops, green beans, and cherry tomatoes -- yum!
