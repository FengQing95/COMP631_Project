Smoque BBQ////but my buddy's baby back ribs and sauce: muy rico!!!! the lady said they used a Memphis-style sauce that had just a hint of spices that really hit spot and the meat was fantastic. I like the fact that the ribs had simultaneously a slight crispy outside and fall-off-the-bone quality Â inside. it was wonderful, even without the sauce.
