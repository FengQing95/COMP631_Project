Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Back to the experience, our journey started with a quick 30 minute wait (worth it), we were seated and the waiter proceeded to take the rest of our order. To make our mothers proud, we ordered a Caesar salad for some veggies. It was pretty good. Not the best and far from the worst. I'd say 8.1-8.3 on a 10 scale.
