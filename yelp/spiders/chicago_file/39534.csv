Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I was in town for a night and looking for a steakhouse to try. I saw good reviews + their very attractive looking food so I decided to go there without a reservation. I was there on Sunday night so it was a little slower. I got a seat at the bar and really enjoyed everything from the atmosphere, bartenders, drinks, food, and even people who sat to me visiting from out of town. Drinks are well made. My toasted bone marrow and 22 oz. dried-age ribeye is soooo tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned. I gotta say this is the best steak I have had in my life ... I know I may have said this more than once about steak somewhere else but you don't stop eating lol...hopefully when I return to Chicago, they will keep the quality the way it is now.
