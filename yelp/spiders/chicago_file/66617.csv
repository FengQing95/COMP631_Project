Little Goat Diner////And A Word on Prices - brace yourself price-refuseniks...Little Goat's fresh baked goods are CHEAP, the opposite of pricey...this quality of merch at these prices is simply amazing. The scones were 2 dollars apiece. I got three. My beloved Ginger scone, from the 'other place' costs 5.99 (and that's not a knock) but...damn again, appreciate that.
