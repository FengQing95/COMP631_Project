Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My faves are the spicy potatoes with tomato aioli (super spicy!), the goat cheese in tomato, the garlic potato salad (garlic lover's heaven) and the serrano ham and tomato bread.  I also really enjoy the white and peach sangrias.  And really, I've never tried anything that I haven't liked here, so you can't really go wrong.
