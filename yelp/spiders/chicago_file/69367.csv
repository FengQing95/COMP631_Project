Little Goat Diner////Oh man, I got to visit Little Goat Bread on opening day and the soup and sandwich combo I had was outstanding! Great job Little Goat! The roast beef was so rare and perfectly portioned. Combined with the kimchi, it was addictive. I can't wait to try it again and also check out the shrimp sandwich, which I hear is awesome. The tomato apple soup was also hearty and delish.
