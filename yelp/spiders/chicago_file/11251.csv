Art Institute of Chicago////I love the layout of Chicago's downtown. The Art Institute is in Grant Park just next to the Â Crown Fountain. An impressive museum that is large but the layout made it less overwhelming than NYC MET though AIC is only second in size to the MET. Though I did manage to miss American Gothic and much of the American Wing....yes, how embarrassing but next time.
