Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm not a huge pizza person (don't eviscerate me), but I'm already yearning my return to Lou Malnati's. This place gets packed, so get there early. There's a line to put down your name, and another to preorder your pizza (nothing else, the rest you order at your table). It's quite an efficient system, and they text you a link that updates what position you are in line.
