Smoque BBQ////Wow, these are probably the best texture ribs I've ever had .I've had meat slide off the bone baby back ribs before, but there was something about these that were different. They didn't slide off like baby backs, but they broke apart as you chewed them off. They had a decent smoky flavor, but it's the texture that gives it high marks.
