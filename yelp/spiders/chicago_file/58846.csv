Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ba-Ba-Reeba was the fan favorite of our Chicago trip! The interior has fun d√©cor and many tables, but I would still recommend making reservations for busy dinner times. The star of the show was the Seafood Paella, and I think it's the best paella I've had outside of Spain! The crackling texture of the rice was absolutely phenomenal. If you do want a nice picture of the paella, make sure to quickly snap one before they scoop it out the pan to serve.
