Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!//// I ate here for a private party in which they gave us dish after dish after dish. Nearly all the dishes were simply amazing. There were a few misses but I believe that that is just an inevitability when you eat 10 dishes. The truth is I will never forget this dining experience ever. One of the most amazing things to do here is watch the amazing wait staff zing around with huge trays of food darting between the narrow passages between the tables with a finesse that few could ever actually achieve.
