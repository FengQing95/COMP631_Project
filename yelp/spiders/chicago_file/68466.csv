Little Goat Diner////Ate here for the first time today after admiring the menu for months. Got there around one-ish had a 20 min wait. They have a texting service that can text message you when your table is ready. I liked this option ,that ways don't have to carry one of those awkward flashy,vibrating " hey your table is ready" things.
