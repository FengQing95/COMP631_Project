Art Institute of Chicago////This is l'creme de l'creme of art museums. It is on par with the National Museum of Art in Wasnington DC or the Met. There is something for everyone here whether you like modern art, classical artwork or in between. The building structure itself reflects the diversity of artwork as the gallery ambience matches the type of art being showcased.
