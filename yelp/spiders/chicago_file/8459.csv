Art Institute of Chicago////You can easily spend an hour in this beautiful museum and barely cover 3%.  If you really want the full experience, make a weekend of it.  Impeccably curated collection.  One of my favorite museums in the country.  Beware of the patrons who are only there to take pictures alongside EVERY piece in the museum.
