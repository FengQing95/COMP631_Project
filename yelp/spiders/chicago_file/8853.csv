Art Institute of Chicago////The art is lame, and the employees are all rude. They had a sculpture sitting out right in front of my face, so I gave it a slight tap, and got screamed. Maybe next time, these "employees" will put up a "please don't touch the art " sign. I also got yelled at for resting my head on a large bench, and told to sit up.
