Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was never a fan of deep dish pizza, I didn't really like Zachary's in Berkeley, and the first time I tired deep dish in Chicago, I didn't enjoy it much either. We were with some local Chicago friends, and they suggested Manalti's as the best deep dish pizza in Chicago for the buttery crust, so we decided to go. Right when we got seated, I realized that I've been here before. This was my second time at a Manalti chain pizza restaurant in the area, and since deep dish is not a personal favorite of mine, come here if you love lots of cheese and buttery crunchy crust. Great atmosphere too with decorations of different sports memorabilia hanging on the walls, and they are not shy on refillable drinks - they are a monster of a size.
