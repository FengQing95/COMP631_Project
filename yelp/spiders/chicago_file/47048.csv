Smoque BBQ////What's the big deal?  My friends and I ordered the rib combo, the brisket, the pulled pork, a few sides.  It was all nothing to write home about.  My mother makes better brisket (once a year at Passover) and she hates to cook.  The ribs also came too easily off the bone.  The sauce was sweet and thick.  For my money, Myron & Phil's has the best ribs.   Smoque was just okay.
