Smoque BBQ////I may be biased being from Kansas City. That said, the brisket was pretty good but I really didn't care for the sauce. Â They didn't really seem to have an identity either. The brisket felt like a Texas style but the sauces were Memphis style and Carolina style. It did enough to fill my BBQ cravings for another few weeks but I'm going to have to look around some more for a favorite BBQ place in Chicago. Might retry this place and bring some of my own KC BBQ sauce. Overall, 4 stars for the brisket, 1 star for the sauce
