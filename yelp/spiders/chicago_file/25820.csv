Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They ferment their dough for a bit so it takes on a sourdough flavor, which I love! I personally always go for the classic, which has a layer of sausage along with the hearty helping of cheese and sauce. The Lou is great too with cheddar, tomatoes slices, sauce and more mozz. But really? Just order the classic. You'll be satisfied.
