Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Although we were 2 people, we ordered the pizza good enough for 3 and had 4 extra slices to take home. 2 slices per person roughly fills you up even with a strong appetite. The prices are reasonable and the waitstaff extremely friendly. They told us the wait would be an hour but we were seated in about 40 minutes.
