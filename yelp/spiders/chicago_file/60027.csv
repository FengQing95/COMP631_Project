Smoque BBQ////My problem with this place are their sides.  It's my personal belief that one of the best thing about ribs are the sides that it comes with.  There is nothing like a side of mac and cheese or baked beans to compliment your ribs.  Here, the sides are simply disappointing.  I tried most of their sides, and they were all a miss with the exception of their french fries, which isn't even a true side when paired with ribs.
