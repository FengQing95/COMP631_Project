Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I saw the first picture on yelp and new I had to try it.  I was surprised at how big the menu was, but ultimately settled on the signature french toast with a glass of OJ and a side of chicken sausage.  French toast was awesome, I was worried it might be too sweet, but the mascarpone added a bit of sourness to make it just right. Juice was good, would of been nice to get a little more in the larger size.  The chicken sausage was not very good.  The side came with three links, and two of which had larger chucks of fat, something the size of your nail that I've never seen in sausage.
