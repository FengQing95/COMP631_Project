Art Institute of Chicago////One of my little pick-me-ups is that I sometimes pass thru the museum on my way home from work.  I just do a quick walk-thru.  Sometimes just through that Asian art gallery that acts as a connection corridor to get you over the railroad tracks.  But usually on these little jaunts, I choose a gallery, or a favorite piece of art, and just walk by, stop for a few moments, sometimes less than a minute, and continue on.  This is a great way to separate your work day from your after-work time!  It really puts me in a special frame of mind to walk home.  But then again, this would only be helpful to people who happen to live and work in the vicinity.
