Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went here for dinner on a Saturday night. I'm glad we had a reservation because there was a ton of people in line waiting for tables. The inside is divided in to separate rooms, so it is a more cozy/romantic vibe than a "hot spot." We tried a bunch of different tapas, all were pretty good, I'd give all the food 3-4/5 stars. We got a pitcher of sangria and that was 5/5 though! Tasty AND strong. Service was good and we would probably come back again sometime.
