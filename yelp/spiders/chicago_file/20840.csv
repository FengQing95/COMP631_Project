Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time to Chicago. Following friend recommendations and Yelp reviews I chose Lou's for my dinner. Ordered over the phone with someone who seemed rather reluctant to help me order, eh, whatever no biggie. Had a pleasant walk from my hotel to the restaurant. Paid the cashier and had a drink from the cool bartender at the bar while I waited. Watch a medium sized ROACH walk around the bar top. Ew. Told the bartender before heading to the bathroom, dunno if he found it but it seemed he looked.
