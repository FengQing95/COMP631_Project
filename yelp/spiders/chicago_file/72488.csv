Little Goat Diner////I got the pork belly pancake. The pancake itself was kind of burnt in the center and the pork belly was really fatty (I get it's supposed to be fatty, but this was like 100% fat) so while the first bite was delicious, it quickly became unpleasant. I did like the bok choy salad and dressing, it complemented the richness of the pork belly nicely.
