Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We never skip Lou Malnati's when we are in town! Having lived in Chicago 20 years ago, we tried all the local pizza shops and Lou's is our favorite. This time we brought the kids. The kids, being from NY and being accustomed to NY style pizza, found the pizza quite foreign. But if you love Chicago style, check out Lou's!
