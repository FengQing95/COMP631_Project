The Purple Pig////Turkey neck rillette smear - We honestly only ordered this because one of our friends only eats poultry and this was one of the few options he had...but DAMN this was surprisingly one of my favorite plates of the night. The texture was somewhere between pulled pork and pate spread, and the flavor was salty but still with a turkey taste. It also came with thick slices of fluffy bread and some sort of cranberry jam.
