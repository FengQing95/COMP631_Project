Little Goat Diner////I had very high expatiations with all the great things I heard about Little Goat Diner, with that said, what I got was better than average food, at a good price with good service. We went for dinner and started off with the Hot Crab Dip, yes it was good, with lots of crab flavor, but no lump crab in the dish, more like a thickened crab bisque topped with hot bubbly cheese served with Ritz crackers. Now I don't have a problem with the Ritz crackers, but with a in house bakery right in the building I kind of thought they could come up with something more interesting and homemade to dip into this hot dish of crab flavored goodness. The server brought plenty more crackers over to finish the dip without having to ask. I had my eye on the Breakfast Spaghetti, but they were out of one of the ingredients so they could not make it. I had the Springy Shrimp & Pork Belly instead. Basically a conjured up version of shrimp and pork lo mein. Both the pork belly and shrimp in the dish were cooked perfectly tender and juicy with the vegetables in the dish crisp and fresh. My friend had the Kalbi Beef Ribs with Thai fried rice, Beech mushrooms and crispy onions. the Korean style ribs were cook perfectly, again like the other dish, tender and juicy, the fried rice and crispy onions added nothing to the dish except for crunchy texture and making the dish have a appearance of brown on brown, on brown. The Thai fried rice was more like what you would get in the Korean dish dolsot bibimbap, with the rice having a golden brown and crisp texture from the stone bowl it is served in, typically Thai fried rice is more closely prepared to Chinese fried rice, but with Jasmine rice instead of regular long-grain rice, but with that said the dish was still good, just not what we had fabricated in our own heads. All in all a good dinner made more enjoyable with the fine cocktails served at the bar and bottle of wine we had with dinner.
