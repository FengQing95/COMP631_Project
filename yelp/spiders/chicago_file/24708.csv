Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After about 10 minutes, our pizza arrived. It was my partner's first time trying deep dish pizza. He's a NY pizza fan for sure and he didn't sway. Even though, the Malnati Classic was delicious, I think I favor pepperoni better, of course with butter crust. My partner couldn't handle all the cheese and had to go for another serving of salad, which I am very happy about.
