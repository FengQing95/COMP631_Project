Smoque BBQ////Worth the wait in my opinion, I'm not a huge bbq eater but I know when the pulled pork is melt in your mouth tender then they're doing something right. Just the right amount of charred bark and meat to make me need to take a nap after eating. Fries are good, but the mac and cheese was bomb. Corn bread is nice and soft and moist. Yep, I used the word moist. My parents had the ribs (each got the different style) and my hubs got the Texas sausage. The beans were smoky and have some heat to them. Overall we were very satisfied even after waiting about an hour and 15 minutes. The people in line made it very entertaining. Wish I would have brought some brews, forgetting that it's a byob joint, but I will definitely come back. If you don't want to wait, I suggest calling ahead and picking up, the line was long even during non-peak hours.
