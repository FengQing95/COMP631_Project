Art Institute of Chicago////I paid my second visit to the Art Institute of Chicago last month, desperately cramming my eyeballs with as many cultural goodies as could fit in the little over two hours I had before closing time. I don't recommend trying to take this mighty collection in during such a compacted time frame but it's what I had to work with. (I also don't recommend parking in the exorbitantly priced underground Millennium Park garage but that's another review.)
