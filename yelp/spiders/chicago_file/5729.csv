The Purple Pig////I had to come here during my trip to Chicago a few months ago after seeing all the positive reviews and recommendations for this place. This place was already so packed even around 5:30pm, with a wait time of well over an hour. Luckily there are a lot of shops nearby so you could walk around while you wait (we actually did this before going to the restaurant because we didn't expect it to be so crowded). When we arrived the waitress said if we were okay with patio seating, she did have 2 seats available immediately. At first I wanted to wait for indoor seating because it was so cold outside, but she emphasized that the patio was heated, so we agreed to be seated there.
