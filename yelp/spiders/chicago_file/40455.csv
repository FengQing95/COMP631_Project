Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The vibe is cozy and romantic. My husband and I really enjoyed the atmosphere and background music. We ordered the wedge salad, crab & avocado salad, dry aged ribeye and pomme frites (fries) Every bite was absolutely delicious!!! The drinks were on point. The service was top notch. We will definitely be back! It was a treat for a romantic date night.
