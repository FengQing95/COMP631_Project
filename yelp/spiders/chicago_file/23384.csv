Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When in Chicago, you deep dish. In all my years visiting Chicago, I had never been to Lou's (I was told I can call by nickname that now that I've been). I always stick to what I like, which is Gino's, but I stepped outside the box during my last visit. I thought the feel of the restaurant and menu were very similar to Gino's, but I never thought the pizza would taste so different! In comparing the two, I thought Gino's was saucier and had a better crust, whereas Lou's was cheesier (fine by me) and didn't have as flavorful of a crust.
