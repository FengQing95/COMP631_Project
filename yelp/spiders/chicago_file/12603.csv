Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Seeing as how I've had deep dish elsewhere, I figured it was good to try it right in Chicago. We ordered a small Chicago Classic (sausage, extra cheese, and Buttercrust) with pepperoni added and some BuffaLou wings (eight in an order) to go with it. The wings were very good, though not the best ever, but still very good. After the inital taste, what put them at the near top was the Gorgonzola dipping sauce. Never before in my life have I tasted, let alone heard of, Gorgonzola dipping sauce. I ordered it on a "feeling adventurous" whim and it was a very well-placed whim. This sauce was the consistency of sour cream and faintly reminiscent of bleu cheese dips but it was all its own and complimented the wings like peanut butter goes with jelly. The pizza, too, was pretty good but not the best. The crust was positively delicious and the extra cheese was a excellent choice but other than that, it was fairly average, maybe slightly above. The Gorgonzola dip, crust, and extra cheese make the place worth going back to and, for a filling meal to fall below $25, so does the price.
