Smoque BBQ////Best brisket in town. But I have to say, DO NOT MISS THE CHICKEN!. Every person I take here I insist we order it and everyone thanks me for it later. The only quiblle I have is that it seems, for whatever reason, that the quality isn't always as good for take away. it seems they put the lesser parts of the brisket in the to go orders. Maybe it is just bad luck but the only bad meals I have had from there were carry out.
