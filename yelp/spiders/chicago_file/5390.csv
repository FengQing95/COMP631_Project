The Purple Pig////Their menu is tapas style, so we ordered the Pork Jowl ($18).  Surprisingly, it was more like an open faced bacon-lettuce-tomato (BLT) sandwich, topped with an over easy duck egg.  The bread was also really firm.  Everything was just so extreme, flavorwise.  I was barely recovering from the sourness and hardness of the bread that when I reached the stuffed squid ($18), my lips and tongue were numb.  Overall, their food seems to be on the sour end, at least from my experience.  This is a pretty well-sought out restaurant in Chicago, but perhaps it just wasn't for me.
