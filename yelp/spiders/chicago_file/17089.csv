Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's always packed, so be prepared to wait. The cool thing is that you can order your pizza before you're seated, so the pizza doesn't take too long once you get a table. The pizza itself is legendary and needs no introduction. The service staff are competent and nice, and my experience has been very consistent from visit to visit. So, despite the long wait, still a 5 all day. It's one of those rare places beloved by locals and tourists alike.
