Little Goat Diner////I really wanted to fall in love with the food at "Little Goat Diner", the same way I had fallen in love with its name. But, maybe the day wasn't just right. I did read about the place after paying it a visit, it definitely is interesting. It is one of Top Chef's first female winner Stephanie Izard's restaurants. It's a very nicely done space, not sure if I would call it a diner though :)
