Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic. It was thick, and not just the crust. Every bite had a solid layer of cheese, sauce, and most importantly sausage. What was most impressive was the price. My wife and I ordered a large and had enough for a filling lunch there and leftovers a couple days later which ended up being $6-7 a serving for really quality food.
