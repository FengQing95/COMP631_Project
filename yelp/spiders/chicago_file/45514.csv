Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Some of the other noteworthy things I enjoyed were the patatas bravas. This is probably the best thing I've ever had at this restaurant. The paella is also good, but takes 30 minutes to make. Also one of my favorites is the goat cheese marinara with garlic bread. I've also been here for brunch and had cinnamon french toast, which was simple but delicious.
