Little Goat Diner////Confession: I've only had salads here. They are not the focus of the menu. I've had the Asian shrimp salad and Steph's Salad. Both were okay. Good, substantial portions, but both times, the lettuce was just not the freshest. Definitely some wilted lettuce in there...didn't seem local or fresh, more like a few-days-old-Jewel-quality. Which was disappointing. Not inedible, but not what you would expect when you're paying $14 for a salad. And both salads were a bit overdressed, so everything got soggy quickly. I was also confused by the two dressings on the Steph's Salad -- it comes tossed with a tamarind dressing, but then they also give you ranch on the side. But the salad already is dressed in a creamy dressing so the ranch seems redundant. I added a little, to see if it, like, revolutionized the flavor profile or something, but no dice. Just added Ranch flavor, which seemed random. I only need one dressing on my salad at a time (call me old school).
