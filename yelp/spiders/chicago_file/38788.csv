Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is always on the agenda if I'm in Chicago. I stayed at the Merch Mart Holiday inn this last trip, which put me right nearby. Great drinks, friendly staff, great ambience. They wouldn't take our last minute (the day before) reservation, so we ate at Coco Pazzo, which was ok, but I was a little disappointed we weren't here. Skip lunch, save room in your belly and enjoy the ride.
