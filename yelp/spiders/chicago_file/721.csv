Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The food, portion size, and prices are downright phenomenal. My only thing against the place is you can expect to wait 30-45 minutes for a table at baseline on a weekend...but they now accept reservations for groups of 6 or more. The Berry Bliss pancakes are heavenly...and the Mexicana skillet is just downright silly. Also a huge fan of the turkey pepperjack panini (one of the best sandwiches I've ever had) and all of their omelets. I bring every visitor I have to the city to this place for brunch...it will not disappoint. Best part is you can add essentially a full portion of specialty pancakes as a side to your breakfast/lunch entree for no more than an additional $2. Go here.
