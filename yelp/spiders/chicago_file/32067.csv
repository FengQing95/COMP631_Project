Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Excellent pizza! If you want traditional Chicago style deep dish, this is your place! We ordered a small and medium for our family of 5, and we still had leftovers!! The pizza is so filling. I don't think I can ever eat pizza in Texas again. I'm officially spoiled to the best pizza in the world from Lou's!!!!
