Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The place was completely packed at 6pm on a Thursday night. The wait for 2 people was 45min. You walk in and put your name on the list. It's always a pain to wait, but they don't take reservations so what can you do? The great part is that they let you order your pizza while you're waiting so it's ready shortly after you're sat. This is such a great idea.
