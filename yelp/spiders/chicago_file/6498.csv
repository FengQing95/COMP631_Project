The Purple Pig////Restaurant is worth the hype. We ordered three dishes between two people and it was plenty of food - full but not uncomfortably full. We had the Grilled Broccoli, Squid Ink Tagliatelle, and Pork Shoulder. Every dish was fantastic! Highly recommend each of them. The pork shoulder was so tender and juicy that we didn't even need a knife to cut through.
