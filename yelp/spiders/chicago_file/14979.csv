Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Dave our server was super nice.  He was highly informative about the menu and a bit of history.  Promt curteous service was only the beginning of our expericence the Pizza... AMAZING.. This place has ruined pizza for me.  I doubt I can go almost anywhere now with out the fond memory of the pie we had here.  We were a party of 5 and ordered a Lou Malnati special and a Classic. Both excellent.  But, the classic had phenominal sausgage, superb cheese and both had just exquisite garlic butter crust.
