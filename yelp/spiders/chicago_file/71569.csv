Little Goat Diner////We heard from a bartender on the Navy Pier that we should try one of the goat restaurants and when the wait at Au Chavel was five hours it was an easy choice for us to hop on over to this location. We kept saying we were so thankful for the five hour wait. This place was amazing! The French toast and the Los Despados (Mexican French dip) was amazing! Don't miss this fancy diner stop!
