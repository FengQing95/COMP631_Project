Little Goat Diner////This was a recommended hot spot by friends who are currently living in Chicago. During my visit here this past weekend, I was impressed. We had reservations for 11:30am and after bolting from Chicago O'hare, we used the convenient valet in front and even after arriving 10 minutes later than our reservation, we were shown our seats immediately. My friends ordered french toast and pancake entrees, however, I have a severe egg allergy and upon informing the server, she brought out a separate vegan menu for me. The crumpets were divine and the home fries were great for sharing. I can't wait to come back!
