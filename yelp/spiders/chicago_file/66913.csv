Little Goat Diner////The restaurant has an automated wait list that will send out texts when your table is ready. Sounds good in theory, terrible in practice. The end result is that the restaurant seemingly holds tables for half an hour waiting for patrons to return. So if you wait inside, expect to become increasingly frustrated at waiting an abnormally long amount of time while looking at a plethora of available seating. On our first visit, multiple patrons that reserved tables after us were seated before us. When I came to inquire at the front desk they surprisingly aloof hostess said, "Oh yeah, we've been looking for you." Thanks for both lying to me and insulting me. After waiting for an hour, we're seated.
