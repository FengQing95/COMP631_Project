Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////unacceptable. Told us it would be a 45min wait for a table....tuned out to be more than 2hrs. I get it, you're busy, but maybe instead of every 15mims saying it will be 15 mins you should 'fess up that it will be an additional hour. Then...to top it all off, you know we're not happy, so don't seat s with a waiter that doesn't listen to anything we say. The only reason I'm giving any stars is that the food was fantastic!
