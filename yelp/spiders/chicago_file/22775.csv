Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We also ended with the deep dish cookie dessert which was very good too, served in a deep dish pan with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  If you are not a huge fan of whip cream like me I would recommend ordering it without which I forgot to do, but after scooping it away the dessert was still good.
