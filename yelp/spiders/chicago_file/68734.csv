Little Goat Diner////Came here for an early morning brunch and was not disappointed. I had the Fat Elvis Waflles with peanut butter butter, maple syrup, and bacon which was quite good. My husband had the patty melt. We also shared a fresh squeezed OJ. We had a reservation and we were seated promptly. We found street parking very near by. It's not the very best brunch I've ever had, but it's definitely a great spot!
