Little Goat Diner////We leave the restaurant to proceed with our evening and about an hour I start complaining that my stomach was hurting. I was also breaking into a hot sweat. We end up ending our evening and I went home. When I got home I got REALLY sick and started throwing up all the food I ate. My husband looked at the chicken I came home with and said this chicken is gross and way under cooked - the bone was even a little red. I was throwing up all night queasy. I did not stop throwing up until 3am in the morning. This morning, I checked in with my friends to find out they they were not as sick as me but experienced stomach pains and were queasy. I almost went to the ER but why should I go and spend lots of money just so they can confirm what I already knew - I was sick from being served UNDER COOKED CHICKEN!!!! Â
