Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Anytime someone comes to visit me up in Chicago, I bring them to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! Everything is amazing but the white sangria is a must have with the bacon wrapped dates! The sangria pitcher is the only way to go when dining with friends. The fact that everything is a small plate that is made to be shared is perfect!
