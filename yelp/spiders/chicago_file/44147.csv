Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here more than a few times now and cannot get enough! The food is always prepared so well and the sangria is simply amazing. The spicy potatoes were one of my favorites along with any of the items they have ever had with goat cheese! Definitely want to try brunch one of these days.
