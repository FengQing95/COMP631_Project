Art Institute of Chicago////2. The European Paintings & Sculptures, especially the marble statues (go through the armor hallway, make a right and go straight (not up the stairs). And I love religious art from around the Medieval & Renaissance, they have quite a collection. The Impressionists are always good too :)
