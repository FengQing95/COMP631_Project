The Purple Pig////For lunch, we ordered the Milk braised Berkshire Shoulder served with mashed potatoes and crispy lentils. Â The pork was tender and the crispy lentils were a nice surprise; it provided great texture. There was an additional flavor on the pork that didn't compliment it, so I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped to.
