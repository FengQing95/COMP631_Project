Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was good but not the best.  I was on a business trip and I came by here as soon as I got out of the airport.  We stayed in a hotel in the North River area about 1.5 miles from this place.  We walked it and got there - no wait and ordered a few beers and the mozzerella sticks to start off.  My fiance and I split the deep dish and it was pretty good but not as good as the other two in town ;-)
