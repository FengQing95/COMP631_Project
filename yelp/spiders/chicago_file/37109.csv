Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////- Best steak I've ever had, hands-down! I had the pepper crusted, prime bone in dry aged ribeye. My gawd.... can you say #foodporn - Fantastic sear, pepper crust that sealed in the flavor. Cooked a perfect medium and filled with juicy flavor. If Starburst made a steak flavor, this would be it
