Smoque BBQ////Five stars for the taste of everything I ordered which was basically brisket platter, cole slaw and corn bread and fountain drink (iced tea).  You don't even need a knife to eat the meat, it's that tender. Delish!! I thought I would take some home but ate every delicious bite. I am not a regular meat eater so this was a treat/sin and I would say worth it!  Slaw could have used a tad more umph, though nice to not have mayo drenched slaw but maybe a bit more seasoning just the same.  Cornbread was still warm and pretty moist and the sauces were both good that they provide for the brisket.
