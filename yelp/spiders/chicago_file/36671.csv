Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Similarly delicious is the bone in dry aged ribeye; a cut to rival any other steak house in Chicago, preferably ordered rare.  What you mind find the most captivating, however, is dessert.  Their chocolate cake is rich, stunningly delicious and HUGE.  You will definitely want to order this and take it (all) home if necessary, it will keep and give you a full week of pleasure.
