Little Goat Diner////YES Little Goat lives up to the hype. After living in Chicago for 3 years I finally made it to Little Goat for dinner with friends on a week night. I started with the Moscow Goat. the grapefruit juice gave the drink a little extra tang. We shared the goat chili cheese fries (a must order). I am so glad the 3 of us split the fries because I could of easily eaten the whole plate by myself! For my entree I decided on the fat club. The sandwich was HUGE and I was only able to eat half. A loaded meat sandwich with veggies, cheese and special sauce...plus a side of fries! As if we didn't eat enough we split the peppermint mattie for dessert. A brownie sundae with icecream and whip cream (think of a thin mint girl scout cookie mouth explosion). I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of the items off the menu. My hardest decision was: do I order breakfast of dinner.
