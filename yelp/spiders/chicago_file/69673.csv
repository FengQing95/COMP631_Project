Little Goat Diner////As to the food, I am not clear on what this restaurant is trying to achieve with regard to the type of cuisine it's serving.  Is it southern American, Asian, French or just some kind of hodgepodge?  Whatever it is, it's very overpriced (its website doesn't show prices).  Not being enthused with any of the offerings, I settled on the Brandade and Belly 'Benedict.'  This turned out to be extremely disappointing.  The pork belly that was substituted for regular ham was fatty and it didn't have much of a taste nor did the crumbly biscuit base, but at least this part of the dish was warm.  Not so with the kimchi on top that was very cold.  The flavor and temperature mixtures didn't work and left me wondering what they were trying to accomplish with this concoction.
