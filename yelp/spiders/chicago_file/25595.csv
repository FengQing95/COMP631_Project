Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Stick to their recommendations I have found a large is just the perfect amount for four people and their is usually a piece left over. Eating two deep crust pieces is like eating four regular pizza slices anywhere else if you ask me. If you are dining in they will cut and serve the first slice for the family. So if you are in the area this is a must try!!
