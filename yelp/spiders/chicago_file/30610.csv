Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The main dining area is decorated with jerseys of famous people. Â They have near the entrance a sign that says text message area. I guess they must use texting if there is a line. I noticed the place was a bit old and when I went to use the ladies room I had to wait since there was only one stall and it was in a small area.
