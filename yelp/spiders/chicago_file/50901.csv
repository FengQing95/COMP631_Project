Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For food, I think few tapas places rival Café Ba-Ba-Reeba in terms of the variety. At other tapas places I feel like there is too much of an emphasis on heavy meat and cheese laden dishes but not so at Café Ba-Ba-Reeba. There are tapas for everyone, whether you're vegetarian, dairy free, gluten free, etc, you will be able to find something on their menu. That being said, we tried a bit of everything: spicy potatoes, short rib, sautéed vegetables, smoked salmon, and more. My favorite by far was the smoke salmon- it was so light and bursting with flavor. Our server was great and very helpful when making menu suggestions. She explained that the menu at Café Ba-Ba-Reeba changes often, but the smoked salmon always stays on, and now I know why!
