Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had one server in our half of the room. He never came back to check on any of his tables - approx (8-9 of them) Second, he disappears after taking our order. Our water cups were empty and no appetizers in sight. The table next to us finished eating for over 10 minutes and their plates still weren't cleared. Another table accidentally knocked their glass of water to the floor, and nobody came by to pick it up or clean the mess until a good 15 minutes later. That is how poor the service was.
