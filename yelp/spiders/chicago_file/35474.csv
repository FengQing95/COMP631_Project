Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went on a Sunday night, and the place was pretty crowded with a lively noise level.  We arrived a little early for our 7:30 p.m. reservation and were guided to the bar to wait for our table, which was fine with me.  Met a very friendly and helpful bartender named Jay who made me a great Sazerac, even better than the ones I'd had in New Orleans.  While making our drinks, Jay took great care to measure correctly and otherwise take time to make the drinks properly.  What really made that Sazerac, though, was the twist of lemon which was taken right off the fruit, not from a garnish tray where it had been sitting around for hours.  It was so fresh, it created an aromatic experience when I put my nose to the glass - a wonderful prelude to the taste that was to follow.  That drink was so good, I had another one with dinner.
