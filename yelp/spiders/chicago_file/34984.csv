Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Background Story: My husband and I were in Chicago for just three nights. One night we were meeting up with friends, who wanted to take us dinner and dancing at Untitled. The other we had long time made reservations (tickets purchased) at Alinea, Chicago's number one. So without too much planning we left the third night open, and while in town decided we still had to do two things: eat a deep dish pizza and go to a steak house. So the night before we stopped by the concierge desk (we were staying at the Langham) and the amazing concierge gave us several options. We looked them up on trip advisor and asked him to call. Bavette's was our number one choice. He said when he called Bavette's said they did not have any tables at all. So he made us reservations at Chicago Cut. BUT he mentioned that if we were able to get to Bavette's when they open, at 5:00PM, we would have a chance at walking in and getting a table because they save tables for walk ins in their main dining room. And voila, indeed they did. We walked in at 5:00PM on Sunday July 12th and got ourselves a nice table in the main dining room (it was not a booth but we weren't complaining). So if you call or go to opentable and don't see any reservations available simply go the night you want at 5:00PM and most likely you will be seated. I thought that was a nice thing they do.
