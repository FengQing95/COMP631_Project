Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I figured I should try Lou Malnati's because it's a Chicago staple.  I was glad to see that they offer small sizes: a six inch deep dish or nine inch thin crust.  I tried both the Chicago Classic deep dish and the pepperoni thin.  Both were unique.  I hadn't  eaten anything like either of them before.  However, neither was so special that I'd go out of my way to return.
