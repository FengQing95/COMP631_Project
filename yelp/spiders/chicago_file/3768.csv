The Purple Pig////Lovely spot. Sat at the bar and asked the bartender, Flint, for his recommendations and the service was GREAT. The Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder was bomb AND the Smoked Pork Tongue was my favorite, so so flavorful! Perfect for sharing. The wine selection was also on point! Found my new favorite wine. Definitely recommend you check this out.
