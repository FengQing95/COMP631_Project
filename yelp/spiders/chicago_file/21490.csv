Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As expected, there was a long line of wait. We got seated pretty quickly since there are only 2 of us and early in the evening (5:30pm) The pizza was good but it wasn't as pipping hot as other tables..I think my pizza was sitting around for a while. Overall, I definitely think peaquod pizza is better.
