Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Visited Chicago and this was the first place I ate. It was crowded but we didn't wait long. The food came out in a short enough amount of time and the service was good. The food tasted very good and i would certainly recommend eating here. There were 3 in my party and no one had anything negative to say about this place, aside from how crowded it was.
