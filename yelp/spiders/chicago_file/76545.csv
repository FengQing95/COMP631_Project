Little Goat Diner////We started with the crispy shrimp appetizer, the crab dip and the pork nachos.  See pictures. The crispy shrimp was a decent starter as the shrimp was flavorful, fresh and served with a tangy cocktail sauce.  They lost me on the crab dip..... I searched for some crab flavor or chunks of real crab (Old Bay was in there somewhere) and sadly it was a rather bland and over-emulsified mush that warranted only one bite.  I've had better crab dips out of a jar from the supermarket so here's hoping they rethink this one.
