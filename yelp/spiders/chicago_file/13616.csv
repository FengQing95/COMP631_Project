Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Friendly staff, attentive service.  Buffalo chicken wings were just AOK but not mind blowing - felt a bit overcooked to be honest.  The deep dish, though, was spot on.  Positioned just north of the river on the southern perimeter of downtown, the place is entirely reachable by foot from the financial district.
