Little Goat Diner////The Los Drowned was good as well. The beef was succulent and came with some au jus that had great depth of flavor. But you get no sides. No fries, no chips, nothing. On the menu it said that it has avocado on it, which it did. But it was just a really thin spread on the bread. If you told me that there was avocado on the sandwich I wouldn't of believed you. It would have been nice if there were an actual slice of it instead. For a 15 dollar sandwich, that's what I was expecting. The pickled peppers were a nice touch though.
