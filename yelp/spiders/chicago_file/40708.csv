Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One downfall for the evening was that we ventured out to Caf√©-Ba-Ba-Reeba to see the Flamenco show and when we arrived we were told the show was a separate reservation from the dinner. We made dinner reservations thinking the show and dinner were together. We were bummed and wished the staff would have specified that when we called to make the reservation and also on the advertisement about the event.
