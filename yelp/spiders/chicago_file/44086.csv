Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I would be remiss, of course, to speak of Ba Ba Reeba without mentioning their extensive selection of sangria. Really delicious, flavorful sangria with lots of fruit. A tad expensive, but that's to be expected. And their desserts are not terribly creative, but are perfectly-sized and cheap, and they hit the spot after such a huge meal. Highly recommended.
