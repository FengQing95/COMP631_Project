Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////UPDATE: I was understandably pretty upset when I wrote this review. but I wanted to give Bavette's a fair shake because of what they did to make it right. (I originally copy/pasted pretty much the same review to RESY, but their clunky website has thus far caused any 'edit' ability to elude me),
