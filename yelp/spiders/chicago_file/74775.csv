Little Goat Diner////Trying something a little different with a spin on things this is where it's at. Definitely have to be in the mood for change when reading the menu. My final decision was a apple tomato relish with bacon grill cheese on a sour dough bread, cheese grits (Gouda goat cheese and one other cheese) and cherry wine soda. It was ok yet will return to try something different at least 1 more time. Customer service was fair went during lunch nice crowd indoor and outdoor. All age ranges was present and looks like throughout diner everyone had something different. Bottom line if your down and want to try something different with a touch of cost 13.00 for sandwich only and $4.00 for sides cool yet I've had better and sure you have too. Dessert shop in diner... I tried a butterscotch oatmeal cookie yummy will stop in for 1 of those and coffee and skip lunch.
