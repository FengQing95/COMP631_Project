Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Another pizza place I was destined to try on my quickie trip to Chicago. The planning of this was difficult as my friends limited me to 2 pizza places...a**holes. Anyways, I already had Giordano's on my list and my second choice was down between this and Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder. Of course if I had more time, I would go to every single pizza place famous in Chicago: Giordanos, Lou Malnatis, Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder, Geno's East, Pizzeria Uno, and I think theres a few more I'm missing. Either way, Giordanos was on the first day, so then that left me with one more.
