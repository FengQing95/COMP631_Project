Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The first time I ever heard of this restaurant was visiting my friend back in November 2010. When she mentioned taking me it sounded like she said illuminati. I was expecting jay z posters everywhere and whole pizzas in the shape of a triangle besides the slices that are already in triangles.
