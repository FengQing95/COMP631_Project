The Purple Pig////As usual, The Pig doesn't disappoint!!! My uncle and I lucked out and snagged last 2 seats at the full bar. Corie, Mauro, and Julian took excellent care of us and the rest of the staff was equally as awesome!!! This partridge dish is over the top delicious, well done Chef!!! I'll be back for this soon!!!
