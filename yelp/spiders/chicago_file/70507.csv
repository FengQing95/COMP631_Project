Little Goat Diner////I got the Parathas Burrito and don't be fooled by the "burrito" in the title. It is nothing like a burrito but that doesn't matter, because it was amazing. The portion was huge and I couldn't help but eat every last bite-- I literally licked the plate clean. The indian flatbread it comes with was so soft but yet had a great crunch and the sauce and eggs mixed with it was a perfect pairing.
