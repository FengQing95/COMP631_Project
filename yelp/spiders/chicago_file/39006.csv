Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The ambience is great for a date, I showed up early and waited at the bar and I can definitely say its a great place just to have a solo meal. The staff is nice and accommodating, and with their BYOB policy for sharing wine (no corkage if you share a glass), it is easy to make friends with neighbors.
