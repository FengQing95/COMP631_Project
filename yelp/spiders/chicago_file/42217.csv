Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place has excellent tapas. My favorites were the bacon wrapped dates and the skirt steak with the herb butter. They come highly recommended as does the sangria. The wait wasn't too bad, about a half hour. I would make a reservation though, the place was pretty packed. Our serivce was awesome. Don't eat much the day you go, trust me, you won't leave hungry.
