Art Institute of Chicago////Absolutely one of the best museums I've been too! Absolutely beautiful and a variety of artists throughout the entire world. Being a student myself and seeing the art I've studied in world history, and women in art- I was able to better connect to the artists themselves and recognize their pieces of art. Absolutely worth the entire experience from start to finish. Here are some of the current paintings! Enjoy
