Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza is still worth it--we ordered it for takeout twice more during our trip. But the delay and wrong size after such a long wait put a bit of a damper on things. Also don't bother with the bruschetta, at least not for take out. They serve it as grilled bread with no toppings and then give a whole lot of diced tomatoes and very little cheese for you to add yourself. Just stick with the pizza.
