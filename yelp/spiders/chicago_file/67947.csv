Little Goat Diner////This has to be one of my favorite diners to open in Chicago. If only it was closer to me I would dine there 3 times a week. The wait can be really long, but let me tell you it's worth it. Sit in the coffee shop and have a delicious latte (or Bloody Mary) and watch them make the bread while you wait. I have been here a few times now. My favorites being the crab dip appetizer (love the fact that it's served with ritz crackers), the Asian pulled pork sandwich, and the Club sandwich. All so darn good. My friend has the goat burger and said it was so filling and tasty he couldn't even finish it. Mind you, he's a big eater too. It's a bit more pricey than your average diner, but if you're looking to splurge a little, this is the spot.
