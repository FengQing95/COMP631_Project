Get off the lion!".  And when nobody is on the lion he's like "what ?!?" and then is like  "nobody better get on that lion".    The roaring lion alarm is set off easily I think.  Maybe it was pigeons or the wind.  Although I can see the guards point of view too.  Teenagers are a problem everywhere.   You have to stay vigilant or they'll run rampant.
