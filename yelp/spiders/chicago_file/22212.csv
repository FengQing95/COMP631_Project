Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Unlike pretty much everyone else I didn't have any deep dish pizza here ... but I did have a deep dish cookie! I split his with a friend and enjoyed a cup of coffee with it. The cookie was perfect and it came topped with plenty of delicious vanilla ice cream. I really recommend this dessert.
