Little Goat Diner////I was told I couldn't sit there because they were for 2 people.  I scratched my head as I waited about 15 minutes for another place at the counter to open up. And out of that 15 minutes of waiting, the two seats I was eye balling were empty for about 10 minutes of that time before the hostess seated a couple there.
