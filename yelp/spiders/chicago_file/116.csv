Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Yum! Totally worth the reasonable half hour wait for a party of four on a busy Saturday. This one's located in the Prudential Building, and there's a big space outside where people were waiting. You can also get some Intellegentsia coffee from the small coffee shop in the front of the restaurant, to warm you up as you wait. The restaurant's pretty high-capacity; I saw a party of 20 ladies seated comfortably in the middle of the restaurant. Even with the large space, it still felt a little cramped, so parents were asked to put their strollers outside in the lobby area. The menu is quite extensive, but I went for their fall special pumpkin spice pancakes with a side of chicken apple sausage. Both were absolutely delicious. The pancakes had a delicate, not faint, taste of pumpkin, and the butter and syrup just makes it even happier in my mouth. The chicken apple sausage was a good portion for the price. They're not the piddly shriveled type, they're actually pretty hefty. Other faves were my sister's corned beef benny, which my brother-in-law happily helped demolishing. Overall, it's a great breakfast spot for families, friends, hangover buddies, and anybody in between.
