The Purple Pig////I was hesitant on trying a tapa restaurant for dinner because I wasn't sure if it was going to be filling for the price. Boy, was I wrong! We got about 5 plates, including dessert and I was stuffed! There was definitely a wait (around 2 hours for us), so get there early and put your name down.
