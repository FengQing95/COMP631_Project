Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Overhyped place to be honest. Poor service. Our server only come and helped us maybe a handful of times. Asked for hot tea, hot water and straw a couple of times but didn't come within a timely manner in my opinion. The classic was good. I like the meat layer and the crunchy crust! The veggie option with spinach and mushroom (I forgot what the name was) was soggy. The wait was 45mins. Food wait was about 20mins. Again, In my opinion this place was overhyped.
