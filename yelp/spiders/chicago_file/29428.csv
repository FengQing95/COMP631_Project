Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was pretty set on just ordering a pizza but the server told me that it would be at least 45 minutes unless I pre-ordered at the hostess stand. I wish I would've known that. So if you're reading this be sure to pre-order your pizza if you're waiting for a table! I ordered the bruschetta appetizer to munch on while I waited for my pizza. It was both a good and bad thing. Good because it was delicious (the garlic rounds were awesome), bad because it filled me up.
