Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We ordered almost all the sides and they were all delicious. I'm a sucker for a good side dish. The broccoli was off the menu for seasonal asparagus.. sad face as I prefer roasted broccoli over grilled asparagus. The hash browns were sooo good and crispy! Crispy! For my entree I had the crab stuffed avocado salad and it was large, definitely enough for two people to split. It's light and refreshing with a lot of crab. I'd get that again. Also gold brick sundae! I had to google that before ordering because we know it as a different name. It's delicious! and worth it. We had it with the whiskey ice cream. The other dessert options did not sound so enticing, if anything- get the gold brick sundae.
