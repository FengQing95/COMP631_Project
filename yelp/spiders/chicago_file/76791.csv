Little Goat Diner////Who knew diner style food could be so amazing! Really do not judge by looks here, because you will be in for a pleasant surprise! The pot pie and burger are no ordinary versions at all and you will enjoy every bit of whatever you order. The prices do seem pretty steep for the food, but the taste explains why.
