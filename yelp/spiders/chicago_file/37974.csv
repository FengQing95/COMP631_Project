Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The dry aged steak, ordered rare, was cooked to perfection.  It basically melted in my mouth and alone would have merited an excellent review.  However, the sides that we ordered (Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, and fries) were incredible compliments to the meal.  The mushrooms were absolutely out of this world.
