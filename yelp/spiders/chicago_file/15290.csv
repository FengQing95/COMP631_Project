Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had a delivery order from Lou's. We ordered one pizza and were told it would be an hour before it would arrive. Ok no problem. 2 hours after we placed our order (after 9pm at this point) we called. We were told the delivery guys said he already delivered our pizza and we were eating it. Ummm...no. So we told them we had not gotten our pizza and there was no way we could have gotten our pizza because there was no way the delivery driver would have been let up into our building. So then they called back and now the story changed to our driver had brought our pizza back to the restaurant and it was going back out for delivery. They refunded our card- which was good because obviously they should. 30 minutes later the delivery guy calls. My husband went downstairs to get the pizza and the story changes yet again. The driver said he called our phone number when he arrived (this is a lie) and a lady answered (also a lie). He had my husbands cell phone number. We were all sitting watching a movie. It never rang and I didn't answer it, nor did anyone else in the residence. Also, if the driver dialed it wrong, that's odd because we have an out of state number. If he did dial it wrong and someone said we already got our pizza and we are eating now...I would double check that I called the right number- maybe I have more common sense though. It was an awful experience. Also I might add the crust was hard. Like really hard- almost as if it were stale??? Yuck. I will stick to Giordanos they are much better.
