Art Institute of Chicago////It's always a shock to turn a corner in one of the galleries and find yourself in front of a painting or a sculpture you've seen hundreds of times in books.  The thing about the Art Institute is that if you spend any kind of time walking through it, this will happen to you with stunning regularity.  In addition to the paintings mentioned below, "Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grand Jatte" is here, as are "American Gothic", Renoir's "Two Sisters", Caillebotte's "Paris Street: Rainy Day", Van Gogh's "The Bedroom", Monet's "Water Lilies" as well as his haystack series, and Hokusai's "The Great Wave Off Kanagawa".  Standing in front of these masterworks allows you to see them the way they were intended to be seen, and the difference in your understanding of the work is immediate.  Even if most people come to see the most famous works in the collection, there is so much more to the Art Institute that I imagine people often leave with new favorites that they have just seen for the first time.
