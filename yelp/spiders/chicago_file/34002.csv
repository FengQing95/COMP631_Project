Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We arrived before 6pm on a Saturday night. I appreciated Â that oldie/frenchy chicago restaurant feel when I walked in the dining room. Found a bar stool at the end of the bar for the date and had a couple of cocktails. I then asked the bartender if we can grab one of the cocktail tables to have dinner. After the evening specials were announced, I told the bartender that we were not in hurry so we will hug the table all night. Wife and I shared all dishes.
