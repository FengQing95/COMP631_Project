Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////From reading the reviews on yelp, it seems that the locals love it and the visitors were disappointed. Maybe Lou's pizza is what tastes good to Chicago taste buds? Or maybe there is a secret code where you have to ask them to make it crisp? I don't know...I just know I came expecting a great pizza and got an OK one instead.
