Little Goat Diner////We started with an order of the onion rings and fried pickles that are served with ranch and a curry mayo...because who doesn't love an entire plate of fried goodness?! I really enjoyed the breading and loved the curry mayo...great start to our indulgent meal! For mains I had the Patty Melt and my friend had the Pork Belly Pancake. Both were very good but we both agreed that my Patty Melt was just beyondddd! Big juicy burger, yummy caramelized onions, all between delicious, buttery, pretzel rye. If you're looking for the perfect hangover food this would be it! We ended with the Tiramisu and Smoked Pork & Toffee Crunch shakes. I wasn't very happy with my choice of the smoked pork shake-I love my pork, but the smokey, bacon-y taste just didn't work in the milk shake. The tiramisu was the clear winner here.
