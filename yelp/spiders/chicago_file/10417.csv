Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute in Chicago is a world-class art museum. Grant Wood's American Gothic is just one of many beauties in their permanent collections. Not enough - how about Gustave Caillebotte's Paris Street; Rainy Day or Edward Hopper's Nighthawks (this alone is worth the price of admission IMO). Look up this museum on line and see for yourself - the collection here is worth getting on a plane for.
