Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So...I really always thought of myself as a devout lover of NY style pizza that could never love Chicago style pizza as much. Well, I have never had Chicago style pizza before. And that is because I have never been to Chicago and never trusted anything deemed "Chicago style pizza." After extensive research and gaining approval from some locals, my husband and I settled on Lou's. We were not sure how much pizza to order because we can typically devour a large thin crust pizza. So we figured 2 smalls would allow us to indulge while having the chance to get a couple different kinds. We opted for plain cheese deep dish and the Malnati classic pie. The classic was by far our favorite but the cheese was so good as well.
