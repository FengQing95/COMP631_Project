Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The dry aged ribeye...A 60 dollar steak (22 oz) made me skeptical but I thought what the heck why not try the best Bavette's has to offer? The result was the best steak I have had in my life. The outside was seared and had a lot of smoky flavor and the inside simply melted in your mouth. The sauce it comes with was a good companion and so was the steak salt. For toppers we got the mushrooms which were ok but a little too pricey for my taste. 5/5
