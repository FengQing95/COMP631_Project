Art Institute of Chicago////Absolutely world class.  The museum is gigantic.  There is no way you can do it all justice in one day so I'd recommend striking out into one area and immersing yourself.  I'm the type that likes to read labels and ponder new things rather than run through galleries looking for famous names.  That being said, if famous names are your interest there are plenty of them in the collections and the museum also gets lots of the biggest/best touring shows out there.
