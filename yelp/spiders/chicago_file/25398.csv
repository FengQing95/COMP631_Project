Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They had verrrrrry long wait-times, but I did like that you could pre-order your pizzas while on the wait-list so that it would be prepared by the time you sat down. Â I can understand a small eating space, but we ended up sitting right in the front area, right near where people were standing and waiting, and it was a bit off-putting that they would be leaning right near us with their elbows hanging over our table.
