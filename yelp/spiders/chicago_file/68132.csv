Little Goat Diner////We got the Machos Nachos and the Tonkatsu Sandwich. Machos Nachos were SO GOOD and the portion was huge. We split them between the two of us and I still had leftovers for two meals after. The Tonkatsu Sandwich was really good as well. It was actually two pork cutlet sandwiches stacked on top of each other.
