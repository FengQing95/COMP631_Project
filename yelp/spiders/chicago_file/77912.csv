Little Goat Diner////I started with a mimosa while waiting but recognized everyone around me drinking a bloody Mary.  Once I was seated, I had another look at the drink menu and the bloody mary with kimchi sounded fantastic so I decided to give it a try.  This would be on the top of my list for best bloody mary in Chicago.  I just started drinking bloody mary's less than a year ago so I've only gotten to try a handful of places.
