Little Goat Diner////Main course: Feeding my inner 6 year old, I chose the tuna melt. I mean hey, I already had the mac n' cheese I may as well throw in an old fashioned classic sandwich. So it was the sandwich of the week. Yay right? Well kind of...the tuna salad itself was AWESOME! Supahh fresh....BUT it came with some sort of cheese sauce. I guess I really wasn't sure what I was expecting, seeing as the menu literally says "cheese sauce", but it was just way messier/creamy that I had imagined and it made the overall feel of the sandwich very HEAVY. Honestly, it was good, just don't expect to do ANYTHING the rest of the day because this tuna melt will down right fatigue you. bleh
