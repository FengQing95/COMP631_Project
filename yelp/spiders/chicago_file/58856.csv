Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place has been around forever for a reason! It's damned delicious. On the most recent visit, we had Catalan style crystal bread (manchego on the side), marinated olives, garlic potato salad, deviled egg (singular ), and vegetable paella. There are plenty of vegan options if you ask the server, and service is friendly and attentive. It's busy in a festive way
