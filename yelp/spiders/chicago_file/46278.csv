Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Dessert Tapas: We all split three desserts and if I had my way, I would have had one all to myself they were so good! We had the truffle chocolate cake, apple crisp, and the almond caramel tart. I have to say that the caramel tart was my favorite but the chocolate cake was a very close second, my guests liked the cake best though. They are small servings and a bit cheaper than the other tapas, so make sure to order a couple! Save room because I feel like these tapas were the highlight of the dining experience!
