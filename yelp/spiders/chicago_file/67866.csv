Little Goat Diner////Great diner, reasonable prices. After reading some of the other reviews I wouldn't go at a busy time, but my friend and I have gone for an early lunch around 11:30 twice and got a table shortly. The food is quirky, unusual combinations of ingredients and just delicious. I would strongly recommend the fish tostada with avacado and a slaw of chickpeas and cabbage!! A large portion, it blew my diet, but it was worth walking an extra mile or two and having an apple for dinner.
