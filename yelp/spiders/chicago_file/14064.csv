Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was the last deep dish pizzeria we tried on our recent visit to Chicago.  We only waited around 15 minutes despite being told it was about 30-35 minutes.  I appreciated being able to pre-order the pizza and the text message set up for the wait list.  We ordered a small Lou's classic deep dish for 2 of us, an individual house salad (which was actually sized for 2 people), and the tre dolci dessert (chocolate chip cookie, peach cobbler, and tiramisu).  The pizza was delicious. All the ingredients were very fresh. The crust was good, but could have been a little more buttery.  Other than that, it was excellent and now one of my favorite places.  I will definitely eat there again on our next visit to Chicago.  The salad was decent, nothing special, and the dessert was pretty good.
