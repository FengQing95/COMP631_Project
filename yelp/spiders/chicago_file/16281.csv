Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////But what was a surprise was that I found their house "Malnati salad" to be refreshing and delicious.  They used a perfectly sweet vinaigrette to pair with their fresh salad, which included Romaine lettuce, olives, Gorgonzola, salami, fresh tomatoes, and romano cheese.  It was a great way to start out the meal and I'd recommend it to you as a great thing to pair with the heavy deep dish pizzas.
