Smoque BBQ////   I do not mind sharing my food, especially when I am drinking.  But, for Christs sake! don't eat it all!!!!  For 4 of us, we had pulled pork, baby back ribs, st. louis style ribs and brisket. Sounds like it should be enough food, but not for my friends!! I only wanted brisket, and maybe a bite of corn bread to soak up some of the alcohol....  Good thing I did not want to try everything, it would not have been possible!  But, everyone smiled when accused of being pigs , and then raved about how great it was!
