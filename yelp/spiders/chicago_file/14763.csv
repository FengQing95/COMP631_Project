Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've been here now twice and I will try others, but I can definitely recommend this place to other.  I try to stay away from franchise restaurant cause I like to find the most original or authentic type of cuisine.  I think this franchise has two other locations, but this one is pretty good.  I will definitely try other places to give yelp reviewers and browser a better perspective, but for now, if you've never been to Chicago or visiting through, then I recommend Lou Malnati's!
