Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Operationally, this place is like Kaizen-heaven. Yes, there is always a line. But they're efficient and as a former supply chain manager, that's my sweet spot. When you arrive, you give your name and phone number. That puts you on the list and they give you updates on where you are in line. Then the hostess gives you a menu and recommends you order with the cashier, because a deep dish pizza takes a while to cook since it's so big.
