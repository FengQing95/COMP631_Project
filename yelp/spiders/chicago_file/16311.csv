Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I think our problem was that my guest and I really wanted different pizzas, and thus, we settled on lunch sized individual 6" pizzas. He chose the pepperoni, and I got the Lou - a white pizza with a garlic/spinach blend and mushrooms. We also started with the appetizer sampler.
