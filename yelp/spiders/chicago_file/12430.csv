Art Institute of Chicago////Clean, climate controlled and curated, exactly what our humid summers and frigid winters call for. Happy to see more diverse perspectives represented this season. Went for Bias's quilts and the Obama portraits and were not disappointed. It was a weekday but still pretty crowded so plan to spend a couple hours and just enjoy wandering instead of thinking of it was "waiting". Appreciated the clean WCs and look forward to the cafes opening back up soon. Be sure to give your local zip code if you live in the city to get a Chicago resident discount.
