Little Goat Diner////I went here on a recent afternoon/early evening when looking for De Cero. I was with a friend of mine that I wouldn't describe as a picky eater, but he's definitely particular.  I hadn't yet been to the Little Goat Diner and was eager to try it if only because Girl and the Goat is one of my favorite restaurants.
