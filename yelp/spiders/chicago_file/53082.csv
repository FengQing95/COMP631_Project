Smoque BBQ////The BEST mac and cheese I've found, and that includes Mom's.  Every bbq item is better than the one before.  The portions aren't huge, but they're adequate.  The joint is a joint, but cleaner and better maintained than the one you might expect.  The service is fast and the sensory memories linger, whether you eat in or take out.
