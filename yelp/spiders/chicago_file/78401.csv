Little Goat Diner////Food: fat Elvis waffles for me (waffles with peanut butter, banana, bacon maple syrup). Husband got some sort of burrito type dish which was really good but I can't remember the name. The waffles were really good, and really sweet. After a little less than half I couldn't take one more sweet bite. Wow! Will definitely cure a sweet tooth, but next time I'd get a side of hash browns or something to offset the sweetness a bit.
