Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Not sure why this place has such high ratings? It was just okay in my opinion. The oatmeal had a bunch of adds such as raisins and brown sugar that I was not a fan of. The California omelette we ordered was okay, but nothing spectacular. Maybe it's the lack of breakfast choices around that make this place special?
