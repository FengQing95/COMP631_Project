Little Goat Diner////What a cool concept Stephanie Izard has nestled herself in. The space was clean, open, and bright... and not exactly what I picture a diner as. Now let me start off by mentioning that I had a hangover from hell the day we went so this may or may not have impaired my judgment. The bloody mary did it's job, but it was not the best bloody mary I ever had or anything. My bf and I ordered the hot crab dip that came with ritz crackers to share as an appetizer. I wanted to love this so much, but it was too salty and rich for me. It looked like velveeta! We each had burgers, I had the patty melt and my bf had the Goat Almighty and again both fell short. Everything was too salty and my bfs just seemed like too much of a lot of things that didn't work so well together. We probably ordered the wrong things for our taste buds, but my bf refuses to give it another chance because it was pretty pricey for something neither of us liked. But I loved Stephanie on Top Chef and I want to love everything she does so I'll have to bring a friend here for breakfast food!
