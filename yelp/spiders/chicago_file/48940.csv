Smoque BBQ////We saw this place of DDD and since we were going to a Cubs game the following week we decided to check it out.  Boy are we glad we did!!  First of all, it is very convenient, right off I94 and close to Addison so we didn't have to go out of our way.  They have  a great system of getting people through quickly.  There was a line out the door when we got there, but it moved quickly.  Now to the food.  It was fantastic.  My husband and I shared the brisket platter and added a 1/4 slab of ribs. The brisket was probably the best I have ever had.  Tender a full of flavor.  same for the Ribs, nice and smokey, tender and juicy.   There is a dry rub on both of these and they didn't need the BBQ sauce that was provided on the side.  I didn't really care for the sauce, it was a thinner Carolina sauce, but like I said the meat was so good it didn't really need the sauce.  On to the sides- every platter come with Cole slaw.  I don't even like Cole-slaw but it looked so fresh that I decided to try it, and I am glad I did.  It was excellent.  Not a creamy dressing, but a lite one with may celery seed or poppy seed. the mac n' cheese was amazing!!  creamy and full of flavor.  The BBQ beans were made with the brisket, so it was smokey and sweet.  My friend had corn bread and it was sweet and moist and had real corn in it.  So I highly recommend this place!!
