Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Over the years that I have tried other renditions of deep dish pizza up and down California, such as Zachary's in Oakland. While they are all very good, there was just something about the crust at Lou Malnati's. There are numerous theories, whether it's the water, the oven, or the ingredients. All I know, I thoroughly enjoyed my deep dish pizza in Chicago.
