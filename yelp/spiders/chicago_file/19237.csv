Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I stopped in on Sunday afternoon, my cousin who lives in Chicago told me this is the best pizza in town. I sat at the bar and was served by the bartender. I waited about 20 minutes for my personal size deep dish cheese pizza. It was fresh and tasted good but a little underwhelming. I was told later I should have ordered the "Buttercrust" and get some toppings. I will definitely take this advice next time I am in town!
