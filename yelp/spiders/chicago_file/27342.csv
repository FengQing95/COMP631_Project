Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friends and I told the waitress. She acknowledged what happened and told the manager. He came to us and apologized - super friendly and understanding. Not once did he blame it on the workers or question if it was ours. He said "No one knows how it got there and things happen unfortunately so I apologize for that." This is the kind of manager we all love working with.
