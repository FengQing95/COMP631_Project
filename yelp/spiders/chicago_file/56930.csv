Smoque BBQ////Darling had the St. Louis ribs - indeed meaty, with a definite smokey smell and taste.  My pulled pork with extra sauce on the side was tender and tasty.  BYOB or partake of fountain drinks.  Semi-spiced fries - good but not exceptional.  Beans with onions and peppers, cornbread with visible corn pieces, drier cole slaw (good for the pulled pork), and mac and cheese with a baked crust in its own little cup -- all worth going back.  $27 including tax.  Not bad at all.
