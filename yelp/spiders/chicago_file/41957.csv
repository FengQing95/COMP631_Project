Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Just tried this place it was really good ,but I love tapas. We got the black raspberry sangria, it was pretty good. The tapas were really good. I highly recommend the squid, it was the best one that we got. The best part was our waiter was very helpful, and he gave us a free dessert when we had a hard time choosing between two.
