Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////While visiting Chicago I came here as this place was recommended, and my expectations were high. Overall, the pizza was bland and overrated. The crust was flaky and had no flavor. It wasn't terrible, but when you combine the hype plus the wait, you're expecting the best, this was not it. Next time I am in Chicago I will try other places.
