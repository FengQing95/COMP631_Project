Art Institute of Chicago////I visited on a Thursday evening which is a time that the museum is open to the public for free. What a deal. Museums are awesome. To think you can go to one for free is a no brainer. I drawn here by Van Gogh's bedrooms. Mostly everyone was here for this exhibit. I came with Northwestern ties so the entire experience was of no cost to me. The general public could pay a reduced price on Thursday evenings to take in this experience.
