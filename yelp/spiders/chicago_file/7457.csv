Art Institute of Chicago////Chicago would not be Chicago without the 8th Wonder of the World: the Art Institute! We took our own odyssey into the vastness of artistic sensibilities on display, as we wandered about and marveled at the works of many of the finest artists in human history, Truly awe-inspiring! The Greek and Japanese artifacts held me so spellbound, that my time allocation for touring the magnificent museum was constantly undergoing revisions - happily so. Good food on site and strolling art gardens augment the totality of the art for arts' sake excursion. Must do. Must see. My date and I capped off a perfect weekender by lazily enjoying ourselves - hand in hand, floor-by-floor.
