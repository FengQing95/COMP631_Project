Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was my first time visit, and as soon as I entered the room, someone was there to greet you. They were very busy on a Wednesday night. We had a reservation so we didn't wait long but if you don't, the wait was an hour and a half. You can stay by the bar area until your table is available.
