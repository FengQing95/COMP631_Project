Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////However, I'd say the winning factor in this whole meal was the Malnati salad! I know, another odd comment, right? Yes, I am saying the salad is my favorite at this pizza joint. But you gotta believe me, this is one of the best salads I've ever had. I would come back here just for the salad! I did contemplate it while I was visiting Chicago. With the right amount of sweet, tart, and savory, it's a hit!
