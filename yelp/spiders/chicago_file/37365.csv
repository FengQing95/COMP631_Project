Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Entrees: We both had the filet mignon, medium rare. The steaks were cooked as ordered (very pink middle) and had great flavoring. They gave us extra steak salt flavoring rub to sprinkle on top, which added a nice texture and flavor. Next time I plan to try the butter/garlic sauce. But I found the filet to be much more flavorful than many other steak joints in town. It came with a bernaise sauce on the side, was also very good.
