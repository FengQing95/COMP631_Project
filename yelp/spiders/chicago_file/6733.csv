The Purple Pig////We are from Dominican Republic and everyone recommended us to come here. We had reservations for Sunday but wouldn't make it so we decided to go on Saturday without reservation and although was a almost full, we got lucky and seated. We started with the Broccoli, Spanish Octopus and Pork Belly. I have to say, weren't expecting that the Broccoli would be THAT GOOD; it was amazing!!! Octopus was crunchy in the outside and soft in the inside; For the Pork Belly, I have to say that I have taste better. We were expecting to be crunchy and no. To finish we ordered the Tuna Tartare. This is a MUST! With their homemade Greek Yogurt oh my God!!!
