Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////BEST tapas place i've tried so far. Can't remember exactly what we ordered, but the fried potatoes were a little spicy and came with a yummy tomato cream sauce. The steak tapa was very very tender and the chicken kebab was very good as well.The stuffed mushrooms were also delicious! Â They have many different flavors of sangria...i tried the passion fruit sangria and it was VERY GOOD! I can't wait to go back!!
