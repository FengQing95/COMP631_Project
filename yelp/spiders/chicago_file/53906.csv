Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place can honestly do no wrong. Every time I go here I feel like I am at Hamilton. Every aspect of the meal is choreographed and perfectly executed. If given the opportunity to build a cot in the back room and stay for an extended stay, I would. If you don't get the ham and cheese croquettes, you may as well have sat home alone watching the Fyre Festival documentary. Also the butterscotch flan can marry me and leave me for my neighbor. I wouldn't be mad. I will love you forever Cafe Babareeba.
