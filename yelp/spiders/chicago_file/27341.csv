Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The waiter cut the pieces for us the second he brought it over and put it on our plates. Before I even get to take a bite of my own piece, my friends and I found a hair that we pulled out from the cheese from the remaining pizza slices on the pan lol I think it's kinda funny because so far our eating out experiences in Chicago have been terrible.
