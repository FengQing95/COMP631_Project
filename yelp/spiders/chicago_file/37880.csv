Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For food, we got half a dozen east coast oysters, bone marrow, fried chicken (my favorite), and rib eye. Oysters were fresh, but I guess you can't really mess up oysters. The bone marrow was very very yummy--but again, you can't really mess up fat. What I think really stood out were the fried chicken and rib eye. I am a fried chicken snob, the meat needs to be tender and juicy, and outside needs to be crunchy, but not too bready. I personally think this was one of the best fried chickens I've had, better than Joe's, and they gave you a LOT. I took home half of the fried chicken and it's my lunch the next day. My husband's rib eye was perfectly medium rare, seared to perfection. Enough said.
