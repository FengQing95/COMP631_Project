Little Goat Diner////I finally got a chance to have an great experience of dinning here. First I made reservation by open table. We got seated very quickly. There were crowded already even thought it's only 5 PM. No wonder why! The food is amazingly fast and delicious!! Service was great and friendly. I loved my entree its noodle seafood Dish. I noticed that they could accommodate a big party as well. This place is good for friends and family get together!
