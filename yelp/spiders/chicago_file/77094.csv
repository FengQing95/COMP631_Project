Little Goat Diner////I really wanted to LOVE LOVE this place but unfortunately it fell a tad below my expectations. It was still very good, but a little pricey for what it is. I ordered the sourdough pancakes ($11) which tasted and looked just like normal pancakes that I could get anywhere. My group enjoyed their dishes but everything is ala cart so you're going to pay extra for coleslaw or fries with your sandwich... that seemed a bit much.
