Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was super excited to try real Chicago deep dish for the first time. Let me start off by explaining how much I LOVE bread. It is the very essence of life to me. The crispiness it can give and also softness and when extra butter is involved... Ohhh man. So yes, I LOVE bread. Now, one of my favorite things to eat is pizza. I mean, it has bread (super important), but you also get other yummy items like tomato sauce, mushrooms, peppers, different types of meats, etc all in one dish. You'll noticed I didn't mention cheese and that's because I'm anti-cheese, but for pizza I will tolerate it.
