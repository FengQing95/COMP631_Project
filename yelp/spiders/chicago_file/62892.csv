Smoque BBQ////Just ok.  Beans tasted like they had been over smoked and ended up with a weird sour/bitter taste, slaw was just ok, Mac and cheese was boring - please use sharper cheddar.  Sausage was ok- quality was on par with aidels - but definitely store bought quality.  At 4.25 a link I was expecting better.  Brisket was good.. but missing a good spice flavor.  Maybe not my style?  Not sure, but definitely underwhelmed.   Most expensive BBQ spot I've been too, but mediocre quality.
