Little Goat Diner////Little Piggy Went To China: I think they alter their menu seasonally, because I've ordered this on two separate occasions and I swear it was a different dish. First time I had it, it was absolutely delicious. I grew up with Chinese food and was really impressed how they worked pretty authentic Sichuan flavors into traditionally Western biscuit, eggs, sausage breakfast sandwich. Perfect egg. However, the second time I ordered this when I was back a couple months later, they had added strawberries to the sauce?? Kind of muddled up the perfect flavor they'd had before and made it weirdly sweet, which didn't go well with the Sichuan pepper sauce. ): didn't enjoy it as much.
