Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is really hyped up, but failed to meet expectations. Garlic bread was hard and crusty, mozzarella sticks weren't hot enough and cheese didn't have the melted cheese it should have; it was tough. The pizza was most disappointing. Tried the Malnati and the pizza was thin, not very deep and the sauce was not that great. I have had better deep dish pizza in San Fransisco and they are not even known for pizzas smh. We asked for no whole tomatoes and they still put them in. Not worth the wait at all. Giordianos is WAY better. Two people and we quit on the first slice each.
