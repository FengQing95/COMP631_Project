Art Institute of Chicago////"Van Gogh's Bedrooms" was a spectacular installation that offered a large number of Van Gogh's works along with a timeline of his life's travels and a timeline of his work along with several sketches of his starting at the tender age of 11.  Many of these works I'd never seen and I've been to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam at least six times.  They even had a furnished layout of what Van Gogh's bedroom at the Yellow House in Arles looked like.  The audio tour was well worth it and provided the in depth information that helped bring the exhibition alive.
