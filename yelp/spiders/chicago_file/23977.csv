Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We actually got seated in about 15 minutes rather than half an hour. Our salad came first. I ordered it with dressing on the side, but when the salad came the dressing was no where to be seen. We were sitting in the corer by the window so it was hard to flag down a waiter to get dressing. However once we got to our waiter, he brought us the dressing soon after. Even though we preordered the pizza, we still waited for a some time for them. It's just the nature of the dish, so I would definitely recommend preordering the pizza.
