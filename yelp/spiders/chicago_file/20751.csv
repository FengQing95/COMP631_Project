Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Was dying to try a Chicago Deep Dish! Our flight got us in around 7:30 pm so some of our dinner choices had already closed for the day. We decided on this joint, why not start off our Chicago trip with a deep dish. Delicious! Exceeded expectations and definitely will return!
