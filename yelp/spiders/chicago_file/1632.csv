Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Breakfast for Lunch is sometimes what you need to make it through the day. I have never had a bad experience here. One reason I love this place is they have turkey options instead of pork sausage or bacon. It is so good to have an option. Â More places should do that. Having an option makes life easier. While everything I have eaten for breakfast has been great, my favorite non-breakfast item is the Chicken Salad w/ Strawberry Bread. The combination is delicious! Plus, there is usually enough Strawberry Bread to take home and eat later. The bread goes perfect with tea or coffee. I also love their Signature Iced Tea. It has a slight berry/floral flavor. As far as service and seating, the staff is super-friendly, even when it is busy. It can get extremely busy at lunchtime.
