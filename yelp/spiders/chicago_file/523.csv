Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We ordered an omelet each, with a side of pancakes.  Each omelet comes with hash browns and either toast or 2 buttermilk pancakes.  For $1 more, you can substitute the pancakes for one of their specialties (ie tiramisu, wildberry (fresh fruit), cranberry/pecan, etc).  HUGE serving of delicious food.  My BF and I could have easily been filled with just one omelet shared, but since we ordered 2.. we were completely stuffed (and we really only ate a bite or 2 of the hash browns since there was sooooo much food).  If we hadn't been heading to the airport afterwards, I would have taken some to go.. but as is, we stuffed ourselves to the point of almost popping with the delicious omelets and specialty pancakes (and didn't eat again until 5 PM that day).
