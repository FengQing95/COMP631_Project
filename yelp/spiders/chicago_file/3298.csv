The Purple Pig////The Purple Pig has been on my go-to list for ages, so I'm glad I finally got to try it.  We came on a Sunday evening and the wait wasn't too long.  We ordered a lamb dish, the half duck confit, scallops, and a pheasant dish.  The scallops blew me away, but the rest of the dishes were just average.  I felt like the meat wasn't cooked as consistently so some dishes seemed drier than others.  I did love the flavor of the duck though.  Overall, it was a bit on the pricier side, but the food was pretty good.
