Little Goat Diner////Went here for breakfast this morning for the first time! I heard great things from other people and It definitely lived up to its reviews. We had the Spanish omelette and It tasted authentic. The sausage patties were great and the pork belly potatoes tasted delicious. Other tables had food that looked even better than ours! Our only regret was not ordering more adventurous food cause everyone else's looked so delicious.
