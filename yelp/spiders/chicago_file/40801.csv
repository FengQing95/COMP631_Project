Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Congratulations Lettuce Entertain You! You have won me back! My last yelp was regarding Stella Barra, in which I swore off LEY forever. However I was invited to Ba-ba-reeba by friends and I had the time of my life...of course the server, Meredith, was on top of it at all times, unlike the server at Stella. We were in a hurry because we had theatre tickets and she kept those tapas coming! Some were hit or miss, but the miss was due to personal taste, not because it was bad...there was NOTHING bad there! My favorites were the white sangria ( how can I get the recipe?) of which we had a pitcher and a half for four people. The shrimp loaded with garlic, the goat cheese with tomato sauce, the stuffed mushrooms, beef tips with blue cheese....it was all so delicious. Dessert was to die for...a beautiful flan, and a chocolate custard that was amazing. Thank you Meredith! You made our experience very pleasant!
