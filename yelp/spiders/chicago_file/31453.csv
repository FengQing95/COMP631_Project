Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Both are two large pizzas didn't come with the pepperoni topping we asked for but they went above and beyond to accommodate us for the mistake. The manager came to apologize, personally, with free deserts in hand and they even gave us a discount for that inconvenience. Also, Zach was phenomenal. The food tasted delicious!!! We got the family Cesar salad with chicken, very well done Buffalo traditional wings, & lemon pepper traditional wings. Do not hesitate to come here.
