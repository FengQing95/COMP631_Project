Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Also of note was an excellent bartender who was happy to go off menu and make us a couple of cucumber gin gimlets.  They were excellent.  Although it started a trend at the bar, as people started asking what they were and can they have one.  They are a little time consuming, so I hope others tipped well and appreciated the work involved.
