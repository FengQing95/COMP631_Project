Art Institute of Chicago////I really enjoyed my visit here, it's a very well laid out museum with an impressive array of artwork.  The lighting and the architecture were just as impressive as the paintings and the sculptures.  I also love the fact that they let me take photographs of some of my favorite paintings, with the flash off of course.  Unfortunately I didn't have a ton of time to spend wandering around and so will definitely be back.  While you can see just about everything in a few hours it's a fast tour and I'd recommend leaving yourself the entire day.  The Art Institute is also near quite a park and the aquarium so the whole area is a great destination.
