Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What a great place. I heard from the Uber driver that you can call ahead and order your pizza to be started so that when you get there you don't have to wait as long if you're in a rush to get to the airport or somewhere. We didn't do that but when we got there it wasn't very busy. The pizza takes about 40 minutes to make but so worth the wait. The crust was perfectly crisp and there wasn't too much sauce. Just a great proportion of cheesy goodness. The minestrone soup was perfect! Not too salty and a great amount of noodles and soup goodies. Great place. Great food. Very enjoyable.
