Smoque BBQ////Each of us opted for the St. Louis Ribs ($16) and the Sliced Brisket ($14), and shared the meat. Mmm, the brisket here was definitely on point! It fell apart so easily, so you know it was very much on the tender side. We ordered our ribs dry-rub with their Memphis and Carolina sauces on the side. It was delicious as well, but I think I prefer the brisket. As for dipping sauce, the Carolina was definitely my choice- sweet and tangy!
