Art Institute of Chicago////We decided to check out the Edvard Munch exhibit per my friend Margaret's request. We took the audio tour, because nothing is hotter than huge headphones, and I was pleasantly surprised by how large the exhibit was. The works were organized more by similar topic than by when they were painted and I actually preferred it that way. There were a few funny moments, such as when I noticed that a work by Max Klinger called Abandoned Plate 5 had, what appeared to be, cloud fisting. There's also the fact that he associates all red-heads with vixens and corrupters (yes, yes we are).
