Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pricing is identical, and it does take a while to get your pie. Hey at least you know its fresh as fresh. Their salad is also very good. I woke up with a hangover and the salad settled my tummy before eating my pie. They sell the pizza and the salad dressing (I should have brought some home) but I only brought 3 pizzas home from this place.
