Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went with a group of 13. Got several recommendations to take a group here. Our server did a great job with our big group. Drinks and food came out very quickly. Drinks were great! Food was just OK, nothing fabulous....in fact the eggplant dish I had was well below my expectations. All in all, I would definitely recommend this place for a large group!
