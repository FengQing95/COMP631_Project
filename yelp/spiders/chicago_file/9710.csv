Art Institute of Chicago////Unfortunately we weren't able to spend much time in here except to peek at a few sculptures. However, would love to visit again to be able to see some Monet, Degas and van Gogh and their take on impressionism. And continuing on that note, it would be an honour to experience seeing the contemporary artworks of Dal√≠, Picasso, and Warhol. Not even slightly ashamed by all the name-dropping. It would be amazing to be able to stand and bask in their talent. In addition to their permanent exhibits, they also have changing special exhibits too- which I'm sure would be just as good as the stuff they keep 24/7/365.
