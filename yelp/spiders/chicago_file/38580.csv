Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For dessert we had to try the chocolate pie. I actually wasn't the biggest fan of it. It was good for about the bite when you get the whipped cream, filling and crust all in one go, but after that the texture and flavors become redundant and nothing too special unfortunately.
