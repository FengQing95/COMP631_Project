Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Man we can't even agree on Deep Dish pizza.  I know New York and Chicago have their issues, but apparently Chicago is confused on what is a deep dish pizza.  This is more like a pan pizza than a deep dish isn't it?  The crust was golden brown and crisped up nicely in the well oiled pan.  It had a nice pie crust raised up around the sides of the pan as well.  But sure enough like a skateboarder standing on the edge, I shouldn't be thinking that you can do a drop in.  It's like all the fillings sank in this pie and you were left with half a deep dish pizza.  We had sausage mushrooms and pepperoni, so there shouldn't have been a shortage of things to stuff this pie with.  I'd say it was only about 3/4 inch to 1 inch thick, which in the world of deep dish, really isn't that deep.
