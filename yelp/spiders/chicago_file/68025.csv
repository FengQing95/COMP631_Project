Little Goat Diner////Never going back. Went on a Sunday night so it wasn't very busy. One of the people I was with waited an additional 15 minutes for his club sandwich after the rest of us has gotten our food. I can see if it was busy and the kitchen was behind, or if it was a difficult order. It was a club sandwich. The drinks took forever and to be honest, the menu was just weird. Not worth the ridiculous amount of money we spent.
