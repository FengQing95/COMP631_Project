Smoque BBQ////I had the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich with chopped brisket and pulled pork.  I admit, the brisket was a little dry, but their BBQ sauce is outstanding and I doused my sandwich in it.  The sandwich was huge, half of it would have been filling enough with all the sides.  Sandwiches come with coleslaw and the choice of one another side.  I ordered the macaroni & cheese, which is the best macaroni & cheese I have had at any BBQ joint.  It was creamy and had a crunchy topping.  I usually don't like coleslaw, but it looked pretty good and I ate a few bites.  It's fresh, not that slimy stuff you see everywhere else.
