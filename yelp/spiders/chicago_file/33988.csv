Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I have been to Bavettes three times now and I have never been disappointed!!  Everything on the menu is spot on.  You can't go wrong with any of their steaks.  I personally really enjoyed the dry aged bone-in ribeye.  It's delish.  On this last visit, however, we ordered the lamb and I must say, it's definitely the BEST lamb I have ever had, but also the best item on the menu.  If you like lamb, you MUST try this!!!
