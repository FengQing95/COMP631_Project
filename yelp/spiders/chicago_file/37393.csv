Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I always get the Petite Duchess and a side for myself to avoid being uncomfortably full after inhaling the aforementioned bread. If you're feelin' like you want to treat yo self, add the bone marrow--then mop it up with more bread. Did I mention bread yet? Fuck. If you're lactose-intolerant or dairy-free: the elote-style corn is fucking delicious and it can be made without cheese, but it does contain butter. The brussell sprouts are a good alternative. Skip the fries.
