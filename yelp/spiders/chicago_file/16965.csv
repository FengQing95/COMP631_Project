Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Fantastic Pizza.  Great taste on all levels, sauce, crust, meat, cheese all came together for a great mouth watering experience.  Call ahead if you can to order as yes, it does take awhile to cook a deep dish pizza.   I have eaten at three other landmark pizza establishments in Chicago and this one is my favorite.  the left overs the next day were so delicious.  thanks Lou for doing it right.
