Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered the classic Malnati's pizza and added Pepperoni. Also ordered the fried calamari to enjoy as an appetizer while the pizza was being made. We were told it would take 40 mins for the pizza to come out and it really was 40 mins. Worth every minute though. The pizza was not that cheesy, had a huge full layer of sausage and then topped with delicious pepperoni slices made for heaven on a plate. The service was also very friendly and attentive. I would come back the next time I'm in Chicago!
