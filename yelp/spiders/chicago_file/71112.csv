Little Goat Diner////We went for late brunch on Sunday at 1:30pm and were pleasantly surprised by the short 15 minute wait. The chickpea salad was a delicious medley of kale, radishes, carrots, marinated onions tossed with montamore cheese & a light, tangy chee vinaigrette & served with a side of tzatziki. I opted to add grilled chicken, plentiful to make a healthy gal full & with all the leafy greens, it was easy to rationalise sipping on cava with a splash of orange juice.
