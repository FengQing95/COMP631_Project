Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is lit!!! Came here for happy hour on a Wednesday night and it was poppin'. The happy hour special is only at the bar so probably go in groups of 2 or 3. We got a pitcher of the red sangria for $16 (6-7 big cups) and bacon wrapped dates, spicy potatoes, and the beef empanadas with the happy hour special. We also ordered the short rib and fried chicken from the regular menu, as recommended by our waiter/bartender. All of the tapas were REALLY GOOD and pretty filling for two people. I would definitely get all of them again but my personal favorite was the bacon wrapped dates. The combination of sweet and savory and the different textures just work so well together. Our waiter/bartender was really nice and even changed the channel on the bar TV when we asked. The only thing that wasn't great was that he never gave us our complimentary bread even though we asked for it twice!! Still love this place though, it's well-priced and delicious so I'll definitely be coming again.
