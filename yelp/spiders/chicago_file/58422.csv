Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went to celebrate daughter's birthday. Server was great - circled favorite items on the menu as suggestions. Ordered nine different tapas - stuffed dates, spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms, iberica ham & manchego cheese, grilled octopus, shrimp, burrata & avocado toast, octopus salad, steak skewers and goat cheese and tomato sauce, bacalado croquettes, and the seafood paella.
