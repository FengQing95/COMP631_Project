Smoque BBQ////Smoque nails the taste.  One star is deducted for the somewhat chaotic seating arrangements.  Once you give your order you wait for an open table where the staff will seat you.  Except there's no place really to stand so you end up standing amongst the people dining and getting their fountain drinks.
