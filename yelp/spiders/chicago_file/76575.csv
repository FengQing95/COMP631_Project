Little Goat Diner////We came here for brunch on the weekend.. make sure to make resos, gets rammed.. the Cinnabun was ooey gooey fluffy deliciousness.. I had the pork belly scallion pancake.. was flavorful and delicious.. it said bok choy salad but there was no bok choy sadly.. it was slaw but still good, that was the only disappointment.. no other complaints.. my husband ordered the chocolate chip pancakes.. they were huge and fluffy... our friends ordered the this little piggy went to China and bullseye French toast.. everyone enjoyed their meals and we will definitely be back to try the rest.. service was great and it was sunny and warm in the diner.. definitely recommend
