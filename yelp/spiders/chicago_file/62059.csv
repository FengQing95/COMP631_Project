Smoque BBQ////I stepped up and ordered a pulled pork sandwich a la carte and a brisket platter entree with french fries and peach cobbler as my two sides. I was even offered, "For here, or to go?' I ordered carry-out and sat down to wait. My number was called and I was handed a bag full of piping hot food that smelled delicious. When I got to the car I noticed it wasn't even 9 o'clock yet. Wow, quick service.
