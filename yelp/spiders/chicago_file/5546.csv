The Purple Pig////This is sooo long overdue! The aunt took the gf and I because she was raving about her favorite app, the BEETS!!! They should be called "heartBEETS"  instead because they not only tug, but yank! on your heart strings and surprise you throughout each bite! The whipped up, fluffy,  goat cheese, and the slightly sweet pistachio butter complement the roasted beets so well!!
