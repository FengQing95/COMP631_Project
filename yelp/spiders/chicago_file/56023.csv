Smoque BBQ////It took about 30-minutes to reach the cashier to place our order. There was an employee keeping tabs on the line trying to arrange proper seating for the groups. I counted at least 14-employees, which I find incredible for a restaurant of this small size. I would estimate the restaurant occupies no more than 2,000 square feet. I doubt the seating capacity exceeds 50 - 60 patrons.
