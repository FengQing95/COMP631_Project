Smoque BBQ////Finallyyyy made my way here last weekend after waiting WAY too long to make a visit. Holy crap, this place is good. I went with my boyfriend who had been several times, so he knew exactly what to order (thank god because it all looked good). We went with one platter of sliced brisket and one platter with a half slab of St. Louis ribs. For sides, we got the mac and cheese, BBQ beans, fries, cornbread, cole slaw, and a cup of BBQ gumbo on the side. Everything was so, so, so (I could go on), good! The sauces on top of it all were delish. I left very full and very satisfied. Can't wait to go back!
