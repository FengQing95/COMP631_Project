Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Probably what most impresses me about Sodikoff's slew of restaurants is his consistency. I know with confidence that when I eat at any one of his places I will get good food. I can barely keep up with his pace of openings (it seems just yesterday I enjoyed my first Pickleback at Au Cheval), and yet I am always eager to try his latest and greatest venture.
