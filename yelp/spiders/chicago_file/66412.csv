Little Goat Diner////If your looking for a bit of adventure on a menu coupled with a great staff and drink options, Little Goat is your place.    This was my second time here and I am already thinking of my next trip and what to try.  The atmosphere is a great alternative for those that need comfort food with an twist and can't wait four months to get into the Girl and the Goat.   The space is clean with wonderful booths and communal tables so if you fear closeness or folks listening to your conversation, you will need to wait for a booth which is hard to come by.  I had a great brisket sandwich while my dining partner in crime had the shrimp and grits.    Amazing portion size and wonderful flavors.  The best piece of the night was the crazy sundae called Cheez-it which included strawberry, peanut butter ice cream and chocolate covered Cheez-it.   Though my friend Anne and I were intrigued and worried, it was absolutely the best item that night we had.   Once again, if you are willing to think outside the box and dive into strange combinations, you will find Little Goat Diner might be your new home.
