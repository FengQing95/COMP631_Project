Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Regarding service, everyone who works here was super friendly and enthusiastic. and HELPFUL. My friend who paid by card, forgot her card there and realized when we were almost back at our hotel. We called and asked them to hold onto it for us past their closing time. They said no problem. We got there ~10 min past 11 pm, and after checking my friend's ID returned it to her. We didn't get the chance to catch their names, but to the staff of Lou Malnati's, THANK YOU!
