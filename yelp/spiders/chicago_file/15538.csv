Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Yummy pizza! I went in for a late lunch and I had the sausage and pepperoni. I love the ratios of all the ingredients, but the best thing about the pizza is the crust. When you think of butter crust, you don't realize how light it's going to be. The bottom had a nice crunch and the sides were perfect and thin. I might need to order some online :)
