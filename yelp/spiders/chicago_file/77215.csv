Little Goat Diner////Omg. This place is amazing. I went here for the first time with coworkers and we were all very impressed. I ordered the fish tostadas and we had the onion rings and fried pickles for the table. The tostadas were huge and delicious. The fish was absolutely delicious. I'm definitely not a picky, eater but I don't like a lot of random things on my food. This tostada was covered in random things, but apparently every last food item on it was needed because the flavor was amazing.
