Little Goat Diner////Ambiance: It's a cute diner with some aesthetics borrowed from the OG G&tG.  I'd definitely bring a date here and family too.  It is a fair bit pricier than a regular diner but the meals are unique and tasty so take a chance!!  Plus its easier to find a reservation here as well :) 4.5/5
