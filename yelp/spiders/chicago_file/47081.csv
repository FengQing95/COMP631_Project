Smoque BBQ////I love the Brisket, it's was very tasty. I have never eating Brisket before in my life. I moment I walked in I said I was going to try it. I live about 45 minutes away and that's on the E way. It's worth the trip. I took a friend of mine there and she lives in Woodridge and she's ready to go again. Delicious food, the next time I go I will try the Mac and Cheese.
