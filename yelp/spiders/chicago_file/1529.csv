Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Nice service, good prices, large menu selection - all good. I am giving it a 3 because the food was ok. Not bad, but not a 4 either. Had omelettes, crepes, eggs benedict, GF pancakes, chicken wrap. Like I said for food selection was good as were prices. But the food itself was average. Not sure if I would go again while in Chicago - would probably try someplace new.
