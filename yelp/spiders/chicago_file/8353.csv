Art Institute of Chicago////I must say up front that I'm not a great lover of art, but I do like the message that try to convey and the detail of the paintings.  Like most things in Chicago, the admission price will knock you off of our feet, almost forty bucks for two people.  I thought at that price you got to take a painting home.  The thing that really got to me is the security guards, turn around there is a guard - turn a corner another guard.  Out of all the guards that we encountered, only two were actually sociable.
