Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's a Chicago classic that I bring visiting family and friends while touring downtown. It's pretty busy on weekends and during peak hours, but service is always nice and there's always a friendly and energetic vibe. Can't go wrong with the Malnati classic deep dish with the sausage baked right in. The vegetarian version isn't bad either. And something that is delicious and unexpected here is the calamari. YUM!
