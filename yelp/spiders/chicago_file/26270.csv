Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza was good but not worth the hype. Service was horrible!  Waited an hour to be seated which was okay given the hype.  Waited at table 10 minutes before we searched for a manager to ask for service. Manager took our order and it took 90 minutes to receive the pizza.  To his credit, he offered a free appetizer. Waiter was so slow all evening. Charged us for the appetizer. Took 30 minutes to remove the appetizer charge and get our bill. Then another 15 minutes to run our credit card. We will never be back. Way too slow. Asked to see a manager again and the first manager had gone for the day. Second manager said he would talk to waiter about getting our bills to us. Checks were again wrong so my party left frustrated.  Ugh. Don't patronize them!
