Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came to the restaurant  for a birthday dinner with 9 adults. No one in my party has had tapas before. Before we order we were told by our waiter that they were smaller portions of food and were good for sharing. Once we all placed our orders and received our dishes, we realized that the waiter couldn't have been more wrong! The portion sizes, compared to the price, was absolutely ridiculous! I have never, in my life, paid so much for so little. The portions that were served were not even fit to feed the individual that ordered it, let alone to share. I am absolutely angry and  supremely displeased with this establishment. Everyone in my party left this place hungry. We ended up going to another local restaurant to finish eating because everyone was still starving. I don't know how something like that can happen.  I would recommend to place photos of your items on menu, so guests know just what they are getting themselves into before paying an outrageous bill.  I will not be eating here again.
