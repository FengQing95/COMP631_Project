Art Institute of Chicago////I had seen the Art Institute of Chicago on the tour guides and between the other things to see I thought I would add it to the list as an addendum, something I'd walk through briskly on the way to see other things. I was wrong. There was so much to see that I ended up forgoing the rest of the day and stayed hours upon hours wandering the halls just trying to soak it all in.
