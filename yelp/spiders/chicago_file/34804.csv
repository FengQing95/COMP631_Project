Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The complimentary bread with whipped butter was delicious. We followed by the peppered duck and goat cheese terrine with apricot mustard. Oh dear. Love at first bite (that was corny but shut up and listen). Rich, savory, succulence easily spread on the crunchy toasts. The apricot mustard cut the peppery-ness of the dish.
