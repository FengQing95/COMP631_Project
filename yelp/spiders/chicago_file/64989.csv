Smoque BBQ////The platters each come with two individual sides, and hands down our favorites were the baked beans and the mac & cheese. I've never tasted beans like these before. They were smoky and downright delicious! As for the later, the baked layer of crust on top was perfect in trapping the cheesy goodness underneath.
