Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This last time I went for dinner, service was above and beyond. Thank you so much Hector for being so knowledgeable about gluten free diets.  I recently started a gluten free diet and am still figuring out what I can and cannot eat/drink.  He checked with the bar that the drink I ordered didn't have gluten since he was concerned that the vodka might contain gluten but it turned out that the drink was gluten free.  He brought out gluten free bread for me as well as a gluten free menu.  It seemed a little slower than usual that night so he told me that if there weren't any options on the gluten free menu that I liked, he could talk to the chef about making some of the other dishes for me gluten free (SO SWEET!).
