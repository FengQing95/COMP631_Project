Little Goat Diner////I'm a fan of Girl and the goat, so how could we not try this place on a cold Sunday afternoon right after the diner had opened? And so we came and tried. However, the diner menu items didn't seem as appealing as the bakery part of the restaurant so we went straight back to the bakery. It was packed. Like the full bar was full of people but the hostess told us we could go upstairs for now since that part was still under "construction." And that top part was adorable, white tables and chairs, gleaming light coming through, a nice kitchen where I'm assuming all cooking classes and events will be. The place is just adorbs.
