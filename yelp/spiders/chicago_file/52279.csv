Smoque BBQ////I'd seen Smoque featured on a TV show highlighting the best BBQ joints in America a couple years ago and since I love ribs I was so excited to try it out when I finally stumbled across it while returning from my favorite Filipino restaurant.  It was a huge letdown after the hype I'd seen on the TV show.  The food was just ok and  overpriced for what you get.  There were 3 of us and not a single one of us was impressed.  At the prices they charge they really need to be serving great ribs and not just ok ones.  Will I return in the future?  It's pretty unlikely since there have got to be a hundred really good BBQ joints in this fine city so I'm off to search on Yelp for someplace else with outstanding ribs.  If you do decide to try this place go in with low expectations and hopefully you'll be pleasantly surprised and find out that we just hit them on a bad day.
