Little Goat Diner////We heard a lot about the main restaurant. So when we were in Chicago, we decided to go here instead since the reservations for the main was booked months in advance. This place is an Asian fused with American Diner classics. Wife got the Japchae and I got the Tonkatsu sandwich. Both had good intentions of wanting to be good. Japchae had good flavors but the cold and hot ingredients didn't mix well. The tonkatsu had the thinnest piece of meat ever. The sauce didn't go well either. Would recommend it if your palette was not diverse.
