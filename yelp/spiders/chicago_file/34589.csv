Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Everything was pretty good including ribeye.   What's really pathetic is that the best thing I loved about this place was the vibe, setting and the free freaking bread they give you.  Yes the free bread was best thing I had all night!  God I'm such a low class loser but bread was like wow like totally n stuff.  I don't know exactly what kind of bread it was either.  Couldn't put my finger on it.  Like sour dough'ish but it isn't, etc...it was like hermaphrodite of breads but it was freaking gooooood!
