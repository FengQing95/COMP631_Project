Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago! I believe it is a 5* place for food and service. I will endure the backed up traffic drive in and trouble with finding parking for the wonderful food and staff. Rachel, was the standout this time. She went over and beyond to serve us with a smile and efficiency.
