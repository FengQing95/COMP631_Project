Little Goat Diner////As huge Girl and the Goat fans, we were excited to finally dine at Stephanie Izard's Little Goat Diner. Although we had been to Little Goat Bread several times before (and even got to meet Stephanie in person!) we had struggled getting seats in the Diner on various occasions (we're not ones to wait ~2 hours for a table...). However, we visited on an off hour this time and got lucky, because we walked in to the gorgeous diner and were immediately seated! The waitstaff was excellent; very friendly and in line with the staff at Izard's original restaurant across the street. As expected, the place was crowded. Definitely the place to try in Chicago right now.
