Art Institute of Chicago////The visiting exhibits are always worth a look. I have seen a special exhibit on Impressionists and the current Monet. I do wish museum staff would better control the flow of people in that exhibit. They are managing it with a virtual line; you receive a text when it is your turn. But it was still very crowded and difficult to move around. While we enjoyed Monet, we aren't diehard fans, so we scooted through to spend our time in the other galleries. I think staff should let in smaller groups of people in 10-minute waves instead of a constant stream of people piling in on top of one another. Also, there was a couple in line behind us when we showed up for our time. They seemed distressed because they didn't have tickets and it was sold out online. While I was glad to see they got to view the exhibit (and were right behind us moving through the rooms), obviously, the staff let them in without a ticket. If they're doing that frequently, that bottlenecks the exhibit even more.
