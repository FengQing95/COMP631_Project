Little Goat Diner////There was a little confusion re: drinks--I ordered the bloody mary, BF ordered a mimosa, we both received bloody marys, and then when we pointed out the miscommunication, it took like 15 minutes for his mimosa to arrive (much to our server's confusion as well). That little blip in service aside, the bloody mary was PHENOMENAL. The kimchi really adds an interesting and unique flavor and I was loving every sip. The coffee was also great.
