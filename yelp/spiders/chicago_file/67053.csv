Little Goat Diner////First time traveling to Chicago and a friend had suggested this place, so we decided to try it out. Absolutely fantastic food. The Bull's Eye French Toast was to die for! Everyone at the table loved their meals. Our waitress even took the time to give us the rundown on shopping areas and places to see. I wish I could go back right now and try out the rest of the menu!
