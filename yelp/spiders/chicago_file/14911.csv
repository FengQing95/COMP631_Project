Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Highly overrated place. I don't normally give such a bad review, but everything went wrong during our first, last, and only time here. We waited patiently about 1 hr to be seated, which was expected. No problem there. We pre-ordered our pizza because it takes at least 30mins to cook. When we got our table, we also ordered two salads, soup, and wings. Which all came AFTER the pizza. When they were serving our pizza, they completely forgot cook two of our pizzas. The pizza cheese was rubbery and excessive, the wings tasted dry (as if cooked from frozen and put into the microwave), and the soup tasted out of a can. The salad was very delicious, surprisingly! When Paying for our check, our server, Kate, managed to over charge 3 of our cards THREE times on three out of 5 cards! I do NOT recommend this place at all. Small place, bad service, sub par food, mandated gratuity for our bad service.
