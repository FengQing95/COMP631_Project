Little Goat Diner////We found ourselves stopping at the Little Goat coffee shop a few times during our weekend stay in the city. They had lots of different options and I got to try both their hot cider and their coffee. On the Sunday that we were leaving, we also stopped off at the diner for breakfast after a night long of partying. It was the perfect end to our weekend.
