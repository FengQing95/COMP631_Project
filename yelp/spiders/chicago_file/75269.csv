Little Goat Diner////While visiting Chicago, my husband and I decided to try Little Goat Diner and we were not disappointed! We started out with their ooey gooey cinnamon roll and it was one of the best we ever had! My husband had the corn beef hash and enjoyed it a lot; and I had a special of the day with fried egg, bacon, avocado, and a summer tomato medley, with a side of hash browns. All of my food was absolutely delicious!! I recommend trying brunch here while you're in Chicago!
