Little Goat Diner////I ordered the little goat latte...which wasn't bad, it was interesting, but it really made you feel like you should be smearing your drink on a cracker and eating it, rather than drinking it like a latte.  I ordered the shrimp and grits as my main entree and we shared a side of fries for the table.  I loved my shrimp and grits, full of flavor and richness and they give you a decent portion of shrimp for $12!  My other friends ordered the reuben, the breakfast burrito and the fried pickle sandwich.  Each order was as decadent and rich as they sounded and delicious!  I think my only complaint was that my stomach hurt a little from all of the rich food I consumed over lunch.
