Art Institute of Chicago////       I loved this impressionistic/pointillism painting. The Art Institute of Chicago gave me a newfound appreciation for this piece of art by explaining it and placing the artists' prior sketches in the same room. I've only seen replicas and snapshots of this painting before. I didn't realize that the painting was wall-sized!
