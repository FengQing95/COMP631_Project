Little Goat Diner////For a first time visit, I wasn't sure where to start. The $20 goat burger was really sounding interesting, but then the waiter mentioned the evening's "blue light special" which was... deep fried pig's tail?! I have never had deep fried pig tail before, but looking at all of the delicious looking plates coming out of the kitchen, I wasn't nervous and took the plunge.
