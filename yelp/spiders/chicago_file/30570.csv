Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A few other notes.....It's great that you can order your pizza while you are waiting for a table.  It takes 40 minutes to make a pie, so this way you don't have to wait too long.  I also enjoyed the stuffed spinach bread, which had a nice crunchy outside stuffed with spinach, melted cheese, and garlic.  Again served with their excellent marinara sauce.
