Smoque BBQ////My pulled pork sammy was delicious, and hit the spot right where i wanted it.  Dumped the coleslaw and the sauce on the sandwich, and was good to go.  Ate the shit out of it.  I really like the sauce; it's tangy and flavorful.  Typically I'm all about the spicy-as-possible but I actually quite like the combo of meat-bread-slaw-sauce this sandwich delivers--no spice needed.  The fries are greaaaaaaaaaat, too.  Some day I'll try some of this Texas sausage, 'cause it sounds great.  Mum liked her food too - tho she's generally easy to please.
