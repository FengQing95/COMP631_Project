Little Goat Diner////Everything was wonderful! The smoked pork & toffee milkshake was sooooo good! It just has a hint of bacon & not overwhelming. Loved the little pig went to China...the diverse flavors explode in your mouth! And the fat club so tasty...the best blt variation I've had. The fat Elvis waffles were killer sweet but very good for those with a massive sweet tooth. Great service too.
