Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What a great steak dinner! We enjoyed well-crafted drinks at the chic bar before being seated downstairs in the parlor. The music was good and the ambience was dark and intimate... a welcome change from the hustle and bustle of the large dining area upstairs. We started with the duck terrine and lyonnaise salad- both wonderful. Bavette's sourdough bread is also very good and I had to check myself from eating too much. My date ordered the small filet and I had the Chicago-cut ribeye, both dinners paired with wonderful red wine. We had the mashed potatoes as a side. I found them to be a tad too buttery but then again I'm a mashed potato snob. Our steaks were cooked to a perfect temperature and were seasoned on point. Service was excellent- we never felt rushed. We will certainly be back again.
