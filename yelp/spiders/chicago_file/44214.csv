Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm a big fan of tapas and was not disappointed in our meal. Our bill came to $77 before tip, which was not bad at all, considering we had gotten a pitcher of sangria. Unfortunately we were too full to try dessert, but they looked really good (we drooled over some at the table next to us), so I will definitely try them on a future visit.
