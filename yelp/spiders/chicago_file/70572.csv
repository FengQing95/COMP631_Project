Little Goat Diner////Such a cute atmosphere. The dinner menu has everything you'd want and the drink menu has even more! It's such a shame the service was mediocre  compared to the food. The male bartender  was constantly working but the female bartender only paid attention to the regular customers and ignored the rest of us. I'm not sure if this was the way they usually divided the workload but was a little off putting.
