Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////To drink with dinner, we brought our own wine. Though they don't shout it from the rooftops, Bavette's has a limited BYOB policy where they allow you to bring one bottle of wine (which can save you a few bucks, that you'll in turn spend with them.) The best part of the BYOB policy is the corkage fee, which requires you to share a glass with another table. Given that the evening was slowing down (it was late, and it was a snowy night, resulting in some cancellations), Amy allowed my boyfriend to basically walk around the restaurant and choose the lucky winner. Though it required a LOT of explanation on his end since the BYOB policy isn't commonly known, it was greatly appreciated by the other patrons.
