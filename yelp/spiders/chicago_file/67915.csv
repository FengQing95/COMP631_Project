Little Goat Diner////It's a decent place, but as I and my friends have found, it kind of gets progressively worse each time you go. I've really had some great stuff here, but other times have been underwhelming. On balance, it's good -- I think the goat chili cheese fries and loco moco have been consistently the best things to get. It just pales in comparison to its big sister across the street.
