Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When I was told we were eating lunch at lou malnati, my first thought was should we be hanging out with the illuminatis. But I soon found out that they're not the same thing. This is the typical chicago pizza you picture in your head. It was very good, but Im not a big fan of the chunks of tomatoes in the sauce. I really enjoyed their buttery crust though. Just a heads up, it typically takes 45 min to cook pne of their pizzas. Once you see the thickness, you will understand why. My fiance who has recently been on a diet even indulged since we are on a little get away. Even though her boobs have been shrinking, she still got pizza sauce on her shirt. She really enjoyed the pizza.
