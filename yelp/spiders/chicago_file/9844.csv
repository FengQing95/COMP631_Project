Art Institute of Chicago////The art institute is a world class display of art. Well-organized, beautifully classified, and expertly curated, the art here is always impressive and educational. The photo exhibits are always thought provoking. Currently(2018) there are some wonderful photos exhibiting black Muslims in the city of Chicago, an often untold story that highlights the charms of the fair Windy City. I spent the majority of my extra time in he Charles White exhibit, he is now one of my favorite artists. I recommend that you spend a full day here if you truly want an opportunity to enjoy all the museum has to offer.
