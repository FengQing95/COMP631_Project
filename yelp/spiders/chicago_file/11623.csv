Art Institute of Chicago////A true world-class museum. My favorite is the Impressionist collection. The Art Institute houses the most important piece of French art outside of Paris: "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte" by Georges Seurat; the title has been shorted in recent years to, "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte." Â I think seeing this masterpiece is worth the admission price ($20-$25) alone.
