Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was ok. Very ok. After waiting over an hour for a table, I was hoping for a little bit more than ok. I'm not going to complain about the wait - they were up front about it, and they have a very solid text/app that tells you exactly where you are in line. We took advantage of this part and left to go have a drink elsewhere first. Before leaving, we put in our pizza order. Even with this step by the time we finally got a table it was still another 20-30 minutes before we got our pizza. It's Chicago, we are tourists, so of course we needed to go deep dish right? I wasn't expecting miracles but there was nothing to write home about on this pizza. It was pretty bland, the sauce was average, and the crust was crispy but otherwise not memorable. Kudos to us for checking pizza off the foods-to-eat list but there was no wow factor. Oh, and then we waited another 20 minutes for our bill, which seemed really counter-intuitive for a restaurant sporting over an hour wait, but there you have it.
