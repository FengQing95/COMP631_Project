Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A year and a half later, and I'm still a fan.  Good, consistent, and great sangria!  I recently went there during the tomato fest(?)..and everything was tomato this tomato that!  Which is great for me, because I love tomatos!  They had a tomato goat cheese thing which I loved, too.
