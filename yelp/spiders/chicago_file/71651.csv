Little Goat Diner////Holy Goat, I ordered the goat burger and a side of smokey fries. The burger is a beast and very good. The actual goat burger it's self was overdone on one side and the cook (cook because I know a chef would not let that go on such a beautiful piece of burger art) resulted in a 4 star rating instead of a otherwise deserved 5 star.
