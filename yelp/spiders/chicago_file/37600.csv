Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This used to be my favorite restaurant in the city, but last night was the second time my husband and I had made reservations months in advance (for 8:30) only to get there and have to wait an hour. We were told to wait at the bar and stood for fifteen minutes before I waved to bartender and she was like, "I see you." Another five minutes and she curtly said,"what would you like?" Strangely it wasn't even super crowded at the bar. My husband and I were so turned off by the reception that we left and went someplace else where they could Accommodate us. We live downtown and regularly go out and feel this is not the way to treat customers, so we have officially given up on Bavette's. Such a shame as it totally killed the mood for the night, which was my birthday. We left pretty pissed and won't be back.
