Smoque BBQ////When I first got there, the line was such that I didn't think we would be able to sit down, but somehow a spot to seat all 7 of us appeared; throughout the meal, I noticed nobody was standing waiting to sit down with their food.  I don't know how they do that.  If only Kuma's was the same way.  ;)
