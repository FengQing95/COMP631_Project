Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So good! Been here twice and I will definitely go back! All of the food is delicious, so you simply cant go wrong. We liked everything we got - especially the potatoes. I forgot to take a picture of the chicken empanada but it was so good. They also have a nice section with an open roof and large window (perfect for COVID).
