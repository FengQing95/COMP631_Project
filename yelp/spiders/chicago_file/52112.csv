Smoque BBQ////I loved this place. I got the brisket and then I got the mac n cheese, the cobbler and the beans as well as the coleslaw (I love sides). The meat was delicious and I loved my little tray filled with tubs of my delicious side dishes. Yum! Good thing this place is kind of far, otherwise I'd be there all the time!
