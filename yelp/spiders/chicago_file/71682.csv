Little Goat Diner////Service: pretty great! We were starving and it was about 230 in the afternoon on a Sunday (busy brunch/lunch time) but really wanted to try this place--- we mad a reservation on the way over for 430 hoping that would give us the lead-- we were right! We arrived over an hour early but were seated ASAP, and we overheard them telling another party of 2 it would be a 45 minute wait! So win on that account!
