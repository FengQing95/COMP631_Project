Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Understated and friendly. Our waiter made several good recommendations on menu options, although she recommended pretty much everything on the menu. I didn't sense any pretension and thought we were well taken care of. Â A few reviews have complained about the hosts. I disagree - they were kind enough to hold our reservation even though we were twenty minutes late.
