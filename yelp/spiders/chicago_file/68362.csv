Little Goat Diner////Friend suggested we go eat there for dinner. I had been to Girl and the Goat a few times, but didn't know what to expect from Little Goat. We had a 30 minute wait, which wasn't a problem because they had a bar and a coffee bar. I had their Hoopoe's Hope which had Gin, Mathilde Peche Cocchi Vermouth, and Fresh Lemon Juice. It was very very tasty. The bartender was very helpful and despite him being busy took very good care of me and my friends. Instead of a pager they will text you when you are ready.
