Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I wish I could have had one of everything. Went for a large birthday party and everything was outstanding from service to the meal. The dishes came out to the table in time to enjoy and order the next item. And the bread! Restaurants are usually judged by the first thing a diner eats and it's the bread that will make or break for me.
