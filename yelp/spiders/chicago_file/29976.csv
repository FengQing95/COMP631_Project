Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This location opens at 10:30am and that was wonderful as we got there shortly after 11am so that we could eat before the next part of the convention we were attending began at our hotel. It was a great choice as it wasn't terribly busy but by the time we left it was quite busy and the wait for a table would be quite long.
