The Purple Pig////Cons: The service was subpar at best. Took about 15 minutes to get a menu, an additional 10 minutes to get a glass of water (after asking twice). The dude that sat next to me 10 minutes after my arrival got 3 menus and a water before me. I guess I was only worthy of one menu, because that's all I got. This is the reason I ordered small fast options (soup and corn bread) I had been sitting there so long, I just wanted to leave. Now, I'm glad I didn't because the food was superb. To be fair, I came in during a lunch rush, so yes, anyone can forgive crappy service during such circumstances, however, I witnessed one pretty repulsive thing while sitting at the bar near the food line. The chef, or person in charge was calling the tickets, meticulously cleaning plates and sending items that didn't meet his standards back, at a commendable rate for such a busy service. This dude had a buddy chilling there with him, no uniform, just some other dude that was stopping by to say hi. That's fine, it did not interfere with the Chefs productivity, HOWEVER, and this is a HUGE however, when the kitchen brought a topper wear of pistachios, the friend dude that was visiting, opened the container, took a handful and put his entire hand in his mouth, then took more pistachios and so forth, I was completely repulsed, now all I could think about was that those pistachios were contaminated. He didn't wash his hands prior to grabbing them by the handful, it was disgusting that the fingers that were INSIDE his mouth went right back into the container.... I obviously didn't order anything with pistachios. Everything else was pure perfection, which is why I gave it 3 stars rather than 1. For such a highly rated restaurant, I was repulsed by what I witnessed. Yes, I am a picky germaphobe, but I reserve the right to be one as a food expert that works with immunocompromised populations. Ewwww.
