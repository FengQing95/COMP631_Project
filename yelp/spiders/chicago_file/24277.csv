Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Being a restaurant owner ourselves, we hold places with over 3k reviews and 4 stars to a certain standard. It's obviously good, in fact we were able to watch over 6 tables sit, order, eat, pay and leave. All the while we were still waiting. I would say around 50-55 mins after ordering our server, nicely apologized and said there was a confusion (not really giving us an excuse) and that it would be 10-15 more mins and the 2 small pizzas would be on the house. We were satisfied with that, figuring we already waited this long. Although, this info coming from a manager would have been better business.
