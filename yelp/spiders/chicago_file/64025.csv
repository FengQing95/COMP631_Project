Smoque BBQ////Smoque's brisket looks the part. Squint and it doesn't look unlike an offering from Austin's own world famous Franklin BBQ. The char looks legitimate, the smoke ring is present, and the meat looks fall-off-the-metaphoric-bone worthy. Wherein lies the rub? In the taste. Smoque's brisket is by no means dry; it just lacks the requisite flavor.
