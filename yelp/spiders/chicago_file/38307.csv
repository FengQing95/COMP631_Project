Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It's smart to get reservations here, because Bavette's can fill up pretty fast. They do have a large downstairs room so the restaurant is bigger than it looks initially, but even with all that space, over the holidays my family got reservations a month in advance and could still only come at either 5pm or 9:30pm. What can I say, it's a popular joint for good reason!
