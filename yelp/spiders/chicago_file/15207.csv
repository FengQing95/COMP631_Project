Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I live in Oak Park and this Lou's is sooooooo much better than the Oak Park Lou's. The pizza tastes better and this location doesn't skimp on the toppings. Justin was our bartender and he was great. Perfect combination of not too chatty and attentive. I will continue to drive to the city to eat here vs. the one in Oak Park.
