The Purple Pig////My favorite place in the city. This place is a foodies heaven. I've been here so many times but there's a few things I always have to order: the bone marrow, calamari (cold dish) and the braised milk pork shoulder. Everything here is good- never had a bad meal. Good place for sharing. Tapas style
