Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went to CBBR for my cousin's Birthday...we had reservations for 8pm, of course they didn't seat us for 20+ minutes after because they were "setting the table"--okay, I get this...but when we finally arrived to our table, only half of the place settings had been set.  So, the waiter sort of "chuckled" and asked us to either wait in a corridor or go all the way back to the front of the restaurant.  If it is going to take you 20+ minutes to set a table, the table should be set and the host should at least be somewhat apologetic about the situation.
