Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I think I am just not a fan of deep dish cause I finally got around to trying Malnatti's classic and was unimpressed. This was a delivery order so maybe it is better served on site. The tomato sauce was barely ok, the sausage patty was the worst bit, and the butter crush was good but didn't rewarm well. Coming from a sauce/sausage/butter fan, this is abysmal. Where did it all go wrong?
