Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We went on a Saturday night (also Cinco de Mayo) so I was expecting a packed house. In fact, we got quite the opposite: we were seated immediately, but our service was not so immediate. I had to think they were understaffed or our waitress was overworked, but after we were seating, we waited 15 minutes before flagging her down just to get some water, and put in our pizza order. This is the only I'm slighting this place a little bit and subtracting a star.
