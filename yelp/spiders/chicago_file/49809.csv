Smoque BBQ////I have gone to some of the best hair salons and have paid way to much to get my hair done, What's worst is that my cut or color wasn't necessarily  what I was looking for. I decided to take a leap of faith and stop into the Hair Cuttery in Skokie on Skokie Blvd . I met Georgia who listened to what my frustrations with my hair was and delivered the cut and color I love! Oh did I mention  1/2 the price!!! She's great and know her stuff.
