Little Goat Diner////Terrible service. Everyone seemed to have an attitude problem. Plates slammed on the table, refusal to make any dietary accomodations for my sister who simply needed her eggs cooked so that they would not be runny, when food was dropped off it was placed in the center of the table without explanation of what it was (there were six people at the table, so there were six entrees that we had to figure out for ourselves) and the food was awful. Soggy sandwiches, tasteless grits...the only good things were the items that came straight from the attached bakery. The entrees were expensive and should have been better priced. Not impressed and will not return.
