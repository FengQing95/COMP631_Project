Art Institute of Chicago////Favorites are the modern American painting, the miniatures room, and Asian art and artifacts. Least favorite without a doubt is the contemporary crap in the modern wing, much of which is the type of art that is an insult to the viewer (and may be intended as such). Happily, the museum presents these works neutrally without attempting to play up Rothko as some sort of genius.
