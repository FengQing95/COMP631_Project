Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Excellent food!! I tried Mercat and Purple pig, they are also tapas restaurants. But cafe babareeba is the best!! The portion size is not too small. I love the garlic shrimp and grill squid. Very tasty! Also tried the hand-craved ham $20 but totally worth it! Pork belly rice is a bit salty and oily. Braised ribs is okay, not amazing.
