Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////First off let me say the staff is very friedly. The service was average. I ordered a martini and asked for extra olives and they failed to do that. That's ok so when we ordered our dinner, My burger was salty, the Mac and cheese was good with the perfect amount of truffle oil. But the Wedge salad was amazing with that bacon. The fries were was also crispy. The elote looks better then it tastes. When I requested a specific dessert for my anniversary without my wife knowing it's a surprise the waitress asked us "would you like dessert. Overall I think it was a technicality.
