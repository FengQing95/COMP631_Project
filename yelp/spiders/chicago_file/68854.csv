Little Goat Diner////Solid place for brunch, but nothing I've had here is super special.  You would expect more given it's called Little Goat and Girl and the Goat is so great.  However, if you are looking for a standard solid brunch place, this would be a great place to go.  They do have great coffee drinks.
