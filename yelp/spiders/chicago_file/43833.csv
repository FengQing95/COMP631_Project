Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The bad thing is the wait. Be prepared to wait 45 min to over a hour even if you have reservations. It is worth the wait but still annoying especially since there's nowhere to wait really. It gets so crowded in there that you can't help but feel you're in the way no matter where you stand.
