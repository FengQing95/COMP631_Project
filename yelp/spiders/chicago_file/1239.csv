Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////They make some darned fine biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were soft and extremely savory, could taste the fresh pepper and fennel seed. Our waitress noticed the order was a touch light on the gravy and she offered to bring out more. These were perfection. Also tried the deliciois Los Altos  benedict which had  chorizo instead of ham, and chipotle flavored hollandaise. Asked for some jalapenos and they slapped a bunch of them on there. They are more than happy to customize every order. They really want you to be happy. And we were!
