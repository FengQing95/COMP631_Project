Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I dined here almost two weeks ago, but I'm still talking about this dinner to friends... to the point of them probably sick of hearing me discuss anything about this "amazing meal I had at Bavette's." I went in on a Monday night with my boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary. Awww! (Go ahead. I'll wait for you to collectively say, "Awww!")
