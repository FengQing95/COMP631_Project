Art Institute of Chicago////The permanent collection is pretty decent, as is the new modern wing. Except for the one gallery that was set up on opening day so that you had to walk against the flow of everyone and their non-deodorant wearing out-of-towner aunts and uncles who happened to be there just to get out. Bad form.
