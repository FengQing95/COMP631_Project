Little Goat Diner////Possibly the best diner in Chicago.   Tough to get in here on the weekends, but worth the wait.   (If there's an hour wait for tables, I grab some snacks from the Little Goat coffee counter next store -- or some bread/salami from Publican Meat Market down the street.)   I recently had a delightful breakfast here of hash browns, bacon, and a delicious mezcal cocktail.    Menu is a bit wacky but never disappoints.   I haven't tried the rooftop bar yet but I'll bet it's also awesome.
