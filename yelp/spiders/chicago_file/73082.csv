Little Goat Diner////Food: flavorful, but nothing unexpected. The menu is hit-or-miss. As another reviewer noted, if you are paying 3 times what Denny's costs, it should taste that much better and/or feel much more special. Â It's nice to have the variety, but I can think of a few restaurants that do each menu item much better.
