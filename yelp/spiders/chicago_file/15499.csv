Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza (sized for 2 people) was just intimidating in its size and gooeyness.  We ordered the "Lou" pizza which was loaded with veggies.  Unfortunately the veggies were just drowned by bread and oozing cheese.  I like fresh, crisp, flavorful veggies so this was not for me.  The crust was thick and had a decent texture, but did nothing for me in terms of taste.  The cheese was standard pizza cheese.  The sauce was unremarkable; I don't really remember anything about it.
