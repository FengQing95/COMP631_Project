Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////While my parents were in town, we went here for supper (lunch/dinner) to continue to celebrate my thesis defense and my job interview.  I have tried two previous tapas places, Cafe Iberico and Tapas Barcelona.  This place has been bandied about as a potential place to eat among friends.  Since I was in the mood to eat a lot of different things but didn't want to be tied down to a particular dish, this seemed like a perfect place.  Also, in the event that we were really hungry, we could keep on ordering, which is what we ended up doing.  We lucked out and ended up finding parking close to the front of the restaurant.  I was a Starvin' Marvin as the only food I had eaten was 5 hr ago and it was chocolate covered strawberries, but I digress.  I have to tell you whenever I know I'm going to a place I've never been, I always look up the menu.  So as soon as we sat down around 4p, I was ready to place some orders right away.
