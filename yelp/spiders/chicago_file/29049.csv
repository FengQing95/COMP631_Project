Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got one sausage and pepperoni deep dish pizzas. They were pretty good... I would have preferred more flavor in the red sauce, especially since the top layer was drowning in sauce. I also would have preferred if the flavors of the pepperoni and sausage shone through the sauce more. Otherwise, the pizza was well baked, and the bottom cheese layer was quite delicious.
