Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We started with the bacon wrapped dates--delicious melt in your mouth salty sweet perfection! We also got the spicy potato wedges. Very good--loved the creamy sauce that accompanied them. We followed that up with the scallops, which our server said was one of his favorites. They were excellent. And finally we got the Brussels sprouts, which was basically a salad. Also good!
