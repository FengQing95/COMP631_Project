Little Goat Diner////Went for lunch with my mom.  Was smart and made a reservation the night before.  Saved us some wait time.  Hint you can do it on Yelp!  Mom had the goat version of sloppy joe with a spicy slaw. Yummy! I had a hard time deciding what to get the menu is just something else but u decided on the shrimp and grits.  Now I have a thing for grits, it's one of those gotta have it and compare it to others I've had.  Like always trying the pad Thai.  It's a thing.  Anyway.  These are good! I mean good.  So good we got an order of them to go for my dad (also an enjoyer if grits) because I felt guilty for having them without him.  FYI they traveled well.
