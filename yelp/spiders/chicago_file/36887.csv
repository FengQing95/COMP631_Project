Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What I did really like here was the bread.  So fresh and crusty!  The crab stuffed avocado salad was also very good with plenty of fresh crab meat.  Loaded baked potato was also very well done.  After tasting it, I imagine that all the other menu items are done well just as they are at Au Cheval.  I would want to give Bavette's another try once I work through the other places on my list.
