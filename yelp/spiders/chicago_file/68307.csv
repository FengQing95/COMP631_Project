Little Goat Diner////I own a business around the corner, so Little Goat has become my go-to for my morning coffee. Their consistently delicious food and exceptional service has kept me coming back almost daily now for breakfast, lunch and/or dinner. I am utterly addicted to their cinnamon rolls! Given that I've become a loyal regular, I've gotten to know some of the staff - Justyna the floor manager is the biggest sweetheart, and my favorite server is Becca. All of the staff is wonderful - and honestly, I friggin' love their tattoos! {in reference to the strange review below of preferences for server body-art}. Little Goat is a great addition to West Loop.
