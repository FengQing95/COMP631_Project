Little Goat Diner////We started with the hot crab dip and side of mac and cheese. The hot crab dip is cute - it comes with Ritz crackers.. lots of CHEESE and possibly little crab? It was pretty hearty but delicious. The mac and cheese was good. For entree I had the Little Pig who Went to China. I really like the cheddar biscuit but I did not like the pork sausage that came with it. It comes with two eggs in the middle which was delish.. came with blackberries which was more decor to me than taste. My husband ordered the bulls eye french toast. His dish was very heavy! They have eggs inside the french toast that's loaded with lots of syrup. It was definitely a fusion dish - but he could only finish half of it. He likes it, but just felt very guilty after eating it. Our tab ended up Â being around $66.. I would come back and try something else. The dishes with the kimchi (not the kimchi pancake) really interests me!
