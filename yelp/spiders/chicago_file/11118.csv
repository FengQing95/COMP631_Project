Art Institute of Chicago////My Father and I visited the art gallery today as an end to what has become a horrendous "vacation." Walking in, we were charged almost $60 for two all day passes. We saw the massive line to buy tickets and decided to go online. Their online system is awful and we went from re-direct to re-direct until finally downloading the GetYourGuide app and accessing our tickets. It probably would have taken just as long to wait in line. The $60 sum for tickets was expensive, but would have been worth the price if we had been able to access all of the artwork. Unfortunately we were not. We found key exhibits such as the old stock exchange floor room, CLOSED or told that we must pay an additional fee. They charged for key exhibits, seating in the cafe, certain lines, bag check, audio tours, hell I am surprised they didn't charge for water as well. The ticket just gets you in the door and every single little thing else is an additional fee. This is a massive tourist trap and we were nickel and dimed the entire visit. I don't know why they had a donation box out, being that we were paying extra for just about everything.
