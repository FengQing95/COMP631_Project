Little Goat Diner////Anyway, I gave it another try and our waitress was really great. I was pleasantly surprised with the service and the food was good, but it is just not my style. I know it's a diner, but I just always feel SO unhealthy when I eat here. And not in a satisfied way...but in a gluttonous way. I do love the ambiance and the beer selections are great!
