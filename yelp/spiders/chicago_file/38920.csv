Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We came here in a friday night for date night. They were not taking reservations for tables but the bar was first come first serve. The vibe was an old time hotel bar. It was intimate and little fancy. We stalked a couple of drinkers at the bar until we could claim their seats. But as we were waiting we were hoping to get some food orders started, firstly because I'm pregnant and super sensitive to hypoglycemia and secondly because I was on call and nervous about getting called back into work. The bartender was super nasty about it and refused to let us. We just went along with in although I was getting super hangry. Finally the  other people left and we were able to order. The  messed up part is that this little rule of the bartender's he himself broke 10 minutes later when a guy next to us and his girlfriend were waiting for s s'est a the bar. They didnt even ask to order...he just offered. So rude! This bartender just totally singled us out and made some stupid rule up. I didnt want to let it ruin our date night. I got the salmon and my fiance got the short rib stroganoff. The salmon was medium rare and since I am pregnant I asked them to cook it more. The same bartender was such a jerk about it giving us such attitude. I'm sorry but I dont trust salmon from the midwest with my unborn baby health! Overall I loved the old timey decor and the food was not bad but the staff was terrible. I have never given less than 20 percent for tip to waitstaff because I myself was a waitress for 4 years but I was really tempted here. This guy should be fired for his lack of professionalism!
