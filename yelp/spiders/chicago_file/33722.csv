Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I have been to Bavette's twice now and it's quickly earned the top spot as my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The food is amazing and the service is top notch! You can bring your own wine or order off their list. I highly recommend the truffle Mac and cheese and the Brussel sprouts as your sides! Just resist the urge to fill up on the bread and butter. I don't know what they do to the butter but it seriously delicious!
