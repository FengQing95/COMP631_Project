Smoque BBQ//// Having won a trip here through a fundraising auction, I was fortunate (read: blessed by the BBQ gods) to sample Smoque's entire menu in one glorious, pant-stretching visit. Everything from the baby back ribs to the smoked chicken raises the bar on what great barbecue should taste like. Indeed, the food here was so outstanding that my face hurt from smiling so much while I was eating.
