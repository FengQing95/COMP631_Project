Little Goat Diner////Great and interesting menu! Went in for dinner on a Tuesday while in town for work. Got there at 5:30 and there were plenty of people but no wait. By the time we finihed and left around 7 there were a few people that waited no more than 10 minutes and those were larger groups of people (6 or more).
