Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I ate here for dinner a few weeks back, and it was phenomenal. The wait for a table was a bit long (our fault - we obviously should have made reservations), but the food was unbelievable. Â We shared the baked goat cheese appetizer, a wedge salad, the shaved prime beef sandwich, and the steak frites. Everything was decadent and outstanding. This restaurant group really knows what they're doing. Happy to have them here in Chicago.
