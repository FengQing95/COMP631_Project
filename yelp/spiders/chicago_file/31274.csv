Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we walked in it was chaos. People everywhere either waiting for tables or waiting for pizza. I couldn't even get a good look at the place but I did see that they had some outdoor seating in addition to tables inside. People dining in were being told it would be an hour wait just for pizza once they got a table. Wow! Glad we ordered ahead.
