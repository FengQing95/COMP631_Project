Little Goat Diner////I've been wanting to go to The Girl and the Goat and cannot seem to get a reservation, Argh!  So, one Saturday morning, I was up and about in the city and decided to try my luck at Little Goat Diner.  I arrived ~8 or 8:30am and sat at the bar, no issues.  Since this was my first time here, I decided I had to try something different and special.  So, I ordered the Little Piggy Went to China and a Razzle Chai Latte.  The tea was thick and spicy, definitely not the type of chai latte you get at Starbucks, but it felt like an authentic spice mixture and I liked it for a treat.  The meal was very interesting...I don't even know how to describe it because it was such a perplexing mix of flavors.  The biscuit was like southern comfort yummy, the sausage had a nice Asian spice to it and the egg was cooked perfectly.  It had a thin spicy strawberry sauce on it which was very odd.  I kept eating it with each forkful and it intrigued, yet confused, my tastebuds.  Honestly, I'm glad I tried it, I didn't love it but I didn't necessarily dislike it, it was just a unique experience...I just don't know that I would order it again.
