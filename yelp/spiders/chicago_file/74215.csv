Little Goat Diner////This was my first time dining in one of the Stephanie Izard franchises, and I wasn't disappointed. Located in the West Loop, this holds down the corner across from Bar Siena. I recommend making a reservation, and possibly dining early. We made ours for 530pm on a Saturday(blue plate anyone?) but it actually made perfect sense...the place was plenty busy already anyway, and as we dined, the throng of expectant diners waiting near the door just grew and grew and grew. Made our early dining time seem like a super smart idea! Of course, I can't take the credit for eating at 530. My usual dinner time is about 9pm, so...all credit goes to the lady.
