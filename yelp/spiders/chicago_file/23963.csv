Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Classic deep dish pizza. The Lou was a great vegetarian option. Really hit the spot on a cold night. We also got the Chicago classic which was good. It was about a 45 minute wait to get in, then about 20 minutes till we got our food on a Sunday night. Nice wait staff and host.
