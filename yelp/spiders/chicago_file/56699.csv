Smoque BBQ////Whoa Mamma how I love Smoque. The smoky goodness starts the moment you walk in the door and smell the meat.  My god, the meat. Growing up in the South, brisket wasn't really a menu option.  Boy, did we miss out.  The brisket here is delicous, with a wonderful ratio of crunchy bits to juicy ones.  The St Louis ribs are chewy (which is a good thing), a little fatty (also a good thing) and spiced just right.  Everyone raves about the macancheese but honestly, I wasn't that impressed.  Now the cornbread, on the other hand, is impressive. Sweet, with real corn and a slightly crunchy top, it goes well with the spiced meat. And they have real sweet tea. And though I may not be a foodie by any stretch of the imagination, I am a teaie. Well,  an iced sweet teaie, anyway.  And it's so freakin' good here. What are you waiting for?
