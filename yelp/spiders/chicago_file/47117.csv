Smoque BBQ////This was hands down the best BBQ I have had outside of Kansas City and St.Louis. The place is very small and the seating is communal. This just adds to the appeal of the restaurant. The only complaint I will make is not about the food or experience, but the parking. Since it is in a neighborhood the parking is mostly residential and difficult to find. However, they do provide a map that shows where available parking is. My best suggestion is to take to train and save yourself the hassle. My wife and I ordered the brisket, pulled pork, and we added a 1/4 rack of ribs for around six dollars. The service was relatively quick for a place that was without an open seat. The brisket was very moist and had extremely good flavor. The pulled pork was equally good and the cooks definitely make sure to let the meat stay the focus point of the meal. The ribs were fall off the bone delectable! The sauces were not very special but we're not necessary due to how well the meat was done. The sides were exceptional especially the baked beans. They are made with the leftover brisket and could sit alone as a meal themselves.
