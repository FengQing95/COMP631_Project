Little Goat Diner////Went for dinner on a Monday night and the place was packed!  Nice outdoor seating for the summer as well as an updated diner feel on the inside.  This place is in fact a diner serving diner food (in case you thought it was just Girl and the Goat but smaller).  It's an updated diner menu with "new" american classics including pork belly pancakes and kale salads in addition to an updated look at traditional classics such as burgers, milkshakes, and sandwiches.  While we came for dinner, I think it would be more aptly suited for lunch or breakfast (or for people who like to eat breakfast for dinner).  Great quality in the execution of each dish such that I thought what I ate was better than I expected from the menu.  Also of note, they have a gluten-free menu for those that need it.
