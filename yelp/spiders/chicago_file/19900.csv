Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I wanted to give this place five stars, but I think we can all agree it shouldn't take 20 minutes to be greeted by a waitress when a restaurant isn't all that busy. When we did get greeted, it turned out that our waitress was very friendly. For my first Chicago deep dish pizza, I thought it was great. I wasn't really digging the crust, but the flavor on the inside mattered more. We got half the Lou and half Malnati Chicago Classic. My boyfriend and I both favored the Lou more. I'm not a huge Italian sausage fan, but the lean sausage on the Malnati was a game changer! We shared a small, and it was still a lot for us! The other issue we had was seeing the crowded staff standing around past the bar. With that much idle staff, I'm not sure how it took 20 minutes to get us a waiter. :(
