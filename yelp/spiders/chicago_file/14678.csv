Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////One of my favorite pizza places in the city.  The deep dish with butter crust is excellent and feels a bit lighter than most deep dish pizzas.  Something about the tomatoes used stands out, in particular.  The thin crust is decent (also, it is much better when first ordered than when eaten as a leftover).  You really aren't going to go wrong having pizza here, but if it's too busy, then go to Pizano's, which serves essentially the exact same pizza.
