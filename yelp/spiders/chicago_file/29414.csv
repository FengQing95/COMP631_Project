Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My favorite style pizza is really the Brick Oven Style Pizza. Having lived in New York City, I've had the best of all pizza. Though the closest I've ever had to a deep dish was Pizzeria Uno. So of Course being in Chicago, my dining partner and I had to try the Deep Dish Chicago Pizza which Chicago is famous for. We arrived for lunch on a Thursday at 11:00 a.m. as not having to wait as I've read that wait time can be long. Believe it or not at 11:00 a.m. we got the last available table. Our server Sam introduced herself, took our drink orders while we looked over the menu.
