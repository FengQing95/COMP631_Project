Smoque BBQ////I thought Smoque had good BBQ, nothing amazing and nothing I would travel from the West Loop for in the future.  The brisket was moist and tender, but I wasn't a fan of the sauce or the overall seasoning/flavor.  I thought my sides were average.  There wasn't a single item, other than the ribs, that I would ever consider going back for... although, if I lived closer I probably would throw another star on.  The curse of Yelp.
