Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For the higher price point and all the great reviews on here, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba didn't quite meet my expectations. The tapas were good - especially the chorizo-wrapped date & cheese and the beef tenderloin. The chicken paella we ordered was super salty (not sure if it is usually that way or just an off night). The service was really great though. I'd recommend making reservations ahead of time if you plan on bringing a larger group.
