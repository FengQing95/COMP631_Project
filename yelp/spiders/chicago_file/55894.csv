Smoque BBQ////I tasted a bit of everything, courtesy of my friends and all of the meat dishes were good.  Meat was very tender, never dry and the bbq sauce is excellent, and I'm really picky about my bbq sauce.  The sides were good as well- cole slaw, mac and cheese and baked beans almost trump the meat itself.  No matter what you order, you will not be disappointed.
