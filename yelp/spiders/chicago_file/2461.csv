The Purple Pig////HOLY COW. I honestly am speechless after eating here. We only went for a light snack and wine before a later dinner, but I want to come back ASAP because the rest of the menu looked delicious. We did a Sauvignon Blanc wine from the Sancerre region of France (light and crisp) and paired it with the whipped feta and the roasted broccoli. All we could say was "wow" the entire time.the feta was paired with the lightest little crackers and very yummy pickled leeks!!! The broccoli was PERFECTLY roasted, green and tender with one side golden and roasted. The sauce they were tossed in blew our minds. My mouth is still watering. No reservations, but ABSOLUTELY worth the wait.
