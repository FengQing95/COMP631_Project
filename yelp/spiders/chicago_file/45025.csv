Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////But half the experience is the experience. The wait staff was not very attentive and I would also venture she was overwhelmed. It would take 20 minutes (minimum) to get drinks. Luckily others handled delivering the food. And parking. It's street or valet. And street is nearly impossible, though we had good luck there.
