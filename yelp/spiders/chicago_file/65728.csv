Smoque BBQ////I thought the brisket was the star of the show. It was super tender and juicy and tasted amazing with any of the sauces. Ribs were good, nice and smokey. Out of all the sides we got, I enjoyed the beans and fries the most. I'm not usually a beans type of person, but the Smoque version was bursting with flavor. The fries were hot and fresh and tasted great dipped in BBQ sauce. Cornbread was decent although I couldn't tell you what constitutes good cornbread (I might have been too full to appreciate it). The biggest disappointment was the mac & cheese. The "large" we got was simply two of their pre-portioned containers, which are pretty small. Honestly it tasted pretty bland and the texture was not creamy or cheesy whatsoever. Would skip next time.
