Little Goat Diner////We came during lunch and were seated right away.  Loved the atmosphere, but the service was lacking.  We found ourselves waiving down waiters wherever we could. They weren't coordinating behind the scenes and were bringing out drinks that weren't finished being prepared, which was awkward.  Then when we asked them to bring out valet ticket out, the hostess looked at us like we were nuts.
