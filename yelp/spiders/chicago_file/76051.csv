Little Goat Diner////Little Goat is so good.  We live in the neighborhood, and it's our go-to.  For breakfast, for lunch, for dinner, for late nite.  It's where we take out-of-town guests, and it's where we end up with our friends that have also been there a million times.  It's comfort food, it's reliable, it's comfy, and although you're in a super relaxed diner...it's incredible 5-star food.  You can get a patty melt or some nachos...or you can opt for special with seasonal ingredients that will blow your mind (I had ramps here last year for the five minutes they were in season, and it was one of the best breakfast dishes I had all year).  Have a cup of coffee or a beer...or get a cocktail with peppercorns that will make your taste buds go, "Whoa!"
