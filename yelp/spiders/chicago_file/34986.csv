Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The service at Bavette's is notably outstanding. We had an extremely friendly, knowledgeable waiter who managed to make an already perfect eating experience even better. We were even served a glass of wine from a bottle that another table brought (apparently the corkage "fee" is a complimentary glass of wine to the house) because we were deemed the nicest table of the night. Pretty easy to be nice when you're in your happy place!
