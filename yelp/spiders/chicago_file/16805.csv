Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Well, the pizza was OK. The cheese didn't melt like I'm used to and there wasn't much sauce on the pizza. It was kinda bland... I think because we ordered the small personal butter crust pizza, we didn't get it in the traditional pan. I saw someone next to me get it in the pan and their cheese stretched for days. So, needless to say, I was bummed about my pizza. In fact, I've had better deep dish in San Francisco; sorry.
