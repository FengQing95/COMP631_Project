Smoque BBQ////Being that I am from Memphis I truly don't make it a habit to try BBQ from other places.  I branched out and walked to Smoque's with a friend.  This place is about 4 blocks away so that is very convenient.  As we approach the restaurant I see a line of people to get into the door.  Now anyone who knows me knows that I am totally against standing in line.  If I had been alone I would have continued to walk until I found another place.  I did suck it up and 45 minutes later I was inside preparing to order.   For this reason I will probably never eat inside of this place again but now on to the food.
