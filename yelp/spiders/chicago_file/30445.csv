Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I got to try three pizza places while visiting Chicago, and Lou Malnati's probably has my favorite sauce. The sauce is slightly sweet with a hint of garlic. We ordered sausage with the pizza and the way they flatten the sausage, you got sausage in every bite. I love that every bite is consistent with the last.
