Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time in Chicago, so I had to try deep dish pizza. Definitely a one time thing for me. The wait for the pizza to come out was about 30+ minutes, so if you're super hungry, this is not the place to go. That's the usual time, though! Pizza wasn't even hot when it came out. We got the Lou Malnati's Special and it was okay. Way too much sausage, so we got tired of it quick. The appearance wasn't even that nice for the gram. Probably won't be back, but it was cool to try!
