Art Institute of Chicago////Being a Chicago native, I really appreciated the miniature version of the Chicago sculptures in Gallery 144 near Chagall's America Windows. You can find the draft for The Picasso and a small version of the sculpture, as well as the Flamingo, and other public art found in Chicago. I found a miniature version of the sculpture of Ceres (which is on top of the Chicago Board and Trade Building) upstairs but I wonder why it is not with the other Chicago sculptures.
