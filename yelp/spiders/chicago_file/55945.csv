Smoque BBQ////Place is A MADHOUSE at dinner time. Â Do yourself a favor and go in during off peak hours, or call in for carryout (unless you enjoy 50 hungry people staring at you through the window trying to "Jedi Mind Trick" yo' ass into eating faster and getting the hell out so they can have your table...)
