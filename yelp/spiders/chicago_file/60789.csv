Smoque BBQ////The place is efficiently ran and seemed to be very well managed.  There was a manager walking around and chatting with everyone to make sure they were happy.  The cashier rang up our order wrong but we got it straightened out (and the manager happened to notice we went back and approached us to help her help us).  The line was a good 10 people long with a single cashier.  It took over 30 minutes to wait through the line and wait for our food... From my experience, this is pretty typical of any rib place I've been to, and it seemed like they were really organized about it, so I'm not complaining.
