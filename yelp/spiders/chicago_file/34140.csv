Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My experiences have always been great from the start. Bavette's takes reservations, over the Internet, like civilized people. Coming from DC where everything is a line or a free-for-all you would think this is some revolutionary idea. And, they actually honor them, in my experience. No long waits at the bar or excuses about tables not being ready. Yet on the other side, when you're dining, they're not pushing to turn your table to get the next cover in. I don't know how they manage to do it.
