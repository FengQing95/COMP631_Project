Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I can't comment on the food, but the service, drinks and ambiance were on par.  Went there for a girls night--bartender made great drinks both upstairs and downstairs.  The downstairs is really cool, a little darker than upstairs and nice servers.  Their moscow mules are great!
