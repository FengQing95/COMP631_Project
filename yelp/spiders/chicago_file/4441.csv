The Purple Pig////Service wise, it really couldn't have been much better.  The level of attentiveness matched that of many Michelin places and despite not receiving any "explanations" of dishes, everyone from the guys who cleared the table to the girl who sat us were both polite and vigilant.  We never encountered a problem and water glasses rarely (if ever) got below halfway.  Pure professionalism.
