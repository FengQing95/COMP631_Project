Little Goat Diner////When I came here for breakfast on Saturday, I had to wait about an hour to be seated. There was a similar wait when I came for lunch if I had wanted to get a table or booth seat. However, I skipped the wait by opting to sit at the bar. However, this isn't really possible if you come with more than one or two friends as usually there isn't enough space.
