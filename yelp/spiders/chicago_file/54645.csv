Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Tapas are perfect when sharing plates with a large group of people. You can't go wrong with any of the tapas but my faves are the goat cheese dip, the fried chicken, and the croquettes! They also have brunch on the weekends with a great selection of brunch tapas! Also their sangria pitchers are amazing, passion fruit flavor is the best by far!
