Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was told by someone I know that used to live here and said that I have to go try this place.  When I went it was a Saturday evening, I was 49th on the waiting list and it took over an hour to get a table.  I was told that I could order the pizza while I waited for my table.  I took about another 20 min to get my pizza after I sat down.
