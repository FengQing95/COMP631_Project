Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is my favorite steak house in Chicago, followed very closely by David Burke's. It is exponentially better than old school places like Gene & Georgetti's. Everything we ate was fantastic, the atmosphere was lovely (yes, you can have a conversation here with your dining partners without shouting to be heard), and the service was charming and efficient. And I really love their BYOB policy: if you share a glass with the table next to you, there waive the corkage fee. We shared a glass with a table next door celebrating getting their green card, they reciprocated with a nice Uruguayan wine that frankly was superior to the bottle I brought! And we had a nice friendly chat with them which made the whole experience that much happier.
