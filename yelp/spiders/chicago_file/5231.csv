The Purple Pig////I ordered the crispy pork ear, octopus, milk braised pork shoulder, and chicken skewers. Cooked very well - the meat was so tender I could pick it off easily with a fork, and the sauce and veggies that accompanied it had strong tastes but didn't overwhelm the main part of the dish. The crispy pork ear was alright - I personally believe it was too fried, which made it honestly taste like nothing more than fancy potato chips. Maybe that's your thing, but especially compared to the flavors of the pork shoulder and the chicken skewers, it was nothing to write home about.
