Little Goat Diner////First time indoor dining in over a year and I felt really comfortable here! Employees were very respectful and patrons are required to wear masks when waitstaff is at tables and on walk to the restroom. Our booth was in a low traffic area so we felt comfortable hanging out and having a second round of cocktails after our meal. We had the chickpea salad (as an app for 4 & we all had a good size portion!) it had an amazing variety of flavors - I really liked the creaminess that came from the tzatziki and it paired with the vinaigrette really well. Texture and flavor was on point! I got the Tonkatsu which was a huge portion of 2 layers of pork fried to perfection on a brioche bun and had a fresh cabbage/carrot slaw that evened it out. We popped over to Sugar Goat for dessert and were able to bring it back to our table and dig right in! We got the strawberry tahini cupcake which is available for a limited time so RUN and get it. Frosting was creamy and not too heavy, strawberry jam filling, and I think toasted sesame and freeze dried strawberries on top? I'll be dreaming about that cupcake!!
