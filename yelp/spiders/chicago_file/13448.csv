Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best pizza I've ever had. I was in heaven. It melted in my mouth, all of the flavors were strong. The crust was buttery and I could feel myself gaining weight but it was so good I didn't care. We also had the calamari which was amazing. The service was only ok and that's why I took off 1 star. I know deep dish takes awhile to make but all the tables around us including a few seated after us got theirs before us (they had different waiters) so maybe it was just the one waiter and the food was good enough to make us for it. If they can get their service up to par this would be a 5 star place.
