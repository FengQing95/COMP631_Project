Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Drunk and beligerent with a party of 8 5 minutes before they closed.  We called ahead to make sure they wouldn't mind, and they told us to come on in, so we did.  We didn't leave until like 1:15 on Saturday, which means we kept the staff there way too long.  Not once were we asked to leave or hurry up or anything, the just kept serving us picthers.  Great service, great food.  Lou's is just as good as any other Chicago style pizza, to settle for one pizza place would be a disheartening experience, so I would also recommend Nancy's Pizza, which is pretty much the same as Lou's.
