Little Goat Diner////I could come here 30 times and still not eat everything I want to try on the menu. Alas, I've only been twice but intend to keep coming back. The key to not waiting a long time seems to be getting up early (we got in at 8AM on Sunday with no wait) or eating at odd times (4:30 dinner, anyone?). No shame in that game. Good food is good food.
