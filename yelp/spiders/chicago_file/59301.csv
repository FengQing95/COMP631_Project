Smoque BBQ////Best BBQ in the city! We waited for about 20 mins to place our order, then it was just a few minutes till our table was ready, and another 15 mins for our food to be ready. It was well worth the wait. We got the 1/2 brisket 1/2 pulled pork sandwich and a half slab of ribs. It was so yummy the meat was nice and tender and I love that they give you the sauce on the side so you can add the BBQ sauce as you like. For sides, we got the Mac and cheese and peach cobbler and instead of cole slaw we got the corn bread. Besides the BBQ the next best part of the meal is the peach cobbler. Warning it might be hard to find parking around there.
