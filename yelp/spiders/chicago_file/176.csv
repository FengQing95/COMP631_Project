Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The only reason why I took off one star is because of the long wait to get in. Wildberry doesn't take reservations, so if you want to eat there you have to wait it out. The wait is worth it! The pancakes are absolutely divine and the ability to substitute the specialty pancakes for $1 is the best. Their Cinnamon Roll pancakes are by far by favorite, and you don't even really need syrup with them! If you don't mind the long wait, or are lucky enough to have have a short one, you absolutely love your meal and the service is great too!
