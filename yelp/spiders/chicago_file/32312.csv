Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////AMAZING! Best garlic parm wings I've EVER had!! We came for the pizza obviously but wanted a side so we chose the garlic parm wings and I've been dreaming about them ever since. The small order comes with 8 perfectly sauced, perfectly fried, and perfectly sized wings. Then we had a small size of the Malnati's classic deep dish pizza with sausage and it was incredible. The cheese pull was to die for. I will say it got kind of cold quickly so the second slice wasn't as good as the first (temp and cheese pull wise) but still very tasty with awesome sauce, amazing cheese, and crunchy but soft crust. Only here for 4 days and will prob be back tomorrow :)
