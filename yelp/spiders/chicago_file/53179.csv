Smoque BBQ////So why not five stars?  Well, I have one sizable pet peeve about BBQ restaurants - no sauce on the tables or at the very least readily available at my discretion.   Before visiting Smoque I had only experienced this at one other establishment - Smokin' Woody's.   Never.... NEVER in TX or KC...or at my pop's restaurant where BBQ is available on tables and/or in pumps where you can dispense your own into cups.  Perhaps I missed pumps that may have been near the fountain soda station?  But I don't believe this was the case judging by my half filled plastic cup of sauce served with my meal.   When my sauce DID run out (because let's be honest, it always does when rationed like that)  I worried, "Are they going to charge me for BBQ sauce...at a BBQ restaurant?!"  Please say it ain't so!!   This was the case for Smokin' Woody's and I have never been back.  It's unforgivable.  Does McDonald's charge for ketchup?  Hot Doug's for mustard?
