The Purple Pig////We started off our night with a couple of drinks. My wife ordered their "Paloma" and I was feeling rich and magical that night and ordered their "24 Carrot Magic." The Paloma was a simple classic made with Espolon blanco tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda. It's really hard to get this one wrong. Definitely tasty. The 24 carrot Magic was something different. This one came with corazon reposado tequila, ancho Reyes Chile liqueur, carrot juice, lime juice and ginger syrup. A drink with a kick of heat, thanks to the ancho Reyes Chile liqueur. Never heard of such liqueur and is now on my list of things to buy! The carrot juice was overpower and made the drink taste healthy. I just wish they had the wider selection of drinks, the at least the drinks we both got were fantastic.
