Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My traveling companion tells me sit tight. Sit tight? My head is about to pop off my shoulders! I sit, riddled with anxiety, waiting to see him or a waiter. It's him first. He says grab your purse. We ditch the table we've waited an hour for, walk a few doors down and into this lovely establishment where we're whisked immediately to an intimate table in the back corner.
