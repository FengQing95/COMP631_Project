The Purple Pig////Service was great, food looked good, BUT I was unimpressed with their signature dish that everyone raved about. I tried their milk braised pork shoulder. Way too salty. I tasted the pork and mash potatoes separately. Both were extremely salty. I felt like I needed a gallon of water after.
