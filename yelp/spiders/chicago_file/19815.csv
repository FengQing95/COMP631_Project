Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Really cool pizzeria to come and hang out.  The line can get long so be prepared; there is also a 40 minute wait for your pie so I recommend having some appetizers.  Had the Lou personal Pizza with added pepperoni and sausage and it was great.  Also had the sample platter for appetizers; all the samples were really good.
