Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Good tapas and sangria, but not so good paella. My colleagues and I ordered 2 of almost everything! Most of them have never experienced a tapas restaurant before and were a bit worried of the tiny portions, so their thought was to order 2 plates of more than a dozen dishes! They were all very tasty, however I don't know what was going on with the dish that they called "paella". Every paella dish I've ordered (and I've had plenty) had clams, lobster, chorizo, mussels, fish, and a wonderful saffron flavor. Their "paella" had small scallop pieces, shrimp, and...green beens! I kept digging to the bottom of the bowl looking for more of the good stuff, but to my disappointment there was NO good stuff :(
