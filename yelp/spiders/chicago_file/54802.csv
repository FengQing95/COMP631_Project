Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////To eat we got the short ribs, spicy potatoes, scallops, Brussels sprouts salad, and bacon wrapped dates. Everything was so great! I think my favorites were the scallops and dates. They all had so much flavor and were cooked perfectly. The short ribs came with mashed potatoes and were delicious. The table bread was nice to dip into the leftover sauces for these dishes.
