Smoque BBQ////I am an expert on baked beans, have had many excellent variations of them home made and out, but these rocked my world. The beans are smoked, have hints of brown sugar, chunks of bacon and onion and taste so good as I write this I want them- now!. I didn't believe how fast I chowed down my side order. I wanted to head back on the kennedy to grab more before they closed. I restrained myself. But from now on large side of baked beans, maybe 2, one to eat later in the week might be a treat. The side special of the day was brisket chili which I picked as a side. It was ok, not something I would get again.
