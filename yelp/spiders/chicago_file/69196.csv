Little Goat Diner////I'm also a huge corned beef hash fan but from Little Goat I wasn't really impressed. Maybe the server hyped it up too much for me? I like my corned beef hash and hash browns really nice and crispy... flavor was good but the meat was too soft for my taste and the hash browns were a little too greasy for me (also has cheese mixed in which I don't usually opt for).
