Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Like I said, for our meals, we went with the deep dish pies.  Honestly, how can you not?  They should throw you out of the restaurant if it's your first time there and you don't order deep dish pizza.  My wife and I went with the Malnati Chicago classic.  It's stuffed with sausage but also comes with their buttercrust.  Trust me - the buttercrust makes a difference.  I had pizza at another famous joint that didn't serve buttercrust and the Malnati pie was much better than the competitor.  We also added peppers, mushrooms and onions to our pizza so it was basically like a supreme pie.
