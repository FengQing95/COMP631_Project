Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My basis of judgement for deep dish spans little to none, unless you wanna count frozen pizza. I visited a friend who recently moved to Chi and requested that he take me to Lou's. The wait wasn't terribly long and as soon as we stepped out to grab drinks down the block, we received a text saying our table was ready. The wait for a small deep dish was probably 6-10 minutes, relieved with a few beers and little complaints. The crust was well-done, nothing was soggy and the sausage was perfectly seasoned. Deep dish wasn't THE best pizza I've ever had but it wasn't done terribly, either.
