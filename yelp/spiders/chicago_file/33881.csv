Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Tourist review: I'm from Texas so when a restaurant in Chicago touted their Elote corn and Ribeye steaks I had to put them to the test. The steak was great, juicy, cooked to perfection (medium rare) and right on with the seasoning without charing. The Elote was very close to home, I'm sure it's a big hit here. Throw in the great service from the bar staff and you get 5 stars, I sat at a high top. Drink order wasn't a run of the mill choice, Vespar, great job on that also. No complaints here, oh yeah you gotta try the bread.
