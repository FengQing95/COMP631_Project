Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service: our server, Ryan, was excellent.  He took us through the menu, gave us great recommendations, and was super friendly. He even gave us recommendations for other places in the city to go the following two days (all of which were spot-on). He didn't rush us at all, and gave us candid appraisals of all of the food we were considering. To us, the hallmark of a good server is one who can add value to the evening.  I can say with 100% certainty our night would not have been as enjoyable had we not had Ryan helping us along.
