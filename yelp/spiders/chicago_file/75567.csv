Little Goat Diner////Reservations at 2 seated soon after @2:15.  Decor is nice place has nice vibe, no AC it is extremely hot inside, very uncomfortable with blinds up.   Service good.  But the food and prices need to improve significantly.  Two of us ordered Reubens ($14 no sides) because we love them,  these were lacking in meat. Spicy sauce so heavy couldn't taste meat, kraut or bread.  Both said it was one of worse Reubens ever.  2 had the Big Fatty Sammich ($15 no sides), which is kinda of a BLT.  One liked it said it was just ok, she has had other items on menu.  The other only ate half said was plain blah with very little meat. 1 had cheeseburger ($15 no sides) she said very filling very tasty and really enjoyed it.  Much tastier food options in the area.  Better places with slightly less cost.  This place is just not worth cost and tolerating the food.
