Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food here is always fun to eat.  To start, we ordered a mixed salad with beets, which was just okay, and the goat cheese with tomato sauce, one of my favorite appetizers to eat.  YUM!  We ran out of bread often but the staff here are happy to keep your bread bowl full if you ask.
