Little Goat Diner////What a fantastic diner! We were a large party and were quickly seated and given immediate attention! We pretty much shared our dishes and all of them were delicious! Special shout out to all the staff, but especially to Ethan Jorjorian, whose recommendations were spot on! Will definitely visit again!
