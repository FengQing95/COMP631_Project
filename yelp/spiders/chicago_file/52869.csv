Smoque BBQ////Good BBQ is part art and part science, and with so many variables even the best are going to have an off day now and then....so I'm still giving Smoque three stars.  It's quite possible that I just hit it at an off time or a bad day, and I won't give up on it yet.  Smoque has definitely earned some leeway, and I hope to raise the rating to 4 or 5 stars down the road.  But another bad experience, and I may be done with it.
