Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Right near my new condo, how could I not check out one of the most established deep dish pizza venues in Chicago. My girlfriend's family had come to visit from Toronto and we wanted to ensure they tried some Chicago deep dish. We ordered the BBQ wings, calamari, and a few large 'The Lou' deep dish pizzas. Our waiter was very attentive and humorous and kept us entertained. The deep dish was good, however, not the best pizza I've ever had due to my travels in Italy and specifically, Naples. Will definitely return for some of their other menu items -
