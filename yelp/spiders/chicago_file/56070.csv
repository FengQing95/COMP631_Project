Smoque BBQ////Smoque BBQ is a good place for BBQ.  I've tried the St. Louis style ribs, baby-back ribs, pulled pork sandwich, and sliced brisket sandwich.  Of those, the sliced brisket sandwich is the one I favor as it is soft, moist, and has a nice smokey taste.  Ribs are so-so, sides are okay, nothing to be desired, which they serve little stingy amounts in these small foil containers...must be a cost cutting strategy.  Cole slaw has a vinegar based dressing which I don't care for.  BBQ sauce is eh, okay as well.  Definitely try their sliced brisket sandwich...a must!
