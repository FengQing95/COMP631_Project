Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was in Chicago for a conference and was looking forward to having some good Chicago deep dish pizza.  Having grown up here I wanted to go with a good friend to get some great pizza. Lou Malnati's didn't disappoint.  We had a great time with some good beer and excellent pizza.
