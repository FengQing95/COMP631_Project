Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place is amazing.  Great drinks, great food, good service.  We started with the wedge salad and some oysters.  The salad was prob enough for 3 with some pretty amazing thick cut bacon on top.  For our mains, we had the ribeye and the roasted chicken.  The chicken was perfectly moist with crispy skin.  We got the boneless ribeye and it melted in our mouths.  Dessert was the whiskey ice cream...delicious.  The good atmosphere and Jameson shots with a pickle back topped off the night.
