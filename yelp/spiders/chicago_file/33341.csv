Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I went to Bavette's last night to celebrate my birthday and everything was top notch-the ambiance, the service, the food...We started with cocktails that were made strong and tasty followed by a delicious red wine. We ordered oysters and salads to share. Each salad selection (smoked white fish caesar , roasted tomato and bacon, and apple mixed greens) was unique and delicious. I had the broiled salmon (It was hard not to  get a steak after all the reviews but I felt like seafood and I was promised to share my friend's steak) and it was made to perfection! My  favorite taste of the night though was the spicy corn side - not what I would normally go for but I could not get enough! The ambiance is speakeasy-esque with big leather booths and candle lit lighting. I absolutely loved it at Bavettes!
