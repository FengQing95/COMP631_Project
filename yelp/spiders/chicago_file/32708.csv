Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food itself is very good (but insanely overpriced as it is a "steakhouse" in River North) and our server was excellent, but overall I didn't enjoy this restaurant too much. First of all its in River North, and its very cheesy inside, with fake antique decor and super bro dudes everywhere (at one point a guy at the bar lifted his t-shirt & showed his back/side tattoo to some lady and then the proceeded to take about 10-20 pictures of themselves). Also the biggest negative was that I had these reservations for about 6 months and we had guests in from out of town and they tried to sit us at the worst table in the entire restaurant (every restaurant has one of these and it's insulting, always horrible location). This table is right when you walk in to the main restaurant to the left, its practically in the middle of the aisle so you constantly have people nudging past you, its so close to the doorway, and its overall just very awkward. I asked to be moved b/c it was an awful table and very uncomfortable. At first they said that we'd have to wait awhile but miraculously a booth by the bar appeared. Our server was very helpful and nice and the food was good but it wasn't my scene and I cannot stand when restaurants have a shitty table and try to stick you in it when you've had reservations for months (that table should be for a walk in). I prefer Boeufhaus overall for their food and atmosphere (which seems more unique and not trying so hard) and Gibsons or Gene & Georgetti for a more classic less river north cheesy dude vibe.
