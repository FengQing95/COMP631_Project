Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Went in on a Saturday morning. Busy as expected but it was worth the 30 minute wait. (Although they said "around 15 minutes" when we asked initially.) The staff was super sweet, the portions were HUGE and the food was tasty. The corned beef hash isn't recommended... it came out overcooked but still edible. The fig and bacon omelette however, was DELICIOUS. I'd go back just for that... and their pancakes.
