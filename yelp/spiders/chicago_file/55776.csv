Smoque BBQ////I recently visited Smoque with my daughter and we bothe loved the place! My daughter had the ribs and judging by the bones left on the tray and the lack of conversation during the meal I can only assume she loved them. I had the chopped barbeque brisket and I have to say it was fantastic. I highly recommend smoque the food and the atmosphere is fantastic..
