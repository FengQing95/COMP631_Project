Art Institute of Chicago////What can I say that hasn't been said? The art collection is breathtaking... it's funny because when I lived in Chicago I never visited but now whenever I am in town it's on the top of the list. You can spend days exploring all of the art here and it's a total trip to see paintings you grew up seeing your entire life like American Gothic in person and close up! We had lunch at the restaurant, was very good, can recommend it and if you like art I also recommend stopping by the Chicago MCA, always worthwhile!
