Little Goat Diner////My favorite brunch spot in Chicago by far. This place is amazing. I ordered the Brandade and Belly 'Benedict', which was a mix of the most amazing flavors. The pork belly was extra tender and juicy, the biscuit was light and fluffy, and the kimchi gave the dish a nice kick. My friend and I also shared the mashed potato tempura. I was a little hesitant at first because I thought it would be a heavy dish, but the tempura was so light and almost had a floral aftertaste to it. Like I said, amazing!
