Smoque BBQ////What is this place that the BBQ gods have bestowed upon us? The best I've had yet.  A true carnivore, i ask for more meat instead of sides and Smoque has never ever let me down.  The brisket is something special.  The pulled pork, amazing. I want some now.   If you don't need to stay then order ahead, stop and buy some beer and be the envy of everyone when you go straight to the front of the line.  In and out in 10 with a line out the door. Go home and make a pig out of yourself.  (No pun intended)  That's wassup!
