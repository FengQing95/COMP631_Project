Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This has to be my favorite place in Chicago for a great steak. Their filet mignon is to die for as it has the right texture and it slides down your throat. I've brought several people here and the reaction has been all the same. To die for! It's definitely worth calling in advance for a reservation.
