Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For dinner, we ordered a cheese deep dish with the butter crust. This took the full 45 mins like the waitress had informed us. The pizza was good! It wasn't amazing though like I was expecting. I thought it was lacking sauce and almost felt like it was a large cheese bread. I would also follow the recommendations of the serving size on the menu. We ordered the medium and was no where close to finishing it and even the server suggested the small.
