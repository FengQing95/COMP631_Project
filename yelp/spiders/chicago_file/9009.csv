Art Institute of Chicago////Dropping a star.   :-(  We took friends this Thanksgiving weekend to visit the Art Institute and the woman handling the member entrance looked surly and was as cranky as she looked.  The museum needs to start paying attention to its employees (and volunteers, if necessary) to determine that everyone is providing proper customer service.
