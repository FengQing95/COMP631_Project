Smoque BBQ//// I want to give this place 5 stars, but I don't go often to BBQ restaurants so I don't have much to compare it to. I used to eat normal chicago bbq... but now, I'll never go back! This place is meat heaven. Please remember, its best to take it home, I've never been able to eat there without getting elbowed in the ribs or get my hands stuck to the sticky table.
