Smoque BBQ////I usually switch between the ribs and sliced brisket. Today got the slice brisket a la carte. For my sides I got peach cobbler and baked Mac and cheese. Everything was delicious and on point. I always bring my friends by here if they crave bbq. I would go at non peak hours so you don't have to wait.
