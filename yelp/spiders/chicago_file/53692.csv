Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Are you kidding me? This is one of my favourite restaurants in the city of Chicago. Talk about tapas...everything I've gotten here has been orgasmically delicious. It is pricey, but my friends and I save up and go every few months. A check-in will get you a free tapas desert! I love the Chicken piri piri and also the sangria is to die for. The wait is usually 2 hours on a weekend, but we just hop over to Marquee bar and Cafe Baabs texts us when our table is ready. Good system! Less busy on weekdays, usually no wait before 7PM.
