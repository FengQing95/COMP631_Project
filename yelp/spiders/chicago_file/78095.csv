Little Goat Diner////Somewhere along the line restaurant designers decided that people wanted to eat in a loud environment because it made them feel like they were in a happening scene. They achieved this by not bothering to hire acoustic engineers. But even an authentic diner doesn't have that kind of ambiance. It's a place where you can hear the rattle of cutlery, and the waitress chatting up the regulars. There's certainly no chance of that here.
