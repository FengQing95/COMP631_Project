Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They probably make the best deep dish pizza in Chicago problem is I'm not a big fan of deep dish pizza. The pizza I ordered was the Malnati Chicago Classic which essentially is a thick layer of some type of meat over a soggy base with a thick layer of tomato sauce and sprinkles of some type of melted cheese. This pizza was so boring I will never recover and or eat deep dish pizza again. The trio of dips and pizza chips and Chicken BBQ club salad were equally as boring and unsurprisingly absurdly massive in proportion. The atmosphere is equally as boring and I resent that the only thing they played on their old school televisions was the fishing channel. I mean c'mon you have a bunch of signed jerseys in glass cabinets on display how hard is it?
