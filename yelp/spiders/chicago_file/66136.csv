Smoque BBQ////Maybe I went on an off day or too early in the morning but the bbq felt a little bit dry. I tried the brisket ribs sausage and gumbo. The brisket was good but unfortunately the rib was no fall of the bone as I expected. I liked that the restaurant provided 2 different sauces a tangy one and a robust sweet one. I like the tangy South Carolina style bbq.
