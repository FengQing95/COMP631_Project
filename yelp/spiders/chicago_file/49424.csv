Smoque BBQ////There was a time I wasn't crazy about BBQ. Thanks to Barry, I'm a definite convert. I dream about the tender brisket and the juicy chicken at Smoque. Even the sides are drool-worthy. I'm partial to the coleslaw, beans, cornbread and of course the fresh-cut fries. The only improvement I could wish for is a second location closer to me.
