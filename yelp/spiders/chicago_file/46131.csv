Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What really stood out was their accommodation of children.  They made a plate of pasta with butter and grated cheese for my 7 year old daughter, gave her crayons and a coloring mat and gave her, get this, Bendaroos to play with.  She was completely thrilled and played quietly whilst the adults got a chance to eat and catch up.  Then she got the dessert tapas sampler.  I can't comment on any of the 6 little bites of desserts that come on the plate, because she would not share a single bit.  I'm assuming that this meant it was very good.
