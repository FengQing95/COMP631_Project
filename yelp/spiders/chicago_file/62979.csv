Smoque BBQ////So of course we ordered pulled pork...sorry Carlos/Omar. We also got coleslaw, Mac and Cheese and peach cobbler. Carlos then came over and he offered us two more sauces to dip in. I really loved the spicy BBQ sauce. It was really yummy. He even hooked us up with sweet jalape√±o peppers. They were so good...I started eating them with my pulled pork.
