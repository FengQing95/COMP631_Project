Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Everything was excellent! The two of us were seated right away. The place is much larger than we expected with plenty of seating. My vanilla berry latte was one of the best I've ever had. Service was too notch! Patrick was great & even accommodated my request for sugar free & soy ;) eggs Benny & eggs Florence were so mouthwatering with extra creamy hollandaise sauce. It was also quick!!!!! Gotta love that :) in & out, completely full in 30 minutes.
