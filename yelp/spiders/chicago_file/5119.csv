The Purple Pig////My wife and I recently visited The Purple Pig for dinner. We tried a Cheese Selection, Crispy Pig's Ears, Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder, and Pork Belly. The Cheese Selection came out first with a trio of delicious cheeses. My favorite dish of the meal came out next, the Crispy Pig's Ears. Addictive strips of crisp and salty pig ears were packed with pork flavor, complimented by sweet peppers and flavorful kale, and topped with a yolky fried egg. The Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder was a tender mound of pork shoulder which sat on creamy mashed potatoes. The Pork Belly was tender with a nice fattiness and topped with crisp radish slices and a sweet ginger glaze. The restaurant also has a large drink selection including an extensive selection of wines, spirits and a decent selection of local craft beer options.
