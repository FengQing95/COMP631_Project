Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////By the time the seafood paella arrived after ~20 minutes, we were stuffed with tapas. I barely made a dent in my portion, which was pretty large. It's hard to say if it was because I was quite full or not, but I was not as impressed with the paella as I was with the tapas. The dish could have used a bit more flavor and the rice seemed a bit undercooked, which makes sense given it arrived at our table earlier than the waiter originally said it would. However, the calamari in the paella was of very high quality and I enjoyed it a lot!
