Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////They make amazing drinks! Best Manhattan that we had on our vacation.  The food is great too. If you order 2 appetizers, an entree, and a salad then that's enough for two people.  We had the oysters, goat cheese dip, Caesar salad, pork chop, a sweet potato, and roasted tomato, but we barely touched the tomato.  The sweet potato was great, though.
