Smoque BBQ////Huge BBQ lover & this place just doesn't do it for me. Recently moved to the north side from the south side & have yet to find a BBQ spot worth going to on the north side. I had ribs, brisket chili, mac & cheese & cornbread. Best thing on that plate was the corn bread. Tasteless, no flavor. And this place is SCREAMING for space. Way to small & you're sitting at atable w/other people u don't know. Reminds me of lunch tables in grammar school. Fat Willy's was slightly better but not by much. Would not return to either of them. Back to the south side I go just for some BBQ.
