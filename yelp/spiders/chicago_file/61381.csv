Smoque BBQ////I was expecting so much given the great reviews this has, but I was disappointed. The meat was dry, definitely overcooked. The sauces were mediocre at best, they certainly didn't do anything for the flavor of the meat but were necessary to combat the dryness. I feel like I must have gone on an off day after reading all the positive reviews, but I'm certainly not jumping to try it again.
