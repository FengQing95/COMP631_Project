Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was my first time at Cafe Ba Ba Reeba, and I couldn't have enjoyed it more.  Originally, we had a reservation for four and ended up having two joiners.  The staff accommodated us immediately.  We got several tapas that were all quite tasty.  The best part of the meal though, had to be the service.  It's rare that you find service so personable and pleasant without feeling bombarded by up sells.  Marilyn couldn't have been more polite and genuine in her hospitality.  She is a gem and anyone should request her for a great evening.  Can't wait to be back and I'll definitely be requesting her!
