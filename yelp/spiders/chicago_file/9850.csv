Art Institute of Chicago////It's shocking how empty it was vs the Met or Natural History in NYC. This continues to be one of my predominant observations about Chicago. It's not crowded or hectic like NYC, in no small part because many streets are wider and the sidewalks like lanes in and of themselves.
