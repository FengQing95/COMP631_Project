Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When it came time to pay the bill, we had 5 cards, but only one with a different amount to charge. We instructed Kate to charge $17 on one card and $34 on each of the rest of the cards. Somehow, she managed to overcharge THREE cards THREE times!! On top of that, one card was charged $102. Where did that amount even come from?? She correctly refunded the overcharges, but three times? Really??
