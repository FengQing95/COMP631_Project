The Purple Pig////If you like pork, then come on over! I have never been to a place that had so many pork dishes. The pork belly is a must try and maybe the best pork belly I've had at an American restaurant. The portions are pretty large and are meant to be shared. I went to lunch here alone to try out the pork belly and gnocchi and was not even close to finishing. FYI bread for the table is $1.
