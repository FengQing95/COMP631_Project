Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place was recommended to me by a coworker and i decided to go on march 11....I made a late reservation for 10:30 at 9oclock, this was kool but i wondered was this a good or bad thing. Now I am definitely critical when it comes to service and quality...and I will tell you that this place is freakin AWESOME....customer service was super great, from the young lady at the door who directed us to our booth to the young gentleman that removed our plates...our waitress Sarah was an angel and the chef must have cooked for kings in past life...lol... Although the upstairs was totally kool with the jazz music and I definitely appreciated where I was offered to be seated, problem was they were out of booths on the main level,only tables...I liked the booths better so the hostess suggested the lower level...i absolutely loved the atmosphere...it was dark but not gloomy quite sexy...it had a 20's &30's gangsta feel mixed with a modern of the same.... music was dope...late 90's early 2000  real hip hop...method man was rockn when I got there...nice right?...the music gradually changed (seemingly on cue)  from french artists to American contemporary...the dry age ribeye was huge, cooked perfectly as I asked medium well-to-well, (something that a lot of chefs don't do right the first time)and  the cole slaw was super fresh and creamy...my dates fillet was just as great!....I passed on the whiskey ice cream only cause we had drank vodka already but next time I will partake....whiskey is my fav:)....but yes I recommend this place to all...I was won over early with the door service and seating, mainly because in the recent past a few other places within the area had not shown my date and I the warmest welcoming. However, this place did no such thing, the entire staff seemed not to even notice our ethnic difference...5 stars all the way around....in the words of Arnold...I'll be back!
