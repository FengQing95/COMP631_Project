Little Goat Diner////We started with the noodle wrapped shrimp which was delish - big juicy shrimp and great, crunchy texture from the noodles. I had the korean burger with kimchee, bacon and egg, and the flavors were amazing. My only complaint is that it practically fell apart when I picked it up and the bun was rather soggy towards the end, but it was tasty regardless. My husband had the pork belly pancake - he said it was good but not super memorable. He also ordered a side of the mac and cheese which he devoured.
