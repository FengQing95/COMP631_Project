Smoque BBQ////I've tried barbecue all over the US so I didn't come to Smoque with high expectations. In my opinion, Chicago isn't really known for their barbecue and Smoque is no exception. The brisket was juicy but didn't have any smoke flavor. My boyfriend pointed out that it tasted like it was braised rather than smoked, and I have to agree. As for the ribs, no one in our group could taste any difference between the baby back ribs and the St. Louis style ribs. And of all the sides (macaroni & cheese, fresh cut fries, cornbread and brisket chili) nothing really stood out as amazing. I appreciate the quick service and BYOB but I doubt I would come back for the food.
