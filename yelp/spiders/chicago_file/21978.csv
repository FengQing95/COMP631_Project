Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The very first time we came here we waited a while to be seated, the host advised us to order right away so that we would not have to wait more once we got a table. I appreciated that! We ordered the classic deep dish Lou's pizza - it was amazingly yummy (first time trying out Chicago style pizza), we got truly stuffed and were content and satisfied!!!! The restaurant atmosphere was great! Service was decent! There is no other pizza joint that compares to Lou's pizza, I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS PLACE! KUDOS!
