Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now about the food.  The salad was drenched with dressing and had what it seemed to be fake bacon bits. The wings had more fat than meat.  The pizza was worse than Digiorno. The sauce tasted sour and was straight liquid. The crust was not good at all and the sausage tasted like lamb. Pizza is supposed to have cheese and this "pizza" had no cheese and the cheese that this had the consistency of rubber. Gross!
