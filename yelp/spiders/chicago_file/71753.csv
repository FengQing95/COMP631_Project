Little Goat Diner////The decor lends to an airy and open diner feel, and the servers' costumes are a modern play on diner style too. Starting off, I definitely recommend the Little Goat coffee, which has chai spices and goat's milk cream. I had the Bulls Eye French Toast, which is made with onion brioche, BBQ maple syrup, yellow tomatoes, and an over easy egg (which is cleverly hidden inside the toast). I did not think that all the flavors would combine so well, but it is neither overly sweet or savory. I also had a side of the cheesy grits, and they were more cheesy than I expected. Not my thing, but even though I didn't like it, I can't say that it was bad.
