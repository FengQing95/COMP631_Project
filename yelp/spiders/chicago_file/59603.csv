Smoque BBQ////A buddy of mine had Smoque cater his Christmas party. I had long been wanting to try it after reading and hearing many glowing reviews. Everything I had heard held up. The food is verrrrry tasty. I was surprised actually at how moist the brisket was, considering the catered food had been sitting out a while. The pulled pork was excellent, and the mac and cheese was top notch. I cannot wait to go to the actual restaurant and get the full experience. BBQ lovers need to eat here. ASAP.
