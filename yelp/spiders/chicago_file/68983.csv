Little Goat Diner////This place was great.   Very much a real (but better quality food) diner.     Lunch was excellent and they give you a larger portion - server knew the menu super well and was very attentive even though it was super busy.   Prices weren't cheap but definitely not out of line at all.     Would definitely go again.
