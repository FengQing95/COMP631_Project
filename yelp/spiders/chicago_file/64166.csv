Smoque BBQ////The restaurant was packed and with a group of 7 people, I had no hope of getting a table.  But magically they got a table big enough for 7 of us!  That's cool!  The guys who cleans and assign tables are cool!  Funny, courteous, and pleasant.  It's kinda nice to feel welcomed at a busy place like that.
