Smoque BBQ////I also think that as far as thick sauces go, Smoque's got one of my fav's.  It's not the syrupy sweet super thick sauce that you wind up buying at the supermarket, nor is it the thin vinegar and mustard based sauce of my childhood.  It's it own beast of delicious tangy flavor with a hint of sweetness.  I like to tear down my rack of ribs and dip just a bit in the sauce, so that I get a hint of the sweetness to accentuate the savory.
