Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Service was pretty mediocre. Â They were probably rushing around a lot because they're so busy. They were putting plates down where they weren't supposed to...etc but oh yeah, the white sangria was really great too! Def. comparable to Iberico. I'd pick either to go get tapas at.
