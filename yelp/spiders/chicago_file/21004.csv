Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Is this the best pizza you've ever had? No. To be honest it wasn't even the best deep dish I've ever had. It was damn good though. I stopped by for a quick lunch, and conveniently they have a bunch of personal pizzas ready to go during lunch, which are pretty much the perfect size, i wasn't looking for a food coma. The staff was also really friendly, I would definitely return next time I'm in Chicago.
