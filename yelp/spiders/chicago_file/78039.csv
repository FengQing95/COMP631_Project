Little Goat Diner////The shrimp & pork belly noodles have fideos noodles, which is a Spanish noodle similar to a spaghetti or angel hair pasta. You get chunks of crispy pork belly, large grilled shrimp, veggies, all tossed in a tamarind vinaigrette. The tamarind is very potent, but not overpowering. The pork belly is crispy and tender, and the shrimp is excellent. The noodles are a bit past al dente, but not soggy.
