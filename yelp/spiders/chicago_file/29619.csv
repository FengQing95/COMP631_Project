Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The restaurant is a lot bigger than it looks on the outside - I believe there are multiple floors and it stretches pretty far back so plenty of seating. There's also plenty of sunlight from the large windows which I appreciate because I prefer to be able to see what I'm eating. Restaurant is clean and the tables aren't packed tightly together. This will be our go-to Lou's in Chicago moving forward!
