Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Skip the long lines at Pizzeria Uno and head to Lou Malnati's! The pizza is better; I heart the butter crust, the sausage that is literally cut as a sheet so that it is distributed evenly though each bite and the fresh tomatoes used in the sauce. Â I'm salivating just writing this review of the Chicago Classic (name of pizza)! The slices looks small but are mighty! Went with my husband and the small was plenty for both of us due to the richness of the toppings and the hearty crust!
