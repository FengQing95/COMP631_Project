Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Lame. Food is average at best. We ordered several plates and all were ok, but just that. Service is slow, everything took time, even the beverages. On top of these, the place smells all the time. We got out with our clothes and hair smelling. Bad experience overall, I can't recommend this place.
