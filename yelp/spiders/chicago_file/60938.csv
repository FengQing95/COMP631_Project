Smoque BBQ////So, I was armed with the address and I made my way down Pulaski from the Blue Line.  It was bright, I had my sunglasses on, I was strutting, saw the address, opened the door, walked in...and it was a dentists office.  I tried to play cool.  I told the receptionists that I was "meeting a friend."  Then I had a pretend conversation on my cell phone with my 'friend' saying that "I was at the office and she could pick me up now..what was that...oh, if you are running late, that is fine.  I'll walk around.  I feel a little awkward waiting at this office anyway..."  And I left.  I am sure the receptionists were laughing at me.
