Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Service?  Not so hot.  The menu recommends that you eat the pizza with a fork and a knife (really your only reasonable choice!), yet getting those utensils proved to be rather difficult.  Not only did nobody ask or notice that my table was lacking, but the waitress that brought the pie took off before I could say anything and then the entire staff began a serious game of hide and seek.  I finally got what I was after, but by then the pizza was a bit on the cold side.
