Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We have been coming to this restaurant since it opened and everything about it has gone downhill.  We ended up finding a table in the bar and canceling our table (Text 9 to cancel your table- don't come up to the host stand and speak to anyone, we don't want to be bothered) The service in the bar was awful.  The bartender acted as though we were interrupting her night and she disappeared for chunks of time.  Another bartender came over and told us we had his undivided attention because he didn't want to make drinks for anyone anymore.  Yay us.  Not.
