Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food here was absolutely delicious! Although the nutella  waffles weren't anything special, you need to try the Citrus french toast! We were all a bit hesitant to try it because of the unfamiliarity behind the concept. Once we did try it though, we were hooked! It was perfectly sweet from the honey and savory from the goat cheese, yet still had a hint of citrus to it. One thing to note. There are a lot of nice tables in this restaurant  for brunch but there is a spot that is dark and dingy and not ideal. Because we didn't specify, we were taken to the back dark area. Make sure to tell them you want a seat in an area with natural lighting. They have plenty of it!!
