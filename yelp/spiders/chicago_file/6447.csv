The Purple Pig////I came to Chicago for a friends birthday and she wanted to eat here. The restaurant is located inside of a building and it was decorated. It's def a vibe! The waitress was very nice and we ordered almost everything she recommended. This isn't the place you come to when you're hungry. The food was good but it's definitely different flavors and animal parts. Lol
