Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had the signature deep dish with sausage, which tasted like the best sausage you've ever had. Not greasy or too salty at all. One medium pizza fed 2 of us with one slice left over. We also had the warm brownie and the chocolate chip cookie pizza deserts which were also quite tasty. Since we couldn't decide between the two they brought us half an order of each which was nice. Prices were very reasonable.
