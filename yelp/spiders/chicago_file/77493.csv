Little Goat Diner////Hash Browns - You can't go to a diner and not get any breakfast food, so I decided to throw these in there too. The potatoes were cut really thin and fried extra crispy, which is a plus for me. It didn't look very cheesy but that richness was felt with every bite (and the next morning too haha).
