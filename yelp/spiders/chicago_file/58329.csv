Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////To start, we ordered a pitcher of the black raspberry sangria which is about 4-5 glasses. Fruity and refreshing without being too sweet. If you like Bloody Mary's they have a build-your-own Bloody Mary bar with all the works including shrimp, bacon, assorted veg, spices, different tomato juices etc mixed with your choice of spirit. Personally not a fan of Bloody Marys - I feel like tomato's are incompatible as bevvies and should only be served in food or soup form.
