Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here several times and never noticed that the tapas here are not all that great. Our waitress was our only highlight here.  We ordered the passion fruit sangria which was actually delicious and enjoyed it on our Anniversary Dinner.  I've been trying to get my husband to try this place and wanted him to be content with our dinner.  Our first dish arrives, spicy potatoes with tomato aioli. The potatoes were extremely dry and the sauce was exaggerated spicy. Even the sauce in Spain isn't as spicy as they were on this date. i ate two pieces and left the dish.  Our next dish was goat cheese in tomato sauce. This was not a bad decision as it was both of our only dish we enjoyed. The goat cheese was creamy and tomato was not spicy.  The third dish was Octopus with potatoes. The octopus was so mushy and tasted horrible. Another dish we had to push aside. The beef empanada arrives and at this point we are both sharing one as all we have to eat is the empanada and goat cheese. We order chicken and chorizo skewers. One bite of the chicken and I just had to stop eating.  It had an off taste and texture as if it was under-cooked. The chicken and ham croquettes were extra crispy and just didn't have a good taste.  They tasted as if they were fried, refrigerated and then refried again.
