Smoque BBQ////Hands down the best in the COUNTRY.  I have had bbq and smoked food in Georgia, Texas, Tennessee, California, and the Carolinas.. bar none these guys are the best.  The brisket is truely award winning and the Kansas city ribs should come with a trophy.  Mac and cheese has layers a flavor and the cobbler is even scrumptious.  Order ahead or expect to wait for this must see hidden treasure in Chicago.
