Little Goat Diner////Showed up during prime brunch time around 11am and there was plenty of outdoor seating! There are 5 socially-distanced tables outside that can seat four people each and only two of the tables were in use when I arrived. Indoor dining was available as well. It began to get more crowded after noon.
