Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////No apology, no attempt at rectifying the situation, no remorse, nothing. Oh, except he did hand me a gift card (that afterwards I saw had no dollar amount written on it so for all I know it a $5 card) and suggested vaguely that the next time I travel all the way from Texas to Chicago, I could use that card 'at another one of our restaurants', which pretty clearly was a swipe, suggesting that squares like us ought to 'just stay out of here.'
