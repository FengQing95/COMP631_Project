Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I don't actually "like" Cafe Ba-ba-reeba that much. It has good'ish food, and good'ish drinks, but there are better tapas bars in the city. Cafe Iberico is MUCH better, in my opinion, and cheaper on all counts. Ba-ba-reeba is always crowded (as is Iberico), but at least Iberico is worth the wait! The one thing I'll give to Ba-ba-reeba is that they do take reservations (whereas Iberico doesn't), which earns them some major points for me.
