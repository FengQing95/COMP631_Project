Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was expecting a lot from this place.  Everyone told me that this was the home of the best deep dish pizza in Chicago.  We got the sausage and mushroom pizza with the butter crust, and ordered it before we were seated so that it would come out faster.  When the pizza came out, the crust was hard, tough to eat, and served lukewarm.  The sauce was okay, but it seemed that the pizza had not been cooked all the way.  Perhaps it was just a bad night for Malnati's.  Surprisingly, the best thing we had was the Antipasto salad which was a little overdressed, but chock full of good vegetables (surprising because no one goes to Malnati's, or Chicago for that matter, to eat salad).  My advice is save your money and go on the architecture tour on the river.
