Smoque BBQ////For 2 people, my wife and I destroyed a full order of ribs, chopped brisket, beans and Mac n' cheese. I can't rave too much over the brisket, but honestly I never do where ever I go. But those ribs is a must. Another must (if you have room for it) is the delicious pecan bread pudding. You will be missing out on a taste of heaven if you don't try it.
