Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love Care- Ba-Ba-Reeba.  They have excellent food and I am a huge fan of the Black Cherry Sangria.  I've been on numerous occasions and always have a great time.  The food is great wether you're at the bar or dining in at a table.  I always find the service to be great even though they are swamped busy.  I havne't had anything here that I don't like.  You MUST try it out.
