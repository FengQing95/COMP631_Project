Little Goat Diner////From what I"ve heard, this place is always just as packed. Luckily, me and a couple friends had a Tuesday afternoon off so when we got there, we were seated right away. The menu is little overwelming, as in, you want to eat every single thing on it. They also have a pretty good beer selection if you into the being a beer snob thing.
