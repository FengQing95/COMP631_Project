Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place has changed my mind about deep dish pizza and the most amazing part is that it changed my sisters mind as well. I was here for a short three day weekend and came here on two of the days because it was that good! My sister has been to Chicago a few times and has tried other places and didn't like deep dish at all, after trying this spot she likes deep dish again! Their ingredients are fresh, the crust is buttery and my personal favorite pie is the "Lou" which is pretty much a veggie pie that comes loaded with fresh tomatoes and etc, I have tried the minatti Chicago classic on the second day after reading reviews on Yelp and I thought it wasn't bad, the sausage was yummy and it's slightly more salty compared to the Lou but still a delicious pie itself for those who love sausages. The only downside is the wait for the pizza is 30-45 minutes but I would still recommend everyone to come try this. I considered going to Gino's on the second day but the prices for their pie was ridiculous and I would rather get two pies from Lou's with toppings compared to one pie from Gino's that is just a plain cheese pie. Oh yea the personal pie is really enough to feed three people! So if you are going with two or three people I would recommend getting two personal pies just to try the different toppings and share !
