Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Nevertheless, what I truly dislike about my experience here was that we got the first beer way BEFORE the pizza arrived and we got our second beer way AFTER finishing the pizza. Essentially we consumed the pizza with water, which is whatever. Meanwhile, waitress kept checking in with other patrons and coming by our table saying "Oh we will get the beer soon!"
