Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were visiting from Boston and heard good things about this place so had to try it - well worth it! The wait was 45 mins for two but they allow you to preorder your pizza while waiting. We were starving so when we sat we order buffalo wings the pizzas ended up coming out right before the wings is they gave them to us on the house. Kalie was our server she was excellent!! Couldn't of asked for better service!
