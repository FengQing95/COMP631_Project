Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered the grilled calamari, garlic shrimp in olive oil, roasted eggplant with goat cheese, garlic potato salad, spicy potatoes and sauce, beef tenderloin with asparagus and yukon potatoes, and I'm pretty sure I'm leaving out at least two more plates. We then after many, many plates, ordered the three chocolate milk cake and the flan, simply to die for and the perfect portion!
