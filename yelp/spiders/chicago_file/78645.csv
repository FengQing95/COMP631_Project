Little Goat Diner////I pretty much forced this reservation on my husband as we couldn't get into Girl and the Goat for dinner. The combinations this place offers are creative and enticing. I had an extremely difficult time deciding between the okonomiyaki and this little piggy went to China, but chose piggy as I was determined my husband would love it and he went with his normal basic bro breakfast. Spoiler, it wasn't his jam totally but anything besides eggs and bacon isn't for him. As for me, I could eat ten of those biscuits! They were so light and fluffy with a little crunch on the outside and the sauce was fantastic. My latte with oat milk was so warming and comforting, like a big hug in a glass.
