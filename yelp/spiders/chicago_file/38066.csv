Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My Chicago Cut Ribeye was very tasty, and cooked perfectly, but I really, really tried to taste the meat, and realized I was only tasting salt and butter/fat. Not really a bad thing, and I still recommend the steak, but as I've said before, though it's a totally different venue/scene/location/vibe, I think the Porterhouse at EJ's in Skokie (yeah, Skokie) is way, way (way) better.
