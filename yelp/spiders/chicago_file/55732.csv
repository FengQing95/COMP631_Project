Smoque BBQ////I really like smoque bbq. Probably one of the best places for bbq in Chicago. Their meat is usually tender. The pulled pork is my favorite, but the ribs are good too. I'm not the biggest fan of their brisket, but I know people who love it. The cornbread muffins are delicious as is the coleslaw (I usually HATE coleslaw). Make sure to end your meal with peach cobbler!
