Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Peri peri chicken thighs - our waiter said this is his favorite item on the menu. It was chicken thighs fried tenderly and covered in a sauce that reminded me of a milder & more tangy buffalo sauce. I'm not a fan of buffalo sauce in general so I was surprised that's what the dish tasted like. However, my partner really liked it as the chicken itself was very good.
