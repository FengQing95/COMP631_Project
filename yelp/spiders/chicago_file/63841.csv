Smoque BBQ////BBQ Brisket: This was one of the most tender and juicy cuts of meat I have ever had. In combination with the smokey char on the outside, you can tell that this meat had been smoked for no less than 14 hr. After 14 hrs this meet was so soft and tender on the inside that you thought it had been watching nothing but adorable puppies forever.
