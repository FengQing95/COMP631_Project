Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Not as good as Gilt Bar in my opinion, but very similar. You enter through a large door into a mix between a speakeasy and a bad Weed street nightclub from the early '00s. Then the hostess allows you to enter the actual restaurant which has a decidedly speakeasy vibe with dark wood, my grandmother's couches (minus the plastic covering) and lots of low lighting. The bar menu is nearly identical to Gilt Bar. My drinks were well made and served quickly.
