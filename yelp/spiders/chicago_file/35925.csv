Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Sexy, swanky, old-worldy, make-you-want-to-wear-pearls-and-gloves, yet not too pretentious kind of place. When you find a place like this, even crappy food seems better. That, however, is not the case here. The food is mouthwatering and delicious, and the service is impeccable. Waiting for our food, I ordered a gimlet on the rocks, and it was perfect in every way. None of the appetizers called our attention, so we got right down to it and ordered the classic bone-in ribeye (medium- and we shared of course) with garlic as the topping, and a side of pommes frites and the elote corn. Everything was phenomenal.
