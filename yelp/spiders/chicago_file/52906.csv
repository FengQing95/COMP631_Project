Smoque BBQ////For a place called Smoque, there was no smokey flavor in their brisket. The staff was very nice, the location was clean, and the bathrooms were very clean. The brisket barely had a smoke ring and I'm almost positive that the brisket was cut incorrectly and didn't sit long enough. It tasted more like they boiled a brisket and tossed it into the smoker for 2 hours to give it a little ring. It didn't pass the pull test either.
