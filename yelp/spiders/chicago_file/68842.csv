Little Goat Diner////One of my favorite lunch spots in the city, the menu is a little quirky, but nothing too crazy that you cannot find something you might like. There always seems to be a long wait here, go at a time that's not the conventional lunch time and it won't be too bad. The Goat burger is delicious, but I haven't tried anything here that I didn't like. It's worth the wait!!
