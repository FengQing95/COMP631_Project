Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Felt like I was back in Barcelona.  I have driven past for years but never understood the tapas thing. (ok I don't get out that much!)  After my stay in Barcelona and Madrid this summer and my cruise in the Med I learned what tapas was all about. I recommend Ba-Ba-Reeba and will be going back.
