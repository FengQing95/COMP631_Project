Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm so glad Lou Malnati was the guy. I'm no Steve Carell, but it has taken me nearly a quarter of a century to breach this horizon...and it was worth the wait. My friends have told me that Chicago deep-dish can't be measured on the ol' bases spectrum; it's an all or nothing sort of deal. Either you get the goal or you don't...and with Lou Malnati's, you'll score every time. I certainly did.
