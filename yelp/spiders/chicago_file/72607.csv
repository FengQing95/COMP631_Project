Little Goat Diner////The goat chili came out first. The meat was tender and had a perfect balance of smokey, salty, and savory flavors, and while it is not at all spicy, we greatly enjoyed it. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for "This Little Piggy Went to China," Little's Goat's Asian fusion riff on the breakfast biscuit. The sausage was tasty, but the sauce was cloyingly sweet, which is not what we expected from the description, and overwhelmingly one note (sesame).
