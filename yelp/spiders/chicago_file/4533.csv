The Purple Pig////Second, holy moly, the food was MIND-BLOWING. I don't think I've ever had food with such amazing flavors. Each dish was more amazing than the last. We started off with the octopus which was perfectly seasoned and cooked, super tender with a nice touch of acidity. The orecchiette pasta had this AMAZING marinara sauce that I've never tasted anywhere else, the pasta was also cooked EXACTLY al dente and not chewy. I've been to tons of Italian restaurants that don't even cook pasta this well. I've been to ITALY three times in my life and haven't had pasta that was this good. Last but not least, the pork jowl. Oh my god, the pork jowl. You know how in food competition, the judge says, "Wow, this dish made perfect sense, every single component of this dish is very well balanced. There's a bit of heat, acidity, salt, sourness...etc." and you have no idea what they're talking about? The pork jowl IS THAT DISH. To be honest, I was super sick and had a stuffy nose that blunted like 50% of my taste but I was STILL blown away by all the flavors. Â It just makes me wonder how it would taste if I wasn't sick...Hmm.. definitely gonna find out next time I visit Chicago...
