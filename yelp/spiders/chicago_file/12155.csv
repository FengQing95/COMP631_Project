Art Institute of Chicago////This Museum is huge. We had Pre-agreed to hit Warhol first. The exhibit is massive. I flew through it in about 3.5 hours. It deserves so much more, even from art Hicks like me. It is put together perfectly and includes all of his art forms. I learned all sorts of things from this Exhibit.
