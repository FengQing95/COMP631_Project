Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Very solid tapas place. I come here when I'm nostalgic for my study abroad days in Sevilla, or whenever I feel like good Spanish food. Bacon-wrapped dates are delicious, as are all the pixtos (tiny tapas), the baked goat cheese, patatas bravas and all the desserts I've ever had there. The paella is good but not fantastic; I'd usually rather save the stomach space and money for more tapas. They have a million kinds of sangria but my favorite is still the classic red. Also, Licor 43 is a must-try! It's a vanilla cordial very popular in Spain and not that easy to find in the states. I've had really, really excellent service here and also just ok service. They have the space to accommodate large groups but be prepared to wait even with a reservation on a busy weekend night.
