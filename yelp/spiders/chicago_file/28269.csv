Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Truly a "casserole on a crust."  We  couldn't get in the first night - there was a two-hour wait, so we ordered delivery to our hotel room: two medium pizzas and two medium salads.  Both were enormous and truly enough for two - very generous.  Good crusts, but...  both pizzas tasted about the same - predominately and strongly of tomato, and not much else.  So in the end, we had to give this highly recommended pizzaria a "Meh."  It might have been different had we had the whole in-restaurant experience, but for this traveler, Chicago-style pizza can be ticked off the list and not need not be repeated.
