Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of the better tapas restaurants in the city of the Chicago.  I ate here with a good friend at the bar because wait times can be somewhat insane so either get reservations or order some sangria.  I did not have a single bad tapas so go nuts on the menu just be prepared of the wait.
