Little Goat Diner////Being a party of 1 and only having time for one meal here, there was no way I could order everything I wanted to try. I ended up with the Los Drowned - a french dip-esque sandwich but elevated and FAR better. The Los Drowned come with braised beef (that basically melts in your mouth), havarti, avocado, pickled peppers & onions, and spicy mayo on a hoagie. I mean. Sound simple, but nononono - it was HEAVENLY. I've never had a sandwich so satisfying for my soul. It was life changing, really.
