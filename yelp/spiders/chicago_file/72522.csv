Little Goat Diner////Apparently Little Goat has a connection with Stumptown Coffee (sustainable coffee farming) which is certainly worth the thought and praise, and apparently they also have a roof garden, which I have not seen, but I understand you can drink and dance there for New Year, or rent it for your wedding. Cool, sounds very fun.
