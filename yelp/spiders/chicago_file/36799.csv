Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////However, there was an incident which you may find amusing.  My friend, probably trying to save a few bucks, and because he had clearly gone mad, ordered the fish special in a steak restaurant.   The fish was Dover Sole.  The fish was over a pound.  It was huge and delicious.   He couldn't finish the fish. He was happy...........everything was great.  Until we got the check. The balance seemed much too high. What could be wrong?
