Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is one of my favorites in Chicago. However, my husband, who has a food allergy was not able to eat much there despite me having called ahead of time so that they could accommodate him. The service is ok, but i'd still give it 4 stars because of the standard menu (if you don't need any changes made and can order things as they are), ambience and prices.
