Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////- 2 servings of paella valenciana (basically paella with a shitload of pork): don't eat this if you're dieting, don't like meat, or are scared of grease. It was delicious and flavors were extremely rich and fatty, but it was literally swimming in grease and there was complete meat overload. Best paella I've had taste-wise, but left me feeling extremely thirsty and a bit guilty afterwards.
