Little Goat Diner////The first thing I noticed was that they serve breakfast all day, so immediately they get a star for that in my book. I also enjoyed their attention to detail throughout the restaurant. Their cute logo can be found on everything from the menu, to the glasses, to the napkin holders, and even on the plates.
