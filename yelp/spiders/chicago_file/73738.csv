Little Goat Diner////Food had great potential but was lacking in flavor and substance. I had the kale salad which was decent but pretty dry. My husband had the fish tostadas, which he loved except he said there was only a couple bites that had fish. For the price there should have been more. It was a little frustrating they texted our table was ready and after walking back to the restaurant it still took another 15 min to get seated. Service was good overall.
