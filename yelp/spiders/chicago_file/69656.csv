Little Goat Diner////BUT I give four stars because my food was amazing.  I ordered the Fat Elvis Waffles, which are peanut butter waffles topped with bananas and bacon maple syrup.  Seriously, the best breakfast dish I have ever had.  I'll be back just to order it again.  My friend had the Spanish Omelet, which looked very souped-up and she said was good but nothing overly special.
