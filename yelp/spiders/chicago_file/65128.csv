Smoque BBQ////I had a wonderful experience at Smoque BBQ today! The food is superb! I always judge a barbecue place by its sides. I can only speak to the ones I actually tasted. The mac and cheese is a small delight. Eat it while it's hot and crispy on top and you will be in mac and cheese heaven. The coleslaw is vinaigrette based. It was  crunchy, tart, and has a lovely subtle onion flavor. Quite good. The cornbread... Wow! It is almost as good as my homemade cornbread. It is creamy and dense and has a just the right amount of actual corn kernels in the batter. If you want to kick it up a knotch don't just butter it, add some of the candied jalapeños! Yum! The french fries are made with real potatoes and are crisp and perfectly seasoned. You can't go wrong with the fries.
