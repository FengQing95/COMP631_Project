Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visited Chicago last weekend and couldn't leave the city without having a Chicago deep dish pizza! I'll get quick to the point. A group of us arrived a little after opening and we were promptly seated. The staff was friendly and the ambiance is very casual. We started off with fried calamari which was good. Not spectacular or anything special, but if you want an appetizer I do recommend that. It was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, just how I like it.
