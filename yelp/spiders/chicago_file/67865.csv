Little Goat Diner////I love this place.  Upscale, creative "diner food" with an expansive menu and always an excellent beer list.  Very casual and easy going.  It's a great bargain for the quality and quantity of food you get.  I have never left this place disappointed.  The pork belly pancake is  a great choice.
