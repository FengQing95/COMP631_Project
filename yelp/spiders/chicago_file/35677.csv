Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The rest of the meal and evening - excellent, attentive (but not overbearing) service. The shrimp cocktail was very good, and the thick-cut bacon side dish was melt in your mouth. The roasted tomatoes were also very good. We capped off the meal with the chocolate cream pie, which one of the hostesses told me when I came in was "life-changing". It came pretty close to matching that description.
