The Purple Pig////First to review Pandemic Purple Pig? Gladly! They are offering curbside pickup or delivery through the Tock app. You can also order wine in the app too. Curbside pickup was super fast as Nick ran out with the food as I was pulling up on Michigan Ave. Chef Jimmy's Italian Feast includes a mixed green salad with beets and asparagus, rigatoni with pork neckbone Sunday gravy, and Jimmy's chicken cacciatore. As you can see from my picture, this was truly a feast for 2! The salad was crisp, and the beets were amazing. The rigatoni was cooked perfectly, but that shredded pork sauce/gravy was out of this world. The chicken cacciatore was rustic and delicious. This is a great way to support your local restaurants during this pandemic. This meal was seriously the best takeout food I've ever eaten!
