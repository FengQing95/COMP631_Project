Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I ordered a customized omelet with hash browns and a short stack of pancakes. The omelet was a little on the buttery side but the hash browns were pretty good. The pancakes were mediocre as well. The portions are worth the price here but the food was just not that special.
