Little Goat Diner////Yes, yes, yes. This place rocks. From the cool atmosphere, Â to the hip location, to the communal seating, to the kick ass food. Nothing disappointed us here. We had the special banh mi sandwich, hot crab dip with ritz crackers, the los drowned and the yummy blueberry crumble. Great lunch spot.
