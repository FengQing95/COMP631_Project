Art Institute of Chicago////So this past weekend we ducked in to check out the Matisse exhibit that closes on June 20th. We did the audio guide to learn more about his work. Hold on to your audio because you can use it in the rest of the museum too. This exhibit featured Matisse's work from 1913-1917. You really get a sense for the evolution of the artist as his works spans from colorful paintings of his studio, nudes of the bathers, black and white sketches, cubism and several sculptures. The huge plaster sculptures looked like Han Solo frozen in carbonite (He's all yours Bounty Hunter).
