Little Goat Diner////Little Goat is so adorable! I loved the name of the diner, the atmosphere, the decor and the more importantly the food. Everything on the menu looked so tasty, but I decided to go for 'The Little Piggy that Went to China' and boy was I pleased. It was so flavorful, not too spicy (not into spicy things) and packed with flavor. From the biscuit to the szechuan sausage, I was having a party in my mouth till the last bite! My sister went with the biscuits and gravy and it was delicious but very heavy. Luckily she went for the half portion but still gobbled it up.
