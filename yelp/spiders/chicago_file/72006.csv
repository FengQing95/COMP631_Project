Little Goat Diner////The hostess had an attitude as we came in.  And the food is ok but it seems over rated.  We had porkbelly pancake and the fish tostadas. They were ok but not great, i wouldn't wait 40 minutes for this food. The waitress was not very helpful either after we asked for recommendations.
