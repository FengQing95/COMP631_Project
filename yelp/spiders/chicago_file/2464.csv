The Purple Pig////On the last day of my recent Chicago trip, we made a firm decision to pig out for lunch at the Purple Pig.  Though it was last minute decision, it seems the odds were in our favor as it was quite near our hotel.  Actually much closer than we thought.  It was literally around the corner.
