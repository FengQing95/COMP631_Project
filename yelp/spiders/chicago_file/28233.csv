Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was my first time in Chicago, so I had to hit the perfect deep dish slice as my first stop. I did my research and told my local friends to take me straight to Lou malnatis. I was not disappointed at all, the cheese/sauce/bread ratio was absolutely perfect. Each bite was its own trip through heaven. For some reason the slices with toppings weren't nearly as good as the classic slice but I was still super content with my meal.
