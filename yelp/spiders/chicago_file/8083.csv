Art Institute of Chicago////Referring to the back, my favorite part of the museum is the Goldman Study Center. In this area they have archives of prints and drawings of so many artists. Screen prints of Robert Crumb, etchings of Giovanni Battista Piranesi, figure drawings of Pablo Picasso, etc! Work that you wouldn't believe. Unfortunately, yet understandably, you have to schedule an appointment to check these things out. But anybody is welcome.
