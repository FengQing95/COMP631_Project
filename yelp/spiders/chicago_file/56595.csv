Smoque BBQ////I ordered the chopped brisket sandwich with mac and cheese. The sandwich is filling as well as incredibly tasty. I was really hungry and my watch read 4:20 but it was very high quality meat. The mac and cheese is even better. I want to fill up a tub with their mac and cheese and bathe in it.
