Little Goat Diner////Ordered the all American veggie burger. Loved the veggie patty but the buns had too much butter. Razzle fries were perfect crispness with the right amount of salt but there was slight bbq after taste, which is good for those who like it. I'm not the biggest bbq fan, but the regardless, they were still good. We were at a table outside - gorgeous weather and great service. There is a bit of a wait, but otherwise I would recommend for brunch or lunch.
