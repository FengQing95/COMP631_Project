Little Goat Diner////Fat Elvis Waffle:  Shared by the table (Myself, mom and the BF)   I love waffles, i love bananas, I love peanut butter, i like bacon.. you'd think this would be great, right?  Eh.. it was waaaaaay too sweet!!  I suggest you order the syrup on the side because the waffle was drowned in syrup and i could only nibble off the ends.  Too much!
