Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////we ordered a half pitcher of passionfruit sangria and continued with some ham and chicken croquettes and rioja short ribs with manchengo mashed potatoes. talk about yummy. followed that with braised lamb with spinach, couscous, and marcona almonds. that dish had a little to much strong flavor to it, so it was a bit much to finish.
