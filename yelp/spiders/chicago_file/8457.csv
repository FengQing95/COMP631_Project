Art Institute of Chicago////THE ICING ON THE CAKE IS THAT YOU CAN EVEN GET FREE TICKETS AFTER THE 23RD AT ANY LOCAL LIBRARY BRANCH IN CHICAGO, but the challenge was there was only 5 passes per branch. Â There will be now 10 passes per branch meaning there will be 3280 free tickets daily available to the public starting on the 23rd of May, so take advantage of this if you get the chance.
