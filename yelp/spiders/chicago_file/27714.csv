Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Around 11AM on a Saturday we stopped in for lunch and the restaurant was still relatively empty which was nice. We ordered a small Malnati Chicago Classic small pizza which took about 30-40 minutes to cook. It's a quick wait when you drink a couple glasses of their sangria.... man those are good! Not too sweet, and packs a nice little punch. When the pizza arrived, it was still bubbling and gooey. A small is perfect for two people because it is just so filling. The buttery crust makes it the best deep dish pizza I think I've ever had.
