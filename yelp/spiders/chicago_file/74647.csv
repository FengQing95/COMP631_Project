Little Goat Diner////The restaurant has a great ambiance and seems to be quite busy all the time. The food took a bit of time to come out...but maybe because I was starving and was slightly impatient when it came to waiting. BUT, IT WAS SO WORTH THE WAIT. My meal was so delicious the biscuit was so moist and sweet which was a nice contrast to the bradade sauce. The concoction was unique but melded so well. I was so excited about my choice. I tasted a bit of the Shrimp and Cheesy Grits, it was good but I liked my dish so much more. To me it was similar to a pasta...not bad but NOT AS DELICIOUS AS MINE...at least in my opinion. The BF and I argued a bit about whose tasted better and I think mine did. LOL.
