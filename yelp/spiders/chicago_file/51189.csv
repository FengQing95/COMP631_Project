Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A group of 5 of us tried the Pintxos platter, the spinach and manchego-stuffed mushrooms (5 only), grilled squid with olive oil and garlic (large portion), spicy potatoes with tomato alioli (large portion) and 2 other tapas I forgot and the seafood paella. I was very impressed with all the tapas but liked the GRILLED SQUID and SPICY POTATOES the most. You can't really go wrong with any of the tapas. Also, don't let my picture of the pintxos platter fool you - everything on there is DELICIOUS and my favorite one was the GOAT CHEESE CROQUETA WITH LEMON GASTRIQUE. Â My only mild complaint was that the seafood paella was saltier and stickier than I would have liked. TIP: TWO SERVINGS of paella is able to satisfy 5 people (2 guys, 3 girls).
