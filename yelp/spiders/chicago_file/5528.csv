The Purple Pig////As someone who doesn't eat pork, I was hesitant to visit the famous swine forward restaurant that everyone raved about. BUT as I looked at the menu I saw an entire section dedicated to veggies and a Mediterranean inspired menu with flavors to entice all types of eaters. The staff was friendly and enthusiastic - ready to answer questions and make lovely recommendations.
