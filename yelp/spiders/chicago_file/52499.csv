Smoque BBQ////I finally convinced the husband to brave Saturday afternoon traffic so we could head over to Smoque and have us a BBQ lunch.  We showed up around 1pm to a full house--plenty of folks getting their Q to go, plenty of others sitting at tables with their BYOB drinks in hand, saucy smiles on their faces.  We waited in line for a few minutes, not a big deal at all, and enjoyed the smoky goodness in the air.  I scored a table while Justin ordered for us and a few minutes later, I was in hog heaven.  I had the 1/2 sandwich of pulled pork, a pile of flavorful, tender meat with a bit of sauce on top, all on a very nice bun (we're not talking Wonder Bread buns here, kids).  The sandwich was great, but even better when I piled my side of coleslaw on top.  I love the slaw--it's not the mayo-laden kind, but a super crisp, fresh slaw with a bite--a perfect companion to the pork.  I got a side of BBQ beans (oh man, these were good) and some peach cobbler so I could get the full Smoque experience, which of course wouldn't be complete if I hadn't stolen some of Justin's mac n' cheese.    He said it was the best mac n' cheese he'd ever had and even though it hurts my ego to agree (I DO make a mean homemade M&C myself), it's true--I've never had such creamy, rich, flavorful mac n' cheese... By the time it was peach cobbler time, my tummy was already full--nothing a little "pattin' it down" couldn't help, though.   The cobbler was very good and even though my stomach was way full, I was glad I didn't have to share with Justin--his enormous brisket sandwich was more than enough for him.  We stuffed ourselves silly for under $20.  A delicious deal!
