Art Institute of Chicago////If the Met had a little sister it would be the AIC- truly a spectacular experience I had here...It was here I saw the "La Grande Jatte" a Seurat masterpiece, the finest example of pointillism and of course our famous "American Gothic" piece... I love their comprehensive Modern Art Collection.  Museums often sets themselves apart by building a certain interest- and here it is their Textiles department and their ever growing photography collection.  If its good enough for Stieglitz and O'keefe then I'd be more than happy to indulge :-)
