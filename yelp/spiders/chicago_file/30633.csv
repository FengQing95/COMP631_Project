Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Get the sausage crumbs and classic peppers, even if that isn't usually how you get pizza. I'm from New York, and if you asked me to compare the best NYC pizza to Lou's I'd tell you they're a separate category and can't be compared, but man Lou's gives any pizza place I've ever been to a run for its money.
