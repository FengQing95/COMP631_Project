Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The redeeming quality was their manager, Peter (I think was his name). He was very apologetic and offered us a complementary pizza due to the terrible service. I was pleased that they actually cared about the quality of their service and our experience, not just their famously delicious pizza--which was very delicious.
