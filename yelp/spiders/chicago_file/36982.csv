Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Wife and I sought this place out as our official Anniversary Dinner spot after our diligent research of so many Chicago restaurants. It was absolutely perfect! Pricey but worth it and in the end so good it feels more like an investment rather than a purchase. No joke. The drinks were creative and dead on. The service was top notch!
