Little Goat Diner////Like Girl & The Goat, you could confidently pick just about anything off the menu.  We immediately bonded with our waiter, who came quickly with offerings of double shot caffeination to suit just about any coffee lover's taste.  I don't usually handle dairy very well and was pleasantly surprised at the proactive suggestion of soy, rice, or almond milk to go with my just brewed super strong coffee.  Now how often do you get three other choices let alone one?
