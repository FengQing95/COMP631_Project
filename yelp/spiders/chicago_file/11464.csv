Art Institute of Chicago////We are so blessed to live in Northbrook and be close enough to Chicago to enjoy the art museum often. My husband bought me a membership for Christmas last year and I'm able to walk in without standing in line and they swipe my card as I walk right in...that kind of makes me feel special!
