Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Overall 3.7 stars. Service was find though I was hoping for some little perks as they knew we were celebrating a wedding anniversary (such as..maybe better corner seats or booth seats or maybe even a dessert on the house). The 2 of us sat in a round table against the edge of traffic and we felt like we were seating far from each other.
