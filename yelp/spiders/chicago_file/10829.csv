Art Institute of Chicago////This place is amazing. I went with a lifelong Illinois resident on his first trip. We did all the pieces from Ferris Bueller, then wandered all over the place. Love the impressionist room and the special exhibit on Danish serveware. If you're a student, remember to bring your ID to get a discount. I was very impressed with their small cafeteria, I had the chicago style dog with french fries, and Â the dish was very good and very reasonably priced. A great place to reflect on your own, to talk about art with a friend, or a fun place as a possible date.
