Smoque BBQ////Had to try Smoque because of all the reviews. It was a fine place to eat but not sure if it lived up to all of the hype.  The prices are pretty high - I paid almost $3 for some mediocre Mac-N-Cheese - and there was not much of it. The pulled pork was good. Tried the beans - ok.  Coleslaw pretty good. They need to move the soda machine to a spot that you can get to easier. Place was packed but efficient.
