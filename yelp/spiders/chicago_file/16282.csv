Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Surprisingly enough, my favorite pizza didn't come from either Gino's East or Lou Malnati's.  This distinction was saved for Pequod's Pizzeria, which was not on my radar at all until I talked to some local foodies.  Check out my review on that if you're curious about what I perceived to be the best pizza I had the pleasure of trying in Chicago.
