Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago is a major museum with all kinds of interesting and surprising collections (coats of armor, paperweights,...).  What impressed me especially was the wonderful attitude of the guards/docents who work in the individual galleries.  As we wandered around, we were greeted with enthusiastic welcomes and offers of assistance and information.  The workers told us about their favorite pieces and encouraged us to explore areas that we might have missed.  I had never encountered this behavior in any other museum and am certain that it contributed mightily to my appreciation of the exhibits.
