Art Institute of Chicago////My husband and I stayed in the Van Gogh Airbnb bedroom, and everything about our stay was amazing. But, more about that in my review of the room itself on Airbnb. Here, I'd just like to say how impressed I was by all of your kind and competent staff. We had a lot of fun seeing the Van Gogh exhibit, but such great fun seeing many of your other exhibits as well. It's clear from your responsiveness and costs (both inside and outside the institute) that you're all there because of your passion and commitment to making these ineffable works of art available to EVERYONE!
