Smoque BBQ////Haven't been in a few years and made the drive into the city as years ago this was a sure thing.  And, it didn't disappoint.  Sliced brisket platter, side of mac/cheese and baked beans is just what the doctor ordered.   Flavorful on all fronts.  Meet was tender and not dry.  Mac/cheese rocks and baked beans bring it all together.
