The Purple Pig////Service was awesome. I wish I remember the name of the lady who waited on us at the bar. She was very helpful and gave us great recommendations. We were eye hungry and wanted to order many different plates but she told us to just pick 3 and after those 3 plates if we're still hungry then we can order more and she can get those plates out quickly for us. I'm so glad she told us that because after 3 plates we were STUFFED. It would've been a waste of food had we ordered more.
