Smoque BBQ////Obviously I like Smoque. It's impossible not to like Smoque unless you lack tastebuds. However, I do not LOVE Smoque like so many others do. Yes, it's better than most BBQ places around here. Yes, it's probably the best BBQ place in Chicago. However, Chicago isn't necessarily a BBQ Mecca (see KC, Memphis, Carolina, Alabama, Austin) and a lot of other places in the city are nearly as good as Smoque.
