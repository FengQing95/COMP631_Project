Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was on the hunt to try my very first deep dish pizza while visiting Chicago during my layover. This place did not disappoint. Service was great! Very nice staff. Although wait time for the food was long because they make all there pizza fresh I am happy I waited. I got the Express Meal which came with a Pepperoni deep dish pizza, A salad ,and a soda for only $12 such a steal. I dined outside since it was a nice day.
