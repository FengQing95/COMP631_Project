Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here on a saturday night and the place was packed! The hostess gave me a pager but ended up just sitting at the bar. The bartender (I wish I remembered his name) was very friendly and attentive. Cafe ba ba Reba is a tapas style restaurant so we ordered pretty much everything on the menu. The bacon wrapped dates were soooooo good! We had ordered a pitcher of the mango and razzberry sangria, which was amazing. Definitely hoping to go back soon!
