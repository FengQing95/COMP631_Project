Little Goat Diner////That sammy was slammin. The sprouts were great too. I polished them both off embarrassingly quick but not a single waiter pointed it out (none of the classic "guess you really liked that sandwich, huh?"). The worst part for me was that I was there alone so I didn't get to try anyone else's food. If the guy next to me hadn't followed my lead and ordered the Reuben, I probably would have asked him for at least a bite. Second worst part is that I'm constantly suggesting going to Little Goat Diner before remembering that it's in Chicago and I am not.
