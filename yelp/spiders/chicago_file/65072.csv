Smoque BBQ////A friend and I stopped by Smoque on a Sunday afternoon around 5pm for a quick bite to eat. He was visiting from Minneapolis and Smoque was his pick after hearing stellar reviews all the way up there. When we arrived most of the tables were taken and there were about 15 people in line in front of us. We gave our name to the host and hoped a table would be available when our food was ready but we knew this place had to be good given how packed it was. The menu had plenty of options from brisket, pork, ribs, many sides, etc. Pretty typical for a BBQ joint. Just staring at the menu made my mouth water...
