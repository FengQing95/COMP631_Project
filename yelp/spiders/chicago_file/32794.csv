Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One side note: I didn't even come close to finishing my 12 oz filet and bone marrow accompaniment plus a little of the elotes and mashed potatoes - so I thought perfect leftovers for the hubs.  I told the person that took our plates (not our server) that we wanted my plate & the sides packed up - he neglected to pack up the bone marrow.  I should have checked ahead of time but I didn't.  I did call the restaurant to let them know - more for the next customer.  They are fairly new so wasn't offended.
