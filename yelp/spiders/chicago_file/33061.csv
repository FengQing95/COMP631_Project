Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Good. Worth the money?? I'm not so sure about that. There was a "chain restaurant" quality to it, which took away from the ambiance. Â I had previously eaten at Maudes Liquor Bar, and their food and presentation is almost identical to Bavettes. (they're owned by the same company)
