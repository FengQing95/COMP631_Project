Art Institute of Chicago////Next time I visit I want to check out the museum's free, downloadable app to see what that has available in it. The MoMA in NY & Louvre in Paris have both done very cool things with their app and we loved using it - it even showed us how to get around the museum which was hugely helpful. AIC would definitely benefit from something similar (if they don't have it already!).
