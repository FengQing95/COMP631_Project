Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's has it down to a science.  Last time I called and placed my order they said it would be ready at 6:06.  Not 6:05, not 6:10, 6:06.  I got there a few minutes early and they said it will be ready in 4 minutes.  Okay.  So now I'm watch and sure enough, 6:06, out comes my pizza a salad.  I always get the Lou's salad and a thin cheese pizza.  So good.  Crust is delicious.  My only complaint and reason why it only gets 4 stars, I asked for a well done pizza and when I got it home it was just melted.  It was still good but not what I wanted.  I know they were crazy busy but they should still make sure they give you what you want.
