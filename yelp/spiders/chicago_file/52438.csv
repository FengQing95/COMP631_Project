Smoque BBQ////I ordered the 1/2 pulled pork sandwich w/fries.  Had I known the sandwich was going to be so small, I would have ordered the full size.  I couldn't stand the BBQ sauce - thought it was WAY too watery, and not very flavorful either.  My husband ordered the 1/2 pulled pork 1/2 brisket sandwich and said it was dried out.  My son ordered the mac & cheese.  While the mac & cheese was good, it was not served as I had heard it was - with a crispy breadcrumb topping.  I've heard the topping is the best part of the mac & cheese.  The coleslaw was edible at best - nothing spectacular.  While we were waiting for them to call our number, I overheard what was going on at the counter.  Two people returned to the counter with their trays of food, complaining about one thing or another.  Another man was trying to order the BBQ chicken, but was informed it wasn't ready yet, and was still in the smoker.  Hello???  The place opened at 11:00 AM, and this was just past noon.  How can any good restaurant not have menu items available when the place opens?  Oh - and the dining area. It leaves MUCH to be desired.  Super bright sunlight coming in and bouncing off the huge metal ductwork on the ceiling; concrete floors, plain Jane tables.  Not that I would expect Architectural Digest style decor, but this was just pitiful.
