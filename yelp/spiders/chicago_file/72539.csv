Little Goat Diner////We stopped in here for a late lunch before heading to the airport on a Saturday. We got the crab dip as an appetizer, and although it was really tasty, I couldn't really taste the crab. For my lunch entree I got the reuben sandwich with kimchi on it. It was amazingly good. It was quite large, but it was so good that I boxed up the second half and took it home with me on the airplane and enjoyed it again the next day. The service is super friendly and the atmosphere is really fun. Definitely check it out if you're in the area!
