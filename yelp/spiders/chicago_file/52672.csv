Smoque BBQ////Ok, I wasn't impressed the first time I went there but wanted to give them another chance tonight. I'm sorry to say I was even more disappointed this time. I understand the name is Smoque but that doesn't mean everything has to be smothered in that taste. It was a cross between that and burnt flavored. I'm still trying to get the taste out of my mouth. The fries and brisket chili were decent, the baby back ribs and chicken were not. This was definitely not worth $26.00. I wont be back.
