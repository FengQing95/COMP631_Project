The Purple Pig////The pork chop had a great flavor and was cooked very nicely, but wasn't particularly interesting and not terribly unique. It was a tad salty and towards the end of the dish it was getting a bit hard to eat without continuously drinking water. Given the price point, I also wish it came with some sort of starch or veggie, as this was the last dish served and we didn't have anything else to eat with it.
