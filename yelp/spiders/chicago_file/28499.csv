Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Malnati Chicago Classic Deep Dish Pizza: 4/5. This was our first time having deep dish pizza ever, but our hopes were high because we're pretentious. Unfortunately my lactose intolerance meant I could only have a few bites, but I got the gist...very delicious crust (their signature "Buttercrust" I believe), lots of tasty meat and gooey cheese center. Really good! It fell slightly short of our expectations because it wasn't as deep as we'd hoped, and the cheese was almost rubbery, which is strange because it shouldn't have been sitting out for long before arriving to our table.
