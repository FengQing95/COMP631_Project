Little Goat Diner////The restaurant atmosphere is kind of like an upscale diner, but the food is great!  We tried the veggie burger which was one of my favorite veggie burgers I've had at a restaurant: not too dry and nice flavor!  I also recommend the TIramisu milk shake which was delicious!  If you like ginger, they sell an amazing spicy ginger ale.  Best ginger ale I've ever had.  Definitely worth trying this place!
