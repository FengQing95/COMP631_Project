Little Goat Diner////I've been here a few times now at different times a day, and it's definitely worth the long wait in line for the lively ambiance and quality of food. I love taking out of town guests here because 1. Famous top-chef association 2. Chicago-y and 3. The food is tasty with a twist...way better than standard American fare or Deep Dish.
