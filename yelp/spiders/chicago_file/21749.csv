Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ate pizza 3 out of the 4 nights we were in Chicago and Lou's was by far the best one! I've always preferred thin crust, so I wasn't expecting to like Chicago-style Pizza, but Lou's left me wanting to go back. I just might order one to be shipped to a me in Dallas because I can't stop thinking about how delicious it was!
