Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Peppered duck & goat cheese terrine was ahhh. may. zing.  Just a hint of pepper to it, set off to perfection with the creamy goat cheese and the sweetness of the apricot mustard.  The toast is a thick bread and accompanies heartily.  When we ran low on it we didn't have to ask for another helping - it was offered promptly.
