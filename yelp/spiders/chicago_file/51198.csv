Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We visited tonight for the first time! It certainly lives up to the hype! The food was so tasty and the service was phenomenal! Our server, Michael, was great-he was attentive and knowledgeable (his knowledge of the menu was very impressive and helpful)! The manager, Teresa, also checked in with us! She was very kind and made sure everything was perfect! We had several dishes and they all tasted great! I had their seasonal sangria (mango) and it was amazing! The price was also right! It was a great dinner all around!
