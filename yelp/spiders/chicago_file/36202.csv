Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////On our way to Gilt Bar tonight and was intercepted by Bavette's.  The desk ladies directed us to the bar downstairs where we were taken care of by the raddest girl I've met in a while, Riley.  She was a great mixologist, knew her stuff and kept us with a smile on our face the whole time.  I didn't get a chance to indulge in the food, but knowing Hogsalt, I'm sure it was on point.  As a bartender myself, I was impressed with everything, from atmosphere to service.  Definitely not let down.  Next time you're in River North, trying to sift through the many options to grab a drink or food, definitely give this place a shot.  It stands out among the saturated night life that is River North.  Ask which bar Riley is at, because thats the bar you want to be at :).  She makes a mean Sazerac. Ya'll rock, keep it real, keep it G.
