Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Instute of Chicago is a vast, intriguing, provocative museum that has something for everyone.  They have art from all eras, ranging from Impressionism to contemporary to  African art.  There is a neat medieval renaissance exhibit tucked in a back corner with horses, armor, and weapons. . There was a gorgeous collection of Middle Eastern and Muslim fabrics, jewels, and artifacts on display while we were there.  There are also sculptures, Greek art, oriental art, Indian art.  There is something for everyone.  There are also really good audio tours.  This is part of the Chicago City Pass, which is a great value:  the art museum, Hancock and Willis tower, The science museum, the planetarium, etc.  This museum is a must do.
