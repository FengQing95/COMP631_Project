Little Goat Diner////Apple pie baby me-oh-my, it's a Willy P kinda day!!!  But wow, let me get ready to tell you about Little Goat's Dinner, a locals-only type place where u can trade in your $$ for grubies and good times.  Well, Big D was in from Scotsdale AZ and he din't look so good so i told him lets eat, thatll get u back on your feet again, and everything will be ok again like it used to be. A littlt bit about Big D is he mistrustful of almost anyone mainly cuz of what happened at the ice skating ring he worked at in Flagstaff AZ where i don't think he's really got over all that.
