Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Despite my love for Chicago and living here, I've never warmed up to deep dish pizza (I still consider it a doughier lasagna). However, if I had to deep dish, I would definitely go with Lou's. It's not too heavy, and it has a nice pan crust that gives it edge a wonderful crispiness.
