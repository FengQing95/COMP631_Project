Art Institute of Chicago////I love this museum. I wanted to run through it like Paige and Leo and re-enact the scenes from Ferris Bueller's Day Off. We captured most of the scenes, all but one: the kiss in front of Chagall's America Windows. Ho hum. PRO TIP: Some of the paintings have been shifted around and won't be exactly like the movies.
