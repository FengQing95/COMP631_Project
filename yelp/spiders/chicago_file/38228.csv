Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I requested the steak to be less salty, and then waited over 45 minutes and a follow up with the bartender before it arrived. Perhaps they didn't get my request for the steak to be less salty, but by the second/ third bite, I couldn't eat it anymore. It was beyond salty! The bartender offered to make me another one, and said if I wanted it less salty, I'd have to wait another 40 minutes. Since I already waited so long for my steak, I sort of expected them to have done it right the first time, but they didn't.
