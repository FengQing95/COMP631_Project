Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Is this a good restaurant? Yes, absolutely. Does it live up to the hype? Not quite. I came for brunch for restaurant week and was impressed by the variety on the menu, the insane bloody mary bar and the physical space. As a tapas restaurant, Ba Ba Reeba offers every little taste you could ever need for a weekend brunch... sweet, savory, spicy, you name it. SO, you know that huge internal debate you have when there's pancakes/waffles versus scrambled eggs and hash on the menu? Here, you can take both sides by ordering a bunch of their pinxtos (small bites) and sharing brunch tapas! The bloody bar, which costs $10, is well worth the price- you get your choice of booze (Grey Goose is the same price as Ketel One, HA!) and as many accoutrements as you can fit in your glass. Cocktail shrimp, olives, pickles, spices, hot sauce, celery, pearl onions, tomatoes, garlic, salami, and your choice of gazpacho or tomato juice. Basically, just stuff your glass with shrimp and call it a day! The food we ordered was tasty in general, but everything was too rich- the waffle-battered chicken stick was basically a greasy chicken sausage corn dog.The Ib√©rico ham hash was also too greasy, salty and overall heavy. My favorite dish was probably the citrus french toast, but even that was too much on its own (the goat cheese butter, while great in contrast to the honey-covered toast, was pretty overpowering). Even thought the food wasn't the best, the place is worth visiting for the experience. It's HUGE and really does have a Spanish courtyard vibe. The paella is even served traditionally like they do it in Spain (the waiter prepares your plate at your table, and you serve more from the skillet as you need it). Might be back, but I'll choose menu items more carefully next time!
