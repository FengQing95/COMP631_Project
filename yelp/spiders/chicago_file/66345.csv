Little Goat Diner////If you eat breakfast here in the morning, you may not eat the rest of the day.  Portions are very large.  I had the sourdough pancakes, after being assured that they were not on the menu just to have a pancake on the menu.  Excellent.  Outstanding.  Also, the housemade sausages were great.  The cinnamon roll was shared and really good.  One thing to remember, on weekends, this place fills up fast.  Get there early or bring a paper or two or a e-reader, grab a cup of coffee at the adjacent bar/bakery and sit in for a wait.
