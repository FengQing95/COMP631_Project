Little Goat Diner////After many attempts to come here on a weekend I finally made it on a monday.  The place was full but there wasn't a wait.  I had the sourdough pancakes they were pretty thick and very filling. The sourdough wasn't overwhelming and there was a slight sweetness. The maple sausage had good flavor but they were visually unappealing very short and fat. The hashbrowns were good just wish they had onions
