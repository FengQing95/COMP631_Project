Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The restaurant is definitely perfect for a great date night.  The lighting helps but what they did really well was the actual spacing of the tables. We've been to a lot of other restaurants and we've been put in seats where you can hear the lip smacking of an open mouth eater because their table is 4 inches away (this is not exaggeration by the way... quack quack bleat).  It has glamour chandeliers and the seating is perfect to focus just on the two of you.  We had a 4 top to ourselves magically and honestly, I couldn't be happier.  Even though we were the first table to be in the line of the open cold door... it was still far enough that we never felt a big draft.
