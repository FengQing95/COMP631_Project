Art Institute of Chicago////This is a world class art museum.  We both downloaded the iPhone app (free WiFi there) and had tour phones included with our Go Chicago passes.  I think the tour phones would have been $8 otherwise.  We used the tour phones a little in the beginning and they were pretty useful.  We didn't use the iPhone tour apps, but I could see using them if we spent more time there.
