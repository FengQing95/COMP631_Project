The Purple Pig////Attention all foodies!  You MUST try this place!  It truly is a flavor explosion in your mouth.  I've lived in Chicago for 27 years, I eat out a lot,  and I think this was one of the best meals I have ever had.  The wine list is incredible, and the service is outstanding.  It's a casual, hip place so you don't have to get all dressed up and you get 5 star food.  My husband and I shared a plate of broccoli and the pork shoulder and it was amazing.  There are so many flavors on your plate that you normally wouldn't put together that are just wonderful.  The chef is creative, gives large portions and you won't leave hungry or disappointed.  I highly recommend.
