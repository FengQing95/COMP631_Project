Art Institute of Chicago////If you are at all interested in going to the Art Institute more than once a year, it makes total financial sense. The member ship is $70-80, which seems steep initially. But think of this, you and one other person can go to the museum anytime you'd like and garner free entrance to all special exhibits. Plus, what they don't tell you is that there is a sweet Member's Only Lounge within the museum to get a cup of Joe and have a loungy break during your visit. Plus, there are lots of Member's Perks that you find out about in the two-monthly newsletter-- early admittance to exhibits, special lectures etc.
