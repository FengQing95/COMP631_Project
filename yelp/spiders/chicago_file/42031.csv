Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So the nicest and most unexpected surprise about this place is the obvious value they place on their customers.  We made a reservation for 8:30 that night and were not seated until 9:15, not that big of a deal because we enjoy each others company and even more so over a glass of sangria.  Anyway, once we got seated the owner/manager (not sure which) came over and apologized for the wait.  We assured him it was no big deal and that we happily kept ourselves busy at the bar in the meantime.  At the end of our meal he brought over the check and it displayed a big fat $0.00.  The collective reaction was WHAT?!  This is AWESOME!  and very very unexpected.  I'm never one to turn down a free meal but it is especially nice to be treated to one when you don't really think you deserved it (ie: we were not the bitchy party who yelled at the hostess about the length of the wait, claiming that it "should not be that difficult to estimate the time to get a table" since they are "a restaurant after all!").
