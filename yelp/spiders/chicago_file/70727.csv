Little Goat Diner////Cute place but I don't really understand what the long waits are all about.   The menu is a little weird - there were not a lot of healthy options.  I asked if the fish tacos could be made with fish that wasn't fried and the answer was no.  I ordered the kale & chickpea salad with chicken and it was really, really good.  The vinaigrette dressing was packed with flavor.  Our waiter was a nice guy, though he was wearing a knit beanie hat, which I thought was a bit bizarre for a waiter.
