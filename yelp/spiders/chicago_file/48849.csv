Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I called Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba less than a week in advance to reserve a good-sized surprise birthday party (10-12 people) for my girlfriend. They were flexible on timing, and asked if I was celebrating a special occasion. When I mentioned that it was my girlfriend's birthday, they asked her name and said that her dessert would be comped. Great customer service!
