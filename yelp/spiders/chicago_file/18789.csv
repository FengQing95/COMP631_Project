Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ate early dinner this past Sunday night, which was the Marathon day. They said it would be an hour 15 wait, but they called me in 45 minutes. This was the last positive thing that happened in the meal. I ordered wine and bruschetta for an appetizer. It came very quickly, which seemed good, except the bread was cold, and super crunchy. As well, I was done with the appetizer before the wine showed up. The pizza took a long time which was not really a problem, and it was expected. But the second glass of wine took even longer to show up. The deep dish pizza was good, but lots of places have good deep dish pizza. To me, this was not nearly as good as Uno's, or Due's, and even a step down from Giordano's. So, while the pizza was good enough, the service and the wait make Lou Malnati's low on the cost/benefit scale. Definitely not worth a repeat.
