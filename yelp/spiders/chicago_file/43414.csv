Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////After so many people telling me about this place, I finally made the 1 hour drive to go there. Overall, the ambience is pleasant, the tapas are amazing and the sangrias are heaven. I tried the paella Valencia which was with rice, pork belly, roasted pork and sausage and I wasn't pleased at all. The rice was harder than I prefer and it had a lack of seasoning with a weird smoky flavor. I was looking forward to this dish but very disappointed. However, the tapas were delicious.
