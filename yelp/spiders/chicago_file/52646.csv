Smoque BBQ////I have been there a few times.  It is always good. Not great.  The last time we went there it was crowded as always.  I don't mind waiting.  The brisket was okay. Good smoke ring.  I don't eat Mac & Cheese.  I wanted another roll.  "98 cents" is what the server told me. Was very happy to take my money. He was not too happy to give me my damn roll. I stood there over 5 minutes. The same guy came over to ask me WHAT I WANTED?  I said are they milling the wheat or something. I had to show the same guy my reciept before he gave me a roll.  Good food not worth the hassle.
