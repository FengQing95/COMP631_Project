Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////2 advices - 1. Don't come here on an empty stomach like I did! You will starve to death waiting and stalking the poor waiters! Ordering ahead doesn't really help unless you are in for a very long wait for seating. 2. Don't order the individual size that serves 1. You won't get much of the toppings and the crust will hurt your mouth.
