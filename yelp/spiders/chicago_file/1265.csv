Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This honestly wasn't the best pancake place I've had. The pancakes were too dry and the service was incredibly slow! we were waiting for Â about 30 minutes for the waiter to come take our order and to come take our food. The only thing I really like was there hot chocolate, but even then it wasn't the best. However I'm still glad I tried it although I wouldn't recommend this place to my friends.
