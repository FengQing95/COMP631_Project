Little Goat Diner////I don't mean to be dramatic but this was the best dining experience of my life. We went in for a hungover brunch and sat at the bar with Julia, who was phenomenal. Amazing bartender, super friendly, and kept her cool during what looked like a hectic busy morning. The Okonomiyaki and This Little Piggy Went to China were both so fantastic that I haven't been able to stop thinking about them. The entire menu looked amazing and I can't wait to go back for dinner!
