Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Everyone always asks what is the best Chicago Style Pizza.  Lou Malnati's is always my recommendation.  They don't always have the crazy crowds you get at Giordano's or Gino's and Lou's is way better!  They have multiple locations around the city but I went tot his one and got a table right away, service was good and the pizza was excellent.
