Art Institute of Chicago////I didn't know about the Thorne room of miniatures. I spent over an hour there and it turns out you can take pictures of some collections (if not on loan) as long as you refrain from using a flash so I took a ton of pictures of the mind-boggling detail on these drawing rooms, kitchens, living rooms etc.
