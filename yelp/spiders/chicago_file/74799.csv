Little Goat Diner////I think my expectations were too high since everyone has raved over it. The drinks I give 5 stars, but the food 3 stars. I feel like it's the naturally beautiful girl that puts on way too much makeup - and detracts from who she actually is. The menu seems like it's trying way too hard - kimchi pancakes (or something similar - I can't remember perfectly) weren't the balance of sweet/salty/umami/ that I expected. I'll definitely go back for drinks, but not for food - 4 out of 4 of us were disappointed with the food.
