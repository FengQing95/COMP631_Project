Little Goat Diner////Little Goat is always a good brunch option. Made a reservation for brunch a few weeks ago and they had our table ready as soon as we arrived. Split one of their Ooey Gooey Cinnabuns - obviously delicious. For my main, I ordered the Smoked Corned Beef Hash with poached eggs - amazing! My friend ordered the Bi Bim Bop Breakfast Bowl and loved it. Great atmosphere, great staff and great food.
