Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was my drink. I had a mint julep and it was too strong. The service wasn't the best I've ever had, but the waiter was personable and wasn't gone for long periods. I'm a huge fan of service when you're paying $100+ per plate; again it's not terrible but not on the level of like Chicago Cut/Maestros/Gibson's.
