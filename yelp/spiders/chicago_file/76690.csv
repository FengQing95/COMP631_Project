Little Goat Diner////It was my own fault really, I was in Chicago for 36 hours & I had a 'To Eat List' as long as my arm, with little time to conquer it. I ran around this city like a crazy person; I ate Chicago Dogs, Deep Dish Pizza, Italian Beef... More Deep Dish. To say I felt gross is pretty much an understatement.
