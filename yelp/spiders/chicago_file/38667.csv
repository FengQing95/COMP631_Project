Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I can't completely remember what we ordered when we went for my stepdad's birthday.  I do remember having the pomme frites and creamed spinach, which were both good.  While waiting for food, you get bread and butter.  Their freshly made bread is the best! I always have to restrain myself from filling up on the bread since I could really just eat it forever and ever.  I think it's a sourdough that has the perfect crunchy crust and soft, chewy, moist inside.
