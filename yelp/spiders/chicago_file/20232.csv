Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Arriving in about 10 minutes, along with a fresh plate, was our main event - a medium Lou with Buttercrust, Fresh spinach, mushrooms and sliced tomatoes covered with a blend of mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese.   Served in prototypical deep-dish glory the pie came steaming hot with cheese still bubbling and the thick buttery crust layered all the way to the top of the pan.  An intoxicating aroma I had to bear in mind the temperature to make sure I didn't burn my mouth digging in.  Slicing the pizza with an enormous pizza cutter we were each plated a hefty slice and waters and teas were refilled.
