The Purple Pig////Highly recommend this place! Came here for a simple dinner around 6pm (was barely getting packed, started becoming busy and packed around 7pm) and walked out blown away! I didn't expect the restaurant to be inside another building but it worked out as we got a table by the window. The place is a bit cramped inside so it all worked out with my big jacket and all.
