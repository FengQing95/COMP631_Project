Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Fun place to eat. Sangria was just "good" not "great". Food was good. I liked the skirt steak in particular (very tender, yum). Prices were high, but reasonable for the area/type of restaurant. I thought the menu was relatively limited from other Tapas place I've been to, but that's just me. I recommend at least giving it a try. I definitely think Cafe Iberico is a better value and has tastier food.
