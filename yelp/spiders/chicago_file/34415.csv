Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I had did my research on Bavette's prior to coming...I can't even begin to tell you how AMAZING my experience was!! The service was hands down the BEST...all the staff were so accommodating and friendly!! The food was better than amazing...the shrimp cocktail were bigger than I thought were ever possible!! The peppered duck and goat cheese terrine was something I never experienced...the bread alone was so fresh and tasteful, the apricot sauce was to die for and then the peppered duck with goat cheese was the cherry on top!!! Our main entree was filet mignon and it literally melted in your mouth with the bearnaise sauce!! Then we ended our dinner with the whiskey ice cream and chocolate cream pie (heard many good things about this dessert), HOLY MOLY...it was honestly the best dessert I have EVER had!!! So, besides the amazing food and service the ambience of Bavette's was incredible. Perfect date atmosphere...I highly recommend going!! So excited to have got a reservation and can't wait to visit again!!!
