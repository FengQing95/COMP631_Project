Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I frequent this place quite a bit - food is good, ambiance is lively and it always provides a good time for me and my girlfiends.  It's one of those places that are fun with good food to boot.  We come here when we're in the 'hood, when we're feeling like a girly gossip session or big group dinners.  Tapas just works for those occasions.  It's just...pricier and not as good as other tapas joints I've been to.  Will I be back?  Yea, sure, why not.
