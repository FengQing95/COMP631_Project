Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!//// Â The 9 tapas we ordered included: spicy potatoes (prob my favorite dish here, the potatoes come out really hot and crispy and the sauce is delicious), the bacon wrapped dates (i absolutely love this combination, if any of you enjoy sweet bacon this is the dish for you), the short ribs (omg the meat just melts in your mouth), the stuffed mushrooms with spinach and manchego (so good), the garlic shrimp (the shrimp was fresh and it was tasty but in comparison to the other dishes this was just ok), the scallops with pine nuts and pesto (i thought this was a very creative dish, the combination of pesto with pine nuts, tomatoes, raisins with scallops I thought worked very well together), the mushroom empanada (good but nothing special), and the beef with the chips (the beef was very tender but really just couldn't beat the tenderness of the short ribs), we had the baked goat cheese (which usually i love but i must admit tapas barcelona and even twist has a better baked goat cheese, i think the tomato sauce here was just so-so).
