Art Institute of Chicago////I need to return.   I know this.  Hopefully sooner rather than later.  I need time to absorb things---and a free Saturday is not the day for contemplation.  I'm not going to criticize the crowds---more people seeing art the better.  I was there for the same reason.  I hope I'm not the only one looking forward to many returns.  (Maybe Groupon will offer another membership deal or perhaps I should suck it up and buy one myself.)
