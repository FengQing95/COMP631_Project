Little Goat Diner////Ordered chicken tenders with a side of corn and chicken quesadillas. DELICIOUS. The best was the buttered corn with cilantro in my opinion, I couldn't get over how good it was. Chicken tenders were deep fried to perfection and came out warm and crisp. Quesadillas looked bomb but I did not try them.
