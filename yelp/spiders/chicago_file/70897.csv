Little Goat Diner////The food is generally fine but not great... It's middle of the road. The Tonkatsu is huge but did not blow us away. Their version of a BLT (with avocado) in fact had almost no avocado but the bacon was good and it's also large. For some odd reason the soak the bread with oil or butter or something that adds nothing but grease and mess. The burgers are average, fries are pretty good.
