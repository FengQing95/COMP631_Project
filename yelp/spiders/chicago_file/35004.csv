Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I love steakhouses more than any other type of restaurant. I have been to most of the steakhouses in Chicago and this is my absolute favorite. It's very intimate and dark but great for a romantic dinner. You really can't go wrong with the food but I do suggest a steak over anything else. If you like ice cream the sundae sampler they have is so fun and good to end the night.
