Smoque BBQ////The place is obviously a quick-serve restaurant.  Very casual as you can see by the styrofome containers and plastic ramekins.  You order at the counter and hope that there's a seat available for the 'host' to direct you to.  They'll call your number in a few minutes for you to go up an retrieve your food on a cafeteria tray.
