The Purple Pig////The food was absolutely divine. I ordered the roasted salmon with fingerling potatoes with piquillo pepper pur√©e. We also had the whipped chickpeas which were divine and far better than any hummus I've ever had. The focaccia was also fabulous. I can't recommend this place enough. Great ambiance and friendly staff.
