Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Was in town for the Chicago Marathon and of course, had to do all of the touristy things. Wanted a Chicago deep dish as part of my pre-race training. Spent many weeks reading all of the reviews of Lou's, Giordano's , Pequod's, etc. Also talked to many Chicagoans who all weighed in on their favorites. Took a shot a Lou's and wasn't Â disappointed to say the least. We arrived on a Thursday night at the N. Wells location and put our name on the list. We were told it would take about an hour or so until we were seated. We were told that we could pre-order our pizza selections while we were waiting (which we did). About an hour later we were seated upstairs. It was close to 9pm, and Lou's was still packed. Service was attentive and we quickly had our drinks; followed soon thereafter by our pizzas. The pizzas were soo good! Many previous reviewers have talked about the butter crust on the pies- and they weren't wrong! Loved our experience at Lou's and will be my go-to pizza next time I'm in Chicago.
