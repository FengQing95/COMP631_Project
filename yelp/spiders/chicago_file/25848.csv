Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First off, the butter crust is absolutely delicious. Probably my favorite deep dish crust I've ever had, and I was pretty in love with Patxi's (in California) version. This version is sweet and flaky, almost like half crust and half pastry. Unfortunately though, like pastry, it got a bit soggy. I thought it was the moisture from the tomatoes, but from reading others' similar reviews it sounds like the mozzarella is so moist that it bleeds into the crust and doesn't keep it crispy. I didn't mind it terribly, though; it was still delicious.
