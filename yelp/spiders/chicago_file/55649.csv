Smoque BBQ////So again I give this place 4stars based on the brisket. It's worth a drive on a good day for the brisket. Probably get it to go. One thing I forgot to mention is the way they have the tables arranged.  Imagine 10, tables for two all lined up in a row right next to each other looking like a huge picknic table.  Ummmm NO! I don't need strangers super close to me smacking their lips, splashing bbq sauce, listening to my conversation, elbowing me, and with the line down the block on a busy night I know it can get crazy and rude in there.  I'll go for the brisket, take it to go and eat on the hood of my car next time.
