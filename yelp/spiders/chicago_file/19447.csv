Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Whereas with Lou Malnati's, despite it's big footprint in the city, it still feels much more like a local's place and less like a tourist trap.  My buddy Andrew and I had a 9-inch, which is perfect for two, and while waiting for the pizza (remember that deep dish is going to take 30 minutes minimum) we had cheddar cubes, which are a huge improvement over mozzarella sticks.  It's not like mozzarella sticks aren't great, or aren't what you are supposed to order in an Italian place, but in a nod to nearby Wisconsin, the cheddar cubes really won the appetizer contest for me :-)
