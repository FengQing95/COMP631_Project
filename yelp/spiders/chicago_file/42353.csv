Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here with a large group recently, which I believe is the best way to experience the restaurant due to the tapas style. We were able to sample a large amount of the menu and overall were very impressed. I wouldn't say I was wowed by anything, hence the 4 stars, but would definitely return. Some of the memorable dishes included the pan seared scallops, grilled squid, and the beef tenderloin. We also ordered the seafood paella, which I thought was delicious, but it was my first time eating paella so I have no basis for comparison. The portion size on the paella was also very generous so if you're planning on ordering this I'd go with a few less tapas dishes. One other let down was the jamon iberico, which again I have no basis for comparison, but considering the legendary status of this holy grail of the pork family I was expecting something much more flavorful. I guess this means I will have to plan a trip to Spain to conduct a proper comparison.
