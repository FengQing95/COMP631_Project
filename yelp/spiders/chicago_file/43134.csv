Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Last time I went, I went with my boyfriend for Valentine's Day.  We went on the Friday before V-Day, it was crowded, but I had a reservation and was seated quickly.  The waiter was nice and let us have plenty of time to decide, since my boyfriend had never been here before.  We started with the artisan cheeses and the baked goat cheese.  The artisan cheeses were good, but probably not something I would order again considering all the other wonderful things on the menu.  The goat cheese is absolutely DIVINE.  One of the best things I think I've ever had- creamy goat cheese surrounded in a red tomato sauce.  I was skeptical about this at first, but I'm so glad I got it.
