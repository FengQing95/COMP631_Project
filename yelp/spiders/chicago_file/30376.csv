Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////One mission this trip --- some deep dish on a super cold day before flying home.  Debated a personal or small classic --- sausage, melty cheese and the butter crust.  Lauren S., my very efficient and just attentive enough server explained the options, and i settled for the small. I skipped lunch after all for this.  She said it would be 40 minutes, but it was out in 30... they neatly serve up the first slice and off you go.  As advertised and expected --- nice thick, almost chunky tomato sauce, plenty of cheese and generous sausage.  They really promote ordering it "your way" which is a nice touch --- less sausage, more cheese, etc.
