Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First of all, a one and a half hour wait?  I know, I know, Saturday night, but it was nearly nine pm when we got there, and they were still packed to the gills, which brings me to my second issue...They were packed to the gills with dressed up Lincoln Parkers.  Is it really necessary to wear four inch heels and white halter dresses?  This is a chain, after all.  Am I really so far out of the "scene" here in Jefferson Park that I don't think I should have to dress up for a casual dinner, and I don't think that hundreds of people go out to eat at 9:00 pm?  Or is this some weird anomaly to the pretentious Lincoln Park crowd?
