Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Whenever I have some one in from out of town that wants a steak, this is where I take them. They have everything you would expect from a typical upscale Chicago steak house, but with so much more style and panache. They prove that you don't have to be a 60 year old white dude to enjoy a steak.
