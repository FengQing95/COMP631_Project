Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went on a date here with my boyfriend a little while ago and had my first tapas restaurant! Great atmosphere, seemed like everyone else there were also on dates. It's the date spot! I love places that give you fresh bread and olive oil and this place had the bestest olive oil I've ever had. I ended up calling a few days later just to ask what kind they use, but didn't have much luck finding it in stores. Haven't been back since, but def want to!
