Smoque BBQ////I placed an order for catering (pick-up).  I had called a few days before to see how much advance notice they needed to accommodate my order for pick-up on a Saturday afternoon.  No problem, they said.  Call the day ahead - whenever.  So easy.  I ordered several pounds of the various types of delicious meats as well as a few pans of their sides.  When I got there the place was a zoo. So many people waiting to order, sit, eat.  My pan of mac n' cheese had been forgotten and the nice manager (?) asked if I wanted to wait or to get a credit. I said I'd wait the 15-20 minutes or so.  When the order was ready, he gave me a gift certificate for my (minor) inconvenience. Yay!  More delish BBQ for my belly! Thanks Smoque!
