Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place embodies Chicago deep-dish. It's a delicious place to eat for locals and tourists alike. I recommend "The Lous" and add sausage in deep dish. It has an atmosphere that is better for kids and more spacious than most places in Chicago just factor in the wait time if you're worried about your kids getting cranky. If that's the case though you can call ahead and tell them your order and they'll start cooking your pizza before you're seated so that it will come out to quicker.
