Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here for my birthday this year per a friend's recommendation and couldn't have been happier.  First of all, the service was phenomenal.  Not only was our particular server fantastic, attentive, and funny, but the multiple bus people that were around made sure that our waters were never empty and that we always had enough plates for the next dish.  The food was RIDICULOUS!  It was so good.  We all had more than our fair share of tapas and the five of us split a small portion of seafood paella.  We had coffee and desert (I recommend that butterscotch shot of pure seduction they offer.  We had one and immediately ordered two more.  Next time I'll get a few to go) and waddled out of there.
