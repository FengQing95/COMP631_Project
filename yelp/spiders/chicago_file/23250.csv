Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have never been to the restaurant but I attend an event which orders Lou Malnati's every week.  Now, I have had a couple decades of pizza, more than enough to last a lifetime, and I am Never happy to see pizza served at an event even if it is free. However, I was introduced to The "Lou" which is a vegetarian deep dish pizza, and I am sold.  I am not even a vegetarian and I actual Look Forward to having a slice every week, even after many many weeks I have not grown tired of it.  The "Lou" has converted me back into being a pizza eater after many years of being a pizza avoider.  What more can I say.
