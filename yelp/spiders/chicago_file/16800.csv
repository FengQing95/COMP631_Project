Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Heard about this place from numerous people. First we tried the rose(?) beer. Tasted great especially in the hot HUMID weather. We ordered the Lou's special and a Lou's salad, which was highly recommended by our waiter. I like salads but this is the BEST salad I ever tasted! Yummy! Must try! Also the pizza was soooo good. Loved the buttery crust. I would have married this meal, I loved it so much, had I not scarfed it down so quickly. Never stood a chance.
