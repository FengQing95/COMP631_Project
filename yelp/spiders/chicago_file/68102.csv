Little Goat Diner////I guess I had high expectations going in, but I have to say my experience at lunch today left me a little disappointed.  The atmosphere was great, but we ended up squished between two sets of couples at a communal table.  I am new to the city, so I figured I would just go with the flow.  We ended up chatting with two other ladies, so I guess it worked out.  I only mention it because not every conversation is meant to be shared.  If you need some privacy, you may want to request a booth when you walk in.
