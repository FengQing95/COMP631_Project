Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had the bacon wrapped dates, which are a must-have. Frankly, I could have told the kitchen to just keep 'em coming they were so good. We also ordered the seared cana de cabra -- this is like a seared goat cheese with caramelized onions and honey. It's the perfect balance of salty and sweet.
