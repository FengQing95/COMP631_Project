Little Goat Diner////After about 30 minutes of waiting for our food, I started to get just a little annoyed. Like where is our food? You have like easily 15 cooks back there.. what's wrong with this operation that you can't make a pork belly benedict and corned beef hash in a reasonable amount of time? Â Doesn't the words quick service align with what a diner is supposed to be?
