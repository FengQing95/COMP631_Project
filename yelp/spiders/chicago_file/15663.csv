Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Two words sum up why I love Lou Malnati's pizza - butter crust.  That butter crust is fantastic.  Crunchy, rich in flavor.  So good.  Their Minestrone soup is OK and the salads are pretty good for a pizzeria.  I can't speak to the other dining options (sandwiches and pasta, etc.) but the pizza is good.  I like both the thin crust and the deep dish.
