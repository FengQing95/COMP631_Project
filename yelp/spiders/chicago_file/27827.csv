Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Of course we had to try some famous deep dish pizza while in Chicago! There were so many places to choose from through my Yelp searches, but we settled on Lou's. I'm glad we chose to go on a Monday afternoon as we had walked by a couple night's before on a Saturday evening and the place had a line out the door. There was no wait at 12pm so I think we got lucky! The menu is pretty simple and we wanted to try the authentic thing so we ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic and added pepperoni. Our server let us know that it would take 40-45 minutes so we ordered a spinach salad and mozzarella sticks to start. The marinara sauce that came with the mozzarella sticks was so fresh and garlicky! Salad was also good with pears, goat cheese and a balsamic vinaigrette. When the pizza arrived, we were so excited...let me tell you, it is filling! We ordered the small which is 2 slices per person and I was stuffed after the first pieces. I think their buttercrust is super heavy. The flavors were good, but it wasn't the most amazing food I've ever had. I think it needed just a bit more pizazz. The service was great and the food was pretty good but I think I'll probably try a different place next time!
