Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For some reason people have had a hard time believing that I came to Chicago for pizza. What's even less reasonable is the fact that I believe it was worth the 2 hour plane ride from New York. This pizza was unlike the traditional New York pizza I'm used to. The biggest contrast is obviously the thickness of the pie, but what else is interesting is that it is constructed with the cheese on the bottom and the sauce is on top. The sauce was absolutely packed with flavor and chunks of tomato offering the bite needed to compete with the various textures present. The crust was buttery, flakey and delicious. What was truly impressive however, was how it remained crispy under the substantial weight of pizza filling. For me the real seller was the significant presence of mozzarella cheese oozing out of every bite. Finally, there was a pleasant surprise, a layer of sausage underneath the sauce. I didn't even realize what was happening until the second bite. All in all I must tip my hat to this mid west treasure. Mr. Lou Malnatti, wherever you are, you have earned my respect and admiration, thank you sir!
