Little Goat Diner////It's been a long time coming for this review. I'm glad to say, that time has come. Little Goat is NOTHING like I expected. In my mind, little goat was a diner, purposely decorated to look dingy like an old time diner. If I had walked into a place like this, I wouldn't have been disappointed. However, I didn't, and I definitely wasn't disappointed with what I saw.
