Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We always participate in their 'sharing is caring' BYOB where they do not charge a corkage fee if you agree to share a pour with someone in the restaurant.  We love doing this and have met some nice wine fans doing it!  Plus this last time we were the recipients of a glass from another table, so a fun bonus to our meal!
