Little Goat Diner////If you miss the little goat you're wrong. The best French toast I've ever had, with a very much needed spin on chicken and waffles. The Mimosa's were spectacular and the wait staff oh so pleasant. Whether you're in town for a day, or been here you're whole life, you're missing out if you haven't been.
