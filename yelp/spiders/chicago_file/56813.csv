Smoque BBQ////Had my first Smoque experience recently and it will not be my last.  I enjoyed some of the best brisket with a nice flavorful barbecue sauce.  You have to be careful ordering a sandwich because soggy bun is the worst.  Smoque preparded the brisket sandwich perfectly, the bun was great and the sides delicious.
