Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////How is this place so popular? Yes, the pizza is ok (my opinion is there's much, much better out there.) But the service is inexcusable. Sat at the bar one night. Waited over an hour for my tiny personal pizza. Did the bartender check in once during that entire wait time? Nope. This place feels like an overhyped tourist trap that doesn't value its patrons. Skip it!
