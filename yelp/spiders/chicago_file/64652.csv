Smoque BBQ////Carlos met us as we entered (2) and handed a menu and explained how to order.  Made some friendly conversation and made us feel welcome.  The mouth watering smells of the place told us why they named it Smoque, the flavors just hit you.  I got the brisket with bread and fries and slaw, the fries were the best hot, crisp and fresh.  The slaw was flavored with a type of vinegar with just the right tartness.
