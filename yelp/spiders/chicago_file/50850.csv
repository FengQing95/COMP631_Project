Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My friends and I all stuck to the seafood options. I got the chicken moorish dish and the grilled squid! Both were so so delicious. The squid came in a simple olive oil sauce that was slightly heavy but great nonetheless. The chicken dish had golden raisins, pinenuts and cauliflower- perfect! The desserts were all small but my friends loved them and the atmosphere was gorgeous. Huge restaurant. Can't wait to go back sometime soon but making reservations at least 2 weeks in advance would be recommended.
