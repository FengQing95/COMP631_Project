Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Interesting french toast flavors, great atmosphere and close to the bean so would be a great stop for tourists.  We went on a friday around noon and had only a half hour wait, which is amazing considering usual brunch waits.  Very casual and nice place to take friends!
