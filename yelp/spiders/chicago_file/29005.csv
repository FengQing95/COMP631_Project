Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Its was long line to get a table. When I got there it was 1 hour waiting. Best way you get a table with less time is call ahead. This way you know how much time you have to wait and shorten the waiting time. Once you leave your phone number, they will text you once table is ready.. Â you may not happy with waiting time BUT once you get a table, you need to get ready for good food... Lagunitas A Little Sumpins' Sumpins' local beer was fruity and good. Malnati salad was really good.
