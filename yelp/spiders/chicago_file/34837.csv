Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The service was solid. Nothing extraordinary, but definitely still made for a nice evening. I have several sets of friends coming into town in the next month and I've told each of them to try scoring reservations here because it's just too good! And honestly, the prices are a huge plus for me. In my opinion, for the quality and portion of the food, it's worth every penny -- and I don't say that very often.
