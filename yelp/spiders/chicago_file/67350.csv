Little Goat Diner////A bit disappointing. Not good enough for that girl & her goat. Convoluted odd menu. Nothing bad but rather ordinary. Will go again to try brunch items, but frankly the wait , the valet, just did nt make this food worth it. Fried pickles & onion rings were pretty bad. All tempura batter. No pickle no onion & unappetizing looking. Server Melissa efficient & very very nice. I think they need to think through this menu. Los drowned ok, same for fish tostadas , tater tot mash broccoli cheese puff. Again Melissa helped make my b day lunch very nice! Â Also when waiting an hour & ppl walking in that you hav nt seen being seated before you, would be nice to have hostess/mgr "touch base, keep you posted" about your wait status. We were only ones waiting so they had time to make eye contact , day something. Needs improvement in customer service there !
