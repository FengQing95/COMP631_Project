Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is definitely my go to when there is a special occasion or I have guests visiting Chicago. They menu is vast and there are options for all sorts of dietary restrictions and preferences. I don't think I've had anything that I can say I've disliked. My biggest recommendation is to make a reservation, especially Thursday-Saturday! If you're planning on just walking in, be prepared for a significant wait and a packed bar area of people doing the exact same thing. However, that tells you that the food, drink and atmosphere are worth the wait.
