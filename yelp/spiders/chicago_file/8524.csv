Art Institute of Chicago////Some of it is instantly recognizable: Wood's "American Gothic," Seurat's "Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte," van Gogh's "The Bedroom," Picasso's "The Guitar Player," etc.  It's wonderful to see those things up close.  But it's even more wonderful to discover works of art you've never seen before, and believe me, the Art Institute has loads of stuff you've never seen.  I've been countless times, and I'm still not sure I've seen everything.
