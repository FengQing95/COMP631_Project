Little Goat Diner////The wait. Depends when you come. A lot of the time, you can walk in without reservations and be seated within 5-15 minutes. If you come during a busier time, the max time you'll have to wait is 15-30 minutes, 45 minutes if it's groooosssly busy, like Saturday night 7 PM or something haha.
