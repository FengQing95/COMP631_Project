Little Goat Diner////Visiting the Little Goat was a planned event that our group had been salivating over for weeks. We made sure to get there early on Sunday morning (we were bringing a baby and didn't want to subject the rest of the crowd to her screaming if we had to wait). We walked in around 9:15am and were seated right away in the communal-ish section of the restaurant. We had plenty of room and to our delight this place was family-friendly, comfortable and DEELISSSSSSHHHH!
