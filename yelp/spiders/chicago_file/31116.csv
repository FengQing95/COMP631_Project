Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I took my buddy from San Jose to experience Lou Malnati's and Chicago style deep dish pizza for the very first time; he had very high expectations as he saw Chicago as the foodie capital of the US. We made the mistake of attempting to drop in on a Saturday afternoon (4th of July weekend nonetheless) and was greeted with a swarm of tourists waiting at the front. The hostess quickly entered our names into the queque and the system texted when our table was ready. She also advised that we preorder our pizza ahead of time, so it would be prepared by the time we were seated (I think this was pure genius! :)).
