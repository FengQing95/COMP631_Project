Smoque BBQ////Just going to be blunt. Reviews looked amazing. It has 4.5 stars. It smells good. However everything is absolutely horrendous taste wise. We just spent 90 dollars for NYE Ribs and my god not only were they dry to the bone, they were also tough. Im not saying i NEED my ribs to fall off the bone however I shouldnt have to fight to chew through it. Coleslaw was mushy. Beans were gag inducing. Absolutely a joke. All in all I will never spend another cent here. I advise you to do the same.
