Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Great large breakfast. Lots of gluten free choices.  All pancake choices can be ordered GF.  Had the skillet with hash browns, cheese, bacon, topped with eggs. Even the coffee was good.stronger than typical breakfast fare.  Super busy even on a weekday.  Great location at edge of Millennium Park.
