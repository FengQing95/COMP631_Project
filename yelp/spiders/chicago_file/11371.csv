Art Institute of Chicago////Absolutely stunned by the Art Institute of Chicago. There was so much to see and we spent several hours taking it all in. They had art of all forms from paintings and drawings, to mixed media, furniture, sculptures, installations, glass, and photography. They had modern art, contemporary art, Asian art, Islamic art, Impressionist art, American art and more. We were lucky to be visiting when they had a  Rembrandt exhibit, and saw many other famous pieces by Monet, O'Keefe, Van Gogh, Picasso, Degas, Dali, Wood, and Gauguin to name a few as well. (I purposely didn't post any of their art on Yelp as I believe in honoring the artists/museum and encourage you to go check it out for yourself, but I did post the placards with the name and artist of several pieces to give you a taste of what you might see!)  It was really easy to get lost in the exhibits, so I highly recommend taking a guide and a pencil so you can check off the exhibits as you see them to be sure you don't miss any. I would also recommend purchasing your tickets online, not bringing anything unnecessary, and reading the rules of the museum online as you don't have to wait in line to check large bags, coats, or other belongings that are not allowed inside.
