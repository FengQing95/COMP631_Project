Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////One of the better deep dish pizzas in Chicago. However, we got quite a few toppings on our pizza (the veggie classic pizza) and then added sausage, and it made the whole pizza kind of soft and soggy. I was a little disappointed. I would highly suggest limiting to one or 2 toppings at most.
