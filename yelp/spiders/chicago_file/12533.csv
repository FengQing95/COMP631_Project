Art Institute of Chicago////Anyway, any self-respecting Chicagoan would be remiss to not visit AIC at least once.  There's a lot to see and enjoy here.  The current premier exhibit is the Obama Portraits.  I liked and admired 'em both, but still thought this particular exhibit was overhyped for the content.  On a relatively quiet Monday visit, I still had a 45 minute wait with their QR scan e-queue, but it was no biggie as I could peruse plenty of other artwork while awaiting a text notification.
