Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It was extremely romantic in there with the low light and candles on each tables and even on some presented dishes. This felt like a what I envisioned a new-aged Chicago style steakhouse. The perfect place for an anniversary dinner. Thanks you guys for a wonderful experience. We have told everyone we know about Bavette's!
