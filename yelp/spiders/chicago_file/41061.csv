Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had the bacon wrapped dates, fried green tomatoes, baked goat cheese, the seafood paella, spicy potatoes, and of course plenty more. Everything was so good, came out promptly and hot (a big thing of mine) and our server was very attentive and friendly, yet not overly so. We did have a reservation but apparently on weekends this place gets really crowded so we did have to wait maybe 5-10 minutes for our table. Since then though we have never had to wait for a table and always had great service!
