Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've only eaten a tapas meal here once and it was okay. I was really grossed out by their cheese plate though. It tasted way too much like how the farm animal exhibit at the zoo smells. Never again will I order the cheese plate here- trust me, it's questionable. Everything else was delicious though I could do with the prices being a little lower.
