Smoque BBQ////The staff at Smoque was great. They have a team of hosts/runners/waiters that get you a table, bring you your food and clear trays away. They were all friendly and helpful. You pay at the counter then take your seat, but make sure to throw a few bucks in the tip jar for the team -- they earn it.
