Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our fantastic experience started with the first phone call.  I was making a reservation for my husband and I to celebrate our 4th wedding anniversary.  The hostess mentioned that they had reservation in the parlor (downstairs) or upstairs.  Having never been there, I asked if she could give me some information on the ambiance of the two areas.  She was more than happy to provide some description to me, so I could make a decision.
