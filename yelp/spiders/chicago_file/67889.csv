Little Goat Diner////I'll be honest. I didn't know what brandade was before I had this dish (and I still don't think I know...). I think I even pronounced it wrong when I ordered. But instead of making fun of my uncivilized tongue, my waiter reassured my choice with a "that's my favorite dish!" I must say, he has impeccable taste as well.
