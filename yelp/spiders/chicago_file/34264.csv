Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I really enjoyed the ambience. Great lighting.  Good cocktails.  I had a cheap attack and did not order a steak or a lot of food but I did have a really good fancy version of an Italian beef sandwich which is the only kind I will eat.   My cousin ordered the chicken and it was very good as well.   We ordered a few more things but it was so long ago that I can't remember what they were but I do remember liking everything and vowing to go back.  I also continue to include this place on my list of recommendations.
