Little Goat Diner////Okay, if you're on a diet, this is not the place for you.  Little goat is a place to splurge!  Everything is so rich and tasty w/ a lot of flavor.  Our table tried the fried pickles and onion rings and the crisp shrimp cocktail.  The fried pickles and onion rings were average (Lilly Q's has the best fried pickles).  The shrimp cocktail was fried to perfection and I would definitely try it again.  I had the BLT with Avocado and it lived up to expectations.  However, I'm glad I didn't have a cholesterol check the next day.  Wow...  did it have a lot of EVOO in the bread (tasty as ever, but maybe a little too much).  My significant other had the Los Drowned and said it was TASTY and would order it again.  For desert we tried the smoked pork and toffee crunch shake.  Let me start off by saying the shake had an interesting flavor.  At first I didn't like it, but, of course, I went back for more.  Once all the flavors married together, I couldn't stop eating it.  We ended up on their rooftop and were pleasantly surprised.   Little Goat is definitely worth a try.
