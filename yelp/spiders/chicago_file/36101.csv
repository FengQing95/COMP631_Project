Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////There's nothing I would change about this charming spot! From atmosphere to music, to the delicious drinks - you'll love the experience. I had the salmon tartar and just about died; it was so good! I then enjoyed the best homemade meatball I've ever had! It came with their house made fettuccine and tasty sauce. My server/bartender, Jay overheard I was moving, and even brought out a sparkling scoop of vanilla ice-cream and hot fudge to celebrate. AWESOME service!
