Art Institute of Chicago////I easily spent 4+ hours here and didn't see everything, so give yourself some time to wander the maze like exhibits.  It's a little confusing the first time through as you can only access some parts of the museum through certain buildings/floors, so I'd suggest figuring out what you want to see and map it out so you don't double or triple back on your paths to get where you want to go.  (I got pretty tired of seeing the Indian art exhibit after I went through it for the fourth time!)
