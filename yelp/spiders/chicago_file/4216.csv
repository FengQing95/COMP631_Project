The Purple Pig////This place brought me to some culinary peaks and some flops. Expect to be seated elbow to elbow with your neighbours because the restaurant is laid out to optimize for maximum seating. The asparagus risotto and the octopus were so good I could weep, but the foie gras was a bit of disappointment.
