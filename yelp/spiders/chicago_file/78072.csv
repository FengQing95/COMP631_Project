Little Goat Diner////The food is disgusting. There are no healthy options on the menu. The unhealthy options are made even more unhealthy. The nachos were extremely greasy and oily and absolutely covered with cheese and grease. The burgers were horrible. So salty, dry, and had a thick bitter crust like the grill has never been cleaned. And it's expensive. I have no clue how there are good reviews and people inside - the food is really really bad.
