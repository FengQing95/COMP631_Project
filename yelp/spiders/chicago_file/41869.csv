Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Truly, truly the best place I've eaten in my year in Chicago. It's a bit hard to get in, and I had a pretty long wait WITH reservations one of two times that I went, but I can understand why. Great atmosphere, amazing food and drinks - get the bacon wrapped dates and sangria! The only thing I didn't enjoy was the lamb with mint but that was my own fault for ordering mint meat...
