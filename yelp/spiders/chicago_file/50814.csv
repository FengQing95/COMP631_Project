Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love love love this place!  Reminds me of being in Barcelona and sampling all kinds of tapas. Have not tried the paella yet but it looks good. I've over enjoyed the Sangria a few time and would return just for that. Favorites include the chicken, octopus, bacon wrapped dates, calamari and garlic shrimp!  It's easy to over order and over eat here!  Loud and lively
