Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I loved the "reveal".  You enter under the stone arch and find yourself in a small, dark lobby where you are greeted by the hostess.  With a slight turn, you pull open the door and find yourself in . . . . .wait for it . . . . .a stunning room, dark and intimate with the bar at the back and crystal chandeliers twinkling above.
