Smoque BBQ////Let's start with the meats. I had the Rib Combo (both Baby Back and St. Louis). They were cooked to perfection. As a BBQ Judge I have become very spoiled with perfect ribs, and these are perfect ribs. The meat comes cleanly off the bone where you bite, but it does not "fall off the bone" when you take a bite. The bone dries immediately. That's a perfectly cooked rib. As for flavor, it was fabulous. I asked for the sauce on the side so that I could taste the meat, and it was heavenly. I added some sauce and it just made me happy. Both the Baby Back and the St. Louis ribs are awesome. My wife had the sliced Brisket. It, too was awesome. Just a little on the dry side, but nothing to complain about. She, too, had the sauce on the side, and if they would have put the sauce on the meat, it would have been perfect.
