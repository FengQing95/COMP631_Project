Art Institute of Chicago////Classics, modern stuff, they have it all.  Um, almost all.  When we visited, we specifically wanted to see Hopper's "Nighthawks," the classic piece of the diner at night with the lonely customers along the counter.  You know the one.  Good try on our part.  In place of the painting was a tiny little notecard indicating that the piece was "on loan" to some thieving museum in D.C.  Nice.  I took a photo of the notecard so that I could be pi*sed off again later.
