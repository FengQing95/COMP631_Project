Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The food was great and they were large portions. I had the eggs Benedict with chorizo and it was good. My only warning here is I grew up eating authentic Portuguese chorizo and this did not taste anything like it. Not sure if there are other types but that's what I went in expecting. It had more of a beefy taste. My fianc√© got the skillet and he really enjoyed it as well but couldn't finish it. The portions are really that big. We waited well over an hour, which should be expected on a Friday morning when there is a festival happening in Chicago. My only issue here is the system the restaurant uses. They text you when they are 'ready' to seat you but then you end up waiting in another line for about 10-15 mins until your table is actually ready. Overall good experience. Wait staff was efficient and friendly. The noise level wasn't bad. We were really close to two other tables but this is a breakfast place not a date night spot!
