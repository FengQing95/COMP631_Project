Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came here with my wife last night. Our server/waitress Â Amy was awesome. The food could be absolutely horrible and the type of service they give would make up for it. Im glad to say that the food/drinks lived up to the hype. They took care of us and made the night perfect for us. I will definitely be coming here again. My suggestion is to put in a reservation for an early dinner. We got there at 5 per our reservation, and were the first ones in. No later than 15 min went by before most of the tables were packed. This is now in my top three favorite restaurants in Chicago.
