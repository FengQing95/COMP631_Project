Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I enjoyed the passion fruit sangria that we had. The chorizo wrapped dates were delicious. Definitely had luck with their special which was a ribeye. The meat was tender and juicy. The empanada was just okay, but it was flaky which I liked the beef was a little bland. I do like the tapas options overall and it allows you to try different things.
