Little Goat Diner////How's the food? This may be Little Goat, but it's certainly big on taste! I had the kimchee, bacon and egg "pancake", inspired by Thai street food (and other similar Asian concepts). It was definitely a tasty combination of flavors and textures, given the bacon and the bean sprouts that were used. Â It comes with a little portion of sauce that you can use to add some additional flavor to your preference.
