The Purple Pig////My hubby and I went for lunch. It was perfect. We ordered a bit too much, but it was all good, so we over ate! the raw corn salad was crunchy and refreshing. We also had the feta spread. The flavors were strong and good. We also split a panini and the roast pork shoulder. The panini was superb. The pork shoulder was very good... but the least fav of what we ordered. Service was efficient. We ate outside under the shade of their purple umbrellas. It was a wonderful relaxing way to take a break from the bustle downtown.
