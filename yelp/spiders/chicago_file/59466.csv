Smoque BBQ////I had been meaning to try Smoque but was terrified of the long lines that I heard about. If there's one thing that I don't like, it's waiting for food when I'm hungry. I get grouchy, I get mean, I get-well, we just don't need to see me when I'm too hungry. So once upon a saturday, me and the bf woke up early to go and get BBQ. We got there around 11:45; no wait in line at all for us! I was excited! But I didn't know what to get. And there wasn't a combo platter, OH NOES. I wanted to try everything.
