Little Goat Diner////I love the Little Goat! The bakery side has cozy seating. They have the best biscuits and cortado in the city--almond milk--yes! Breakfast Tasty Thing is my favorite way to have eggs. Also: Peter and Ryan are two of the most professional and friendly bartenders you will meet in this city. No matter how busy, they are always attentive and aware of what your next request may be. Highly recommended.
