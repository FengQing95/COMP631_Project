Art Institute of Chicago////Collection:  The AIC is renowned for their collection of Impressionist works, which was the foundation of the museum's original collection.  They also have a large and important collection of Asian and Pre-Columbian art.  Their works on paper, including photography (hidden in the basement near the toilets), are also very impressive.  The photo department has a very extensive collection and their well-planned exhibits change frequently.
