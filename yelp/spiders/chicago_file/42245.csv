Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'll say this much, the food was great.  That, however, is where any love affair I might have had with Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba ends.  I loved the stuffed mushrooms, beef empanada, little steak dishes, and the sangria.  But the atmosphere was awful (unless you like loud crowded places - I don't).  It was so loud and crowded I felt rushed and couldn't relax.  I couldn't hear anybody at my table talking and I felt like I had to battle my way to the washroom.  This just isn't a place for me I guess.
