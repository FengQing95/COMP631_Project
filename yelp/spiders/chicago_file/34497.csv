Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I had the roast chicken with a side of elotes-style corn. Amazing. This is the way chicken is supposed to taste. Crispy, flavorful skin, juicy insides...perfection in poultry form is found here. Of course, our table imbibed in a bit of the boeuf as well. Cooked perfectly (as it should be, the boeuf is in the title), it was juicy and lovely. A safe bet as well. Other sides that wowed: the frites, the baked potato, and the roasted broccoli. Nothing that really blew my mind, but all very tasty. I was surprised at the portion sizes. We all had leftovers (and took them to go), which so rarely happens at nicer restaurants.
