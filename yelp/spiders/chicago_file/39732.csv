Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////First time I ordered the Lamb Chops. They were AMAZING. They were seasoned just right and cooked perfectly so they were easy to chew. I also got to try some of my friend's Filet Mignon, which is what I ended up ordering the second time. Their medium rare is actually medium rare! The food is absolutely worth the price!
