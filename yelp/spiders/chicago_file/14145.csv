Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I decided to ask another waitress since our waitress never came back to check on us after we got the wings. I was told they would check and be right back...no such thing almost 30min later again we were about to walk out I called the server to cancel our order and she actually argued with me about how it was not her fault I wasn't informed even pre-orders can take 2 hours, which is ridiculous, I guess this waitress has never heard of customer service or being part of a "team" there is not "it's not my job or my fault" when you work with a team of people, she didn't have to argue or point fingers on her own team for not doing their job... anyways I was truly just going to leave cash on the table to cover the drinks and wings then walk out as my kid was extremely hungry... magically Tina our waitress came up with our pizzas which by the way were terrible! sauce was bland, soggy and cold, could she just admit perhaps she forgot our order... honestly Pizza chain restaurants can make better tasting pizzas..so disappointed as everyone recommended this place, maybe I need to try a different location next time. 2.5 hours for awful customer service and pizza are not worth the wait...nor the $50+ bill for personal pizzas.
