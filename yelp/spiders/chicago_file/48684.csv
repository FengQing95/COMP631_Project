Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Amazing tapas, great ambiance, wonderful service. The salmon tapa is one of my favorite and comes with a guacamole on the side that is incredible! We also had the shrimp with garlic, the grilled octopus, and the Spanish egg and potato tortilla. 4-6 small plates is more than enough to share with 2 people.
