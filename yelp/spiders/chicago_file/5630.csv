The Purple Pig////Located on Michigan Ave, you'll probably have to take Uber/Lyft/taxi or public transportation. Interior is very cozy and modern. Waiter was knowledgeable and polite. I just walked in on a weekday afternoon so I can't speak to how busy this place can get but it's one of the most famous (tapas) restaurants in Chicago so I would look into reservations.
