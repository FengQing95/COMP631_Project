Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My go-to for deep dish because it's close to where I live and they do take-out.  I usually love love love sausage on my pizzas, but I actually think the Lou (veggie) pizza is my favorite here! The Classic is a close second but If i were to eat one pizza the rest of my life, it'd be the Lou.  I don't see a point in even trying to create your own pizza because both of their pre-selected options are delicious.
