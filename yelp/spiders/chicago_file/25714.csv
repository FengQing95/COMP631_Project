Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////About another 10 minutes passes, ironically while she was telling our group of another time at a restaurant they had messed up her order and the aftermath of that day. We then see the manager and our waiter approaching our table. The manager asks "did you eat the chicken wings?" We all knew where this was going and were SHOCKED. We even asked if he was joking. The manager let us know that the wings did in fact contain dairy, AFTER she had already eaten the wing.
