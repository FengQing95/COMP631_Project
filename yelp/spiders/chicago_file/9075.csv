Art Institute of Chicago////There's a reason the Art Institute of Chicago has remained the #1 attraction in Chicago: it is inspiring. Though not as large as some of the museums in Washington, DC or New York City, you could spend days in the Art Institute seeing everything. The special exhibit going on, "Magritte: The Mystery of the Ordinary, 1926-1938", was okay, not really my thing but still wonderful to see his paintings up close. The best part was that it was included in the general admission ticket price, unlike many other museums which make you pay extra on top of the general admission price. Obviously weekday mornings right when the museum opens are the least crowded, if you want want to see these masterpieces up close, one-on-one.
