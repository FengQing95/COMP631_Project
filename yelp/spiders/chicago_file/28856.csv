Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came for lunch during the week and were told it would be a 40 min. wait. They told us we could pre-order our pizza so that we wouldn't have to wait too much longer to eat once we were seated. That didn't seem to be the case. We waited just as long if not longer for our pizza. Not good when you're hungry! That was the only downfall. More importantly the pizza was amazing! We had the sausage & mushroom. It certainly did not disappoint! It was tasty and the small size shared btwn my husband and I was just right. Our server Lauren was very nice and even made some conversation with us. Place has a nice vibe too. I would recommend and return here again!
