Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Okay, this place isn't bad, at all. It's a great option for those who don't like *real* deep dish -- Lou Malnati's serves more of a pan crust style and the pizza is certainly lighter because of that. And it's super cheap. But it just doesn't compare to the wonderful deep dish this city has to offer. I'm underwhelmed!
