Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My other service issues -- they took away my husband's drink when he was still drinking it (and they aren't cheap cocktails!). Another is that they didn't even ask about coats so we had to go to the front and wait for them while the staff was huffy with us. My final qualm is that I had bites of steak cut and specifically said I wanted everything on my plate boxed. I opened it to eat it today and found none of my bites -- with the price of the steaks, those were like $5 bites each!!!
