Smoque BBQ////Think about what barbecue ribs are.  You take a rather low quality cut of meat, season the heck out of it, and cook it at low temperatures for long enough to make it edible.  It's real easy to get any of those steps wrong and have it turn out really poorly.  It's really very difficult to get right every single time.  Smoque absolutely nails this, and has come up with an extremely well balanced rub and sauce to go with it.  Mad props.
