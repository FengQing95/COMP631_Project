Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ended up coming here last minute with some great people. The six of us were coming from an event that had a lot of wine but very very very little finger food. All of us were starved so we ended up at Ba-Ba-Reeba. We ordered, seriously, like half the menu. Octopus, spicy potatoes, mixed plates... a ton of desserts... the spread was pretty good... I wouldn't call it the best tapas I've ever had (and oh do I love tapas) but the company and the surroundings def upped it :] And the sangria was pretty tasty - I love it when they leave in chunks of fruit, wish there was more tho - (I loved the white) Our waitress was super nice and we had a great time just chatting and dining the whole night. It's def a fun place to go to if you're into sharing small plates and trying a ton of different things!
