Little Goat Diner////First off we tried the tiramisu shake and the cookie shake. The cookie shake came with the hat of whip cream that you expect with a proper milkshake whereas the tiramisu shake came with a scoop of.. wait for it.. mascarpone chese mix stuff... that was topped with some toothsome chocolate cereal (most def made in house) that was TO DIE FOR. Great start. My friends tried the coffee with the goat milk... yea good coffee but goat vs cow milk in coffee doesnt really allow for our 'untrained' palates to taste the difference. For entree I ordered the Los Drowned, Little Goats version of a French Dip. DELISH. and ask for the hot sauces. Made in house and there was a habenero one that went oh so well with my sandwich... mmm. My DH ordered the Korean Pancake with pork Belly. He really enjoyed the cole slaw it came with but it wasnt my favorite, though a creative blend of flavors that I can respect. Also in our group was ordered the Kimchi Rueben, excellent, theloco moto Veggie burger, super hearty for a veggie patty, and the goat almighty, a wowza impressive monster that tasted like a heart attack. But an enjoyable one nonetheless. Needless to say, we were all very satisfied with our meals and if we can avoid the weekend wait, we will be back!
