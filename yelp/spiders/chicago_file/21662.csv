Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Although this place has really great reviews I have to say, I think it's mediocre. And it's not just because I'm from New York and love NY style pizza. I tried Gino's deep dish and thought it was a lot more impressive. This pizza was not bad but it didn't blow me away either- I probably wouldn't return given the many options of pizza in the area.
