Little Goat Diner////Party of 4 on a Saturday for lunch was about a 20 minute wait. Awesome place. Everything we ordered was fabulous. At our table we had a party melt, a tofu burger, the fat club, and the fish tostadas. We so order two servings of smoke fries. The star of the meal was the fish tostadas - absolutely perfect! Â One order of fries would've been enough for the whole table.
