Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Every menu item is some of the best I've ever tasted in that category, and the prices are very reasonable for the quality and ambiance. The bone if filet is an absolute triumph. They even have a great bar with remarkable wine and whiskey selections. Although it claims to be French in its style, it's really an unpretentious American steakhouse :)
