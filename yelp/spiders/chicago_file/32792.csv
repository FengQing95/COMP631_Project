Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went here for Valentine's Day. What a great experience! The interior is not visible from the street, and a classy, relaxed vibe inside. Lots of wood, great music (recorded off vinyl - for a retro feel), the acoustics are great. Place is lively but not over the top. We were seated quickly, ordered drinks and oysters. Two different kinds of delicious oysters and homemade sourdough bread - yum! My steak was perfect - just exactly medium rare. My husband got the pork chop, and it was melt in your mouth. Butternut squash was a well-prepared, a great side. We had a late reservation (10:15) or we would have ordered dessert. Next time for sure! Can't wait.
