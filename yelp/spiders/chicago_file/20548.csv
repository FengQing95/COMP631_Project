Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Love the crust of the deep dish Pizza here, crispy and not oily. Cheese and tomato were also very tasty. On the down side, 1h wait for a table at 8:30pm, 30+min wait for pre-ordered pizza and the starter we ordered while waiting for pizza came like 30s before the pizza itself.
