Smoque BBQ////Lots of sides to choose from but I went with the mac & cheese and the fries. The mac & cheese was decadent, with just the right amount of cheese flavor.  The small portion left me wanting more, and I later saw other customers choose mac & cheese for both of their sides to make up for it (what a great idea!).  The fries were served hot and fresh in a small brown paper bag and were plenty to share with a friend.  Portion-wise, the fries were the better deal.
