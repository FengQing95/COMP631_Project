Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We were seated in the larger backroom, which comfortably fit about 28 people, including the two staff members. My sister picked the middle package (paella, salmon and bread, bacon wrapped dates, eggs benedict, french toast) and it was ALL delicious. The guests (and myself!) could not stop raving about how good it was, and the service was phenomenal. We did a drink package for two hours, and the servers were very prompt with filling the drinks that no one even noticed when the bar service ended.
