Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////this is as good as it gets when it comes to deep dish... and for all the east coasters saying that we shouldn't even call this pizza... GET OVER YOUR EAST COAST THINKING! chicago style and NY style are completely different beasts... they are however both PIZZAS!! just like how mercedes and bmw are completely different... but both are CARS! (ok... that's not the greatest analogy but i don't care)
