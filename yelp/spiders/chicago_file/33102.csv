Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is a brilliant best-of. It takes all the greatest hits (the Au Cheval cheeseburger, the Gilt house made pastas, the notorious bread, the pork fat fries) and then adds a steak section. The staff here is a bunch of fucking rock stars, who I am so happy put up with us and even seem to maybe like us. And the vests. We owe this one to Johnny B., who is one of the best (who you'll know if you've been to Gilt) - but really, we like everybody here. A lot. How can you not?
