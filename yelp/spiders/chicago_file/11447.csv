Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute was another Landmark "Bucket List" place for me to visit while in Chicago. Is it the best museum in the world as the sign on the doors says? No, but it is definitely worth the visit. There is a floor for everyone's taste, just beware it is crowded and we went on a Tuesday morning right when it opened. Plus if you have a student make sure you ask for that discount.
