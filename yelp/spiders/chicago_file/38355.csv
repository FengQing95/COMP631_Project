Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////AGED BONE-IN RIBEYE and BONE MARROW: We chose this specific ribeye based on the waitress' description of the different steaks. This was supposed to be their signature dish...the most flavorful with marbling throughout and the most tender of the cuts. She could not be more WRONG. It was filled with chunks of fat, not marbling. And it was TOUGH. The dull Oneida steak knives they gave us couldn't cut through it. The bone marrow was very greasy and flavorless. We ate a few bites and brought the rest in a doggy bag. Seriously. A $70+ piece of steak and accompaniment is sitting in a cardboard box in the fridge right now. That is absurd. I love steak. And this steak is not worthy of love.
