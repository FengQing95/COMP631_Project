Little Goat Diner////Came here when visiting some friends in Chicago, and I was really impressed with our brunch! Ordered a Bloody Mary and the omelette of the day: bacon cream cheese on the inside with tomatoes, fresh basil, and small, crispy onions on top. Wow, I think this is the best omelette I've ever had! The creamy inside with large bacon pieces was perfect and savory, and the crispy onions provided a good texture contrast to the creaminess. The taste was stellar. Service was prompt too!
