Smoque BBQ////I went here last night after hearing great things about the place. When we first walked in there was a sign warning that they would run out of pulled pork soon. Seeing as this is what I came to eat, it was pretty annoying that they would run out of one of their most popular items. When we did get to the register, it took them awhile, but they decided they had enough pulled pork left for one sandwich. I was happy that I was going to be able to eat!
