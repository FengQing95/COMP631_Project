Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////To be honest I'm a New York pizza kinda of gal but Lou's may have changed my mind! I just moved to the city and I thought to myself the best way to get to know Chicago is through their food!! First stop : DEEP DISH! I went to Lou's with my family around lunch time, it was pretty packed but I love their system where they check you in and you can see your place in line. There was about a 27 min wait so we just headed over to the Starbucks down the block and I just kept checking their site to see how close I was in line. What a great idea.. a must for so many restaurants! We started off with a house salad, I tried the house sweet vinaigrette, it was so freaking yummy! What's even better is you can buy a bottle for 6.99 downstairs!! Ok so let's get to the real deal, the pizza... omgggg. SOOOOO YUMMY CHEESY AHHHHH. We got the Lou which is a deep dish with Roma tomatoes, spinach and mushrooms. It took a while to come out, even though we ordered ahead but it was so damn worth it! Everything worked so well together, the dough was just perfect crispy on the outside but soft and doughy on the inside. My mom, who hates pizza (weird, I know!) even said this pizza tasted really good! I shared it with my dad and it was the perfect amount for two. My mom had a chicken sandwich, it was nothing special but it came with fruits and cottage cheese which was nice. The service here was excellent, our waiters name was haired, not sure if I spelled it right but she was adorable and soo friendly. With how busy they are, I was really happy to see that they don't sacrifice service. I've had Gino's before and Lou's wins the deep dish battle for sure!
