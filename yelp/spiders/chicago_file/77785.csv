Little Goat Diner////I went on a Saturday for a late brunch, and did not have to wait for a table. I managed to grab a seat by the counter by the expo station facing the kitchen and I knew I would be in for a treat. I studied the menu on my commute into the city and knew I would be ordering the Shrimp and Cheesy Grits. The server mentioned it was a "good choice" and very "American," to which I responded that I'm actually from Canada, which we both shared a little chuckle at.
