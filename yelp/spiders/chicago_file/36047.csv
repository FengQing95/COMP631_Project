Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I made a reservation six weeks ago to celebrate a late Valentine's day with my boyfriend. I was so excited to finally have a chance to go to Bavette's, a place that my coworkers had been raving about for years. To my disappointment, when I called today to confirm my reservation for this Sunday, they notified me that they could not find my reservation. They mentioned that as they changed from OpenTable to Reserve, they lost a few reservations.
