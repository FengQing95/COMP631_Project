Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We ordered the shrimp cocktail, fried chicken, and filet mignon. The steak is easily one of the beat I've had in the city, the rival being a place on Maple Street. We had a glass of the house red and it was ok, but not outstanding. The chicken was good, but not spicy enough, and the shrimp was ok. I would probably rate the shrimp 5 stars if I hadn't had so many cocktails in the city. It's good, but it's not the best and you can tell the shrimp have been frozen. Again, this is ok but I know there are places with better and fresher shrimp.
