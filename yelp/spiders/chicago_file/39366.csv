Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Just went for cocktails. Fabulous atmosphere and great waitstaff. Sat near the door on couches and ordered drinks. I had Bavette's punch with grapefruit and it was amazing. I ordered a second even. There was an order of a mint julep since it was derby weekend but that didn't go over as well as the old overholt. I'm not sure anything beat the grapefruit and rum combo.
