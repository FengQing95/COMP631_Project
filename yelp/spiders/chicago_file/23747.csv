Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Don't laugh, but that stuff crust pizza I ended ordering was the smallest size they had which was the individual. Although a pretty good pizza, I think I should have at least went with the small size. By comparing my pizza to others around me, I felt like the individual sized pizza lacked something on the grand scale whereas the bigger sizes had that intimidating stuff crust cheese spewing I was hoping to find. Noted for when I return: go with at least a small and bag the rest for to-go if you can't finish it. Still, The "Lou" pizza was still a tasty treat.
