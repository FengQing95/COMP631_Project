Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's Pizzeria did not disappoint! This pizza was amazing! I got "The Lou" personal pan pizza. The pricing was decent ($10.25 + $1.10 for the pepperoni I added). The flavors were poppin and this is the crust you WANT to eat! You can even add additional seasonings to the crust ($.75 extra). Be prepared to wait about 30-40 minutes for your freshly made pizza. Don't worry about the time because you will want to try out the soup, salad, or other appetizers. The salads are shareable and worth a try. I loved the pizza so much that I decided to try the dessert cookie pizza! No complaints! Get the bigger portion ($7.25)...you won't regret it! The cookie is cooked to gooey perfection and topped with vanilla bean ice cream. This was the perfect way to start off my Chicago adventure!
