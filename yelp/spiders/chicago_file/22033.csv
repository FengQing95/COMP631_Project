Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Was looking to try deep dish pizza when planning a Chicago vacation, Andrew Zimmern mentioned about Pizzaria Uno & This place. Decided to try Lou because it was a walking distance from our hotel. We got there around 5:30, the place was busy but we just had to wait for 5 minutes for our table. The server was promptly greeted us almost as soon as we sat down. For appetizer, We ordered fried calamari (5/5)- the Marinara sauce was freshly made. Chicken wing (5/5)- was probably the best wings I have had anywhere. Now for pizza, we have ordered personal cheese deep dish & the small Lou with buttery crust (since according to the menu this was the one made Lou famous). The pizza never came out until about 1.5 hrs after. The server admitted that she had forgotten to send our order in. They comp the both pizza for the mistake. I have to say after the wonderful appetizers we have tried, the pizza was a let down. The Lou (3/5) was just ok, good cheesy and crispy crust but that was probably the best description I could give. I was just bland for my taste. The cheese pizza (3/5) was again very cheesy but nothing that would scream my name to come back for.
