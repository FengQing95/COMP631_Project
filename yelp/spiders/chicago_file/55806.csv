Smoque BBQ////THE GOOD: let's see, their RIBS were DELISH! - Both St. Louis and baby back style!! Their Mac N Cheese was pretty tasty, but came in a small individually backed foil container.  Fries was typical, but... IT'S BYOB!!! That's always good on my book. The sauce was great! They have their own version of a bbq sauce which had a sweet and tangy taste.
