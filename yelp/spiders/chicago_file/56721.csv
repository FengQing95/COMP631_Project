Smoque BBQ////I have been to Smoque at least a dozen times. I almost always get the brisket platter with beans and fries. I am not a big fan of the cornbread or cobbler. The coleslaw helps cool my stomach. The food is great. The ribs are of a different style and if you know it, then it is good. If you compare it to the drenched in sauce variety we mostly get here in Chitown, then you will be disappointed.
