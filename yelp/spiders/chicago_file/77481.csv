Little Goat Diner////As we were here for lunch, I did not want to spend 2 hours here. The hosts at the front were all very rude, and not just to me, but to all of the customers that came in. The server that we had only came over once. He took our order and disappeared. After a very long wait, the food was brought by a runner. The waiter never came back to check on us, offer us water, condiments or anything else. After a frustrating meal and a very long wait, we could not catch any servers that would give us the check. (Our server was really MIA by now). I had to walk over to the hostess and ask them to send someone with a check. They seemed very displeased that I did that and gave me attitude again. Finally, I was able to pay my bill and I vowed to never come back here again.
