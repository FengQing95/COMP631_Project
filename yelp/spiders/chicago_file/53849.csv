Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This small-from-the-outside, but huge-on-the-inside establishment is a fantastic place to try out tons of different Spanish dishes, including their famous paella. I don't remember all of the dishes we got, but some standouts included the grilled hanger steak, the SPICY POTATOES (ridiculously good and cheap!), and of course, the paella.
