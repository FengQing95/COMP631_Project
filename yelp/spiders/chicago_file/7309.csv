Art Institute of Chicago////There aren't many art museums that you would find like this around the globe. This excellent museum gives you an amazing chance to understand art. Worldwide known artists of the past are the usual topics for most exhibits, temporary and permanent. We have been to this museum many times and the famous artist Magritte was the temporary exhibit that we went to today. Though it did not have the most famous Magritte painting of all time, this exhibit was filled with Magritte's legacy both in paintings and in words. We also recommend the permanent Japanese, Chinese and Korean pottery exhibit right before the India section. And the Greek section. When you enter this museum you'll be blasted by the taste of art and moments you won't forget forever.
