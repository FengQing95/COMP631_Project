Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////As someone who is originally from Madrid, I must say this place is great and pretty authentic, yes it is somewhat Americanized, but its done so in a positive way: I had never heard of peach sangria before but it was surprisingly delicious. The patatas bravas (pissed off potatoes) are to die for and the Paellas are delicious as well.
