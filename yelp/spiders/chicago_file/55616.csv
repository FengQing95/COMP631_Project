Smoque BBQ////Definitely as good as it gets.  Smoque BBQ is as good as good if not better than anything you'll get in St Louis, Memphis or Kansas City.  If there's a line outside rest assured it's because the food is good.  Don't fret over the line or the wait, if any.  Just enjoy and quit bitchin about any inconvenience to you. The food is worth waiting for.
