Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Creamed Spinach - (blue cheese, caramelized onions) This was not as I was expecting. It was more cheesy than it was creamy. Like really, sooo much cheese. I'm not a big fan of blue cheese so that was probably part of my problem with it. It did come highly recommended, just wasn't expecting this to be so heavy either. I was thinking the blue cheese was just going to be sprinkled on top, but it was baked right in and acted as the cream....so more like cheesey spinach vs creamed spinach
