Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came here around 11pm on a Saturday night but not for the food. We went straight to the lounge underneath the restaurant. It was heaven for me. I am used to the NYC nightlife and this was very similar to my tastes. It was super comfortable, small and not at all crowded. The music was amazing, not dance music, but not really lame jazzy shit either. It was seemingly gangster rap that was mellow. Wu-Tangish if you will. We were brought a shot of Jameson and a shot pickle juice to be consumed back to back which seemed to be their specialty and I had to rip one (then the other) to give it a go. Pickle juice does a great job masking the whiskey taste so for all you ladies out there who love ripping whiskey shots but prefer the taste of pickle juice instead (admittedly there probably isn't an army of you out there) keep this in mind. I'll be coming here as often as possible, suggest you do as well. Unless I'm there, then go away so I can have a table.
