Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza did in fact take nearly 45 minutes to make its way to our table.  By now, the dining room had filled up quite a bit.  The pizza tasted good, but the amount of time waiting, really hyped up my expectations.  The expectations fell short once reality hit.  It was just an average tasting pizza once the high wore down.
