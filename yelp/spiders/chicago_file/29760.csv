Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's delivery from south loop was quick, however, the pizza has changed.  the once delicious butter crust is now a cracker with a smatter of some red sauce. Worst pizza I've had in a while.  And, I've had it twice now within a month or two time just to be sure this wasn't a trend.  Too bad, have to go back to Beggar's for real pizza.
