Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is one of our families go to places to bring our young kids.  We all enjoy the great taste of their thin crust plain cheese pizza, but where it is at with me is the thicker crust sausage pizza. This is my favorite sausage pizza in Chicago.  They have been growing their locations throughout the Metro area and you can find them in most neighborhoods. A very family friendly dinning spot and does not disappoint.
