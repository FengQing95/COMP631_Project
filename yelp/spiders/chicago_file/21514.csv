Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great spot for visitors, locals and anyone looking for some good food. I have bought this food for work catering and have brought friends and family here. The thin crust is my favorite, the crust is so buttery and delicious! I also appreciate that the chain puts their calorie counts on their menu.
