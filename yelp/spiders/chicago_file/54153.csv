Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A friend of mine and I wanted to get out and try some place "different" so did some searching "Best Restaurants of Chicago" then realized...I get discounted parking in Lincoln Park, why not go there? So I searched "Best Restaurants of Lincoln Park" and found this place, I've heard of it, but never been there and it's been a long time since I had some good Tapas. Â Thankfully I was able to make a reservation on Open Table for either 6:30 or 8pm, I took the 6:30 - the place was packed the entire time!
