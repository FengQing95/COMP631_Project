The Purple Pig////We started off with the soprassata and a cheese that I can't even remember now but it was very bold and very funky! Great flavor tho! We ordered the crispy pig ears, salt roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette, and huevos rotas con chorizo! We also got a steak dish that was good but I didn't get a pic and the name of it escapes me now. But Everything was so good! I couldn't stop eating the beets and I wish I had more people so that I could try more things! We will definitely be back.
