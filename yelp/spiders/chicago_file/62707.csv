Smoque BBQ////You know how some places are hit or miss.  This place is like home run or double.  The food is either very good or amazing! I went on a Saturday a few months ago and the BBQ was good.  But I went for lunch the other day with a work associate from out of town and the food was on point! I always get the chopped brisket and it did not disappoint.  I Highly recommend if you're looking for a good BBQ joint.
