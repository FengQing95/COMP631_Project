Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Well this place is awesome!! Great time for a group of close friends to enjoy some great food and great sangria! Highly recommend trying the black raspberry sangria! On the tapas side of things, we always start with the potato salad and the always amazing calmari. The braised lamb is just out if this world! So many options at Reeba and wish I could have them all. Once again we had a great time and before we knew it we had killed 3 pitchers of sangria and enjoyed some great food. I will be back of course.
