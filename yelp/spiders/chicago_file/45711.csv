Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The sangria was excellent. We got half a pitcher of peach and half blackberry. Both were delicious. After my second glass, I was quite the spirited bday girl. Especially since I just spent an hour and a half driving through traffic trying to get back into the city. I wanted to throttle someone by the time we made it to the restaurant, but sangria made it all better.
