Little Goat Diner////Unlike Girl and the Goat, you can get a table after 20-30 minutes as opposed to 2-3 months. Â The only negative aspect is the same as at G&G, which is, if you are a party of 2, you may be seated at the same table as another party of 2 you are unfamiliar with. Luckily we were a party of 4 so we got to sit in a nice booth and watch the strangers sit awkwardly at the same tables.
