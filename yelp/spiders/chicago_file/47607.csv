Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What an awesome tapas restaurant in the city! This place would be a great place to come with a group or a few friends. Or in my case, new friends (looking at you Angela C!). If you want to see exactly what we ordered check out her review, all I can remember is the highlights (you can thank sangria pitchers for that!) first of all, I didn't think I'd need reservations on a Wednesday but it was packed (45 min wait) We didn't mind waiting because we were drinking the amazing red sangria (if it ain't broke, don't try a crazy flavor right? We stuck with the original!)
