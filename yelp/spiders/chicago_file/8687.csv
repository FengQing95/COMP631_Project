Art Institute of Chicago////So many amaazing pieces of art. The stained glass was particularly beautiful. I've never had art make me feel so many feelings. There was one piece of people on a concrete boardwalk. I can't remember the name, but it was... wow. Definitely worth the price of admission, even if I wasn't happy when my wife said we should go.
