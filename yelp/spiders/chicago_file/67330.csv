Little Goat Diner////On my actual birthday, the next morning, we decided to give the diner another try.  We got there around 1:00PM and it was packed, which we were expecting coming in around prime lunchtime.  They use a text messaging system for the wait list, which seems nice to most, but I personally didn't find it all that helpful.  I feel that it only made the hosts less personal - not remembering names and not genuinely listening to people's requests.  Also, you can track where you are at on the list by following the link onto the internet.  Our place in line changed frequently, somtimes decreasing and sometimes increasing - which was slightly mind-boggling.  We watched other parties go ahead of us that arrived after us, but we also understand that a party of three or four may be seated elsewhere than a party of two - so we didn't let that bother us much.  I was definitely getting antsy as we were quoted a half an hour and it was bordering one hour that we had already been waiting.  While I typcially don't mind waiting, my partner had to get to work and I also feel that the time quoted should be at least close to correct.
