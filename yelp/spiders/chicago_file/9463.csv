Art Institute of Chicago////I do have to agree that the layout can be a head-scratcher for the first time visitor. So we found ourselves asking for directions most of the time. The modern art section was definitely odd and abstract, to say the least. There was a dark room filled with televisions, and on screen was images of a crazy clown doing different things, like sitting on the toilet, jumping up and down, screaming, etc. Definitely not for those who had nightmares watching Stephen King's "IT." And NO, I didn't take any pictures.
