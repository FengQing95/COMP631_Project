Smoque BBQ////My cousin and I visited this place on memorial day weekend. Not sure why this place was so crowded. The cashier got our order wrong as she left some items out. The pulled pork lacked flavor, it seems to left something to be desired, so did the mac and cheese. I will say the brisket, fries and cole slaw was really good. The brisket really doesn't need any sauce as it is rich in flavor. I'm no bbq connoisseur Â but i was taken back by the sauces, I was expecting there to be more variety, maybe a sweeter one? They were all tangy but still good. I know what to specifically get if I ever come back here.
