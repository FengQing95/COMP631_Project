Little Goat Diner////Little Goat and Girl and the Goat across the street are opened by the same owner. But apparently this is the cheaper, less fancy, and equally tasty resto. For weekend dinner, come way early-- as in 5pm early-- to reduce your wait time to... under 30 minutes. Yeah, it's that popular.
