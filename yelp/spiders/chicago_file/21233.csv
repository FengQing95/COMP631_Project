Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Good pizza! But was rather disappointed when the Sheffield location doesn't have mozzarella sticks or bacon as a topping.... I mean it's a pizzeria and it not have this?? They said some locations do but they don't. I think the brand name should follow throughout it's restaurants and include all menu items for all stores....not one and not the other.
