Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This Lou Malnati's is located in the River North neighborhood of Chicago. It's a little over a half-mile walk from the south end of The Magnificent Mile (about a 12-15 minute walk). I chose this place for our group for lunch because it had a 4-star rating on Yelp with about 3,000 reviews. I would consider this place touristy.
