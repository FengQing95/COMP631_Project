Little Goat Diner////LITTLE MISS PIGGY WENT TO CHINA: i usually dont like asian fusion food, being asian myself, and i was a little skeptical about the asian pork sausage thing but they made it so good! i loved the asian scallion biscuit (was hesitant about that too, im a southern so im picky about my biscuits) and the asian style everything was delicious! it had just the right amount of spice and kick to it while yet dialing it down to breakfast / diner level so you're not walking around the city of chicago with a burning booty hole. i will say tho, i dont like my eggs runny and i asked him to make it over hard.. and he said usually when they're busy thats not an option. so just keep that in mind for my other fellow non-yolk egg lovers.
