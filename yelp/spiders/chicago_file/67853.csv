Little Goat Diner////I feel bad to give 3 stars but I want to be honest. I had the crispy shrimp cocktail and the tomato apple soup. The soup was way too sour and didn't taste the apple flavor at all. The crispy shrimp cocktail was alright but the coat of crispy noodles was soggy and had an unpleasant texture. The cocktail sauce could have been better. My friend had the spiced apple pancakes and it was decent except it did not have enough apples to it. I expected better food... It was a little disappointing.
