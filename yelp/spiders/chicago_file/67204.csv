Little Goat Diner////Gotta go five stars here... The brussel sprouts were amazing...mashed potatoes tempura..wow!  They make their own hot sauce!!  The Mac and Cheese were great after I added the hot sauce (before that...left a little something to be desired...).  Also best broccoli cheese soup I ever had!
