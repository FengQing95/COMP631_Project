Little Goat Diner////Very pricey but the food is only marginally better (if that) than you'd find in most other good diners in Chicago.  If you're looking for brunch food (eggs scrambles, fancy waffles or pancakes), there's better at Wildberry, Bongo Room, or even White Palace Grill.  Skip this elevated diner.
