Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Um yep this place is awesome!  From that buttery crust to the lean Italian sausage to the homemade tomato sauce on top, Lou Malnati's is the standard upon which I judge Chicago deep dish.  The service here is top notch and the servers are spot on with their recommendations.  Loved the spinach cheese bread.  It was called something else but basically it was spinach with tonnnns of gooey cheese baked in a delicious flakey crust.  I recommend the baked cookie dish with ice cream and whip cream for dessert.  Carb overload but totally worth it!
