Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////At CBBR, you may think they are at capacity but they have work arounds. Feel free to sit at the bar, random stools not connected to the bar, or in little cubbies that used to be windows for a totally comfortable eating experience. My cultured lady friend said that's just the way they do it in espana. Food is tapas style which translates to English as not enough to satiate. They will change the TV at the bar to the sports game of your request, whether that game is Auburn vs Alabama or Western Kentucky vs Marshall. It's rivalry week people!!!
