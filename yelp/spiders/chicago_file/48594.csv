Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If I could give 3.5 stars, I would. But since I can't, I'll be nice and bump it up to 4 stars! Tapas never seems to really fill me up (I compare tapas to dimsum), but Ba-Ba-Reeba does have a few great tapas dishes and the sangria is worth the bump up to 4 stars! We ordered the classic red and white sangris, but the all around favorite was the white peach sangria!
