Art Institute of Chicago////I arrived the art institute 15 minutes before the opening. There was a line of 30 people formed in visitor entrance door. I decided to Â buy the ticket online while I was in line to get in. It saves a lot of time. You can go straight in instead of waiting in line to buy tickets inside. You can also buy fast pass and wait at another shorter line.
