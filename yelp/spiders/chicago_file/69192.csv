Little Goat Diner////The decor is classy but definitely reminiscent of a diner; it's just a more upscale, classy diner. Luckily they still retain the artery clogging grease in some of their dishes so that it's a faithul interpretation. Little Goat Bread turns into the house bar after 6PM or so, and it's a nice place to grab a quick drink if you have to wait for a table (which if you do have to wait, has been a fairly short period). There's so much more to talk about, but I'll end on this: there's a reason I keep going back to Little Goat, but there is definitely room for improvement. Given that its only been open for a couple of weeks, I fully expect it to get up to 100% soon, and time will tell if this 4 star review can claw its way up to 5. And you know what? I like its chances.
