Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is a new place but it looks like their employee training is already in good place. Service was excellent. Also, where else would you actually have the busboy interacting with guests? The busboy stationed at our table went above what is usually expected at other restaurants. He asked us how we were, told us who our server was at the beginning of the night, described the salt/pepper/spices sprinkles which he brought to our table for our pork chop.
