The Purple Pig////I was a little grown off by the seating, but it ended up being a pretty concept. We didn't have a preference on seating and were seated "outside" where they have long tables.  The seating is communal. We got sat and made ourselves comfortable. We each ordered our drinks and cottonwood cheddar plate to snack on. I ventured out and got the Colombian old fashioned. I wasn't very thrilled with my drink of choice, but tried to drink it anyway. The cheese plate was great. Our server, Mauro checked on us and noticed I hadn't drank much of my drink. I told him I didn't really care for it, he took it off our ticket and asked me what else I wanted.  How observant and sweet.
