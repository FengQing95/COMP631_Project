Little Goat Diner////I had a bite of a friend's "Pie of the Day - Passionfruit meringue on a chocolate and white cookie crumble crust"...not exactly sure I described it right. It doesn't matter - it was GOOD. The passionfruit flavor was abundant, but not overwhelming. The meringue was nice and crispy. The crust provided a good balance to the slightly-acidic meringue.
