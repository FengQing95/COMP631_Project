Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This deep dish pizza was all right. There's a long wait. You can order your pizza while you stand in line, so theoretically it's ready when your table is ready. We waited 45 minutes for a table, and 20 minutes after we got the table for the pizza, so the total time they had to cook the pizza was 65 minutes. I found the crust to be bland.
