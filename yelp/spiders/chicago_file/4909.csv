The Purple Pig////Food: Amazing. We tried out around 6 different dishes and all of them were amazing. I personally love the octopus and pork shoulder. They were both so memorable and tasty! The portion was also pretty standard for 5 of us and they came out relatively fast. Definitely get the octopus, my favorite!
