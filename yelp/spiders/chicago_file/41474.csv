Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I can't believe I have yet to review the fun times had at Cafe B-B-R.  The Sangria is delicious and the many plates we had were fantastic.  I recommend reservations as it gets hella packed with people in here most nights.  The scallop plate was good as well as the skewers that come out on the skewer hanger they put on your table.  People stare, but it's worth it.  It's not like they weren't staring at me and my hot friends anyways.  I'll be back, and I'd like to try the brunch sometime.
