The Purple Pig////Delicious small plates and craft cocktails. I love the purple pig. It's dimly lit and perfect for a date night. It's always crowded and loud, so just know that going into this restaurant. If you don't have a reservation, be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes. Even though the wait is long, there is always a place to stand and order drinks while you wait.
