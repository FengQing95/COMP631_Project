Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Only reason this gets 3 stars is for the dressing and the croutons. They claim it's a house made sauce and it was great. The croutons were also fresh and toasted. The salad itself was poorly thought out. Big chunks of lettuce with finely diced cucumber and tomato and huge circles of onions. Not easy to put together into one bite.
