Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Mediocre deep dish pizza. The mozzarella was tough. Sauce needed salt, garlic and oregano or basil. Crust needed salt. It had no taste. We went on a Friday night. The wait for a table was 1 1/2 hrs.. Take out was a 45 minute wait that became + 1 hr. We opted for takeout but they did not provide forks and paper napkins. Only plus was the staff.
