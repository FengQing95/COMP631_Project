Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service: once we cleared our wait and were escorted to our table, I, didnt like the table. It was an odd size for two people and was in the entry hall. I requested a booth and after waiting 30+ minutes past our reservation time, the hostess kindly adjusted plans to seat us where we had requested. Little things like this show the heart and soul of a restaurant. Remember, we were 30+ minutes PAST our reservation time and yet they still moved our table to our desires.
