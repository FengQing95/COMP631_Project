Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Arrived 20 minutes later, walked up and there was a gentleman waiting at the hostess area. Let him know I called ahead, he looked me up and said "it'll be about an hour and 15 minutes.". I explained how I called ahead and what was said to which he said "She meant 45 minutes to an hour sir." We went back and forth a bit on this but he dismissed me and walked away as if he didn't have the time to listen to a customer on what another representative of his employer had said to a customer. So we waited.... An hour and half later I go back up and ask how much longer to which they said "We texted you it was ready quite a bit ago." To find out they texted the wrong number. They "apologized" and said they'd seat us next. We sat back down, right in front of the hostess table mind you and after 20 more minutes I asked again what the status was told yet again that they had texted me and hadn't heard from me. The lady repeated the number back to me and again they had it wrong (after 3 times of giving them numbers mind you). I even inquired as to "why couldn't you just lean over the counter and say 'Sir we can seat you now. You saw me sitting there but relied on a text?' to which she blankly stared at me. I asked to speak to a manager, she walked away and after another 10 minutes of waiting my Girlfriend and I left.
