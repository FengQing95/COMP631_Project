Little Goat Diner////My two friends and I split three dishes. The crab dip was so rich and creamy and loaded with crab, and even though you may find yourself short of Ritz crackers, don't hesitate to ask the waiter for more. The Asian tasty thing was my favorite dish, and it's pretty much an Asian style pancake with bacon and dippy sauces. And the tempura mashed potatoes omg. I was really curious about that one since I've never seen anything like it before at a restaurant. Really, it tastes exactly how you would expect it to taste. The first bite is wonderfully light and crispy, and then in the smooth mashed potatoes inside just ooze out.
