Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I knew the pizza would impress but the service was bar none.  Our server was HIGHLY knowledgeable about what we should order as newbies and suggested their house salad along side our pizza and I'm so glad he did.  That is seriously one of the best salads I've had and went with the pizza so so well!  As for the pizza, duh, it was fantastic.  We went 1/2 and 1/2 and both sides were mouth watering. No words other than, GO.  You won't regret it!  Great food. Great staff!!  We will be back Lou!!! No worries!!
