Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place has been around forever...and for good reason. When you first walk in, you can feel the warm ambiance. It's as if you stepped into a different world and you're no longer in good-ol' Chicago. If you end up waiting for your table, which often times happens because of how busy it is... you can sit at their nice bar and have a drink. They also have their cured ham hanging from the ceiling- love it! Definitely adds to the ambiance.
