Art Institute of Chicago////Im not a fan of art (or anything fru fru), but this place was pretty cool. I got lost for a second, moments later I realized you walk in one direction and it put my anxiety at ease. I've never been to a museum so this was a trip - a tad bit overwhelming. I didnt know what I was suppose to be looking for (as in artists), but they were all great (lol). It was weird to be a few feet away from paintings that you see in books (what stops people from vandalizing them anyway). What I enjoyed most were the sculptures (really cool). And the asian section was awesome. It was weird that the only art displayed from korea were a few pieces of pottery. I guess it all got destroyed when the japanese invaded or something.
