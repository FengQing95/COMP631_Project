Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place has nothing on Gino's east. Honestly, it's just generic deep dish that you could get anywhere. The crust is bland and the tomatoes are from a can. One word, lame. You will have to wait no matter where you go for deep dish, so I would definitely go back to Gino's.
