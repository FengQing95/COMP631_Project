Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////All of the food we tried was OK, but nothing was yelp worthy. I was particularly disappointed by the crab cake - I expected for $20 it would have a significant amount of crab in it. It was mostly breading and while the accompanying sauce was tasty, it overwhelmed the limited crab flavor. Â We shared the burger, the hangar steak and the veal cheeks for our main courses. The veal was the best of the three but nothing you couldn't make at home.
