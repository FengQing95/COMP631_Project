Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What an amazing experience! The waitress was extremely helpful about what to do around town, and what to order on the menu. The Malnati salad is the best salad I've EVER had. I would recommend it! I was sad I didn't get a large! I ordered their Malnati Chicago classic deep dish pizza medium, with onions. Overall, this place. If you want good service, good food, good atmosphere, then this is the place to go!!
