Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The atmosphere is really swanky, it's also quite dark so we're glad we weren't at a booth because we might fall asleep. We started with a seafood tower (it's bigger than you think!) full of oysters, king crab, salmon ceviche, and shrimp. Then we split the 22oz bone in dry rub ribeye which was absolutely delicious! We loved the seasoning and the sear. It was fantastic.
