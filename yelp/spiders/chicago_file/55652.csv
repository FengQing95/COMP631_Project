Smoque BBQ////The ribs are fantastic!  I ordered corn bread with mine and the bf ordered mac and cheese with it.  I loved both and was extremely jealous that I couldn't have more mac 'n cheese!! I would have gone back to order my own but the line was too long!  I'm not a huge fan of cole slaw so I didn't even really try it.
