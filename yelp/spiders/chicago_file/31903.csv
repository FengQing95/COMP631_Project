Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Waited about :40 for a deep dish Malnati's classic overflowing with sausage and with a buttery flaky crust. So good and totally satisfying. After ordering and eating some super tender calamari, we could only eat a couple of pieces each and took the rest on the road when we drove to Detroit. It was that good.
