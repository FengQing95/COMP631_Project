Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service was slow, and yes they were busy, but so were we. We needed to eat and get out and go do something else. I was waiting on one of my skewers until the very end of the meal when everyone else had pretty much finished eating and I was sitting waiting without any food in front of me. Tapas without the sharing part sucks. Everyone else seems to love it and good for them. But for the price, the food is just not worth it. Bah humbug.
