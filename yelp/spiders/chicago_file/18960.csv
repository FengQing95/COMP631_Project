Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When it comes to Chicago style pizza, Lou's is the best. The Chicago Classic is my personal favorite. The sausage they use is just wonderful. Then the sauce is what really makes it. The vine-ripened tomato sauce is the best pizza sauce I've ever had. There appetizers are worth it as well. I'm a fan of the hot wings and bruschetta. When in Chicago make sure you stop by this historic pizza joint!
