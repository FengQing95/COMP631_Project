Smoque BBQ////Can't wait to come back! Easily found parking right outside and luckily there was no line but it was pretty crowded for a Wednesday afternoon. I had the ribs, split it with the BF.  Good, but I like ribs saucy and this was a dry rub. But I tasted my bro's brisket and it was so tender. The mac and cheese is good and so are the fries.The sides seem kind of small, but I guess they make it to be portioned out. They're 'cute-sized'.  I can't wait to come again and try something else!
