Art Institute of Chicago////This is easily the second largest museum I've been to, and it's well worth every penny and all the time that you can afford to spend at it. It has such an eclectic collection of art that there's something for everyone. While it might be difficult to traverse and plan a path to take, the discovery is fulfilling and a great experience. There is a lot of ground to cover, and even more to see.
