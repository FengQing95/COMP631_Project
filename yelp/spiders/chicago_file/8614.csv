Art Institute of Chicago////The modern wing is currently closed through May but there was plenty more to entertain us, with photography exhibits, sculpture sections, asian art galleries, and of course my friend's favorite Thorne Miniature rooms. I have a feeling I could've stayed so much longer and returned on multiple days and still not fully examine every work here.
