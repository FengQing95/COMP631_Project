Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place gets super packed!!! Therefore, I suggest making reservations here. It's a good thing I did. After getting past the hectic-ness of the front door, you can appreciate its upbeat ambiance and prompt service. The peach sangria was light but did the trick.....we ended up ordering the following (2 tapas each is plenty of food!!!)
