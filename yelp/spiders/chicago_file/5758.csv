The Purple Pig////Great service and great food. Get the bone marrow or some charcuterie. Or both. Our server had a Gucci shirt that said Gnochi instead. COME ON!!! Â how cool is that? Also he was a great server. Especially since COVID has made it so difficult for the servers and bartenders in the industry. I would highly recommend it. Actually an old chef of mine suggested we go there after we already had. So that means chefs like it. Just go.
