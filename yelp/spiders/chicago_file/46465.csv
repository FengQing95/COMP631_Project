Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My all-time favorite place for tapas. Try everything at lease once (I know I have!) Chorizo-wrapped medjool dates and cheese are delicciiouuussssss. Goat cheese baked in tomato sauce is perfection. Their octopus is always flavorful and has the right amount of salt and spices. Â White peach sangria is very yummy! If you haven't been, you have to go! And if you have, then you know you will be back for more!
