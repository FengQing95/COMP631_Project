Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We really enjoyed our experience at Bavette's. We accidentally came in the night before our reservation, but the hostess kindly told us she could seat us within the hour, so we went for a drink at the bar. Once seated, our waiter was super friendly and attentive, and all the food we ordered was delicious. Despite being a steakhouse, I highly recommend the fried chicken...perfectly crispy and tender. Drinks were strong and tasty. Overall, a great experience, but I am only giving 4 stars because I wouldn't say there was anything particularly memorable or exciting about Bavette's compared to other "nice" restaurants around the city.
