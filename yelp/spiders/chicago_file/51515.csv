Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been coming to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba for over 20 years. Time to right a review!  The service is consistently solid, friendly, phenomenal. Wait staff is always helpful to give suggestions. Bottom line:  get sangria, order the paella for the table, and order /share tapas to your hearts' and stomachs' content. This is a great to celebrate a birthday. Restaurant is loud but in a boisterous, party type of way.
