Art Institute of Chicago////The collection inside is truly world class. Be prepared for the surprise of famous pieces around every corner. The paintings, sculptures and object de art is eclectic and brilliant. I like the way the areas are grouped. You'll need a map. We decided on which collection we wanted to see first and went from there.
