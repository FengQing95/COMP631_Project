Smoque BBQ////This place is definitely worth the hype! Tried a bit of everything. Pulled pork was great! Brisket mouth watering. Ribs absolutely delish! Could not eat everything placed in front of us and would definitely suggest a to go box! The little cobblers were tasty too! Slaw and sides were yummy. Definitely go with people willing to share and try a bit of it all!
