Little Goat Diner////I had breakfast at Little Goat recently and am a convert after trying the Bulls Eye French Toast. Eggs and fried chicken over a piece of french toast with barbeque maple syrup on top.  Crazy, and crazy delicious.  Is their dinner menu still too greasy? Yes. But honestly, I'm not sure I care any more. I'll just go for breakfast.
