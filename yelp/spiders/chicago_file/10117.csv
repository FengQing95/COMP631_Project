Art Institute of Chicago////Such an amazing art museum! I was thrilled to see the Impressionists exhibit, Picasso, Munch, Dali, and American Gothic. So much beautiful art! I look forward to planning my next visit. The architecture of the museum is beautiful and extremely clean. The staff were helpful when needed and maintained appropriate observation as needed.
