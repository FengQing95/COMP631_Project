Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best deep dish in Chicago, I am a big fan of the deep dish with sausage, it is perfectly cooked and tastes delicious. The crust is perfectly crispy yet buttery, and the service here is great. And no before you ask this pizza will not make you feel bloated and overly full which is always a good thing.
