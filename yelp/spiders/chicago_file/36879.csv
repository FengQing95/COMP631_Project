Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've been here twice and been blown away both times. Their dry aged rib eye is probably the best steak I've ever had, but their sides are also amazing. Their brussels sprouts are perfectly caramelized, their truffle mac is cheesy and truffle-y, and their chocolate cream pie is incredibly decadent and rich. Would recommend!!!
