Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So I went here with a friend about a year ago while visiting with minimal issues but this time, I'm sad to say, made me never want to come back here. On the way out of town today, that same friend and I approached with our suitcases (because we're traveling and it's a thing people do?!), and we were told "put those against the wall" and handed menus without further instructions. They wanted us to leave our suitcases against the wall unsupervised so anyone could just walk off with them. I don't think so. This place is not traveler friendly and they were very rude. If you're traveling to town, don't bother.
