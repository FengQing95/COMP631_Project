Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I loved that it is in the historic Wrigley building. Our table was located in the basement. Waitstaff was efficient and very knowledgeable about the menu. Our deep dish pizza was great and filling allowing us to take a piece home.  The restaurant, like many these days, has lots of hard surfaces and is pretty loud  but that is also because this business is busy.
