Little Goat Diner////Yeah, that man was me. Me and mezcal have a storied history. We don't play well together. And yet, this Cherry Smoke Bomb deal was actually pretty good, making me rethink our relationship. Like maybe me and mezcal aren't meant to be monogamous. No, we probably need a little polyamory in our lives. Anyway....it was pretty good for something I expected to taste and smell like bad decisions. The Old Fashioned was good as well. Bourbon, sugar, and orange bitters, well balanced and tasty.
