Art Institute of Chicago////On a soaked, stormy day that could've been the inspiration for Chicago's "windy city" tagline I made my way to the Art Institute and gave up on the notion of departing any time before closing.  There was simply too much to see and no compelling reason to step back out in that weather any time before it was mandated.  Truth be told, I could've spent days in here.
