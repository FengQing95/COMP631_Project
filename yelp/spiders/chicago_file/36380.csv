Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We shared some sides:  the elote corn and the thick-cut bacon.  I'm a fan of shareable sides, and the elote corn could have fed four people.  I could not get enough of this one!  The thick-cut bacon is a bacon lover's dream.  It was so thick that it almost tasted like a slab of ham.  It was good stuff, but not my personal favorite.  I'm just not crazy about bacon.
