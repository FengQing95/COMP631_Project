Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Wow! We were told to go to Bavette's for great steak. Reservations are a must as we told 11:00pm was earliest available and Open Table had seats available in 3 weeks. So we just went and took our chances to sit at the bar and have dinner. Upstairs bar was packed so they said to try downstairs. Got two seats and had a wonderful bottle of wine and a great steak and sides.
