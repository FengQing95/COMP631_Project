Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This was my best friend's first time in Chicago and I wanted to make sure that she had a good experience. As I searched yelp for good brunch places (she's an Eggs Benedict fanatic and loves sweet and savory breakfast items!) and stumbled upon Wildberry. We used the NoWait feature on yelp to get a place in line and I'm so glad that we did so! It was a 64-84 min wait but taking into consideration the time it took for us to travel from my friend's place (blue line and walked)--it worked out perfectly! The staff was friendly and professional and our waitress was warm and bubbly and answered any questions we had about the menu. I ordered a White Chocolate frappe, cinnamon roll pancakes, and corned beef hash. My friend had a caramel macchiato, smores pancakes, and eggs Benedict. Holy moley, every single bite was a life changing experience. My friend actually cried at how good it was. So please do yourself a favor and try this place out!!
