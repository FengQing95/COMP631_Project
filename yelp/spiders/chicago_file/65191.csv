Smoque BBQ////For a party of 4, we ordered a pound of sliced brisket, full rack of the St. Louis rib, cole slaw, mac n' cheese, bbq beans, fries, corn bread, and peach cobblers.  On the exterior the meat looks a bit over-charred but it wasn't burnt at all, which was good.  Ribs were decent but the brisket was just too dry.  Fries were cold and stale, cole slaw had no flavor, but mac n' cheese was pretty decent, as well as the corn bread.  The crusts of the peach cobbler was delicious, but once you pass the crust, it's like eating canned peaches heated up.  All time favorite was the bbq beans!!! It's flavorful, sweet, bbq-y, tangy, and everything you can ask for.
