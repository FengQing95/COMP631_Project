Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////its always been a pleasure to dine here ....our family chose to come here instead of Pilsen restaurant week just because we weren't in a mood for anything new. We were no.1 on the waitlist @ 3.15pm and were seated in 5 minutes by the bar in the dingiest part of the restaurant, I was getting claustrophobic while the family was just happy to go ahead and order. I requested to be seated in the main dining area and Ava at the front desk (i think) immediately obliged. We were so much more happy in the new location and it enhanced our dining experience greatly.
