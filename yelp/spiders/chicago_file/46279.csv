Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////All in all, a great place to go, especially if you love variety in your meal. A really fun experience and a great place to take out of towners and family. If you go with friends, just make sure you share nicely and be careful, it's easy to get carried away ordering lots of plates in a group, make sure you set a price or plate limit before you go in! :0) On the flip side, it can be a pretty cheap meal if it's just two of you because you can watch what you order easily. Ok, enough reading about it! Turn off your computer and head on over to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba! There are pitchers of sangria calling your name!
