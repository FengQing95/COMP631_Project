Little Goat Diner////The jap chae was a different take on the original version and the glass noodle was more brown and seasoned. It was a bit more seasoned than my liking but it was delicious. Â I'm glad I got the goat burger which was topped with a sunny side up egg. I would recommend the jap chae but I would add some protein.
