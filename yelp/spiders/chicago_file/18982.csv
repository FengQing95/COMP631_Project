Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is (from what I hear) the best of the best in Chicago. My friend and I came here on our lunch hour during a conference that was being held down the block. The service was impeccable, the food was delicious, and lucky for us, there was NO WAIT! I want to give this place 5 stars, but it just wasn't the best I've ever had. Everything was fresh and the food was yummy, but there was something that just wasn't 5 stars to me. Nonetheless, it was delicious and if you're in the area you should definitely give it a try for yourself.
