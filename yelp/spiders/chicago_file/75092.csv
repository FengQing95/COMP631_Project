Little Goat Diner////The selection at this place is so unique and interesting. There are combinations of very traditional dishes in unexpected ways. I had a Japanese pancake with pork belly and fried fish flakes. It was very delicious. They even have their own in house beer. I would def recommend coming when in Chicago.
