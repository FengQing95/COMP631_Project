The Purple Pig////As I explore and learn more about my taste buds and experiences while living, join me on this journey of Mediterranean influenced, tapas style of wonder! We started out with a pig meat platter which included a lot of fancy words describing each cut that I can't remember. Each small plate we ordered came out in random order, they just brought out whatever was made first. We waited an hr to sit and it does seem busy at all hours of the day as we tried last night(Friday night) and were quoted a 4 hr wait time......ridiculous.
