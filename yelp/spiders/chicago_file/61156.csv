Smoque BBQ////I never really order ribs from resturants, but this was by far one of the best ribs i've had in a long time. I waited about 30-40 mins to be seated, but it was well worth it. The Spicy Memphis Bbq Sauce was amazing with the ribs and also the 1/2 chicken. The Mac n Cheese was a great side with the brisket chili. I would go back for sure to try the pulled pork. Also, this place is byob.
