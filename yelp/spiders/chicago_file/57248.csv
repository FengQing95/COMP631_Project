Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've never had tapas before so this was my first experience.... I. WAS. FLOORED. Every single dish we had was perfect. We had the garlic shrimp, beef empanada, spicy potatoes, calamari, and fried chicken with piri-piri sauce! All of them were delicious. We also tried the paella-mixta which was also very good and enough for the 4 of us after all the tapas! We also split the sangria! The passion fruit sangria was my favorite & will be yours too if you like sweeter sangria! A great waiter & a great environment played another amazing part of this excellent experience! I will definitely be returning!
