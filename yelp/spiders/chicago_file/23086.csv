Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've lived 45 miles north of Chicago my whole life, I've grown up on the Chicago style pizza, thin and deep dish, but sadly, I've never had many actual Chicago pizza. Went there today, was blown away. We got the Lou's special, and I never want another pizza again in my life, I was so blown away!
