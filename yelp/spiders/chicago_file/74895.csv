Little Goat Diner////What is there to say that hasn't already been said in the 2K yelp reviews? Aside from the amazing food, the service was also outstanding! Our server took the time to chat with us about the menu and our trip to Chicago. We ordered the crab dip, shrimp & cheesey grits, and the corn beef hash. Granted we came from brunch on a Sunday so it is expected for the kitchen to be backed up. We finished both the crab dip and the shrimp & grits and waited a good 10 minutes before the corn beef hash came. It was definitely worth the wait!
