Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered the Lou's Style Pizza which was amazingly delicious..the only problem is that whoever added the tomatoes put a couple of butt pieces of the tomato in which the core on the top was evident..and it was several pieces like this...pricey pizza should have quality tomatoes??????!!!!!
