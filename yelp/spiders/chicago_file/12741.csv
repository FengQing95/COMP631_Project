Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My bf and I went on a Friday night, and.... we were the sole customers, which I thought was odd. Our server was great and we waited about 30 mins for our pizza (the Lou) to arrive. We were expecting to need a box to take home leftovers because we'd read that while the pie wasn't huge, it was filling. There was no need for a box because the pizza was just that good, and we scarfed it all down (politely, of course). The spinach and mushrooms tasted very fresh and the tomatoes that garnished the pizza were slightly crispy. Plenty of cheese yet it didn't feel too heavy. The crust was nicely buttery.
