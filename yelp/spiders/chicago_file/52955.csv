Smoque BBQ////I'll keep looking for good BBQ in the city of Chicago. To me there was nothing really special about the flavors and taste of the BBQ, not to mention the layout and annoyance that I felt on my first visit wasn't particiularly great either. Still had to wait in the line to pay for my call in order and that was extended because they were training a new girl on the register. Â Yeah, I'm grumpy and not an old man!
