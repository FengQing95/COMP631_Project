Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's came recommended by several Chicago locals and it didn't disappoint. We ordered the small Chicago classic deep dish and we were nervous it would be a heavy meal that made us feel fat but surprisingly, the pizza was deliciously satisfying. We were warned in advance to be expecting a 40-50 minute wait since they make the pizza from scratch so we also ordered some mozarella sticks which were meh. The pizza had this delicious sausage inside of the dough that was so yummy. No wonder even my Uber driver recommended this place. Its a must visit.
