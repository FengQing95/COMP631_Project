Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The service at Lou Manalti's was incredible! Our waitress was extremely helpful and served us all our slices individually, and would constantly come check up on us. This was my first time trying deep dish pizza, and I guess my expectations were different? The flavor was decent but i guess i wasn't too much of a fan of deep dish. and the thin crust pizza tasted like something i could make myself at home. their lasagna was really good though! i got a spinach based one and it was delicious and very flavorful! also, their garlic bread was okay. it wasn't anything too special, like I said something could be made at home. I see why this place is famous since deep dish pizza is unique so i recommend trying it if you're new to or visiting chicago, and maybe you'll like it :-)
