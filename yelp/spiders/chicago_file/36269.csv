Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service: Our waitress took a long time to come by to take our drinks, but we overlooked it. When she arrived to take our order, we had already had plenty of time to look at the menu, so we said we were ready to order. I think she took offense to that because she really didn't come by to speak to us for the rest of our meal. Her assistant/runner/busboy was the main one checking in on us and taking our dessert and coffee orders. He was great. But if I'm gonna drop $40 on a tip, I want my server to at least pretend to be interested in me.
