Smoque BBQ////Supposedly this place is consistently swarming with carnivores, so I came here on a Sunday around noon for lunch. There was practically no line and I placed my order right away. I really appreciated the laid back order-at-the-counter-and-wait-until-your-number-is-called arrangement, as well as the family style seating with all the tables close together in a row. This is what I envision when I come to a BBQ joint.
