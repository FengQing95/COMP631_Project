Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The first time I had Lou's sausage pizza I was impressed about each bite of my slice. The slab of sausage all over the pizza was amazing. Each bite was just an experience that honestly I would say hands down best Chicago pizza experience. Every time i had Lou's pizza I always discover something different about that pizza flavor and yes I love Lou's Pizza!!!
