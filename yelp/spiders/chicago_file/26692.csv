Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Upon arrival, I put my name down for our party of 7 and was told the estimated wait time was an hour and a half (pretty accurate). We were able to pre-order our pizza, so when we were seated it came out pretty quickly. During our wait, we kept track of our place in line via a website that was sent to my phone, which let us wander while waiting. For the 7 of us, we ordered two medium pizzas (one Classic and one Lou).
