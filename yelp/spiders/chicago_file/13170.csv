Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A generous 3 if you ask me, but I only went here for some late night chocolate chip pizza.  Could upgrade the cafeteria style plastic plates, but I can't knock the place too much cause I didn't have the pizza.  Coffee was horrible, so was the server, but it was 10:30 at night...
