The Purple Pig////So yes, I always get the crispy pig's ear here. I just can't get anything like it elsewhere, and the crispiness of the ear batter and the tang from the banana peppers is absolutely addicting. Lol @ "ear batter". Be sure to break the yolk and mix it all together. We also got the smoked pork tongue, which was so tender, smokey, and a little sweet. I loved that it was finished with some char. The lamb ribs were ridiculously rich and tender, and I liked the citrus notes in the garnish. Last but certainly not least, the potato ice cream with caviar is truly a treat. The ice cream is not too sweet, and the pops of salty fish roe is an innovative and delicious pairing. Get this, please!
