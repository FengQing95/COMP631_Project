Smoque BBQ////I ordered the pulled pork combo with 2 side dishes. She got the 1/2 brisket and 1/2 pulled pork and got way more meat than I did! I have never tasted a better mac and cheese in my life. Only problem was that the serving was too small. The pulled pork was really good and so was the brisket.
