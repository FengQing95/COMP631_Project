Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place starts by scoring cool points just with the atmosphere. Sure, there's a wait, but even if reservations are full, you can walk up and put your name in to wait. Head back to the bar (which is also full service) and sip on a boozy cocktail. It'll be temping, but you should skip the apps. We had the baked goat cheese. It was delicious but we regretted putting bread into our tummies before tackling dinner. If you need a little something, they serve divine housemade sourdough with lightly salted butter to keep your mouth happy. The piece de resistance: dry aged, bone in rib eye. Go for the brussel sprout side. We also put the beat on the baked potato. Need a wine for your beef? They have a Chateauneuf du Pape on the menu!
