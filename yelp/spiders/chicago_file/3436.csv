The Purple Pig////Myself and my group decided to come here at about 3 pm on a Sunday afternoon. We were lucky to only have to wait about 15 mins for seats so if you plan to come on a more popular day or time you will need reservations. The seating is mostly community style at a long table, so it can get a little cramped but it is worth it. The atmosphere felt upscale without feeling pretentious. The decor was simple but the pops of color around the dining area caught my eye.
