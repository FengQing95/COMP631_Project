Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ok, I had to separate hype from reality.  I finally tried Lou Malnati's.  I'm happy to report that this pizza lives up to word-of-mouth claims of greatness.  I think it may have dethroned Giordano's in my book.  I love the butter crust and melty cheese.  I can't wait to go back to try the Lou and the Deluxe.
