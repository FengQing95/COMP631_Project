Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you're into crispy deep dish then this place is for you! I got the Chicago deep dish style and tbh, I enjoyed the crust because I like the crisp Â definitely fulfilling. You get to place your name first and then place your order as well so when you get seated, you won't have to wait for the pizza as long. However, I went during 9 pm and no wait; I suggest for those impatient people to do that and just eat later to avoid the hangry-ness.
