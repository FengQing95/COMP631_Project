Art Institute of Chicago////I have been here several times and every time I go I see and learn something new. The museum is huge and if you really want to see everything it has to offer at once, plan on spending the day there (it's very worth it). There are deals for Illinois residents to go for free on certain days, which is awesome! They also have student discounts. Overall it's a beautiful place with so much to see.
