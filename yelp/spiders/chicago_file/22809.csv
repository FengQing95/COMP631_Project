Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Being a New Yorker, I had to stop by Chicago on my way to North Milwaukee, to try some deep dish pizza and see what all the hype was about.  The wait wasn't too bad, 20 minutes.  We ordered the Classic and since it took 30 minutes we ordered the calamari for starters.  I wasn't crazy about their special "cocktail sauce" they paired with the calamari, we just wanted some good old marinara sauce which they brought us eventually (and it was good).  I expected the extra cheese on the pizza to be stringy but it was globs of it instead so I tasted more cheese than anything.  the buttercrust was okay, i guess i like my crust crunchy and not corn mealy (sp?)
