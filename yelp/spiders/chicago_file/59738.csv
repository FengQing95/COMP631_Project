Smoque BBQ////And Smoque can give me those tasty smoked meats. Their St. Louis ribs and pulled pork are what stands out here. Sometimes there ribs are tough and shitty, but that's only happened once. The brisket, chicken, baby back ribs, and sides are all delicious as well. They just don't shine like the pulled pork does.
