Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You think to yourself an Asian girlfriend is not the ideal partner to knock one of these out and she puts you to shame!  The Pizza's crust is unique and perfect in that Chicago way Flaky and buttery! YUM! The CHEESE! I call it stretch armstrong cheese because you can almost bungee jump with it.  It's wonderful, I love it!  The tomatoes and sauce are great as well I'm not a chunky tomato person  The student beats the teacher 5 stars to 4 stars my friends.  The calamari sucked, but I will not hold that against you Lou! I always say when in Rome.  The only way to work off the huge calorie intake that is a chicago style pizza and enjoy is it (well you know!)
