Smoque BBQ////Also, most entrees include a couple sides with the meal and coleslaw. Sides are fries, brisket chili, mac and cheese, cornbread, and beans. I had the chopped brisket with slaw, mac&cheese, and cornbread. MAN OH MAN, the mac&cheese was a small serving but soft, fluffy, and delicious! The cornbread is equivalent to the child of Famous Dave's cornbread (if you know, they have the BEST cornbread ever) with corn inside. Lastly, my food came with a Caroline BBQ sauce & and Memphis style BBQ sauce that i would interchangeably switch back and forth on my brisket. OOOO baby, it was a good, quick bite that came out pretty quick! Mark my word, I'll be back to get some of those good good ribs i saw others had.
