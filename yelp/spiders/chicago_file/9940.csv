Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago is a MUST SEE when visiting the city. Each floor is packed full of intriguing artwork and, for the most part, it's pretty easy to navigate & find your way from one exhibit to the next. The modern wing (specifically on the third floor in the "new contemporary" area) & the impressionist wing were particularly amazing. Absolutely worth the cost of admission & a great way to spend 4 or 5 hours. The employees were friendly and helpful when we needed help with navigation and had questions about the artwork.
