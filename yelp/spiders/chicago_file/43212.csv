Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here before, great service and amazing food. I came here tonight and I can't even get seated when I had a reservation and everything. the reservation was for 7:30 and we were not seated until 8:05 - with no apologizes or updates while we waited. we waited 35 minutes for a reservation. just told to stand in the corner. what's the point of a reservation if you're just going to stand around and be ignored?
