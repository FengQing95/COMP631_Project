The Purple Pig////I finally got to @thepigchicago and boy does it live up to the hype! We had cocktails while we waited for a spot on the patio to open up. We had great service and got to know the couples at the tables beside us (and ask all about what they ordered). Our favorites were the beets with pistachio butter (do not miss this!), polenta, and marshmallow fluff-peanut butter mille feuille. The pics didn't turn out great, but it was worth it to eat on the patio in perfect weather. Can't recommend highly enough.
