Little Goat Diner////Really loved grabbing lunch at Little Goat!  The service was slow (granted, they are SUPER busy always) but they were really friendly.  The food was amazingly delicious.  We got nachos for the table (SO DELICIOUS, get these to share!), I ordered a patty melt (amazingly good - everything about it was to die for) and I ended the meal with a 'choco taco' which is like a deconstructed ice cream taco that users sour cream ice cream and will blow your mind with your uniquely amazing it is.  Just trust me and get it.
