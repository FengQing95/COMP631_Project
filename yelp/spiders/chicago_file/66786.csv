Little Goat Diner////I don't mnd waiting for a table and understand that busy hours = a lot of work but I felt like our server kept forgetting that we were her table. The first dish was brought to our table. We were done eating by time our server came over the explain to us what sauces were served with it... we had to ask for refills on coffee. If my glass is clearly empty I'm not sure why I need to ask if I can have more. Then our entrees came... well all but one. The other food was cold by time the missing dish came. With no apology or explnation. We sat and waited then she came to our table with a confused look and said, "Oh..." then walked away.
