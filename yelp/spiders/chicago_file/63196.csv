Smoque BBQ////Our neighborhood bbq spot! This place has some of the best bbq in Chicago. I usually order the chopped brisket platter with two sides and coleslaw which is a vinegar base. Highly recommend the macaroni and cheese because it has a baked crumb topping then the cornbread. They are large servings, so be sure you're ready to eat! It's family style eating and easy to come with large groups if you don't all want to be on the same check. Very friendly staff as well who frequently clean the tables and direct you to an open spot!
