Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The only thing disappointing was their inability to split charges on toppings for half and half orders. So if you ordered a pizza with one half pep/sausage and the other tomatoes/peppers you would be actually charged for four toppings. As for their appetizers it was mediocre from the selection I made.
