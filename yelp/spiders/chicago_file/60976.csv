Smoque BBQ////I've ordered from here several times for family birthday parties--i.e. when my son turned five or daughter turned three.  It's definitely a crowd pleaser. I had about 20 people (12 or so adults and 8 kids) -- and over ordered the first time.  When I ordered again--I got it right:  3 lbs each of the beef brisket and pulled pork, 1 order of mac and cheese (1/2 a pan), a quart of beans, a quart of slaw and some buns.  We made our own green salad at home, and it was plenty!  I paid a little extra to pick up the food in packaging to keep it warm--which I thought was worth it.  All in, it cost under $200. They have a catering menu and department to make things easy. I would definitely recommend them to make family or large group gatherings more simple and stress free--and to get lots of compliments too.  The best part is when there are leftovers!
