Smoque BBQ////Mac & Cheese - By far THE best I've ever eaten!!! I don't know how many times anywhere I've had Mac & Cheese somewhere else and thought it was a disappointment, to the point I felt cheap ol' Kraft Mac & Cheese way still better than any "home made" Â I've had anywhere,.. but Smoques Mac & Cheese fucking RULES!!! its got this nice bread crumb crust that just makes it!,... so insanely good,to the point you may even stop in JUST for that.
