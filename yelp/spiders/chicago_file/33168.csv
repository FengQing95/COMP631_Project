Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////- Classic Ribeye Chicago Cut w/bone marrow: I'd read less than superlative things about the steak here, but this was a really darn solid effort, cooked perfectly medium-rare. The steak salt that comes with it must be laced with crack cocaine, and before we left, the busboy slipped me some to go on the sly, bless his heart. But when the best thing about a steak is the seasoning, something's not exactly doing its job.
