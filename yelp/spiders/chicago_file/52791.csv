Smoque BBQ////For those who do not know..the STL  (Saint Louis) is a squared spare rib cut.  It makes a uniform cut..but it was what the pitmasters @ Smoque did to that was crazy good. Of the 3 who normally favored -- baby back ribs...we all admitted that the STL cut..was the best pork rib we had tasted in our 35-40 years.  It  was as close as one could achieve to bacon..in BBQ. We had to order an extra rack to satisfy everyone when a 1/2 slab was adequate for one.
