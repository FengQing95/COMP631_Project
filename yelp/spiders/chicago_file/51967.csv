Smoque BBQ////We ventured to Smoque on a Monday, walked in and were graced with the heavenly smell of smoked meat. Looking at the sides, I decided I wanted to try everything--a side of beans, corn bread, french fries, and a small salad should be more than enough for this vegetarian. My boyfriend ordered the sliced brisket platter with mac and cheese and cornbread--We also opted to add the 1/4 slab of STL ribs. Food arrived at the table in just a few minutes, and we were both silenced by the deliciousness.
