Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We have been there multiple times and every time our experience is fantastic. Good food, great drinks, classic ambiance. Carol Ann is amazing! She makes tasty cocktails and was fun to talk to when we sat at the bar last time. Definitely order the mushrooms, they are so good! Highly recommend!
