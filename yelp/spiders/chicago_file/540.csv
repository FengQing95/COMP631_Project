Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I had sucha great experience eating here. I was visiting for a week and had brunch here two times in my week long stay. The Food was fantastic, the service was superb, the food was affordable, and the resturant was clean. The only down fall is the wait to be seated, but its worth it. thank you wildberry for the experience.
