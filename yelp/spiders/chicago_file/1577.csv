Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Extremely attentive service. Generous portions. Everything was very tasty!! We got the corned beef Benny and the brisket hash. Both were fantastic. The waitress suggested the pancake to be multigrain with blueberry (no glaze). She was right on point and we fully enjoyed our pancakes! Coffee and lattes are great. We would change nothing about the experience!
