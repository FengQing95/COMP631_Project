Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So we sat down and immediately were in awe of the vintage rat pack decor/music.  Totally set the mood from the old school jazz to the dim lighting and brick walls.   We started with some elijah craig old fashions which were perfect and had a spice to them which we have yet to decipher what the spice was. We ordered the oysters, so fresh, so delicious.  Both of us decided on the 16oz chicago cut ribeye.  Perfectly cooked. No need at all for the steak seasoning they give you on the side or the bearnaise sauce.   The seasoning was just right.  We also ordered a side of truffle mac n cheese (better than mine and that hurts me to admit) and roasted broccoli.  We were in caloric heaven.
