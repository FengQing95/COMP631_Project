Smoque BBQ////The Boy did good.  I mean, REALLY GOOD.  We ordered baby back ribs and the brisket platter.  I took one bite and it was OVER.  I shared a rib or two and then it was ALL MINE.  The ribs have a decent amount of meat so that kept me quiet (haha) and the sauces were tasty!  The brisket was tender and perfectly smoked.  Overall, we were super happy with our meal.
