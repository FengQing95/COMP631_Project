Little Goat Diner////Just got back from Little Goat Diner. I ordered the Crispy Creole Chicken sandwich, it does not come with fries, which is actually a good thing.  Most of the time when you order a sandwich or burger, fries are included. But, I've come to realize that I don't really need them.  Anyway, the sandwich was hot, temparature wise and hot, pepperwise.  I really enjoyed it.  It's just a wonderful sandwich.  My wife got the Los Drowned, which is a take on the classic French Dip sandwich, she was generous enough to let me have a taste. Just like my sandwich, hers was flavorful and on super soft, fresh bread.  We also ordered muffins, which were slightly above average.  Little Goat Diner is a gem, I can't wait to go back and try more of the offerings.
