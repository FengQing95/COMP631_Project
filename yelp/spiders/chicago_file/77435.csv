Little Goat Diner////Okay so onto the food! I started with a cup of coffee which I have to say is one of the best tasting coffees I've had in a while. It was rich and I probably could have enjoyed it without any milk. Â I decided on the Bullseye French Toast thanks to all the fabulous reviews from my fellow Yelpers. This French Toast did not disappoint. It is made with sweet onion brioche, a sunny little egg is baked in which I some how missed in all the reviews I read so imagine my surprise! The toppings were crispy chicken and strawberries with a drizzle of BBQ maple syrup. The brioche was cooked perfectly which I'm grateful for because sometimes French Toast is a bit chewy or dry. The chicken and BBQ maple syrup were a nice twist and paired well with the strawberries.
