Smoque BBQ////So when you first get there, get in line to order (you'll see the line when you get there....and there's ALWAYS a line) and afterwards someone will assign you a table.  Don't try and grab a table before you order or you will mess up their whole seating system....I don't know how they manage to do it but it works every time :)  The longest we've had to wait was about half an hour and that was when the line went back to the door so not too bad.
