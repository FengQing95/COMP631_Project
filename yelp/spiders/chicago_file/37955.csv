Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Elote Style Corn: chili, lime, cilantro, and parmesan.  I'm always reluctant to order elote style corn from any restaurant because it never tastes the same as the street vendors and it is just way more expensive.  But everyone was telling me that I had to try it here, so I again went against my gut and ordered the corn.  It definitely didn't taste like the authentic elote, but Bavatte's spin on it was still good.  The corn was creamy and the lime and chili gave it an extra zing.
