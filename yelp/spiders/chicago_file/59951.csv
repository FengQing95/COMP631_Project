Smoque BBQ////Words can't describe how good the pulled pork and the chopped brisket sandwiches are.  If you've had bad bbq before you know that theyre usually really chewy and dry even with a good douse of bbq sauce.  Totally NOT the case here.....the meat almost literally melts in your mouth, so tender, so juicy, so perfectly delectable that I think I ended up eating twice the amount of food I usually consume in one sitting.  They have a half brisket half pulled pork sandwich in case you cant decide but if I had to pick one I would most definitely go with the brisket because it was a little more flavorful.
