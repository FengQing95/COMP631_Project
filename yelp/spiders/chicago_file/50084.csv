Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Kind of pricey for what they offer. The food was delicious and the drinks were tasty and strong! The waiter was timely and service was okay. Nothing bad, nothing great. Average. Would have been 4 stars if it wasn't so pricey. Be careful! Their prices seem good but it's actually just mini-servings.
