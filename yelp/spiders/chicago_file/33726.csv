Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Speaking of the staff, they are delightful and unflappable.  My dad has quite poor vision these days, especially in low light.  With how dark this place is, you definitely need a few minutes for your eyes to adjust.  Long story short, we ran into some new friends of ours when we arrived for our reservation and my dad (to my dismay) decided he was going to get a picture with them. Flash and all.  In the middle of the floor of the busy, crowded, dark restaurant.  I was trying to get him to stop, but the waitstaff were incredibly kind and even helped him get a picture.  Kudos to all of you there for being so accommodating -- you earned every penny of my unusually large tip.
