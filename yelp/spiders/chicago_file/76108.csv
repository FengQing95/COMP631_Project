Little Goat Diner////I am a huge fan of Little Goat and came here a ton when it first opened as Stephanie Izard is one of my favorite Chicago chefs, never realized I never wrote a review -- but I've tried plenty of the items such as the brendade and pork belly, bull's eye french toast, crab dip, chili, sloppy goat and many others (that may have since rotated off the menu?). I love the atmosphere of this place, a very friendly diner, very approachable and casual. Sometimes there's a wait, but usually it's bearable as they have a lot of seating.
