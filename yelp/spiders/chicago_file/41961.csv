Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Good stuff. Good stuff. Food came out really quickly and was really really good. The watiress kind of had an attitude, Â but whatever. My one pet peeve is that I felt that it was too hot (I was roasting the entire time!) and it was really really loud. But overall good. The sangria was really good, and the cheese plate was good. Not overrated as some people have said. I'd go again.
