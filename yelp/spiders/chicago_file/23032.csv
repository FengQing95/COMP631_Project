Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Yes, it's a tourist trap.  Yes, the people around you will act like they've never waited in a line before.  Yes, the wait will take at least 45-60 minutes.  The good news:  they use that time to cook your food since deep dish pizza takes a minute.  And this pizza is really, really good.  Five of us (swimmers, so we can eat) had the spinach salad, a medium Lou and a small classic and left two slices on the pan.  It was a TON of food, but we left full and happy.
