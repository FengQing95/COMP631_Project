Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here on a wednesday afternoon to try some Chicago pizza. I was not disappointed as I had the classic and the Lou. Both were fantastic and the drinks there decent. The service was fast and friendly and I got to engage in good conversation about pizza with the locals and explained why NYC pizza is better, however I was met with resistance and bias. This is the great thing about Chicago, the people love their city and it truly shows. The prices were decent and the location fantastic
