Little Goat Diner////Food is inventive and flavorful--on the creamy side. You won't be disappointed if you like novelty. For dessert I got the SMOKED PORK AND TOFFEE CRUNCH MILKSHAKE. Yes, you heard right. I kept fishing around trying to find the salty pork bits, which I definitely tasted, but they mix it into the shake very well.
