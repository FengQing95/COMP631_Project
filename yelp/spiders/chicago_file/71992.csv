Little Goat Diner////I went with the veggie burger Korean style - with kimchi and a sunny side egg on top with spicy mayo.  Delicious.  A great veggie burger (potato based and not grainy at all) and even better kimchi added to a super soft bun.  Once I popped the egg yolk, there was no way I was eating this thing with my hands.  My husband ordered the french toast that consisted of a fried egg INSIDE the bread that blew his mind.  The combination of fried chicken with strawberries and syrup blended to perfection.  We got a side of tempura mashed potatoes that were very unique and tasty, but quite honestly the fries were better.  Our other friend ordered the corned beef hash that was excellent as well.
