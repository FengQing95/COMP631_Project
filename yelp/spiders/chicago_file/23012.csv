Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A short easy 5 minute wait, warm comfortable, cozy atmosphere, friendly service from everyone (whether we were their table or not) and great tasting, high quality, good sized, outstanding food!! Not sure how I could be impressed with a house salad, but I was. It was big, fresh, tomatoes were diced and bright red and juicy and the ranch here is fantastic!  The pizza??? Stellar!!!! Had a "Lou" with spinach, mushroom and tomatoes.  Fresh, hot, delicious!!!! I want to try other places, but I know this place has set the bar **high** and I'm positive no matter which others I try, I'll be back to Lou's!!!
