Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////mehhh. This pizza tasted good, but it was definitely not worth the wait. It took us over an hour to get seated and after that, it took almost another hour for our pizza to come out (this was AFTER we had put in our order when we had first walked into the restaurant). After all of that wait, I expected to bite into the best pizza I've ever eaten in my life. Let's just say the pizza definitely did not meet those expectations.
