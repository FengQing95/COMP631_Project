Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The food here is phenomenal. I got the fresca omlette with chicken sausage which came with fuit and pancakes. The best pancakes I've had in a long time!! It was like cake - so good! Â The omlette was fantastic as well - must get with the chicken sausage though or it's not the same.
