The Purple Pig////This restaurant has been on my list for a few years and I was surprised by the number of veggie options. Unfortunately it was a tad chilly and we were seated outdoors with no heat lamp so that was a bummer. But the restaurant was packed at 530pm and they don't take reservations so this speaks volume!
