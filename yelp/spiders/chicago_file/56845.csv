Smoque BBQ////RIBS: wash yo hands because they so good, you'll smack yo mama. Excellent dry rub that isn't too salty like 98 percent of ribs. Seriously slow cooked as they must be. How can one tell? Put your plastic silverware down and pick it up like you're supposed to. Hold it by one end. Does it seem top heavy because it leans and perhaps even cracks and breaks in two. Of great importance, of all meats ribs are the easiest to cheat on. From this point forward, look at the fat on the exterior and between bones. Should be about 2O percent max. Score 9
