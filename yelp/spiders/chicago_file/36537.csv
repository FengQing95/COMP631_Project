Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It was hard deciding which appetizer to start off with. So upon recommendation from our waitress, we decided on the peppered duck & goat cheese terrine, which she mentioned was a staff favorite that was often overlooked by guests. This appetizer was presented in more of a pâté fashion, with a side of apricot mustard and toast. The combination, especially with the apricot spread, was absolute delectable & a must try!
