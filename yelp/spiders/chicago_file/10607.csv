Art Institute of Chicago////How long you need: If you can, I would get there when they open and leave when they close. The museum is 3 floors filled with thousands of exhibits, painting, and art. Even if you spent the whole day there, it would not be enough time to see everything. If you are on a tight schedule, the museum guide has a 1 hour speed through that tells you which things you should hit up.
