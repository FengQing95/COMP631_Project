The Purple Pig////Wow! I had always heard about the purple Pig and it did live up to its reputation. We went at an odd time on a Saturday so we were luckily able to be seated straight away. Our waiter explained the format of the menue that most things you share a few plates. After some debate over what to get as everything looked so good we choose three main items. We started off with the pig ears, ricotta gnocchi with pork shoulder, and stuffed squid. They also have a cheese menu and we were super close to choosing a braised meat that looked amazing! They also had plenty of veggie options to choose from. To our surprise the squid came out first and it was beautifully plated. The squid was stuffed with this amazing creation and served with mushed favas and thr most amazing pesto. Each bite of the squid was cooked to perfection. The pig ears were served with egg and kale. Also very good and would be better with beer. Those two items came out super quick. However, it took a much longer time for our gnocchi to come...so much so we thought they may have forgotten it. Eventually it did come and was well worth the wait. The most tender and tasty gnocchi is the most favorable sauce and meat cooked so tenderly. We loved our meal so mu h we actually ended up ordering dessert which we never do. Amazing menu with several different items to  choose.  We went with the brown sugar cheese cakes topped with pomegranate. This was so rich and decadent. Very well done! I really hope we can come back again.
