Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My boyfriend and I met his sister, brother in-law, and parents here on a Saturday night around six a few months back. It was our first time at a Â tapas restaurant and our waiter was so patient and explained how the meal generally went. He also took his time describing the different options and what was spicy and not etc. Everything I tried was delicious. Between the six of us I think we tried just about everything on the menu. Their alcoholic drinks are a bit light on the alcohol but still tasty.
