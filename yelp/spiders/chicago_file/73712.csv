Little Goat Diner////What has happened to Little Goat? We haven't been in a while but decided to go this morning for breakfast. It was early so they weren't very busy, but we still had to wait to order for what seemed like 15 minutes after we were seated. I watched my husband's dish sit on the counter for a full 6 minutes before a runner came and slammed it down on our table. It was lukewarm at best. My dish showed up with hard fried eggs despite having ordered them over easy. The overall attitude of the staff seemed preoccupied, nothing like we've enjoyed over the years. Hugely disappointing.
