Little Goat Diner////I had to think long and hard to choose my main course and debated heavily between the breakfast spaghetti, the brandade and eggs, and the corned beef hash. My server, Patrick, helped me narrow it down with a good description of the spaghetti and brandade but after seeing a few plates of hash leave the kitchen I feel he sold that one a bit short when he described it to me. I will definitely be back though and the hash is on my short list of things to try.
