Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered a Malnati Chicago Classic with the buttercrust.  How can you not order buttercrust if it's an option on the menu?  I suppose Malnati's qualifies as a deep dish, it's certainly not a thin crust, but it's literally about as half as thick as the deep dish found at Giordano's.  Though I believe Malnati's uses better quality ingredients than Giordano's, as in the tomatoes and cheese, yet in my opinion I feel Giordano's puts out a better overall deep dish pizza.  It may just be the crust here as it really disappointed me.  I ordered their famous buttercrust but the crust of my pizza was far from moist and buttery as it was actually a bit dry, very crisp and definitely required the use of a knife and a little bit of elbow grease to cut through.
