Art Institute of Chicago////This is a great place, for both tourists and locals alike. They have very rich collections from all over the world, and you would need much longer than a day to even walk around. Very well curated collections, makes you feel part of a different era. Staff is friendly and helpful. Also very efficient in signing in guests, short lines and even text you when it's your turn. Strongly recommended.
