Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We arrived and had to wait about 30 min, but they were nice enough to take our order while we waited, so we didn't have to wait too long after we were seated to eat - Score!   Street parking is difficult, so take public transport, or find a local lot.  Atmosphere is nice, they have a couple of different rooms with booths and regular tables.  Service is always pretty good here.
