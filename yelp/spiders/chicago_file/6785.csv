Art Institute of Chicago////I prefer to visit this museum on my own but I took my 7 and 9 year old for the first time this year and they loved it as well.  It's a different thing with young kids and here are my observations.  Take advantage of the Coat check-its free and you don't want to be lugging a coat around and they won't let you bring a big bag in.  We started in the Impressionist area and I simply asked them to pick out their favorite picture in the room and to tell me why.  This engaged them.  They also loved the miniature rooms and the children's hands on area.  They did not care for the modern art wing as it was a bit "scary" with some of the darker images there.  Let them lead the way from room to room with the map.  You won't see everything but you may gain a new perspective.  Let them buy a postcard of their favorite afterward and do lunch at Bennigan's across the street or if you brought a picnic enjoy the Bean.
