Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is now my favorite deep dish pizza place. I used to think it was Gino's East, but I was so wrong. We came to Lou's on a Friday afternoon and sat outside on their patio. My husband and I both had drinks and ended up splitting one of Lou's pepperoni deep dish pizzas and a ceasar salad. The combo was perfect and it was just the right amount of food portions for each of us.
