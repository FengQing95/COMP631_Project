The Purple Pig////The one thing that was out of this world great was the whipped feta appetizer. That had incredible flavor, however the dipping bread to whipped feta ratio was way off, not anywhere near enough bread. They did bring us more bread upon asking and later charged us $1 for it which is a little silly.
