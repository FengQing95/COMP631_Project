Smoque BBQ////at smoque the menu is simple, so its easy to try all the things offered. the baby back ribs and brisket is our usual choice (platters of course), the meat is tender and juicy, but the bbq sauce is super vinegary for my taste. i would prefer if it was sweeter.. Â the half chicken looks juicy, the texas sausage is a bit boring compared to the other meats.
