Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My friend who lives in Chicago loves this place, mainly because it's still stylish and cute inside but it's not in the all time busy downtown area (about 10-15 min drive from there). Located in Lincoln Park community, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! was super busy on a Friday evening, with different ages crowd. The wait for a table was 1.5 hours, but luckily you can order off the main menu at the bar as well. We were there around 8 pm and were barely able to snag the last 2 seats at the bar. This place offers a variety of Spanish tapas. If you order a paella, make sure you specify for how many people. It was two of us and they must have assumed we ordered paella for two and boy was it A LOT of it! My favorite part of the evening was the passion fruit sangria - it was DELISH! Very easy to drink too hahaha
