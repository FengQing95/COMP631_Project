Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Their tapas style menu was a de-glorified American version of it - portions are definitely not what you would consider "classic" Spanish tapas portions. Their patatas bravas which is your basic tapas dish was cut up like American french fries and I could barely taste the so-called "spicy" aioli sauce. Salmon was way overcooked as was our beef tenderloin smeared with an overpowering curdled blue cheese. Sick! The cheese plate was absolutely nothing to write home about. When you order a cheese platter, you're perhaps preparing yourself to be wow-ed by a new cheese that you've never had. They gave us some crappy goat's milk cheese with olives dancing about in it. They might as well have just given us a dish of olive tapenade to spoon into our mouths, because you couldn't taste any of the cheese.
