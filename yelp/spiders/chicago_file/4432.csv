The Purple Pig////Runner-up to best dish of the evening was this whimsical cold plate which was JUST as awesome as it sounds.  The potato ice cream was unlike anything we'd ever tasted and reminded us of the "french fries" liquid nitrogen dish from our meal at EL Ideas.  The crème fraîche atop the striking purple chips was a snazzy touch.
