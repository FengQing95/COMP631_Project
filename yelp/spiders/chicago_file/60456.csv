Smoque BBQ////This is the best BBQ place in Chicago, hands-down.  Phenomenal food.  Smoque clearly beats my previous best-BBQ choice, Rudy's (Texas).  The Smoque website has an essay on their BBQ philosophy that made me salivate like Pavlov's dog.  If you are even remotely interested in top-notch BBQ this restaurant is a must-visit....immediately.  Rather than repeating the accolades over and over, suffice to say that everything on the menu is best-in-class.
