Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were given a pager that also includes an app that shows you were you are in line and after approximately 25-30 minutes, we were seated. Our waiter took our order for other items, and we sat salivating and waiting for our first taste of Chicago deep dish pizza. As we sipped on our Italian Margarita's (which are delicious), the pizza finally arrived. Another waiter cut up the pizza for us and got us all set up. To be honest, the pizza was quite good (the ooey gooey cheese and the sausage), but I gotta say one of our LA gems of a restaurant might have them beat. That said, we weren't disappointed at all and were glad we could visit this famed Chicago restaurant.
