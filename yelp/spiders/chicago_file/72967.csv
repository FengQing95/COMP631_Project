Little Goat Diner////I'm a fan of Randolph street solely because of its exotic and diverse culinary scene, including Little Goat diner! I have to say, I was more than eager to try it out and had very high expectation, mostly from friends' recommendation and terrific online reviews. So when my friend had a short and sweet transit in Chicago on her way back to WI, I suggested Little Goat for breakfast. My bf and I got to the place at about 9 am, didn't realize that most parking on Randolph is valet, so we did meter parking on Washington street, less than 2 blocks away, and saved $14. My friend was already there, so we got seated almost immediately. Don't get me wrong, the place was almost packed, so if we had gotten there closer to brunch time, I'm sure we would wait a little longer.
