Art Institute of Chicago////Check out their website for listings of their free days, although these tend to be very busy days.  We visited before noon on a Friday, and there was no line to get in.  When we left, there was a short line to collect our checked belongings.  You can check coats and bags here for $1/item which is worth it so you don't have to lug things around.  The museum gift shop is worth a look, there are a lot of home items, sticker booklets, coffee mugs and jewelry that I could've went wild on!
