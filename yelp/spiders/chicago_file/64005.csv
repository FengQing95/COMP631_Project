Smoque BBQ////I'm a sucker for brisket (fatty, please) so I got the plate with mac & cheese and cornbread and my bf got the pulled pork plate with baked beans and cornbread (bty, it automatically comes with coleslaw). Now, I've had my fair share of brisket and I had a local New Orleans favorite that unfortunately closed due to a family illness but Smoque BBQ ranks right up there with my local favorite. I will say this, being a southern chick, I know good mac & cheese and cornbread when I taste it, and theirs is pretty darn good. We each were given 2 different sauces with our plate and we both preferred the tomato based sauce over the vinegar based sauce.
