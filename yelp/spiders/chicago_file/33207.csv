Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////1) Duck and Goat Cheese Terrine: This was a fantastic appetizer to start the meal off with. There were two generous slices of Terrine served with three thick cut pieces of freshly baked bread. The duck paired nicely with the goat cheese and reached perfection with the apricot mustard spread that was served alongside the terrine. The contrast of flavors along with the crunch of the bread made this a truly memorable appetizer. For those who are "iffy" about duck, this wasn't gamey in the slightest and I'd highly recommend giving it a try.
