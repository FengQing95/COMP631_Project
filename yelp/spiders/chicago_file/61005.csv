Smoque BBQ////First time here. Â Plenty of menu choices and the prices are decent. I had the pulled pork and sampled some ribs. Absolutely fantastic flavor. The ribs were Smokey and tender. It came with Memphis and Carolina style sauce, both were perfect. There is some seating outside if the weather is nice. Its right off highway 90, easy to get to.
