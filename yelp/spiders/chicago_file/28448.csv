Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So - caveat . . . I am not a fan of Chicago style pizza.  I just do not do the deep.  That being said, I was pretty happy with the pizza we got here.  We opted for the butter crust to add some calories and make it crisper.  What I liked about this was that the crust wasn't crazy doughy like some other deep dish places and the toppings didn't make some wet spongy mess.
