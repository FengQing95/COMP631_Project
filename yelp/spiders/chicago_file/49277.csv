Smoque BBQ////The family and I really enjoyed this great BBQ joint.   I had a sliced brisket basket, and thought the meat was the best I've had in a long time.  I tried a sample of my family's ribs and sausage.  The meat was extremely well prepared and delicious, though the ribs weren't as tender as I've had elsewhere.  The meat is definitely the main event here -- and it was wonderfully well smoked and delicious.
