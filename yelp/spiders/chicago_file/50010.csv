Smoque BBQ////i have to say that the meat was pretty good, except i thought the sausage was a little lacking in flavor...the baked beans were good but a little sweet for my taste. the mac n cheese was good as was the mayo-less coleslaw. the cornbread muffin was rather moist and tasty and the cobbler was decent. overall it was a good meal if i keep in mind that their thing is BBQ and all the other stuff is just bells and whistles. i would def go back though, glad to get this one off the bookmarks!
