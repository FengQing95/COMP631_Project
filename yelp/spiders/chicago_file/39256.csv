Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is your vintage Chicago steakhouse - good, homey atmosphere and excellent food. Would highly recommend a reservation, as the place tends to fill up quickly and even the bar / waiting area gets crowded on most nights. The meal starts off with arguably the best sourdough bread I've ever had - seriously, would have been content just eating slices the whole night. The NYC strip on the bone was delicious - perfectly cooked with good flavor. Our table split several of the family-style sides which is definitely the way to go as they would be large for a single person. The side highlights were the creamed corn (has a little kick to it) and the brussel sprouts (great flavor overall).
