Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Just finished a visit at Lou's with a buddy while on a business trip.  A 12 min walk from the Hyatt, we arrived at 4:20 and were offered the bar or a seat and promptly received  the menus.  Staff was courteous and gave recommendations if asked.  I had the Classic Chicago, my buddy the deep dish Cheese and Roni.  30 min later the pies arrived and the combination of a a flavorful and generous sauce, the great cheese, and the crisp, buttery crust did it for me.  Not too greasy, not too "healthy" but just right. The small (9") could have been shared by both of us but as it was,  we ate our individual pies until we were stuffed and each took a piece home.  Would actually have rated it a 5 star except the beer menu  was fairly limited but after all,  it is a pizza parlor!   You can't miss at Lou's so give it a shot.
