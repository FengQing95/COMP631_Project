Smoque BBQ////I've tried Smoque a couple of times and don't really see why everybody raves about it. . The food was very good  but not overwhelmingly great. The service seems disconnected, customers are turned in and out without much interaction. Not very petsonable.  I prefer Rub's Backcountry Smokehouse on Western & Lunt.
