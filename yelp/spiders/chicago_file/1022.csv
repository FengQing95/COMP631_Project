Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I went with my family for breakfast and was expecting it would be good for being downtown. I was disappointed, the corn beef hash had a odor to it. The hash browns were burnt. My toast was cold. And the service was poor. I understand they were busy but presentation still counts.
