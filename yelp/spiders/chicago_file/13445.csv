Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Finally our deep dish arrived.  We ordered the small personal pizzas, however next time we would simply order a small or medium pizza.  After having the larger deep dish a couple of nights later, it does taste different than the personal pizza size for some odd reason.  Not sure why, but we found this to be the case.  We ordered the Malnati Chicago classic and the cheese deep dish.  Both were awesome.  A couple of things that I noticed about the Malnati Chicago Classic, which was my favorite!  They make the pizza on their famous buttercrust...its fantastic.  The sauce that they use on their pizzas is awesome as well.  Not too sweat, and they don't flood the pizza with sauce.  This has always been one of my complaints with many other pizza places.  They actually put on the toppings before the sauce, so the crust stays nice and crispy.  The sausage had a mild seasoning on it, but just enough to add good flavor to the pizza, however its not overpowering.
