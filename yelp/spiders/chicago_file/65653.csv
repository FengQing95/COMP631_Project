Smoque BBQ////We do love good barbecue and have been anxious to check Smoque out since we moved to Chicago. Their ribs and brisket are really delicious, perfectly cooked and deserving of the 4 stars. Have I had better? Yes, but not by a lot. So that's a win. Cute little barbecue shack type look where you order and pick up your food at the counter. It looks like it could get really busy & crowded in there.
