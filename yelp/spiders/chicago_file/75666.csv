Little Goat Diner////GOAT ALMIGHTY: we set the night on Au Cheval but we ended up getting a burger bigger than our heads. My first goat experience was amazing and this was absolutely delicious. What really brings it together is the salsa verde. The acidity woks very well with the rich menage of pork, goat, and beef.
