Smoque BBQ////Smoque provided the dinner at our wedding, and it was delicious! Peggy helped us finalize our menu, and made sure our buffet had a variety of sides and protein. Maria supported our wedding day-of, and made sure that everything went smoothly. Smoque even let us borrow a sign holder so that we could make sure all of our signage was consistent (we had two catering companies). Our guests LOVED the food - the brisket was a HUGE hit. Peggy and Maria are so incredible and made sure we felt special. This team is amazing, and we can't wait to be back for our next meal at Smoque.
