Smoque BBQ////-  THE BREAD PUDDING OH MY GOD OH  MY GOD. I wouldn't say that this is a traditional bread pudding - because it's not - and so it cannot be directly compared with those fresh from the South, but that's what makes this so amazing. It tastes like a pecan pie with a bourbon kick, with the soft and smooth texture of a bread pudding on the inside, with a pie-like textured crust. Different, but in a great way!
