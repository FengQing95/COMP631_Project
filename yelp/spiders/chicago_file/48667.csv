Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I lived down the street from Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba for four years and walked by it every day without going in. Turns out a bachelorette party was the reason that I would come to know the true excellence of Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba. When I called ahead to make a reservation for 9, the staff was a pleasure to work with. Our table was set up and ready to go when we arrived.
