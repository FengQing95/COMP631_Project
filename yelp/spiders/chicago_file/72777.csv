Little Goat Diner////You can make reservations in advance or walk-in, but plan the night accordingly cause there's always a wait. If you want to eat at 7 as a walk in, I'd recommend arriving to Little Goat at 5:30 with plans to grab drinks before at one of the many bars in the area. The hosts are happy to take your cell number and text you when your table is ready.
