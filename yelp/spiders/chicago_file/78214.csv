Little Goat Diner////Do not. I repeat, do not miss the chance to have breakfast at Little Goat (or lunch or dinner). Look up the story of Stephanie Izard from Top Chef. I'm inspired by her restaurants, Â atmosphere and unique flavor creations (and I usually am not into unique flavor creations). But, this was an all-time top breakfast spot.
