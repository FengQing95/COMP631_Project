Art Institute of Chicago////John Hughes references aside, The Art Institute is full of fabulous treasures.You should be sure to visit the Thorne Minature Rooms gallery in the basement level. This is a little known collection of doll housed sized rooms ranging from the 1500s through the 1940s and spanning American, European, and Asian cultures. They are works of painstaking detail and every time you view them you will see something new.
