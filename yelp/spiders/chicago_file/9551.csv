Art Institute of Chicago////Unfortunately, the museum owns no paintings by my favorite artist, Pieter Bruegel the Elder.  However, they have plenty else to capture my fancy, such as a few each of El Greco and Delacroix, two of my lesser favorites.  To cite just a few, I also love Milton Dictating to His Daughter by Henry Fuseli, The Eruption of Vesuvius by Pierre-Jacques Volaire, and the set of four huge canvases by Hubert Robert which depict contemporary Italian peasants going about their daily lives amidst vast Roman-era ruins (The Fountains, The Obelisk, The Old Temple, and The Landing Place).
