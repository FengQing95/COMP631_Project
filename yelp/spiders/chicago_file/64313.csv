Smoque BBQ////So I'm not exactly sure what all the hype is about. In Texas these types of places are all over the place and I suppose its a novelty to have on in Chicago. With that out of the way the food is not all that incredible. Is it good BBQ? Absolutely, but I can find at least 5 comparable sliced brisket places in Chicago. I was not blown out of the water.
