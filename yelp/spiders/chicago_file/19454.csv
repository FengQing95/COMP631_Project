Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I LOVE PIZZA and finally made my way to Chicago. Had been dying to try acutal chicago deep dish pizza as i've mostly been a NY Pizza kind of guy. It was definitely good but...not amazingly mind blowing? maybe it got hyped up too much but it just was OK to me. Would definitely recommend it if you're visiting Chicago. If you're a fan of knife and fork pizza it's perfect but I like eating with my hands.
