Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Deep dish pizza is a classic Chicago experience.  If you are visiting Chicago, this is the place to go for deep dish.  Be prepared for a long line as the place was full when I went there on a Friday night and my guest and I were 33rd in line when we got there.  The line moves quickly, but 33rd means you are waiting.  You have the option to pre order your pizza.  Since deep dish takes 30+ minutes to cook, this is a good idea so you aren't waiting once you get a table.  The restaurant is very good with their timing so they get the pizza cooking before you are seated but isn't done until you are seated so it comes out quickly and piping hot.
