Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba has an extensive menu, mostly all tapas style. We ordered the spinach and cheese stuffed mushrooms, the lamb kabobs, spicy potatoes, squid and paella for a party of 4. My favorite dish was the squid.. extremely flavorful and tender. All the food was actually very flavorful, though a little salty for my taste (might just be my personal preference). The cava sangria was phenomenal. If I'm in Chicago again, I'd love to come back to try other menu items.
