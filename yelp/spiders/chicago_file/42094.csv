Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been to Ba-Ba-Reeba a few times and loved it every time, so it's about time I wrote a review!  I came here this weekend with a friend that I studied abroad with in Spain, so we were in the mood for some good Spanish fare.  On our last outing to a different Spanish place, we had some pretty horrible and completely inauthentic paella, so we were relieved when we tasted it here.  A little crunchy, full of olive oil and flavor, and just the right saffron color.  We also sampled the manchego (mmm, manchego) and spinach stuffed mushrooms, which were fantastic.  The special sangria of the day was a mango sangria, which was also quite tasty.  My personal favorite is the goat cheese and tomato sauce, which I didn't get this time.  I will definitely continue to consider this my favorite Spanish place in the city until proven otherwise.
