Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My favorite dishes on the menu are the goat cheese croquetas and the fried goat cheese... Obviously I have a big thing for goat cheese.  The spicy potatoes are a religious experience as well.  Besides having great food and really reasonable tapas portions, Ba-Ba-Reeba has about 6 different types of sangria to choose from at any given time.
