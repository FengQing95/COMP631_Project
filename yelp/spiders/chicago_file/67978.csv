Little Goat Diner////Three words. Fat Elvis Waffle. The peanut butter butter is exactly what it sounds like and it is pretty amazing. The waffle is hearty, but not overbearing or doughy. It's got a good fluff to it which I appreciate. Bulls Eye French Toast is not bad either, the chicken is nicely done, the french toast itself is just a bit much for me personally. I would really recommend the parathas burrito most of all though. It's a great meal with rich flavors and a nice chili pepper sauce, simple but really really well done. Good stuff here.
