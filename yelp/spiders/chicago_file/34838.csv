Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I can't believe it took me so long to finally go here. I loved everything from the ambiance to the food. It's a very speakeasy type of environment especially the downstairs. Super cozy and intimate. The old fashioned was incredible. The bone in filet was like butter, cooked to medium rare at perfection and I think just won best steak in Chicago on my list. To end your meal, get the chocolate cream cake, just do.
