Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Wow so many reviews, it must be good right. I don't think I was that impressed. Maybe it had to do with the fact that we visited Spain just last year. It was good, don't get me wrong. Just don't know if it's worth all this fuss on yelp. We walked in for a late lunch and still had to wait 20 minutes. Looking around the restaurant after we were seated, the place is really big and it looked like there were plenty of empty tables. Hopefully those were reserved because man, does it but me when we have to wait even though there's space for us. Anyways we tried their tapas - a brunch crepe with runny eggs, short rib, shrimp with garlic and olive oil, chicken and ham croquetas, citrus salad with goat cheese, potatoes bravas (spicy potatoes), and the beef empanada. Â My favorite was the short rib and it came with mashed potatoes, although like 8-9 bucks for a tiny piece of melt in your mouth meat. The potatoes were just like how they make it in Spain but with a slightly less spicy sauce so I enjoyed it a bit more. I even got their passion fruit sangria - delicious but could've been stronger. We really wanted to try their paella but they didn't have it. And we came on a Sunday afternoon. If they don't have it on the weekends, when do they offer it - maybe only at dinner? And if you check in here on yelp, you get a free dessert. Even their desserts are taps-sized. Just a few bites. Luckily I got the chocolate one and it was very rich so I could only take a couple bites and everyone got to try it as well. Delish.
