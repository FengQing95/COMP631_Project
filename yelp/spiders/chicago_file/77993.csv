Little Goat Diner////My friend and I came here around 10 a.m. on a Thursday originally without a reservation. We called about 20 minutes beforehand just in case. The hostess got my name and number down. We arrived right on the dot and they were not full. Better safe than sorry when it comes to making a reservation!
