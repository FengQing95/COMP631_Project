Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My favorite time to go is on New Year's Day for their Pajama Brunch.  The gimic is: wear your pajamas to brunch and receive a coupon for the amount you spend on brunch that you can use later.  It's like two for one, and you don't even have to get dressed!  In fact, even the servers wear their pajamas on New Year's day.
