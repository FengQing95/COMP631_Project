Art Institute of Chicago////(Just a last thought: Back to "regular" days...If you have only a day or less, especially do check out the website/calendar. I highly recommend attending one of the talks as it can deepen your appreciation/understanding of the artist, the work, the time period, etc. and/or look into doing an audio or "mini-tour." Â
