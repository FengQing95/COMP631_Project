Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've been to this place already twice since moving to Chicago a couple of months ago. The deep dish pizza is reaaaaally good and I always take my visitors to experience it here. The servers are really nice, and I found it to have a lesser waiting time than usual deep dish places around River North. I highly recommend. Oh and also way better than Giordano's!
