Little Goat Diner////The food, oh my Gosh!!! We enjoyed the crisp, freshness of the pickles and onions. The Goat burger (wing style) on a potato bun was beyond heavenly. It melted on my palate. My Mom-in-love have the crisp shrimp cocktail and was delighted by the generously sized, succulently juicy shrimp! The cocktail sauce is good & spicy though! The smoky fries are one of a kind! You must try them!! They even helped with the surprise cake we brought with us! She was also happy with not only the coffee, but with the mug in which it was served. The Daddy goat, the mommy goat, and the baby goat appear inside the mug as you empty the richly delicious coffee.
