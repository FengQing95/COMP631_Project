Little Goat Diner////We got seated quickly since we were there early. They were able to accommodate a table for 6. All of us ordered from the "Cereal Killers" section of the menu. For some reason, I wanted to order something I usually don't, something they wouldn't have in San Diego. And then I saw it staring at me, "The little pig went to China". I was hesitant to order it since I was hungry and was already thinking if I didn't like it, I'd end up starving. Luckily my husband offered to share and/or trade food if needed lol.
