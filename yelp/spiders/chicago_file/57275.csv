Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went for the first time with my brother since he was visiting me. Our waitress was amazing and really did a wonderful job. The food was very good we tried all sorts of things from breakfast to dinner. I did order the skirt steak and it came out burnt. The waitress didn't even hesitate and just took it off our bill. The atmosphere was great and casual. I really thought the bloody marry bar was such a hit and great idea. The only thing I would suggest is to have a bottomless something either bloody or mimosa.
