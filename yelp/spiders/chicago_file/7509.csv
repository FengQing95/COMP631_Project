Art Institute of Chicago////AIC is also relatively inexpensive (apparently the prices increased some recently) and the ideal size.  I've been to the MET.  It was a little overwhelming.   AIC is not too exhaustive, while having something to offer everyone.  Paintings.  Sketches.  Sculptures.  There was even a collection of figurines for children on the bottom level.  I'd recommend the Art Institute of Chicago to anyone from the art novice to the great works connoisseur.
