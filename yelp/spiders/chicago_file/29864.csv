Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Since I didn't visit the pizzeria personally, I can't comment on service or ambiance. Based on taste alone, we were very happy. Our pizzas arrived all boxed up with dry ice. It was neatly and securely packed. Placed our pizzas in the freezer and when we were ready to enjoy them, we just followed their simple directions. Tried the Pepperoni, Sausage, Spinach, and Cheese. They were all delicious and made with quality ingredients. The crust was thin, buttery and crisp. The sauce was smooth, light, and flavorful. Quality ingredients are used and you can taste the difference. We are incredibly satisfied with our order.
