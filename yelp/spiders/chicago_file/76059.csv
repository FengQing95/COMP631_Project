Little Goat Diner////Finding this place as one of the most famous places to visit we had to try it. It's an interesting place with a different and unique menu. They did a wonderful job with the decor and ambiance. The food was different but good! The little piggy went to china had a very unique combination but a good taste after all. The service was great and friendly. For sure a place to try if you are in the area.
