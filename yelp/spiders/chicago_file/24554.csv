Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place lives up to the hype. As a tourist in Chicago for the first time, you are told to try the famous deep dish pizza. Definitely made the trip worth it! Loved this place so much we had it twice on our trip. There is a long line but you preorder your pizza and they text you when your table is ready. Definitely give this place a try!
