Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first taste of deep dish in Chicago. What i liked most about this pie was the crust. it was buttery, crispy and flavorful. i do appreciate the use of chunky tomatoes for the sauce, but it needs more of it. the mozarella cheese and meat (pepperoni and sausage) toppings were great.
