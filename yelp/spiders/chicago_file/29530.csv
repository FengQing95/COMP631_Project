Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Let me be very clear, our server was fantastic. Three of four pizzas came out and she was so apologetic. However this wasn't The Chicago pizza that I was expecting nor the Chicago style pizza that I had heard it was. And to be clear, the pizza wasn't bad. It was just not as good as other Chicago style pizza is that I've had while visiting the Windy City.
