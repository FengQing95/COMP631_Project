Little Goat Diner////Normally, I enjoy sitting at the bar because it offers a different vantage point.  This time, it was an uncomfortable experience.  It was actually really hot and without a proper place to hang my coat, I was a bit miserable.  Live and learn.  Once we were seated, we had a chance to peruse the menu.  It was hard to decide what to order and what to save for next time.  I ended up choosing the grilled cheese with smoked gouda & mont amore cheese . guanciale . smoked tomato.  Though my sandwich was good, I didn't appreciate the fact that the whole underside of it was soggy.  I love a buttery, CRISP grilled cheese, and sadly, this did not deliver.
