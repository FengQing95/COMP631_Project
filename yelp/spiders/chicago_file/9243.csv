Art Institute of Chicago////I bought a membership to the Art Institute of Chicago, and it has been a great decision.  The membership has paid for itself several times over!  My friends and family have enjoyed visiting the museum.  The members lounge is very nice, and I've enjoyed the early entry times on the weekends!  There's nothing like having the Impressionist art to yourself!
