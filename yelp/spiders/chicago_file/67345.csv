Little Goat Diner////I ate breakfast at Little Goat last week.  I'll have to try it again because the menu is huge and diverse and I hate when people make a snap judgement about a place after trying just one dish, but I wasn't really impressed.  I ordered corned beef hash because I love good corned beef hash and I think I can identify whether or not it's legit.  They open at 7:00 am.  I was there by 7:30 am and there were maybe 10 people in the restaurant.  I expected really quick service, considering the fact that the waitstaff and kitchen staff outnumbered the amount of diners in the restaurant.  I was wrong.  I actually sat at the counter and noticed that my order on their computer screen was flashing red because it had taken longer than it should have.  That's fine if it's Saturday brunch, but it was bizarre for a fully staffed restaurant at 7:30 am on a Tuesday.  I'm not a service snob and I wasn't in a hurry, so no big deal.  Just something I noticed.
