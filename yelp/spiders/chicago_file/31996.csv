Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ordered the gf pepperoni pizza Chicago style and my mind was BLOWN! I haven't had Chicago style pizza since I stopped eating gluten and WOW they have done an amazing job, my partner ordered a deep dish from Giordanos and said their regular deep dish tasted just about the same. I highly recommend Lou Malnati's I will be going back, ordering to get shipped and telling everyone! Thanks Lou!
