Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////You will need a reservation (got ours on open table) during their hours of operation 4-9pm Monday through Sunday. The ambiance was chill and sexy like it'll make you want to get up, let your hair down and dance without a care in the world. Also, customer service was on point; loved how the servers engaged everyone with the food. That took the dinning experience to a whole different level
