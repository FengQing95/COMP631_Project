Little Goat Diner////A peer of mine ordered a malt milkshake, and I sampled a bit. It literally just tasted like a Maltese in liquid form! It was heavenly, but also very heavy and sugary. Needless to say, I was impressed when he finished the milkshake, along with his smoked corned beef, an order of apple pancakes (that he was supposed to share with a friend), and a couple chicken fingers!
