Smoque BBQ////I've been long overdue for another visit here. For some reason I just don't make it down this area, but I really should schedule a visit more often. Stopped in on this "chili" day, just after the polar vortex rode through, for some mighty tasty beef brisket chili. Funny how a 23° day after -51° wind chills, feels like you don't need a jacket.
