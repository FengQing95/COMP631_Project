Little Goat Diner////Great little spot in the west loop area.  Same owner as the famous restaurant Girl and the Goat (which is fantastic but more upscale).  This is an upscale diner type restaurant.  You can get anything from a fancy grilled cheese to dark chocolate chip pancakes (breakfast all day) to dinner type meals.  The service is great and prices are reasonable.  They also have a full bar.  Pro tip: walk in the doors and go right to the bar area, often times the booths and bar seats have some openings so you don't have to wait for a table at more crowded times.
