The Purple Pig////My most memorable item of the night. The bone marrow was SOO thick, I have never seen any piece of bone marrow that thick. I was speechless when I saw it. They recommend you adding the piece of bone marrow to your sliced baguette, add a pinch of salt and some cilantro on top. Super fatty dish I know, but it was just delicious.
