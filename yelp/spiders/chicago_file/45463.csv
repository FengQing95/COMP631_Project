Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The New Years Day Pajama brunch was excellent! Our waiter Ryan was one of the best waiters we've had anywhere. Friendly, not pushy and gave us a few extras without us even asking. Overall great experience. Â Brunch paella is an excellent idea as well as the traditional bacon wrapped dates and empanadas. I'll be coming back with the $65 worth of gift certificates they provided at the end of the meal:)
