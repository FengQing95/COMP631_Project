Smoque BBQ////Just picked up for dinner on Friday night.  Ordered  on the phone, and the person who took the order was very helpful - as I wasn't certain about portions and sides,.  I asked for a specific time on a Friday night.  It was ready, for  pick up, easy peasy.  I had two Texan's over and they raved!  At one point whispering between one another just how the ribs were. We had such a fun night because every one's mouth was doing the happy dance.  Smoque doesn't rest on it's laurels, they keep their standards up.  Of course, will be back!
