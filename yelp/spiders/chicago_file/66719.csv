Little Goat Diner////Called on a Saturday morning to make a reservation. They do not do same day, but the hostess was very helpful in telling us that the amount of reservations they have would pick up around 8:45, if we wanted to come before then we would be able to get a table. We arrived and were seated right away! Good coffee and great food. A must stop brunch place!
