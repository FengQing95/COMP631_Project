Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Chicago cut sirloin -- boneless and perfectly cooked. First bite was close-your-eyes good. If you are hankering for a steak, this should be your destination. The side of Bernaise was unnecessary -- the steak needed no sauce or additional seasoning of any kind. It was perfect.
