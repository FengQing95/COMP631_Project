Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Had so Â much fun here! My cousins and I came to cafe ba-ba-reeba on a chilly Sunday evening right after St. Patty's Day. I think people were still recovering from the night before. There was a wait time of abt 45minutes and we were all hungry. We got lucky because there was room at the bar!
