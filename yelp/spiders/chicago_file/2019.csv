Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I've passed by this place several times and have ALWAYS seen it packed with people, so we decided to see what all the hype was about. Certainly came in with high expectations, hoping it lived up to it and after today I'd say they definitely did. Don't let the crowded scene and long wait detour you, it is worth the wait. I loved that you Â could even download yelp to see your place in line and see how quickly they seated people in front of you on the app, it's really genius. Great service and great recommendations from the waiter as to what was some good specialities. The food was great as well and nice portions for my buck, so I didn't feel cheated. It'll be nice if they expand a bit or have a nice waiting area since they are so popular because I know the Prudential building gets a lot of their waiting customers. But all and all, great experience and I look forward to eating here again.
