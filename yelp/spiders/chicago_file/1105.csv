Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This was our first time trying Wildberry.  The food was so yummy - we'll definitely return the next time we're in Chicago.  We had a 30 minute wait, which I hear isn't bad for this location.  We spent the time strolling the park across the street while we waited for the text notification.  We tried the no-wait app, but it just told us to come in.  Maybe the wait needs to be a little longer before the app works?  I had the Apple and Pecan Pancakes with a side of Hash Browns.  The pancakes were perfectly sweet.  The service was great - they refilled my water a few times.  It took around 15 minutes to get our meals.  The restaurant is very clean.  The place is packed a little tighter than some restaurants, but this isn't the worst thing.  It has the side effect of encouraging strangers to inquire about your meal and share their thoughts on their own order.  It was kind of neat.  I felt it added to the experience.  There's nothing more they could have done better.
