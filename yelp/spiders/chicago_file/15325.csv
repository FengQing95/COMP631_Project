Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Have been going around Chicago trying all pizza and this pizza was great....now for the bad part. 35 minute wait for horrible service and bland pasta. I order app it came cold. Asked for drink 10 minutes. Then asked for extra sauce it came with my bagged up food..... really lacking on customer service and Â speed. Manager needs to step in and try to help out. Ruined experience just because no one is running show and preventing these issues. Get more managers to help out the one female manager I saw was changing trash in toilet obviously she is being over worked.
