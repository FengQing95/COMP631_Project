Little Goat Diner////There was only a 15 minute wait on a Saturday night. We were seated at the communal table which was fine-definitely enough space. Loved the cheesy garlic bread and the grilled cheese. Both were EXTREMELY rich and decadent-didn't even get close to finishing it. The shrimp cocktail was unique in that the shrimp were wrapped in noodles and friend. Not amazing but not bad. The fries were delicious.
