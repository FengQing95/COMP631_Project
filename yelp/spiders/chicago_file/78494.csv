Little Goat Diner////I came here with my sister and our friend on a trip to Chicago. My sister is a vegetarian and the options for her were pretty limited but she chose the avocado toast and enjoyed it. I had the big biscuit and gravy, which was pretty salty but I like salt so I didn't mind. Our friend had the corned beef hash and we all shared the buttermilk pancake. The service was great, I highly recommend making a reservation if you want to be seated quickly!
