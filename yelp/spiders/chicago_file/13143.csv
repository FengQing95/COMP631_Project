Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Then after a horrible experience at another deep dish joint, we returned on Wed for lunch to erase the bad taste from our mouths and memories. This time we had a half-&-half, "The Lou" and pepperoni/sausage/mushroom combo, with extra sauce. While the toppings were still perfectly done, given it was half/half the tomato slices were smaller in order to fit in the tinier space. And while the crust was still good, it was not as light and buttery as the one we had on Sunday...go figure. Still we enjoyed it very much. I have to say we like LM better than the others we've tried, not just in Chicago but elsewhere also. For deep dish, LM is the one to beat. Off course we didn't try its other locations, but it sure makes for a great reason to try them all. Too bad, we had to leave and couldn't get to them.
