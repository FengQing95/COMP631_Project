Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We went here on a holiday weekend and waited an hour and five minutes for our table.  It was worth it.   Totally worth it!  When you arrive and give them your name they will ask for your phone number.  Give it to them.  They will text you and you get to see where your place in line is, while you wait.  Then you go to the counter and order your pizza.  Just your pizza and then when your seated you'll order any appetizers or salads.  This is suppose to get your pizza to the table quicker.   Ours came out a little too quick when we got seated. It beat our garlic bread and mozzarella sticks.  I was peeved at first but it was so amazing I didn't care!!  We took home the leftovers and had them the next night for dinner.
