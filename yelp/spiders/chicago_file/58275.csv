Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Was very busy but the service was outstanding and the food amazing as last time! Got our must haves of Brussels Sprout Salad, The Goat Cheese baked in tomato sauce with garlic bread and Sangria. This time we tried the Fried Calamari which came with a spicy aioli which was excellent. We really liked the Sweet Potato Soup but it was a very small portion and could have eaten more. We did not care for the Chickpea Stew, filled with a lot of corn. Ended with a delicious chocolate truffle. Satisfaction.
