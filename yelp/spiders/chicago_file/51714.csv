Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our waitress was really nice and attentive, and gave good recommendations. We ordered a half pitcher of the Classic Red sangria. It was delicious, and red wine is not usually my favorite. We really debated between the Classic Red and the seasonal special, which was white with mango. Next time.
