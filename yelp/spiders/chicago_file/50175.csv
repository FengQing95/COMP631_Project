Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We were seated but our waiter took his sweet time showing up to take our order. Then he insulted my intelligence by asking me if I knew what tapas were. Yes moron, I'm familiar with the concept of tapas and I've eaten at just about every tapas place except this one. So we ordered and I waited, and waited, and waited, and then waited some more for my sangria to show up. The food started coming out and still no sangria in sight. Had to flag down two bus boys and tell them to go fetch my server for one of them to finally actually go and tell my server that he forgot to put in my sangria order. We had just gotten our last plate when my sangria finally arrived, with this from the server: "Sorry, I couldn't read my own handwriting." So the reason I sat here sangria-less through my whole meal was because you couldn't read your own handwriting? Oh, ok then, that makes me feel so much better.
