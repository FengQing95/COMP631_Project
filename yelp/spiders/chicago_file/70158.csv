Little Goat Diner////Overall solid experience. Since we went at 2PM on a Friday, there was no wait for a table. I can see this place filling up quickly and often. By the time we left around 4PM, all tables were taken and they was a line out... Plan accordingly. 2 main courses, plus a side, plus 4 glasses of wine topped out at $95. Not bad.
