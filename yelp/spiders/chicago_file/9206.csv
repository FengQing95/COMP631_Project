Art Institute of Chicago////Prior to coming here, I had no idea that one of my favorite paintings, "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte," is actually exhibited here. Â When I first saw it I was just thinking... "wow this is a big reprint" but then it hit me... and I wondered, "could this be???"
