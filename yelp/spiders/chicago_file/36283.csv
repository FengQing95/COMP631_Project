Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This was a "one-star" experience in every sense, but I'm not giving that to Bavette's because I know from past experiences with its sister restaurants that it knows how to make good food and drinks (plus I prefer dark, dimly lit places with high-brow jazz). This, then, is not a complaint of the company or the restaurant but rather of a single night that is most likely an outlier. Â I know that if I came on a less-busy knight and perhaps with a different bar staff, the gimlet would have tasted like a gimlet, and the ribeye would have been the great thing that all the other reviewers rave about. On this night, however, it was not meant to be.
