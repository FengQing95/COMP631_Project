Smoque BBQ////Yummmm some of the best American BBQ I've ever had. Got full slab baby back ribs, brisket a la carte platter, and Texas sausage a la carte platter. Brisket was soooooo tender and had amazing smoked flavor wow. Baby back ribs were pretty good although I think I've had better elsewhere, but still worth it. Texas sausage surprised me bc I didn't think sausages would taste thaaaaaat good but it was so damn delicious??? My bf and I also agreed that their coleslaw is the best we've ever had. Mac and cheese was great too although it was smaller than I imagined.
