Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had the Malnati's Chicago Pizza and it was good. I'm giving it 3 stars because the taste of the pizza was alright. Butter crust is bland and sausage lack seasoning. It is loaded with cheese and sauce was delicious. I've had other Chicago deep dish pizza much better than this for around the same price.
