The Purple Pig////Food: We weren't famished, so my boyfriend and I ended up splitting three dishes from the appetizer menu. We started with the beets with goat cheese and pistachios. This was my favorite dish! The pistachios added the perfect flavor and crunch to the dish. I was surprised by how big the serving was because the bowl doesn't look huge. Next, we had the Greek cornbread. I was least impressed by this, although it wasn't bad. It just wasn't anything special. $6 seems like too much money for it. Next up was the cauliflower, which was great, but still cannot be compared to the Girl & the Goat cauliflower dish. There weren't very many gherkin pickles, which disappointed my boyfriend a bit.
