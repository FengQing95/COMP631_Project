Little Goat Diner////Little Goat Diner is, as you already know, the diner-themed spin-off of Girl and the Goat (a supposedly at-least-equally amazing restaurant across the street that I have not tried but at which it is notoriously hard to get a reservation). One thing I wish I'd known ahead of time is how impossible it was going to be to park nearby -- it's not a problem we generally have in Indianapolis. Just go into your experience at Little Goat Diner or anywhere nearby knowing that you will either be walking a little like I did or paying for a valet. Did I have a reservation? No, I walked in alone and was kindly seated at the bar immediately. There seemed to be a couple of empty tables as well. It was a Tuesday night, but what I'm trying to say is that you should be able to get in here, unlike at Little Goat's big sister restaurant.
