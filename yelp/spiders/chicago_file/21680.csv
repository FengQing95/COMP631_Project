Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Well, I have to say I was pretty disappointed with the service and quality of food.  When we arrived, we were told the wait was appx 35 minutes. We ordered our pizza ahead of time and got a beverage.  After waiting 70 minutes, we finally were seated.  The waitress did not come to our table for over ten minutes, and tells us we have time to order an appetizer and a salad.  I thought that was odd but went along with it. She takes forever to get us a pitcher of beer and guess what another guy comes out with our pizza before she comes back with our beer. We canceled the app but she says she can get our salad right away.  Guess what, we finished our first slice of pizza before she brings the salad.  No apologies just gives the salad.
