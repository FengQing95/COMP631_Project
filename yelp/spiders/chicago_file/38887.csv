Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So Yes, this place is known to be the best steak house in the city. I've been informed on multiple occasions that their food will make your toes curl in glee. I can honestly say, maybe my expectations were too high. I'm a huge fan of Hogsalt and Bavette's is one of his crown jewels.
