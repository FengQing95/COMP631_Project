Smoque BBQ////The other thing I would suggest is that if you're like me and you're into spice- ask for the spicy barbeque sauce and the pickled jalapenos. I never KNEW how much this would up the flavor factor of my sandwich until I slathered this BBQ sauce and topped the jalapenos...I will never go back to a plain brisket sandwich here.
