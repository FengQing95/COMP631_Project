Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////- Peppered duck and goat cheese terrine. Are you fucking SERIOUS? (yes.) I don't really know how to describe this. This may be tied for my favorite thing I have eaten on a piece of bread, ever, and I didn't even know I wanted it. I mean, it's terrine. Shreddy duck and slightly gamey goat cheese and pepper. Taste and believe, mfers.
