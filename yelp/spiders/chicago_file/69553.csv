Little Goat Diner////The food came out to about $21-$26/person which felt overpriced for the mediocre food and subpar service.. The food at our table that was not a spinoff of asian food, such as the french toast and breakfast burrito tasted better than my won ton crab omelette. As someone who has grown up eating all kind of chinese food, I thought I would appreciate it but I wasn't sure what they were going for. I'm glad I tried this place, but probably will not be back.
