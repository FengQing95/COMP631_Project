Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I must admit that my omelet sounded a lot better on the menu, it had avocados in it and while I'm a fan of anything with avocados in them, maybe an omelet is just not one of them. I enjoyed my americano and the fact that it came in a big mug was also helpful. If this place is considered a pancake heaven I would have to say that the clouds in that heaven would be made by their incredibly fluffy omelets. I don't think I've ever had a omelet that was so fluffy  (no other way to describe it really). I'm pretty sure Canadians do something different to omelets here that don't make them come out like that. I did miss not having the option for multiple types of syrup on our table by default such as blueberry (I might have been able to request some but I didn't bother).  Prices were a little bit high, but you end up with lots of food that it might seem to balance itself out.
