Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great Ambience! Unfortunately my experience there wasn't as great due to people I wen with. I am new to the city and was invited over by a friend to meet some others. Considering it is a tapas place, I was limited to choices because most didn't eat pork, which was still fine, but the other two girls didn't eat anything but 'halal,'which eliminates all meat from being ordered. So, we were limited to Seafood and vegetarian options, which were average. I did order the sear lamb loin with mint salsa verde and pisto manchego. It was pretty good, but not amazing. My friend also ordered for herself the beef skewer with red onions and horseradish cream, which was pretty good. It was more flavorful than the lamb. We ordered the seafood paella, which was alright. I've had better paella elsewhere. The sangria blanco was great. Overall, did not have the best experience, but would return to try again. I could possibly change with a more open minded and fun group of people.
