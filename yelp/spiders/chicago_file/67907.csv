Little Goat Diner////The rest of the food wasn't anything special, however. My wife had the corned beef hash; the beef was stringy, the potatoes were flavorless, and it was sorely in need of spice, or some kind of seasoning. I also tasted a salmon salad, which was pretty good but not mindblowing. And the apple pie was a downer. Way too much pie crust, which was buttery and flaky but lacked crispness, and the small amount of apples inside were pretty bland. The chocolate shake was very good but also very expensive.
