Smoque BBQ////Sides: The macaroni and cheese comes baked in a separate metal container. It was rich and cheesy, but not too heavy - certainly a must have. Don't skip the fries, baked beans, or cornbread - all delicious and certainly noteworthy. Most importantly, do yourself a favor and save room for their peach cobbler... holy shit.
