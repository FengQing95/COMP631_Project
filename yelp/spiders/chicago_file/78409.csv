Little Goat Diner////The environment and service of this restaurant were absolutely too notch. We made a reservation for 17 and they were able to sit us right away. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive! My review is mainly based on what I ordered, which was the "Los Drowned" which was a beef sandwich. It was incredibly over chewy and the meat wasn't tender unfortunately. They serve breakfast and lunch which is my Â absolute favorite. Many things on the menu look absolutely amazing, but I think I just ordered incorrectly.
