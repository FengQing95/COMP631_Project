Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Love love love this place! A must place to visit if you're in Chicago. We shared a skillet between two of us and upgraded for their signature berry pancake on a side. The skillet was loaded with crispy hash brown, eggs, Â some meat, lots of avocado, and salsa which were a perfect combination. We tend to be picky when it comes to pancakes but also enjoyed the signature pancakes which were moist and fluffy. I want to go back to chitown just to have another breakfast here!! Go for a walk to the millennium park nearby to burn off all those calories afterwards!
