Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Finally, let me add by writing that I picked LM after surveying a number of cab drivers about pizzerias, and many of them said, "try Iluminati's" - I was like "Illuminati"?  I didnt realize it was Lou Malnatti's, not "illuminati" (thats from the Da Vinci Code) until I arrived.  Tourist faux-pas.  Enjoy.
