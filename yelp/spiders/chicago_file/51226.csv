Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I really enjoy this wonderful Sevilla style restaurant. It's got the whole package: delicious food, great sangria, terrific service and very nice Spanish ambiance. Haven't found a tapas I didn't like here as all of the dishes are carefully prepared and high quality. Try the patatas bravas, croquettas, tortilla (it's like an omelette), and dates wrapped in bacon...oh, just try them all, they're all good.
