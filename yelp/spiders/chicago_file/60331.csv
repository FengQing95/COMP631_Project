Smoque BBQ////Additionally, the advice of fellow yelpers led me to believe that this joint was to be the best of both worlds, if the set of worlds under consideration are those that (1) serve some of the best macaroni and cheese in the city and (2) are kid friendly. Â Point (1) eliminates a good majority of spots, and (2) knocks Kuma's and Orbit Room out of the running for good (though who doesn't love getting tanked and listening to metal around children???)
