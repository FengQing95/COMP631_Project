Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Once we were seated our waitress was great! We order drinks and an appetizer (3 cheese bread) because we were starving by that point. The bread was delicious. Took another 20 minutes for our pizza to arrive which was also delicious. Best part was the sausages. Left full and happy. Only complaint we had was their system. It's almost dangerous how many people were crowded in their waiting. It wasn't cold outside or raining or snowing so most could have taken a walk instead of hanging out like it was going to make time go faster
