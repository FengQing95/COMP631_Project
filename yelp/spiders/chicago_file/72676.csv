Little Goat Diner////I truly enjoyed Little Goat, not only because the food is delicious but also because the portions are HUGE. I got the sausage and biscuits which were so creamy and delicious, and extremely filling. We also got the pork belly pancake which was full of flavor and the melt in your mouth chocolate crisp pancakes. If you're ever in the West Loop area and choosing from the plethora of restaurants there, definitely try Little Goat!
