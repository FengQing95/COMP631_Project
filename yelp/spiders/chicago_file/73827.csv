Little Goat Diner////My daughter ordered the beef ravioli and it might have been the best of the four entrees that we ordered, beating out the Chinese chicken sandwich, the shrimp & pork belly and the duck leg confit. It was the a classic case of the menu reading better than the food tasted. Sadly, it was not a particularly memorable meal (for anything positive, anyway.) I've only eaten there once, so it is fair to guess that it was just a bad night.
