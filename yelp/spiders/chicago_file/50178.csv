Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My friend Teddy told me I HAD to try Ba-Ba-Reeba because they have the best tapas around, and I was a little skeptical because St. Louis has some incredible tapas spots and I wasn't sure it would measure up. Good news is that it did! I still like my regular tapas spots better, but we had a total blast and got to enjoy some really great food. This place gets really busy on a Saturday night so make reservations if you can. Per usual with tapas places, it's incredible loud and busy, which is all part of the experience...
