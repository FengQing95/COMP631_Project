The Purple Pig////One odd thing I noticed during the visit was that several individuals from the big group next to us were standing on the seat and tried to see something outside of the window. Their waiter or any staff seemed not making an attempt to check on them or even stop them. I am not sure if that because everyone was occupied at that time, but it was slightly disturbing to other customers.
