Little Goat Diner////Anyhow, this is really a paean to diner food - pancakes, waffles, eggs, bacon, burgers, sandwiches, potatoes, bread - all familiar stuff - but most items feature at least one unique twist.  For example, the burgers include your choice of patty - beef of course, but there is also goat and veggie.  The goat patty is really good - mildly gamey but well prepared - crispy caramelized on the outside but the inside was a bit dry.
