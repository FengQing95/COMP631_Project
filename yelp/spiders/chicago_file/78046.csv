Little Goat Diner////Most of my 5 star reviews are for hole in the wall places, but Little Goat Diner is super popular and not extremely cheap and still warrants 5 stars based on the food alone. I ordered the bullseye toast and it was seriously the most delicious thing I've ever eaten for brunch - the fried chicken was perfect, and I usually find breakfast fried chicken too greasy or fried. This chicken was cut in bite-sized chunks and battered in a very flavorful and semi-sweet batter. The toast itself was perfection, as was of course the runny egg in the middle!
