Smoque BBQ////Yummy yummy!!!!! Everything we ordered was right on point. Price is average for a good BBQ joint, but not cheap. We ordered St. Louis ribs - every bite the meat just falls off the bone! Soooooo freaken delicious!!! The brisket was a must try, so we did order a plate meal and OMG the meat is soooo tender it just breaks apart. Never had brisket like that before. In additional we ordered extra sausages and there was no regrets there! Everything was delish! Oh, the sides.. the French fries were super fresh and crispy. The cole slaw was on the sour side, but refreshing and the bbq beans were made to perfection. I would so definitely come back to this place when visiting Chicago again!
