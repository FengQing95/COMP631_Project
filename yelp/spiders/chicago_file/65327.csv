Smoque BBQ////I'm by no means anyone who has eaten many types of BBQ in my life but I can definitely say this place is tasty. I came on a Friday evening at around 6:30 with a large group and luckily were able to find seats; it can get kind of packed so do come earlier! However, I think a lot of people do get it to go. Four of us split a full rack of the St. Louis ribs with slaw, fries, beans, and the chili along with the BBQ brisket. Everything was so delicious and we demolished the entire thing. Other people in our party got the mac and cheese and that was also well received. I love that there are so many different types of BBQ sauces, and I like that the slaw isn't really heavy. I've been craving this place ever since and this place gives me another reason to visit Chicago again!
