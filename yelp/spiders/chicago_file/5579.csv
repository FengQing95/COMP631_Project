The Purple Pig////I suggest coming with a group of 4-5 people so you can try a bunch of small plates. There is always a wait (no reservations) so be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes or 1.5 hours on the weekend. It's more on the pricey side but it's worth giving it a try. Each plate is very tasty and flavorful and I don't think you'll be disappointed with anything on the menu. The food here is more on the salty side and it pairs well with wine.
