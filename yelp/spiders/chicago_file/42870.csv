Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite Tapas places in the city. Just so beautiful inside, everyone is super nice, and totally affordable! And when it's nice outside they have a nice back area to sit outside. The Sangria is the best! So addicting, before you know it you have gone through pitchers! There is nothing on this menu that isn't worth trying.
