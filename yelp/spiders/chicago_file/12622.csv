Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Wow! My first Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. I had seen Malnati's on Food Network, and always wondered: Could it really be that good? I guarantee you it was that good! We started with the Lou salad. The greens were fresh and tasty, Bacon from heaven, bleu cheese, and a sweet tangy dressing that I would gladly kill for. Then comes the sausage pizza! Amazing! The server helped us take photos of this beast, and she separated the slices for us. I really can't wrap my mind around how a pizza this thick could have such a crispy crust. And speaking of crust; you could actually taste it! Most pizzas use the crust as a vehicle for transporting the other ingredients, but this crust was one of the main stars of this pizza show! The sausage was to die for. The tomatoes and cheese were fantastic. I haven't had this much fun since the day the dogs ate my little sister. (Just joking sis!) The question has always been: New York pizza or Chicago pizza. Now I know the answer! Chicago by a landslide! Sure I may eat a New York pizza again, but there us no hurry! Thanks Lou! Thanks Chicago!
