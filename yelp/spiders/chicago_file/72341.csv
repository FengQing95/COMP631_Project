Little Goat Diner////Honestly I rarely give a 5 star rating, however we took some loafs of bread and bagels home from the bakery next door.  Used them for breakfast items, and made mussels and the bread for dipping.  Was really really good.  Thus took the 4 star meal to 5 stars with take home - top notch baked items.
