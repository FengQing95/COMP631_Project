Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I used to live near this Lou M's, so I ordered it a few times for takeout.  The first time it came, the pizza was so doughy I wonder if they cooked it half as long as it should have.  I thought it was a fluke, so I ordered it again.  Same thing--the pizza was way way undercooked and doughy.  Plus the delivery driver took well over an hour and a half to get there, and I lived 5 minutes away at most.
