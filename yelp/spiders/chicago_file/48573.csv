Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love babareeba, brunch, lunch,  late night dinner, private event and simply cocktails I have done them all here.  The service, sangria and tapas are great.  The menu selection is extensive but I try to go for different tapas each time it still have my favorites,  beef medallions with blue cheese crust, the warm potato omelete, staple goat cheese and red sauce,  scallops are great as well.   This place has such a great vibe and a beautiful decor, it's huge and has several rooms, if I could find one negative it would have to be the bathroom situation or lack of, they have one in a private room and another that you have to take a steep staircase down too.  Besides that,  I truly love babareeba.
