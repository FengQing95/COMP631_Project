Little Goat Diner////Dined solo at Little Goat and had the fun of sitting at the counter where I got to see many of their dishes as they went into the window form the kitchen. Some of them looked so good I feared that I may have ordered wrong (I will definitely order the tempura mashed potatoes next time!)
