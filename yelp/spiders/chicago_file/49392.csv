Smoque BBQ////Let's talk storage - I'm talking space needed for those items that currently don't fit in your condo/house right now.  The LockUp facility on Kinzie has exceeded our expectations.  Staff is friendly.  The facility is always very clean.  Have used the facility for 5 years without any problem.  The manager, John Cisnerios, is a great guy, knowledgeable and very helpful.
