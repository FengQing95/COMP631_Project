Little Goat Diner////Alas, I am an idiot. Girl has vision and knows how to implement it. First of all, you WILL have to wait for a table, but you can do so at the adjoining bakery/bread shop/cafe/bar/souvenir shop. The cafe serves Stumptown coffee. The bar serves an array of cocktails that are a bit more frou frou (perhaps more diner-apropos?) than those served at G&TG. The assortment of souvenirs is extensive. And you can even watch the bread people at work behind a pane of glass.
