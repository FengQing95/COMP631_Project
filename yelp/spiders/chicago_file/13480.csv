Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is really only commenting on the Malnati Chicago Classic. I really like meat but this was way too much Â for a pizza. Instead of doing crumbly sausage so you get some really cheesy bites,some meaty bites and some saucy bites---they layer the whole surface of the pizza with a huge sausage patty. It didn't work---it was overload and weirdly creepy---IMO. Crazy busy--other dishes were fine but I am obviously clueless to the hype.
