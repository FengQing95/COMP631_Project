Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is the place I always take out-of-towners to get authentic deep dish pizza.  I always go with "The Lou" but even if mushrooms and spinach aren't your thing make sure you upgrade to the buttercrust!! Don't be dissuaded by a long wait time- you can pre-order your pizza (which takes 45 minutes to cook) so its really not so bad.  Plus they have a system to text you when your table is ready so you don't have to wait in the lobby- just make sure you can get back within 5 minutes!
