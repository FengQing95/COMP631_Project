Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza came and I scarfed it down like I hadn't eaten in days (more like 14 hours).  After I was done a shift change had happened and a different server brought out a cookie dessert and wished me a happy birthday. What a sweet surprise!  When the first guy took my beer order, he carded me and noted it had been my bday the day before.  I'm sorry I didn't get to thank him.  What a great way to start my visit to Chicago!
