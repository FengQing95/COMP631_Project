Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Is this massive touristy chain restaurant using cold water to wash their dishes? There was a staff of 10+ just standing in the back laughing it up. Yet we were given room temperature Â wings 45 minutes after ordering them? Our table was still covered in crumbs from the party before us (but i felt embarrassed for asking for clean dishes twice already so I wiped it off with a napkin myself). I will absolutely never return here or any affiliated restaurants again.
