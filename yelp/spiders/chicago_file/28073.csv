Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you're on a business trip, and only have time for one food option in Chicago, this is the one. We ordered the trio of dips which were delicious and generous portions and I could not stop eating. But this is a trap, you should try really hard to not order any apps so you can save the entirety of your stomach space for that delicious buttercrust deep dish. I got the 'Lou' + sausage and it was so so good. Sadly, on the walk home we ended up giving away our leftovers. I still dream about that pizza but I guess tastebud heaven should be shared.
