Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've had lots of stuff there over the years, and they've changed their menu a little, but in general I'd recommend both potato dishes - a garlic potato salad and roasted ones with an alioli dipping sauce, the pintxos platter (especially if you are with only 2 people, since it lets you try 6 things), the escargot on garlic croutons (OMG), and all the empanadas.
