Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Food: We ordered a few tapas including the Grilled Squid, Octopus a la Plancha, Shrimp with Garlic followed by Seafood Paella. Of the tapas I enjoyed the Octopus the most as it was had nice grill marks and the tomato sauce was the perfect compliment. The shrimp was good with a generous portion in a slightly spicy sauce. The Paella was the star of the meal with a nice selection shrimp, squid, clams, and mussels to go with the perfectly cooked rice. They had a nice wine list and I was able to complement my meal with a wine flight of Spanish reds.
