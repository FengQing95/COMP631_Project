Little Goat Diner////Indian flatbread, chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, mont amore cheese. I swapped my sunny side egg out for egg whites. Â DELISH! so glad I got this dish. Very filling, great flavors and healthy all in one. Thank you to my waitress for helping me make that decision
