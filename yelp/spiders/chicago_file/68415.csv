Little Goat Diner////The food was fabulous and I feel that the prices are comparable based on the quality of food.  I had the apple pancakes and they are just to die for.  I am actually craving them right now.  On my second trip, I had the pork belly benedict and it was good but not great.  I wouldn't die to go back there for that.  i would go back to try out the lunch and dinner options.  Some people were having burgers and they looked good.
