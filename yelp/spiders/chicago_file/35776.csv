Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Awesome option for reasonably priced French food downtown. Came back here a year later because I enjoyed it so much last time. Both times, I sort of did it on the cheap. They have a lot of seafood and steak options, none of which I tried. I loved the French influence of the less expensive dishes though. The foie gras appetizer was great. The roasted chicken was fantastic and reasonably priced - highly recommended. It's hard to make chicken really great... The beef stroganoff was very good as well. If the noodles weren't house-made, they fooled me. Excellent steak included with the stroganoff as well.
