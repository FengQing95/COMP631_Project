Little Goat Diner////When I visited Chicago last summer, I ate here two days in a row despite abundance of foodie options in this city. I tried the Sloppy Goat which was simply amazing and blew my expectations out of the water. Everything tastes as good as it looks. To me the quality of drinks is just as important as the freshness of the food to rate a restaurant "as good as it gets". For years I've been on a hunt for the ideal bloody mary. Mike, the bartender, nailed it! I was extremely impressed with the way he balances conversation with his guests at the bar without compromising his mixology skills while crafting specialty cocktails. I haven't had a bloody mary ever since, and will have to visit Chicago very soon because someone's getting thirsty...
