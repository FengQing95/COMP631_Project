Smoque BBQ////My mother bought some pulled pork and chili for a family dinner last night and boy was it decadent. They even gave us their rolls to make sandwiches with. I had to reheat my meat since I came home late but even then it was to-die-for. You know something's good when it tastes amazing even when it's microwaved! Only gripe is that the sauce is kinda watery, but the upside to that is that the bread sops up the sauce that much better, making every bite count. Also wish they would've given us more sauce, I could've used it to dip some random things in...it is THAT good. Just do me a favor and get your tush over to Smoque. You won't regret it! Plus the owner donated tons of food to our annual block party where we live...so you know the guys have some heart, too!
