Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Such a good place for big groups who don't mind splitting a bunch of small plates. They also have sangria pitchers that are a really good deal. I came here with 4 other girls and we ordered multiple items as well as two pitchers of sangria and spent $27/each which was way less than we were expecting.
