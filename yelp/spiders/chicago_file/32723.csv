Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I only give them 2 stars because they have good strong drinks. I was very disappointed by the service there. I have reservations a week in advance and somehow they just disappeared...Hmmmm had a big night planned and then it was ruined!!! I expected them to try to do something...anything to help me out after I told them my plans and they put me on hold for 15 min and another lady got back on the phone.... acted like I wasn't on hold and then just plain out didn't care, said sorry I cant do anything the next table we have is for 11pm. WHO THE HELL GOES ON A DINNER DATE AT 11PM!!!! Very disappointed to say the least. I would have been ok with them seeing if any of their places within the company had places but they DID. NOT. GIVE. A SHIT.....No shits were given!. BLahhh-vettes
