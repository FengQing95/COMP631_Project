Art Institute of Chicago////I was reminded when I visited yesterday that the food here isn't bad, but not great if you're desperate to eat. And like all cafes and eateries within a museum, it is a little overpriced. Ate in the museum cafe on the east side(but not Modern Wing part) near where the fountain is outside, and I didn't like how hard the soft taco shell was in one portion of it. The members only lounge that was nearby was nice too, though I wish they had say, complimentary pretzels. They did have complimentary Metropolis coffee, so that was nice.
