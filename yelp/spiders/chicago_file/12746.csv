Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This pizza ranks pretty damn high on my list. The Art of Pizza, on Ashland, is still higher and makes me feel more like I'm supporting local business. Malnati's: I liked the Lou very much. The girl that waited on us was quite friendly. The plates on the table were actually pretty dirty and my water cup had a piece of lettuce in it. I know these things happen but it's a little unsettling. I'll definitely go back if I'm in the area.
