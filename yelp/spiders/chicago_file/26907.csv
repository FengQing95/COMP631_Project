Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's was PACKED when we arrived at 7. We threw our name in the queue and we're seated within about 20 minutes. We ordered the Lou Pizza and a Malnati salad. The salad was awesome! Fresh bruschetta, delicious cheese bacon and olives with a great house dressing, we polished off this salad pretty quickly! The pizza looked amazing but unfortunately tasted pretty bland. The crust was delicious though. Maybe we just picked the wrong toppings because the tables around us were raving about their orders. The dining room was really tight, getting in and out was nearly impossible. Overall it was a pretty blah meal.
