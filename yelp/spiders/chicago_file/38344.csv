Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////CLASSIC RIBEYE CHICAGO CUT with WILD MUSHROOMS and ROASTED BONE MARROW - OMG, this ribeye is one of the best steaks I've eaten.  It very tender, flavorful, and my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  The mushrooms were a great accompaniment as was the bone marrow - it was buttery and full of flavor this time around.  YES, THIS IS WHAT THE STEAKHOUSE IS ALL ABOUT!  Also, for those that want steak a bit less gamy but aged, Bavette's added a wet aged bone in ribeye to their menu (we did not try this).
