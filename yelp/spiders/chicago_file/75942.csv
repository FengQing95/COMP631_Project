Little Goat Diner////Not all that impressed by this place. The coffee and food was only okay. It was so loud you practically had to scream over breakfast, the wait was also long even with a reservation - I can't imagine how long the people standing there without a reservation had being doing so. Also, the restaurant is not as allergen friendly as it appears online or on yelp. Definitely not a gluten free or lactose free friendly establishment.
