Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were seated downstairs, which while nice if on a date, was a bit dark for me forcing me to pull out the flashlight app to read the menu. Our kids had Shirley Temples, which they thought were really good. The server said they use real cherry juice in them. I thought the ice-to-drink ratio was way too high (at least 1:1), but they bring another round without us commenting on it.
