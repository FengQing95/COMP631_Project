Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////we waited 1.5 hours to eat here but it was worth it! the pizza was amazing. service was eh, though it was extremely busy and probably couldn't be avoided. they allow you to preorder if you wait a long time, which is good because the food gets thrown in the oven as soon as you sit
