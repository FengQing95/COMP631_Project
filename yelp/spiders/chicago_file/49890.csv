Smoque BBQ////Parking at Smoque can be a challenge and it is often crowded, but we've never had to wait for more than a few minutes for a table. The decor is basic, but I'd be worried if it were anything more for a place serving BBQ. The staff is friendly, and one of the owners is often walking through the restaurant inquiring about what people think about the food - a good sign as I think they genuinely want to make their BBQ better each day.
