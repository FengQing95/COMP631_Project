Little Goat Diner////I definitely left feeling like I need to give this place another shot, but the first time experience was lack-luster! I went for a birthday lunch with colleagues; service at the front door felt very rushed, and we were crammed at a smaller table for a large group. The restaurant is buzzing with activity, and it has such a cool upscale diner feel to it, but it made conversation pretty difficult.
