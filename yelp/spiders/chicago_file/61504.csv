Smoque BBQ////As for main courses, we tried the 1/2 slab St. Louis ribs, 1/2 slab baby back, an brisket sandwich. Sauces included were Memphis, NC, and a spicy sauce that came with candied jalape√±os. Overall the meal was good, but expected the meat to be a lot more tender than it was. I later learned that they only smoke their meats for around 3 hours and it's intended to be chewier... But honestly, that's not my preference. I prefer my BBQ to be fork tender and none of these dishes qualified.
