Little Goat Diner////Service wasn't great. Despite telling the hostess we needed a high chair, we were initially seated at a booth that could not accommodate a high chair (which lead to more waiting as they concurrently seated a party without kids at a high chair friendly table). I asked our server about the uniquely-titled "kimchee & bacon & eggs & pancakes Asian style breakfast tasty thing." She said that it was kimchee and eggs without further explanation. When asked if the dish included pancakes per the title, she said she wasn't sure, but then said she thought so. I asked if I could sub out the bacon and she said she didn't know without an offer to investigate. I ended up with an Indian-themed breakfast burrito which was generally good, although it included a bean salad that wasn't complementary or interesting.
