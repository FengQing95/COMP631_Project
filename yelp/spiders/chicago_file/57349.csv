Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We came in on a Wednesday evening and got sat after about a 1.5 hour wait. Our server, Erin, greeted us promptly and got us started with a pitcher of sangria (which poured us about 2-3 glasses each). While we were looking at the tapas she recommended that we start off with some pintxos, so we ordered the pintxos platter. Everything was bite size and super tasty - our favorite was the bacon-wrapped date!
