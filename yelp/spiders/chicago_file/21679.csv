Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Love deep dish pizza and this is one of the best places in town to get one. We ordered a roma tomato with spinach mix (garlic, oregano and basil) small deep dish pizza and a small Caesar salad (which feeds two easily). It takes about 35-40 minutes to cook the pizza so be sure you have time to relax and enjoy the moment. My fellow Yelper (Aliya J.) introduced me to this place a few years back when we were in Chicago so I definitely wanted to make my way back to it when I returned to the Windy City. We got great service and a window seat to boot so it was a great way to spend the lunch hour and then some. The pizza was perfecto! Still as good as it gets!
