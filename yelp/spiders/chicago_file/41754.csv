Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Does it need yet another review? LOVE LOVE LOVE! Always great food and service! In celebration of their 25th anniversary this year they gave out $25 giftcards if you turned 25, too--that's the kind of customer service I'm talking about and keeps me coming back. That and their gluten-free menu (for those special eaters in your life...) which wasn't bad either. Still my default place!
