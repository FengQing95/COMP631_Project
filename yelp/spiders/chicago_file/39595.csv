Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Would I go back if I was in Chicago again? Don't know. Still a bit peeved since we'd been looking forward to including Bavette's in our itinerary since we planned for this Chicago trip months ago. I'm upset my wife had to sit through that and I'm ticked the manager didn't seem to believe me or, if he did, he really didn't give a damn.
