Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////They also remodeled the patio style dining room which is now much cozier.  The room has exposed brick with sexy, dim lighting as well as a new updated restroom.  Be sure to make a reservation, no matter what your party size, because I have stopped in on a week night and had to wait a considerable amount of time for a table.  Best Tapas place in Chicago!
