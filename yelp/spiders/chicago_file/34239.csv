Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Fantastic food. From out appetizer down to our dessert and Irish coffees it was delicious. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the two gin martinis I had before our entrees tasted like someone had poured lime juice in them, possibly the worst I've ever had. Other than that it was a good place. Be prepared to drop some cash but it was worth it.
