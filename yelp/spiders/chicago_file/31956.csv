Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So good! We are from Texas, looking for that Chicago kind of meal, and were recommended this place by many friends. I would say it didn't disappoint. The service at this particular location was excellent. Everyone was very friendly, accommodating, and more than generous with allowing us to try Chicago beers before deciding on one. We recommend the lemon pepper dry rub wings as an appetizer & the pizza of course! I know everyone goes for the deep dish, but the thin crust is excellent too. Whatever you do, don't forget to enjoy the delicious butter crust! This is a must!!!
