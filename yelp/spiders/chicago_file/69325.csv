Little Goat Diner////One dish jumped out at me when I looked at the menu: Fish Tostadas. I immediately ordered that and a side of fries. The dish itself was delicious; it wasn't "off the wall" amazing, but I saw a bunch of different ingredients in it that made the flavorof the dish interesting. There were a bunch of different vegetables and pieces of avocado in there; could not say what the dressing tasted like. The girl next to me ordered the old fashioned mac n cheese; I may have to look into ordering that the next time I visit.
