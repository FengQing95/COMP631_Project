Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This last time did it. We were told our order would be ready around 5:45. So we wait, & wait & wait some more. Everybody else is getting their order no problem. We finally got it around 6:40pm. Not hot at all because it probably was sitting in a warmer for close to an hour.
