Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It was my first time at Bavette's yesterday & they didn't disappoint. Our server (Nick) was amazing! He gave us his genuine and honest opinion about what we had in mind to order which made it so much easier. We ordered the rib eye, fried chicken (super slept on, probably my favorite), the Mac & cheese, & fries. Every thing was perfectly prepared & brought out in a timely manner. It's probably my favorite steakhouse in Chicago so I'll definitely be going back soon!
