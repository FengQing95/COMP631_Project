Smoque BBQ////but I would say that Smoque came close to being like you find all over TX.  The BBQ sauce was more TX-like than you get at most places.  Most places seem to run to a Southern style sauce.  The only thing wrong with the brisket was that it was over-done. I could have eaten it without teeth.  I like my brisket to be a bit chewy.  Not tough, but chewy tender.  The slaw was over-vinegary.  The fries were great!
