Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I lived just down the street when Wildberry opened so I was aware of how popular it was right from the start.  After a few weeks I went, and was shocked when they said the wait was 2 hours-really??? Since I lived down the street, I signed in and went back home.  then returned at a little earlier than the time with my family-and I was NOT disappointed. The food was amazing (the berry bliss pancakes are RIDICTIFIED and portions were large) and the atmosphere was a a tad bit loud but this was breakfast with my family not an intimate dinner. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because of the wait.  Not sure if that's fair, but...just get on the wait list on yelp (but that only works if you're within 10 mi of the restaurant) since not everyone can go back home, work out and come back.
