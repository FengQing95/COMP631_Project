Smoque BBQ////In short, we ordered everything on the menu and everything was absolutely delicious.  The brisket was juicy and smokey, though unfortunately, we ordered the sandwich, which soaked up most of the moisture; order the platter.  The pulled pork was moist, soft and had just the right amount of sauce.  The ribs were perfectly done.  My personal favorite were the baby backs, which had the right combination of smoke and sweetness.  I don't think we used the sauce more than once.  The Texas sausage was a bit underwhelming, but went better with the sauce than the ribs did.
