Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////They were kind enough to try to fit us in on short notice but it was the worst table in the place. Oddly enough, the host never mentioned that the bar area is first come, first serve; when we realized that we went right in and scored a cute little private area with couch seating and surrounded by candles... so cozy!
