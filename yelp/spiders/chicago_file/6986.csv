Art Institute of Chicago////Special exhibits: Always impressive.  I always appreciate how much work and coordination it must take to put together these huge retrospectives, like the Lichtenstein exhibit going on right now.  Each special exhibit draws in pieces from private and public collections all over the globe into one place.  What you're seeing in a special exhibit is the result of years of planning.
