Smoque BBQ////Everything was delicious.  The ribs were smokey and very tender, but meaty enough to give a satisfying resistance when I sank in my teeth.  They were painted in sauce, but not drenched, so the flavor of the meat remained supreme.  The pulled pork was superb, moist and flavorful, smoked for hours and pulled apart by hand.  The brisket was not quite as good as the first two, but this was just preference - it was faultless, with a delicate texture usually reserved for fattier cuts of meat.  The sausage was great, thick and full of flavor and spices, with a good level of snap.  We got two barbecue sauces to slather on our meats as we pleased.  One was thicker and sweeter, the other a bit runnier with a vinegar tang.  Both were delicious, and I actually loved mixing them together.
