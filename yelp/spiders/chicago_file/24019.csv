Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had the personal sized classic deep dish with sausage on it. It was bland and the crust was soggy. I don't want a salt mine on my pizza but this pie needed a serious pinch of salt on it. The actual pizza versus crust ratio was terrible, almost half of what you get is soggy crust. I personally far prefer giordano's for their deep dish. Will definitely not come here again.
