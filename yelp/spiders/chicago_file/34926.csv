Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I really wanted to come here and leave a glowing four to five star review imploring everyone to drop everything they are doing and head to Bavettes right this second but unfortunately it wasnt an all around experience that deserved such a rating - the ambience and service were both outstanding and on fleek. The cocktails were good but the food - in particular the filet mignon came out underwhelming which is the main disappointment given that is the main draw. We got the fried chicken, the steak frites and the filet mignon (latter two done to medium rare). The filet came out more medium and the steak itself tasted more chewy than tender. We should have sent it back and given the service they would have been more than happy but we were in a hurry and didnt expect that this place would be somewhere we would need to send something back. That said the fried chicken, steak frites and sides were all on point but the filet did give us a bit of a downer for the night
