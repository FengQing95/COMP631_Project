Little Goat Diner////I loved the ambiance here. Our food came out in a timely manner despite it being busy for lunch on a weekday.. the service was excellent. The flavors of the dishes were complex and melded perfectly with each other. The crab dip is really rich and creamy... albeit a little too salty especially in conjunction with Ritz crackers. I would highly recommend for a cute brunch date!
