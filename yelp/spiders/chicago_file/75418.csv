Little Goat Diner////I have long been a bit skeptical of the Stephanie Izzard empire as I find Girl & the Goat very salty and overhyped, so I was surprised at how much I truly liked Little Goat Diner. I came here for a work lunch with a client. He ordered the chicken and waffles which as heavy on the egg and seemed to like it. I ordered the fatty club, which was just so delicious. It was one of the better clubs I have had in my life. I bill myself as a club sandwich aficionado as I have spent quite a lot of time overseas. And while I am a very open minded eater, I sometimes just crave a club sandwich. Little Goat did not let me down.
