Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm a big foodie and am incredibly honest in my reviews. Trust me when I say, you need to go here. First of all, I went alone. Usually when I go to a nice restaurant alone people look at me odd  , but everyone from the hostess to the busses to the waitress respected me and treated me well. I felt so taken care of. Immediately, they give you the expectations with masks and such (they do very much enforce having your mask on when your server is around so be prepared for this. My server was great and explained his etiquette right off the bat which was extremely helpful. He stood at a distance until I had my mask on but stood at a distance when checking in). The food was PHENOMENAL!!! The old fashion was a great start. Sourdough was delicious and warm. Oysters paired with theirs given sauces were perfect. The wedged salad is to die for. I promise you want to get something with bacon on it!!! Or just a side of bacon . It had a sweet sauce almost like honey over it. My ribeye was perfectly cooked and delicious. Juicy , well seasoned and the sauce paired well.  The entire time, the bussing team and my waiter made sure I had all I needed. My server paired a wine with my steak and I did not regret it. Brought home a peace of chocolate cream pie by the suggestion of my waiter and oh my goodness. Light and easy to eat. Not too overly sweet. The chocolate paired with the cream and Oreo bottom was delightful.
