Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were staying at the Fairmont and phone ordered for delivery.  An hour and twenty minutes from time of order to delivery, which they tell you when you order.  $4.50 delivery fee added to the bill was really reasonable.  Arrived on time and piping hot.  My wife got the personal size cheese deep dish.  I got the small classic deep dish and added the spinach mix.  We shared an individual house salad with reduced calorie ranch dressing.  My wife's pizza was a miss.  Didn't seem as deep, not as cheesy or as saucy as the one I had.  Mine was excellent.  Terrific, fresh tomato sauce and the spinach mix with basil and garlic was the perfect addition.  Very cheesy.  The salad was your basic house salad, nothing fancy about it but good size and crisp lettuce.
