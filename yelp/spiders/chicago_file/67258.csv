Little Goat Diner////If there are eight things that are known by Chicago, it's that "The South" is "hilarious" and "Steel Manginas" and "Fried Green Tomatos" and stuff. The food that was eaten by me when this place was visited by me was good, though was basted in this irony. Ultimately it was enjoyed by me and my date. I think that fewer Cheerwine was made to be in my glass than was was drank by me ideally but also that's acceptable I mean it can't be found by me or anyone else around Chicago so it's up to "That Little Goat" to provide it. Oops I was regrettably made to be distracted by how attractive the waittress was but mainly because of the shortest hemline that was worn by her combined with full-sleeve tattered two's that in "the real South" her momma would have slapped her ignorant for even considering adopting. Thick-cut country bacon ass, tho!
