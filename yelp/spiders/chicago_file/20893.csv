Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So if my silly little yelp review is going to help you decide if you are going to try Lou's I leave you with this. I am a huge Neapolitan pizza snob. I like my crust thin and crispy, so it's possible that my preferences are influencing my opinion. I say, Eat at Lou's and decide for yourself.
