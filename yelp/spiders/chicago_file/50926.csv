Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went ahead and ordered couple of dishes from their brunch menu and some from their dinner menu. We ordered their home-baked french toast that came with blueberries and baked apple slices, and an order of their eggs Benedict with cubed hash from the brunch menu, and then the shrimp served in garlic, olive oil, their highly-raved meatballs, and finally ending it with beef tenderloin with blue cheese plated with chips. Everything came out in a timely manner and one after the other and every single one of the dishes was perfectly seasoned and cooked. I was tempted to try their Bloody Mary because they have a Bloody Mary bar, but I wasn't brave enough to create my own. Maybe next time I'll give it a shot.
