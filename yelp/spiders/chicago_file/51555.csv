Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Deeeeeelicious!!! Everything is absolutely amazing and we can't even pick a favorite. Sangrias are always go-to, but the mojitos are fresh as can be!!! All the tapas had so much flavor, more than any other place we've been of the same sort. Hot and fresh, even with the place packed!!! Service is also so great even though they have so many people to take care of! Ham and cheese croquetas a must, as well as the spicy potatoes, beef and mashed potatoes, garlic shrimp.... Always a great time!
