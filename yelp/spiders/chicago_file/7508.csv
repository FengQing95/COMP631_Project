Art Institute of Chicago////I will never forget the first time I viewed "The Praying Jew", a painting by Marc Chagall.  I literally forgot where I was momentarily.  There was another visit when I was captivated by Pablo Picasso's The Old Guitarist, one of the most beautiful images I've ever seen.  The Art Institute also has a piece by my favorite artist, the late 19th century realist, Henry Ossawa Tanner.  Or, if you just want to relive high school Art 101, there are the classics- American Gothic, Nighthawk, Greyed Rainbow, and countless others.
