Smoque BBQ////This is a no-frills place, y'all. Don't get me wrong. You'll get friendly, efficient service, a clean table and amazing food, but you should also expect to order at a counter, eat close to strangers and fill your own drinks. That's okay though because that's how a BBQ place should be, amirite?
