Art Institute of Chicago////When you want to take a break, there's three places to take a rest and eat something - the terrace on the top floor, a little cafe on the 2nd floor and a cafeteria-like space on the basement level, which is connected to a court yard with plenty of tables. Fortunately, it was a beautiful day when we came so we got to enjoy it.
