Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The last time I was at Ba-Ba Reeba I remember being disappointed because the menu had changed and the food didn't seem quite as good.  I decided to go back because I had friends in town who wanted to see a bit of Chicago and enjoy some tapas - and since the drinks at Ba-Ba Reeba are always fabulous, I decided to return.  I'm glad I did.  We had some sangria and mojitos to get started while we waited for our reservation to be ready.  For dinner, the three of us ordered about seven different tapas.  The bacon wrapped dates were great as always!  The Spanish meatballs were a little disappointing, but were quickly redeemed by baked goat cheese and the braised short ribs.  I didn't remember them serving short ribs, so I was happy to order them!  We weren't planning on dessert, but our waiter brought over three small desserts, complementary.  It was really nice of him because the chocolate cake and caramel flan were delicious! We also managed to score a complementary round of mojitos!  Thank you awesome waiter, we walked out full and happy :)
