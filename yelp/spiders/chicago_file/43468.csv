Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I am a middle school Spanish teacher and, in 7th grade, we learn about the foods served in a typical café in Spanish speaking countries. We speak about the culture of tapas and, specifically, the famous "tortilla española."  Of course, to really experience a culture, you need to taste their cuisine. Thus, I was on a "mission" to get sample size pieces of "tortilla española" for about 100 students.
