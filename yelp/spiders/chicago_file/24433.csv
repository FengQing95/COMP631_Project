Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I understand this place is very busy , I get it 4000+ reviews. I was really disappointed with the front door receptionist or the hosts. People like her are the face of the restaurant. She should be smart and know how to entertain bunch of hungry people . We got there around 1 pm I believe, she took my cell phone number so that she could text us. She said the wait time for two is about 45 minutes. We invited ourself inside to see if we can grab a drink while we are waiting. No luck it was crazy , after sitting for 30 minutes , we noticed people were standing in a different line . My boyfriend asked one of the guest and he said " we are preordering our pizza because it takes 45 minutes to make it". At this point I was mad , how com no one told us? We go to the front door person to tell her if we can order our food because we have a flight to catch , she looks at us lost and she goes to say; oh you are up , your table is ready , I told her never got your text , off course she wrote the wrong number down . We waisted 1.5 hour waiting for Chicago must try pizza. When we went up stairs, I complained to our waiter and he said he is not sure who is up front and that he would talk to his manager. Anyhow he offered that I should get a drink because I was upset . I know he was annoyed by. His face said it all . I won't suggest to come here if you are super hungry and need to leave . Prepare to wait for a long time make sure they get your phone number correct and that you pre-order your pizza while you are waiting. It was okey , and I won't comeback here . Slow service. It is run by bunch of teenagers.
