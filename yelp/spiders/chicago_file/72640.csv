Little Goat Diner////Attempted to get breakfast here on a Saturday without a reservation (crazy thought, I know) and sure enough, the place was paaacked. I don't dig excessively long waits for brunch. Instead of waiting at the diner, I waded through the sardine-like-packed LG Bakery next door and picked up some bread and baked goods (which were great, and reasonably priced, by the way), and then immediately made a reservation to come back to the diner.
