Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For dessert, we shared the chocolate chip pizza.  We decided to tell our server to put the order in while we were still eating the pizza for fear that it would take forever to come out.  Good thing we did though, because it did take quite a bit of time.  The heat from the cookie paired perfectly with the cold ice cream.
