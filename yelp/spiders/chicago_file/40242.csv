Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I will never forget my experience here because it's the restaurant my now fiance brought me to before he proposed. This place has the best steak I've ever had. Not only do they nail it on the perfect taste & temperature of the steak, but all the accompaniments also knocked it out of the park. This isn't your Gibson's or McCormick & Schmick's, this place caters to the Millennials and they get it RIGHT! Hit up Gilt Bar for Happy Hour and then pop on over to Bavette's for an award winning dining experience.
