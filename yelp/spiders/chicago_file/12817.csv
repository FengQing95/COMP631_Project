Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Awesome pizza & service but DAMN the wait for a table on a Saturday night is almost 2 hours!  I know, they have GREAT pizza and I LOVE it but it just stinks waiting for a table and salivating while waiting.  Parking is also pretty bad in that area.  They need to get valet service.
