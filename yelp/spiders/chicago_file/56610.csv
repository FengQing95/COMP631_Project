Smoque BBQ////You don't need me to tell you what the hundreds of other reviews have. The food at this place is great. The St. Louis ribs, the Texas sausage, the pulled pork sandwiches, the cornbread, the mac & Cheese, and the french fries were all sampled by yours truly on a recent visit. It was BBQ heaven, everything was amazing and done perfectly. I can see how this place would get crazy, and I'm not sure I would have given it a full 5 stars if we had to wait hours to order, but we came here at about 11:45 a.m. on a Sunday and there was only one person in line ahead of us. We ordered, were seated right away (with a high chair for our daughter no less), and had our food all within about 5-10 minutes of walking through the door.
