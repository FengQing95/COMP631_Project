Smoque BBQ////However to our surprise the pull pork sandwich was really good and flavorful and they did not skimp on the meat. It was enough meat on that sandwich to make two. They gave two kind of sauces so I guess it's up to you to decide which one you want and just dig in. You will be in love from the first bite. The cornbread was not impressive at all. It came in an individual cup and the pepper came in a separate cup as well. I thought when they cornbread and peppers, that the peppers would be cooked into the cornbread but nope I was wrong. Instead they give you peppers that look like they belong on top of nachos in a movie theater. So I didn't care for that.
