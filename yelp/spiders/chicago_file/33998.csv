Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We arrived right on time for our 6:45 reservation and were told they were running behind and to grab a drink at the bar.  The upstairs bar was packed so we went downstairs.  We felt like we were in the way of the wait staff and other diners and generally made to feel awkward.  We finally got our drinks and took them upstairs to wait for our table near the door.  We should have just stayed there, it was the only place in the restaurant where I didn't feel like I was in someone's way.
