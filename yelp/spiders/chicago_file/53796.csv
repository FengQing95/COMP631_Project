Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If you check in on Yelp, you get a free dessert tapa per person! My friend and I shared the mini ice cream sandwiches and the butterscotch custard and it was the perfect way to end the meal. Each dish was small as expected, but very satisfying. My favorite was the ice cream sandwiches because they had housemade pumpkin ice cream in the middle, which made the little fall-loving girl in me squeal with delight!
