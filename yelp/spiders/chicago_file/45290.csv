Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It took a while for me to fully appreciate all that is Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.  From the first time I visited, I knew I liked the sangria - I've been told by a waiter there that the Black Raspberry is the strongest, and it is definitely the tastiest - but I wasn't too impressed with the food.  But I kept going back and eventually found the perfect dishes.  You may need to try several things here before you figure out what suits your tastes.
