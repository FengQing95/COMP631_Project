Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service-Right off the bat the server came over and introduced themselves and immediately stated if you have any dietary restriction please me know. I thought this was a pleasant surprise as every restaurants I go in they don't care about my restrictions, but to ask right up front is awesome.
