Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were told to come here while in Chicago on vacation to have the best Chicago style deep dish pizza! Our experience was awesome, and the food was great! We tried the wings and bruschetta. We also got the classic Chicago style deep dish (cheese, sausage, and sauce on butter-bread) AMAZING, we want to go back again before we leave!
