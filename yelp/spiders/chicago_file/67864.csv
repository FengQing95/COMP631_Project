Little Goat Diner////What a fabulous lunch! Everything we ordered was spot on and tasted perfect. It was extremely busy- but the waitstaff did a great job making sure everything ran smoothly. If you are staying at the Soho House as we were (which is literally right across the street) this was a great place to quickly grab a bite to eat. Honestly, I didn't expect it to be so delicious or that the flavors would've been so layered and thoughtful! We definitely will make a point to go back and try some other things off the menu.
