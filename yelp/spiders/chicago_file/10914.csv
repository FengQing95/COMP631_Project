Art Institute of Chicago////I have nothing bad specifically to say about the Art Institue, I've simply seen better - so I was a bit underwhelmed. It's a staple in Chicago, so I'd definitely recommend visiting. But I'd prefer the MoMa in San Francisco or LACMA in Los Angeles. I did love their collection of contemporary art although I wish it was larger and more extensive. This is an average museum that's still worth a visit. The architecture on the exterior is the best part of the museum - it's beautiful! No real complaints.
