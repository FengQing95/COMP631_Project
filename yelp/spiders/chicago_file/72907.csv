Little Goat Diner////// Shrimp sandwich - wow, soo good. the bread is so soft and on the inside and crunchy on the outside. the shrimp is not fried which i like, and the avocado is so fresh. The salad seasoning is very similar to one of the dishes at G&G [i think the pig face salad is the same, with the crunchy little bits]
