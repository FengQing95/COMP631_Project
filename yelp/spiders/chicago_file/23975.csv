Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My first deep dish pizza in Chicago was about 2 years ago. I thought it was just alright, but I felt obligated to give deep dish another try since I'm back in Chicago. We came in on Wednesday night around 9 pm and we were quoted for a 30 minute wait. Since we were rather tired after a long day of sightseeing plus all the positive reviews on Yelp, we decided we would just wait here than go to a different place.
