Little Goat Diner////A trendy, cozy, cute diner style restaurant. My boyfriend started out with a "Sure is Smokey, Burt!" cocktail which tasted like a straight up campfire. It was the strange yet very intriguing. The waitress was super informative with what we should order. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which was delicious! It was a dry pulled pork but very tasty. My boyfriend got the Los Drowned sandwich and the fries. The fries were skinny, crispy, and had a delicious smokey flavor which I've never experienced before. My boyfriend claims they are the best fries he's ever had! We had to force ourselves to not eat here for the second night so we could experience another food spot. We will definitely be visiting Little Goat again on our next visit!
