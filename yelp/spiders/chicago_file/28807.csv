Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When in Chicago, you must get deep dish pizza! Lou Malnatis did not disappoint. We got there early, around 6:30pm and didn't have to wait for a table. We did wait a little bit to get a server though. By that point we were ready to order since we knew it would take a while to get the pizza.
