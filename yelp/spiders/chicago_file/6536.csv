The Purple Pig////The BRAISED BERKSHIRE SHOULDER was one of their signature dishes and the meat was indeed richly flavorful and melt-in-your-mouth tender. One bite and I could tell it was high quality pork. Unfortunately, it was too salty and added a tad of disappointment to an otherwise perfect dish. (4 stars)
