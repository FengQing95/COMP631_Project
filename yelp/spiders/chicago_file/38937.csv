Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What a fine restaurant! The wedge salad is the best I have ever had! The bacon on it is out of this world! Then the filet mignon and mac and cheese were top notch! Their old fashioned is also very good and they can make it with any kind of whiskey you'd like. I will be coming back when in Chicago!
