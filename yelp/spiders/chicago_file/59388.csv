Smoque BBQ////Neither the ribs or brisket had been sauced before the meat left the smoker;  big no-no in the BBQ world.  Sauce should be applied about 30 mins before the meat comes out of the smoker and allowed to caramelize on the meat.  Two sauces came out with our order.  Neither was a Texas-style sweet sauce or a Carolina-style mustard/vinegar sauce.  Neither sauce was appropriate for the meats we ordered.
