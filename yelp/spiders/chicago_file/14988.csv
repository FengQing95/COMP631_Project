Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the "Deluxe" deep dish pizza on a recent trip here.  Cheese on the bottom, then the sausage and other toppings and the sauce on top.  Not too saucy so the pizza doesn't get soggy - just right.  The crust is the best part, just the right thickness, actually fairly thin for a deep-dish.  There's a good sized lip on the edge of the crust that keeps all of the toppings in place.  My only criticism is that it's a little too bland for my tastes.  A few more Italian herbs and spices and you got a real winner.
