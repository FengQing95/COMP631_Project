Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Fast forward to a few days ago when a new group of friends came to Chicago with me and we decided to leave it up to them to decide for themselves. However, it was a little tougher this time for me and my other friend that was with me the first time around. While the sauce is robust, spicy and more flavorful than Lou's, Giordanos delievered an abundance of cheese (layered to perfection) with thinly sliced pepperoni... but the crust was a little bit more dry and mealy than I remember.  On the other hand, Lou's had the most incredible buttery, flaky crust. It was absolutely delicious. I do NOT remember the pizza being so good last time. It could have been that we ordered in last time and maybe this type of pizza is better served hot, and fresh. While Lou's doesn't serve up a crazy amount of cheese like Giordano's, nor is the sauce as robust,  it's still superb! The sausage was also fantastic here (I normally don't order sausage on pizza but we ordered "the classic")  it was thinly sliced and layered so precisely with every other layer including cheese, and pepperoni. Omg it was delicious!
