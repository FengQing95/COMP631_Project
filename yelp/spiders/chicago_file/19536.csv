Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Never go in expecting greatness, right? Well- I was excited to try my oh so expensive pizza (they charge for every single topping) but was sort of letdown. I was expecting the pizza to be more deep than what we got and didn't expect it to be so hard to eat, almost needed a steak knife to cut it haha. But on the positive- the appetizers were fantastic! Get the calamari and sampler platter!
