Art Institute of Chicago////It's a snowy, freezing, wet, and cloudy day in Chicago?  Seek shelter at one of the best art museums in the country.  The museum features rotating exhibits (currently the Adjaye architectural exhibit is definitely worth seeing) and an impressive collection of American and European art.  Great pieces of Monet, Renoir, and Van Gogh's works.  The museum is huge - so even on a crowded day you don't feel like you're always fighting for viewing space.  Pictures are allowed.
