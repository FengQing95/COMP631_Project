Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were visiting and were told we HAD to have this pizza. We were warned of the wait and put our names on the list and told it was a 30 minute wait for a table - no big deal because we could also put in our order with the expectation that our pizza would essentially be delivered to our table as we were seated. WRONG.
