Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One of my favorite Chicago restaurants, each visit is consistent and the quality top notch.  You definitely need reservations unless you are lucky enough to score the couch downstairs by the bar area, but it's a bit difficult to eat while sitting on the couch.  I love that I can bring my favorite bottle and the corkage fee is waived as long as I share a glass with a fellow diner.
