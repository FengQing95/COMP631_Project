Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Nice atmosphere, I had the fresca omelette with a side of hash browns and caramel apple pecan pancakes. The omelette was very large and all the ingredients tasted fresh. The pancakes were great as well as the fresh squeezed orange juice and service. Definitely worth visiting when in Chicago.
