Smoque BBQ////Smoques meats are in fact tender. They cook them for 15 hours so they can't screw that up. But they're pretty flavorless. I mean I couldn't tell if was eating the beef or the napkin. It wouldn't have been so bad if they had better BBQ sauce. I guess that's a thing of preference, as the person I was with appreciates vinegar based sauce and I'm more fond of tomato based sauces as they have more flavor. And something strong was needed to help this poor beef. The pulled pork was nothing to write home about. I've made better pulled pork in my oven.
