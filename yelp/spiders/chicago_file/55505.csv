Smoque BBQ////if you like the barbecue this is definitely the place to go! we drove  40 minutes to get here and it was definitely worth it! I also love that they have a parking lot behind the restaurant which makes parking a breeze. I went ahead and I ordered the brisket platter with came with  three sides. the brisket was delicious, tender, and juicy. their barbecue sauce was also sweet but spicy and had a great kick to it. I also order the macaroni cheese and the cobbler. the macaroni and cheese was great,  I just wish the portion would have had them bigger because it was so good. the cobbler was a great finish to a delicious meal too, I even had to  keep my fiance's hands off of it, lol! we also sat on the patio because it is a beautiful day out which made the experience that much better!
