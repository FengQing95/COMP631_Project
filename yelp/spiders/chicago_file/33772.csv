Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our server Sarah was warm and knowledgeable of the menu when we had questions. We lucked out with being seated at a large, comfortable booth generally allocated to larger parties; some of the two-tops are a bit cozy and closely spaced. Despite being filled to capacity we were not made to feel rushed; Sarah coursed out our order nicely. Perhaps the only slight boeuf (beef) was she appeared to be responsible for a large number of tables, so she and her support staff were spread a bit thin, but still did a commendable job. I also would have liked to have had a bit more of a description of the dishes, but overall the service and ambiance was friendly and inviting.
