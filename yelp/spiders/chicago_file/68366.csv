Little Goat Diner////Overall dinner was acceptable. Waiter and staff was very helpful and friendly. After looking over the menu I think I would really enjoy having brunch there more. I am really glad I tried it. I think just because of all the other choices right there it might be hard for me to pick Little Goat again for dinner.
