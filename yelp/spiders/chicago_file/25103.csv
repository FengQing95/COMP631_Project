Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The crust on this pizza is absolutely to die for!!! This is the best pizza I have ever had in Chicago ! It is always a stop when I travel to the greatest city in the world. The staff is always friendly and even though it is always crowded, the staff is well organized. A must on your visits to Chicago .
