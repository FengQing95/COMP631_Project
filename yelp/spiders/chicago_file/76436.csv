Little Goat Diner////What took me so long to get here? Ah yes, the wait scared me. They've been open for over a year now and it will still at least a 30 minute wait on a cold random Friday afternoon. Â I put my name in (with a big sigh) and headed over to the bar area. And that's when I saw 2 seats at the bar (full menu available) with my name on them. Score!
