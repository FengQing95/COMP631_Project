Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Had a great night here celebrating my anniversary with my wife. The food was exceptional with the highlights being the garlic shrimp and chorizo wrapped dates. Excellent service for the most part but some of our food took a while due to it being an incredibly busy night! Waiting was enjoyable though because the ambiance was great.
