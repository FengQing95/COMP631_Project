Smoque BBQ////About the place in general, yes, it's packed (thanks Guy Fieri!) but it's BYOB so bring something to drink while you're in line. Both times I've gone, on a Sunday night around 7ish, I waited no more than 20 minutes for a table. They've got a very efficient system going, you get your table, then shortly after that you get your food. Â It's cheap (to me at least) and a good amount of food for what you pay.
