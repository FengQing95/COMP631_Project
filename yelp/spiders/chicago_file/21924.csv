Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////In my experience at this restaurant all of these previous reviews become invalidated. Dreadfully, the Lou Malnati's Pizzeria experience was terrible. The tomato sauce overpowered everything, I didn't order a tomato soup. My last two comments are; this pizza joint is at par to Walmart pizza, secondly, Giordano's is recommended if you are thinking of trying a new spot.
