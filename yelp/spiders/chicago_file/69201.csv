Little Goat Diner////Amazing place. We did have reservations and still waited some time. I ordered the everything Lox. So good. The everything crumpets were out of this world. I didn't care too much for the side of the egg salad. My friend ordered the French toast with the chicken. He loved it but he didn't know the eggs were sunny side up. He did not love that part. Overall good place and service was good.
