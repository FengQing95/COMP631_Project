Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Food was awesome. I had the butchers block, which was a skillet that was served in an actual silver metal skillet and not your typical skillet plate that you could find at Denny's. It reminded me of Dale and his Bodega. That epi was from Top Chef Allstars if you didn't know. I also had a side of strawberry pancakes, which are to "die for". I'm asking God (no offense to those who don't believe in Him) fotr forgiveness as to how gluttonous i have been. My girlfriend had fresh glazed strawberry crepes. I had a bite. It was well balanced, not too sweet and not too heavy.. it was perfectly cooked. Each bite made her eyes roll back like how i... Let's save that for another topic.
