Little Goat Diner////This used to be one of my favorite places to go and take people visiting, but the service has really declined.  I went today with a group of girls around 4:15.  When we arrived, there were 7 seats available at the communal tables and no one waiting.  Over the course of 20 minutes, an additional 10 people got up.  Instead of seating us, the hostess got an attitude with us and proceeded to seat every other party without a reservation walking through the doors.  I was disappointed to give my friends that experience of Chicago.  They remarked how rude she was.  We went across the street to find a table easily at Bar Sienna.  I'm not sure I'll be back... Especially not with visitors to Chicago.
