Art Institute of Chicago////One of the world's best art museums, the Art Institute includes the largest collection of Monet outside of Paris. (In the 1880s, famous Chicago millionaires like Bertha Palmer (of the Palmer House Hilton Hotel) really got into Monet and bought a lot of it. The white marble building itself was built for the 1893 World's Fair and then converted to the art museum afterwards.
