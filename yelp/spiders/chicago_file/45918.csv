Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here with two girlfriends on a Sunday afternoon. This was my first time trying tapas and I am still unsure about my feelings towards it. I was surprised at how large the restaurant is. Nice decor and ambiance. Only negative was that we were seating in what seems like a private dinning area next to a large party of 12. Their children were running around all over us.
