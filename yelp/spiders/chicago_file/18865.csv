Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Edit: over an hour after originally being seated my pie comes, had the Malnati something or other classic pizza. Was totally underwhelmed and the pie seemed a bit underdone. It's sad that the best Chicago style pizza I've had was back home in Detroit. I won't be coming back here.
