Smoque BBQ////Smoque BBQ held a high rating on the Yelp machine when I was searching for some good grub.  Fortunately for me, I went to Smoque.  When I go there, I noticed a line.  A long line.  I decided to wait in that long line until I got to the front.  I was traveling through on business, but I made friends with some Smoque regulars in line.  They shared with me that I would regret it if I didn't order brisket for my meal.  They were right.  I went right for it.  I ordered the brisket and I didn't regret it.  As an added bonus, the fries were good, the macaroni was good, the cole slaw was good.  It was all good.  The sauce was very good as well.
