Little Goat Diner////The restaurant has classic American cafe style decoration. Perfect for after-work dinner or a weekend brunch. The menu is inspired by the fusion of classic American food and different Asian cuisine. The lamb burger I ordered managed to extract the best of both worlds. The flavor is refreshing yet familiar. The only problem I had was the serving size, as a young professional in his early 20s, I am constantly starving after work and I found the portion not quite satisfying.
