Art Institute of Chicago////I have not been here in years, this was my loss. With the new addition this place is better than ever. So much to see from sculptures to fine art. I enjoyed just wandering about and enjoying all the history. It is wise to purchase a yearly pass as you just cannot do this in a day. This is a must stop.
