Little Goat Diner////It's clear that Little Goat is the product of some very experienced restaurant-industry people putting their heads together and making a simply great dining experience for their guests. Â Stephanie and her team are doing a lot of really smart things that others haven't thought of, or don't care enough to do, like accommodating those that inevitably wait a long time for a table by guiding them to the "store", where they can watch the bakers do their thing through the glass, and order a separate coffee or beer or wine, or even a delicious pastry, while they wait.
