Smoque BBQ////So yeah, Smoque fits the bill. I ordered the brisket with two sides (Mac and Cheese, and fries) and it came with coleslaw. What's nice is that they allow you to add "tastes" of the other meats. Perfect for someone like me who just has to try everything. Texas Sausage? Yes. Some of the ribs? Thank you very much.
