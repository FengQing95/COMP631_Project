Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started off with the Baked Goat Cheese Appetizer.  This is kind of just a dip to put on garlic bread.  Not much different in consistency of a melted ricotta cheese swimming in marinara sauce, it reminded me of sloppy lasagna filling that had spilled out.  The herb flavor of the goat cheese was a little more pronounced than it's ricotta counter part, but it served the same purpose.  Someone should re-imagine dish, as it's presentation is crude.  Perhaps as a breaded fried cheese with just a little marinara on top.  As it is, it has a late night rummaging through the fridge and throwing something in the microwave feel to it.  3 stars.
