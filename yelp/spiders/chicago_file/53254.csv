Smoque BBQ////This would be a 4.5 star review if the distance wasn't so great, about 45 from where I live. I have been here once so far and that day was the White Sox home opener after the game. I got the sliced brisket platter which came with coleslaw and 2 sides which I choose to be the brisket chili and the mac n cheese. I also got a taste of pulled pork.
