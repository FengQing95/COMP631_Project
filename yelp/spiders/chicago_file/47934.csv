Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here a few times and always had a great experience. I've never had to wait for a table as reservations had been made and we were seated promptly upon arrival. I've tried several of the tapas, but some of my favorites are the spicy potatoes, meatballs, stuffed mushrooms, bacon wrapped dates. I've tried a couple of the desserts. I can't remember which ones but they were decent. The white peach sangria is great. Friends have had cocktails and wine and were quite satisfied. I would definitely recommend coming here. Busy on the weekends, so make reservations!
