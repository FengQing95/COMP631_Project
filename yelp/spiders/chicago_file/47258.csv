Smoque BBQ////I have had BBQ all over the US and Smoque has the best ribs anywhere. Their rub is so good you don't even need to use sauce. The pulled pork is very good. The brisket is fair. Seems to always be over done. Â The beans are very good and their Mac and cheese is fair. Too dry actually. If you haven't tried this place you are missing a great place. The St. Louis ribs are my choice over the baby back, but you won't go wrong with either one.
