Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wildberry is a straight up breakfast cafe.  That means, aside from a selection of sandwiches and wraps, the menu is entirely breakfast based, and your beverage options are just water, juice, milk, or coffee/tea.  This is not the type of place you come for a bloody mary and a unique brunch creation, or a healthy tofu scramble (i.e. this is not Prasino).  Wildberry is the place you come when you want to fill up on the most perfect waffles and pancakes you've ever had.  In general, I typically prefer a place like Prasino where I can get a tofu scramble, have some soy sausage or veggie bacon, and sip on a bloody mary.  But when I'm feeling nothing but raw hunger, Wildberry is where I will come for a giant skillet of eggs, hashbrowns, and loaded with veggies and cheese (I ordered the Garden skillet, substituting asparagus for jalapenos) and a side of multi-grain pancakes with figs and sugar crusted pecans.
