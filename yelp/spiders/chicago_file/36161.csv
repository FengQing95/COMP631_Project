Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is my new favorite place to go when I'm looking for steak!  The Rib Eye is so delicious, and if you order enough appetizers, is big enough to split two ways (I don't like eating huge hunks of meat).  The oysters are amazing.  The ambiance is quaint and romantic unlike many other Chicago steakhouses.  Service is attentive without being overbearing or rushing.
