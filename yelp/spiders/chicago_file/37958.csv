Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This was the best steakhouse experience I have had in Chicago. I went with a couple of friends for a birthday, and we had a fantastic - albeit exhausting - time. I loved Bavette's classic, 1920s vibe. The aesthetic included dim chandelier lighting, rich brick walls, and nice, red semicircle sofas that could cozily fit a table of seven. Â
