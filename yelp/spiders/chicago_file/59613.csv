Smoque BBQ////As for the sides at Smoque, they were great too.  As a Chicagoan I'm a sucker for fresh-cut fries and these were as good as I've had -- the "small" is a huge piping-hot bag, liberally seasoned with cracked pepper but not oversalted.  The cornbread and mac-and-cheese were solid too -- very small "side" portions of each, but they were rich and tasty enough to make up for that.  I personally don't like cole slaw but my wife enjoyed hers -- she doesn't like the kind slathered in mayo, but this was vinegar-based and hit the spot for her.
