Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our waiter was certainly a charmer. He complemented our desserts, butterscotch custard and dark chocolate crema, while also adding a third one, the chocolate truffle cake, to his tab. La-la-la-lovely! Each bite was a sugary, wicked blow to the taste buds. Very, very rich! My favorite goes to the butterscotch custard! Â
