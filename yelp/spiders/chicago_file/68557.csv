Little Goat Diner////Big fan. We arrived at 9:30A this morning (Sunday) and were quoted a 45 minute wait for 4 of us. You can wait in Little Goat Bread (attached to the Diner) and grab a bloody mary, coffee, cinabun, or cactus (yes, they sell plants too) while you wait. The whole check-in process was smooth, hostess grabs your cell # and texts when the table is ready. Love that.
