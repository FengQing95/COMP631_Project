Little Goat Diner////Love every single thing about this place! The atmosphere is very open and bright with quaint and unique decor. It took me almost half an hour to choose a meal because the entire menu looked amazing! The hash browns are to die for, alone with "this little piggy went to china". Great service too, especially being so busy on a Sunday! Can't wait to go back!
