Little Goat Diner////Wonderful! Both of us ordered the spiced apple pancakes. They were stuffed with  sliced fresh apples, not the typical  canned syrupy stuff. The bacon was great.  The coffee was really good but the hot chocolate even better. Our waiter was really attentive. The Goat is usually packed (it's family/kid friendly) so I recommend reservations...which they honor with on- time seating.
