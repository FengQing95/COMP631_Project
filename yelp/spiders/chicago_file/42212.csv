Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Another after-work tapas event with colleagues (refer to previous review of Cafe Iberico). Maybe it was just me, but after a longish cab ride to the restaurant, and a wait to be seated with our large(ish) party, the restaurant didn't live up to the hype. The sangria selections were inventive- in addition to the traditional white and red, Cafe had Blood Orange and Passion Fruit available by the pitcher. The passion fruit tasted a little like kool-aid but quickly worked its magic. As for the food, the definite stand-out was the spicy potato dish, followed closely by the bacon-wapped dates (can never go wrong with bacon). Meat dishes were hit or miss. The menu overall was extensive. Had I not come here with tapas experts, it would have taken me a bit to go through all of the offerings. Even for a weeknight, the place was packed. While the ambiance is conducive for large groups, I would not recommend it for overly corporate events, as things tend to get a bit animated (raucous?) in the main dining area as the evening wears on. A good place to go once, if only to say 'I've been here' and check it off your list of Chicago dining experiences.
