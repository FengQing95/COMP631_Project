Little Goat Diner////"peppermint matty": The waitress described it was peppermint cake/brownie topped with vanilla and chocolate ice cream. That sounds amazing! But for some reason she didn't mention that hefty pinches of pepper hidden about halfway through. That brought things to a rather unpleasant end - I'm not saying that it was bad but it's definitely something that needs to be advertised so that people who don't care for spice in their dessert can avoid it.
