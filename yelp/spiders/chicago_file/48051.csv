Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food:  We came unknowingly during restaurant week.  This is one of the few restaurant week venues that is worth it.  I indulged in the short-rib stuffed piquillo pepper for my pintxos, the citrus -cured salmon tapas, the seafood paella, and the carmelized bananas.  Everything except the paella was up to par and I truly enjoyed it.  The seafood paella was just okay.  It was over-cooked and overly salty, so I was chugging water.  The seafood was plentiful, but that was it's only redeeming quality.  I much prefer Cafe Iberico's paella more.  I would like to try the other tapas to get a better gage of the caliber of food.
