Little Goat Diner////So I went on the open table app and booked a table immediately and walked back to the Black girl host who looked annoyed at us for not obliging and hiding our shameful brown selves at the kitchen door to eat our food in the dark, and they then with my reservation in hand sat us in a booth with natural light. WOW WAS THAT WAS SO HARD FOR THEM TO DO THE FIRST TIME AROUND? They had no prior judgement outside of knowing we speak English and were brown. So tell me what else could have caused such rude ignorant behavior?
