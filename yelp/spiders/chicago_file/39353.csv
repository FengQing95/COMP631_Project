Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The old fashioned here was one of the best I have ever had. Not too sweet, smooth and served at a nice cool temperature. The ribeye is a generous cut so you want to come here hungry. It was cooked to a nice medium rare, had a nice crust and not overly seasoned so the beef comes through. The sauces weren't that memorable and I would just eat the steak the way it is served.
