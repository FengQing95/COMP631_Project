The Purple Pig////The dishes made its way out of their kitchen at lightning speed. At 11:50 the entire place was sufficiently packed. I ordered the Pig's Ear (decent but would pass next time), Â the milk braised pork shoulder (AMAZING) and the octopus (my FAVE!). 3 dishes were perfect for two of us - in fact the portions are on the larger side. Topped it off with a glass of chards. Perfect last meal in Chi - thanks Purple Pig!!
