Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The North State Street location is sooooo much better. Tonight we ordered a Buffalo Chicken Salad and Deep Dish Pizza. Where do I start....I couldn't taste anything but bread and my salad was full of watermelon with the rind attached, rotten lettuce, water and steams. Lesson learned won't be ordering from this location again
