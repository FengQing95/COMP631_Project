Little Goat Diner////The service was good and the drinks were pretty tasty. I tried This Little Piggy Went to China which was a unique combo something between biscuits and gravy and eggs Benedict with a Chinese flair. (Note, those strong Chinese peppercorns are mixed in with the sauce - the ones that kind of make your tongue go numb. If you aren't a fan I would ask if they can remove them or maybe pick something else.) An overall enjoyable experience and I would go back to try some more items on the menu.
