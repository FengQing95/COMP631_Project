Little Goat Diner////Since I came alone, I got seated immediately at the counter at around 1 pm and I'm glad. I got a chance to see what everyone was ordering and it helped me pick mine! AND I could see the products of those orders... hehehe! I ended up getting the Bulls Eye French Toast which was really very interesting. I wouldn't say it was the best french toast I've had but it was certainly creative and it tasted pretty good. The brioche had an unique flavor which I suppose is due to the "sweet onion" part - it was probably the most savory french toast experience that I've ever had. I also don't read carefully, apparently, because nestled in each toast piece was a soft egg! What a glorious surprise! I really liked the eggs in a basket bit of it and they are very generous with the chicken as well.
