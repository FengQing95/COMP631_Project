Art Institute of Chicago////The building itself is magnificent.  The atrium at the entrance is awe-inspiring particularly when the sun shines in from overhead.  Many points in the museum simply have large windows overlooking the beautiful architecture of the city.  And I have to say, the architect did a tremendous job of making the addition both impressively modern but at the same time consistent with the design of the existing museum.  While there is glass all over the corridors and the entrance, the exhibits themselves are classic and tasteful.
