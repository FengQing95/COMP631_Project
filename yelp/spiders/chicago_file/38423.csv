Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We decided it might be a nice idea to split since we had all just had food and drinks at happy hour. We started off with an order of the garlic shrimp which was really flavorful and extra garlic-y just the way I like it. Then we got the bone in filet mignon, which was really tender and had an amazing flavor and marinade. For sides we shared the mac and cheese (make sure to add bacon!) and the elote style corn which was amazing. The entire meal was so delicious and to top it off, we got the chocolate cream pie which was literally the BEST dessert I've ever had. Don't come to Bavette's without trying it because you will regret it.
