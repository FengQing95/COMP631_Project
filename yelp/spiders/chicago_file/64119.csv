Smoque BBQ////Carlos greeted us with a big smile and made us feel at home. He lit up when heard we were from St. Louis (we know good BBQ) and showed us the menu and offered tips to my kids on what to eat. I had the chopped brisket and taste of pulled pork.  EXCELLENT! The large fries was huge and we should have only ordered one for the whole table.  Great food and service.
