Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is by far and away the place I recommend visitors/friends of mine try when they visit Chicago and are looking for 'Chicago Style' pizza. Â There are other great pizza's in Chicago, but if you have to ask this guy Lou's is the top and the one place I make sure I get to when I stop through Chicago (I no longer live there).
