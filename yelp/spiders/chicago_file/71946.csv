Little Goat Diner////Been here twice now! Love it. The menu is super fun and interesting, and if there's any flaw with it, it's that there's too much good stuff on it! You don't know what to choose and you worry that you'll end up enviously eyeballing whatever your friend got. Well don't worry, because I don't think you can really go wrong here.
