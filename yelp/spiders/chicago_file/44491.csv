Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The peach sangria was as awesome as I remembered, and the food did not disappoint either.  In fact, I think it was even better this time because I've become much more adventurous in my food selection and was willing to try things I wouldn't have touched a few years ago.  The two of us ordered the scallops, spaghetti squash, cranberry vinaigrette; the roast dates with bacon & apple vinaigrette; the spinach & manchego stuffed mushrooms; the baked goat cheese in tomato sauce; and the butternut squash & cheese toast, kale & apple salad.  We both agreed the scallops left something to be desired, but everything else was absolutely incredible.
