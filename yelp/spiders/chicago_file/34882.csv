Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Definitely my favorite dinner spot! Such a classic steak house and the ambiance is on point! Our waitress Amie was very friendly and attentive. The steak was juicy and not overly seasoned, the baked sweet potato was delicious with the caramelized brown sugar. I'm so glad we had the opportunity to eat here.
