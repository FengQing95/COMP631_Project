Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Hands down the BEST STEAK I've ever had! My husband and I are pretty much steak snobs and steak is something we enjoy eating and critiquing. Their 42 day dry aged 42oz bone in ribeye not only melts in your mouth and delivers a punch of flavor, it cuts like butter. One bite and you are in steak heaven. No lie. We always end up ordering the ribeye to share along with a couple sides. It doesn't matter which side dish you choose, they are all equally delicious. Service is impeccable and everyone is very attentive and eager to please.
