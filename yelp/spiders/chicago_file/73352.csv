Little Goat Diner////We were so impressed that we cancelled our reservations at a storied Italian eatery the next evening to dine at LGD yet again. Upon arrival I was red in the face w embarrassment that I hadn't asked for Justin again, but the very capable Myshel was able to arrange he taking care of us again. We aren't timid when it comes to cocktail hour and ordered a few things to get the ball rolling.
