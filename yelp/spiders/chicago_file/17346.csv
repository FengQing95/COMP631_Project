Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came in on a Saturday night and there wasn't a wait at all. Our server was wonderful and gave us some suggestions since we'd never been here before. She was juggling a lot of tables but still managed to check in on us often and made sure our cups were always full. We got the Â original with pepperoni minus the meat sauce and it was out of this world!! Will definitely be back when we are in Chicago.
