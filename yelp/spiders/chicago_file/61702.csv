Smoque BBQ////Outstanding BBQ that lives up to its hype.  It has the usual problems of a popular place - long lines and difficulty finding a seat, but they try to stick with the roadside BBQ model of ordering and then sitting and then enjoying.  It's hard to find a better BBQ place, but it is also terribly out of the way for most of my city travels.  I really wish they had a few more options for some of the prices they charge, not that I'm not willing to pay a lot for a good smoke sausage, but there isn't much else too it other than meat on your plate.
