Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place was great. The one thing that made it extra great was the waitress Lauren. She was very relaxed but also assertive. Some waiters can get real fake talking to you but not in this case. It was my first time there and she answered all my long questions(maybe annoying) just because I had never experienced going for tapas. Everything she suggested was amazing! The sangria, the food, the music, decor and atmosphere made for an enjoyable night. GREAT FIRST DATE SPOT! You can see what the other person likes to eat and then Go from there if you lucky enough to get a second date so it's easier to pick a restaurant. I had a great time.
