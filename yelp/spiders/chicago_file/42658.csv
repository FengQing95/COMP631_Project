Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First off, the sangria was incredible, and the food came out quickly - the shrimp came first and it was delicious.  But the bacon dates came next and they were STONE cold.  Now, every time I've been here, I've ordered this dish and it's come out piping hot and incredibly delicious.  These tasted like they had been sitting around for at least 30 minutes.  I mentioned this to one of the servers (not our waitress), and he brought us a fresh plate that was up to standard which I really appreciated.  The other two dishes that came out were just alright - warm, but again, tasting like they had been sitting out for awhile.
