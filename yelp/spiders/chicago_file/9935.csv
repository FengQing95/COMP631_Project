Art Institute of Chicago////As soon as you enter, there is a grand, multi-directional staircase in the middle of the museum that is breathtaking. In fact, all of the museum's architecture is truly beautiful and leaves you in awe. As far as the exhibits, there are plenty to see and enjoy. There are sections featuring Asian art, European art, American art, Contemporary art, and many more. On the ground floor of the main building, there was a miniature exhibit that allowed you to peek inside little windows to view furnished miniature rooms. One of our favorites for sure! On to the classic paintings, some of the featured artists include Van Gogh and Monet. Such a wonderful experience to see works from some of the greats. And for those who love more interactive art, there is a contemporary exhibit that allowed visitors to step on cool metallic sheets scattered throughout the floor. Definitely one the coolest museum experiences we've had!
