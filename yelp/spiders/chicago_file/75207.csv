Little Goat Diner////I went on a family brunch outing to the Little Goat Diner during a short trip to Chicago. My girlfriend and I had visited Girl & the Goat the night before and both agreed that the Little Goat was a much better dining experience. We shared the Pork Belly Pancake and Fish Tostadas. Both the dishes were very good but my favorite was the Fish Tostadas. My mom stated that the blueberry pancakes were below average and they didn't seem to look the greatest. All in all it was a good meal and I would go back to try out some of the interesting dishes on the menu.
