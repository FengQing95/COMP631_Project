Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The only negative thing about this meal was that I tried to make a reservation through Resy every day for 30 days leading up to the meal and could not get one. This was honestly the best meal of my life. We went in around 7 pm on a Saturday and were told it would be a two hour wait (which we were prepared for). My brother and I both ordered the Chicago cut 16oz ribeye with truffle Mac & cheese and the pommes frites as our sides. We also both got old fashioned's (mine was Elijah Craig and his was a Japanese whiskey) which we both loved. The steak was cooked perfectly and was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The truffle Mac and cheese was unbelievable. The pommes frites were not unbelievable, but were still pretty good because...fries, you know? This place is absolutely worthy of all of the rave reviews and I highly encourage anyone who is a lover of steaks to visit.
