Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Moved on to a table for 2.  First things first, ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio from Italy to enjoy while we wait for our food order.   Fried calamari came out hot and crunchy served with a side of marinara sauce.  We ordered the Lou's special, 3 kinds of cheese, Roma tomatoes and mushrooms (all the basics we love) and added anchovies.  It comes with a butter crust and boy was it yummilicious!!!!  I loved it!  Pizza had the right amount of sauce (I like my pizza saucy) and loaded with cheese and tomatoes.  LOVED the butter crust, so light and crispy!
