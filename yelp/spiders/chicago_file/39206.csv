Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The 16 oz filet mignon bone in was great to share, the elote corn was freaking amazing, the Brussels sprouts could turn anyone into a sprouts fan, and the duck terrine was perfect. The west coast oysters were much better than the east coast, both were briny. The shrimp were huge. The crab legs were the perfect sweetness and great in the drawn butter sauce.
