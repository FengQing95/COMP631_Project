Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had a large party and got seated immediately. The server came over and asked if we had been to a tapas bar before and if we had been to Cafe BaBaReeba. None of us had been to BaBaReeba and a few of us had never had tapas before and we got a great schpiel on what tapas was and how to enjoy it. The server went through the menu section by section and gave us recommendations and seemed genuinely excited about the food there. Food came promptly and in waves so we were never overwhelmed or waiting around.
