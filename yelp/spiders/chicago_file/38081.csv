Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We also had the pomme frites, the smoked trout salad, the creamed spinach, the Brussels sprouts, the wild mushrooms, and the broccoli. My vegetarian GF really liked the veggies. I thought the creamed spinach and the Brussels sprouts were the stand-outs. Little meager on the creamed spinach portion, though (but we had lots of leftovers).
