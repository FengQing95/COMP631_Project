Smoque BBQ////BRISKET: For the most part, brisket is a fairly lean piece of meat. It is the toughest to tenderize because it's the thickest. If the middle is warm and moist with a black/brown, but not burned crust on top that is seasoned in a highly pleasing manner, someones doing something right. Here's a test for great seasoning. Scrape a little off with your knife and hold it on your tongue. Sure, salt is an ingredient, if it seems to be the largest ingredient, your eating at a poser's restaurant. I'm not a big brisket eater and often rely on what others say. I'd like to take my buddy Steve here once a week and order him brisket. It's the only time he don't constantly run that damn mouth of his. Score 8
