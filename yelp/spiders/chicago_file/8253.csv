Art Institute of Chicago////I came here using my Citypass. There was no separate line for Citypass users and we had to wait 15 minutes, not what I had hoped for with the Citypass. Let me state I'm not a super huge art lover or anything, but I still found this place to be spectacular. It has lots of art pieces, and art related history.
