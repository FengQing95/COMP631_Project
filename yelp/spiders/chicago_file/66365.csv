Little Goat Diner////We ate there for the first time last night. No wait, which was good, and the end seets on a largely empty communal table, which was fine. Restaurant design and layout, nice. Waiter, liked him. But the food, not there at all. We had the fried pickles and onion rings, and they were just ... bad. We left at least half of them on the plate. Way too much breading. Not enough pickle somewhere in the breaded pickles. A little undercooked, too, just enough to make them disappointingly gloppy except at the edges. My $19 burger just didn't cut it, either; it wasn't at all medium rare (as ordered), and it just wasn't tasty. The burgers at Owen & Engine on Western and at Revolucion on Broadway, for example, are vastly better (and also way cheaper). And my chocolate malt, no malt flavor, negligible chocolate taste, and skimpy at the price. I doubt I'll go back. We were aiming for Au Cheval but couldn't get in and wound up at Little Goat, and, next time, I'd opt for Au Cheval or one of the may other options.
