Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////God damn I love this spot.  It makes me wish I was 60 years old in a good way (mostly so I can afford it).  It's actually a huge restaurant with two bars and seating in the basement so don't let open table scare you away- you can definitely come and nab spots at the bar on a Saturday night for a cozy dinner for 2.  Great drinks, wine, service.  I've liked the steaks but honestly think the rest of the menu outshines them given the $$$$.  The fried chicken, crab cake, mac & cheese, oysters, broccoli, lamb chop, burger are all stand out.  The seafood tower looks so good.  Bring your parents and celebrate something.  Weird quirk- they don't have tables to seat parties larger than 6 (or so they said when I called looking for a party of 8 one time) so be ruthless with your guest list.
