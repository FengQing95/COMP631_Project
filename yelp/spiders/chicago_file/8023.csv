Art Institute of Chicago////In the summer they have a beautiful, if slightly pricey (but not quite expensive), courtyard restaurant in the center of the AIC. It is absolutely beautiful and the perfect place to sit on a summer afternoon and enjoy an excellently prepared meal. Their salads and "girly-er" food are usually the best. They do have vegetarian options and a full bar as well.
