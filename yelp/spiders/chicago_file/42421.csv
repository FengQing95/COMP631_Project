Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ate here last month,bringing out of town friends. It had been a few years since we had been to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.  It was a let down in terms of food quality and atmosphere.  Perhaps the place simply grew too large over the years and management has become complacent?  We had about 10 different items from the menu, including a few recommended from the waiter.  Without specifying any one, all were of mediocre quality, based on both the presentation and taste.  This place is dark and has become blah. While this used to be a cool place to meet or bring friends, I do not think it shows well for Chicago any longer.
