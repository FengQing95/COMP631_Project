Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Downstairs has the same menu as upstairs, but the vibe is very different.  Upstairs is kind of turn-of-the-century, a little loud, vaulted ceilings.  Downstairs is shorter ceilings, candlelight, quieter, and more modern.  Not thumping music or anything, but definitely not the same vintage decor.  More like vintage touches.
