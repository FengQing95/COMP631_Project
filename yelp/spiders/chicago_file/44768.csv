Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Some of the best assortments of tapas I have had anywhere. It is the kind of food one wakes up craving. The ambiance is very authentic and lively. It is also great to through parties. My sister's wedding rehearsal dinner was here and they did a fantastic job. Service is always great and the sangria is perfect.
