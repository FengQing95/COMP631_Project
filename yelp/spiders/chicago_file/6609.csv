The Purple Pig////The food & drinks -- the cocktails are boozy and beautiful. My type of cocktail! For the food, we split three plates: the potato appetizer (not sure of the name), the tuna tartare and the octopus. Sheesh, everything kept blowing my mind. The potatoes are garlicky and savory... the parmesan sauce elevated it to a whole different level. The tuna tartare... it tasted as pretty as it looks! The tuna was soft, delicate and fresh... and the homemade circular cracker... I would buy it by the pound if I could. It was buttery, flaky and tasty... super addicting. And the octopus, order it. I don't think I've had octopus this well prepared. This dish is in a league of its own. Pesto sauce? The chef is a genius. Everything was amazing. I can't wait to come back!
