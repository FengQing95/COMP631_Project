Art Institute of Chicago////The art institure is great, with so much to see. I particularly liked the light up stairs. I much preferred this to the Louvre. Some of the modern art is really not to my taste, but all art is to provoke a reaction, good or bad! Definitely worth visiting on Tuesdays when it's free entry in the evening.
