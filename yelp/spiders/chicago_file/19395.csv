Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The place was good for pizza, definitely something different. The pizza was really big and thick. My group of 6 adults actually had trouble finishing it. But there was a taste on the pizza was odd. The juice of the pizza tasted kinda like an alcohol. But other than that, it was actually good.
