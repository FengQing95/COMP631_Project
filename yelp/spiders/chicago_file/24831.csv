Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Service was pretty good, servers did a decent job presenting the pizza and serving it, even as the crowds began to hammer in. And the pizza... we had a cheese and two of the specials. Even though I normally don't care for plain cheese, due to the insanity that is a slice of deep dish, the simplicity actually helped.
