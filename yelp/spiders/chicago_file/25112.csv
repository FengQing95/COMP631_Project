Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So we were in Chicago for five or six days and I haven't been in years. I love pizza. And I mean, I LOVE pizza. All kinds of pizza. Thin crust, deep dish, New York, Chicago, Neapolitan, whatever. I'll eat frozen pizza, leftover pizza, pizza that may or may not have fallen on the ground. In my books, even bad pizza is pretty good. And while Lou's was FAR from being bad pizza,I was just a tad disappointed, just a little let down Â and perhaps a victim of my own sky-high expectations. Oh well, it was still pizza and it was still pretty good.
