Smoque BBQ////Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn't for you. Otherwise I'd say they're worth a special trip if you're on the Northside.
