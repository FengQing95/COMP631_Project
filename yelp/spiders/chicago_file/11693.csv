Art Institute of Chicago////As a pleasant surprise, the security guards there were generally super cool and a couple were very interactive with us guests. One of them heard us wondering how a white painting, literally just white paint on canvas, was considered art. She proved to us that it would become our favourite painting by having us pose for a picture in front of it.
