Smoque BBQ////I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, I was going to get a side but saw they had a barbeque chili on the special for 2.95, it was one of the 5 best things I've ever eaten! Sausage, pork, beef I mean rockin'! The sandwich was so good too! Really can't say enough about this place. Now that I'm back in AZ I'll be dreaming of my next visit with my son-lucky kid lives less than 2 blocks away!
