Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had a reservation for 6:30 on a Friday, but we arrived a half an hour early because we had nothing better to do. The place was basically empty at that time, which was surprising. It did fill up pretty quickly though. We might not have needed a reservation at 6:30, but we probably would have by 7.
