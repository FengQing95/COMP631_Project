Smoque BBQ////The ribs are good without sauce, but with their house bbq... dear, sweet baby jesus... they could cure world peace issues. Lets just put it that way. They have amazing chew, are lean, and pull from the bone perfectly. It's not melt away pull from the bone, but it gives you that gnaw needed to strip the bone and that's amazing.
