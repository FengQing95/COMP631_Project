Little Goat Diner////After a wait at the cute coffee bar next door, where we got two pretty-good drinks, we headed over to the diner for a just-alright brunch. Perhaps starting off on the wrong foot, the service was only lukewarm from the beginning onward: Our waitress ran by to tell us she'd be right with us. And then again to say she'd be "right with us" a second time (Hey, at least she said something?)
