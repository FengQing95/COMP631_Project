Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started with the foie gras (rich and recommended as all foie gras should be) and peppered duck and goat cheese (just ok - not quite what we expected). Â The pastas were excellent - both the meatball and pasta and fettuccine Merquez were delicious and generous with both pasta and meatball/sausage. The fried chicken wasn't particularly memorable, wouldn't order it again.
