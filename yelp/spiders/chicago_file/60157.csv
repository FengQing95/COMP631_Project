Smoque BBQ////As for my pulled pork.  It was tender as can be.  Thank god it didn't taste as smokey as the ribs.  The sandwich was huge, I couldn't finish.  Fries were fresh cut tater style and plenty of them.  Slaw was good, not to much mayo (maybe there wasn't any at all) but unfortunately they were peppered with raw red onions that don't sit well in my stomach so I couldn't enjoy them.  My husband slurped them up.
