Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here on a Thursday night with a reservation for 6pm. When my friend and I arrived, the host led us through a winding path around the restaurant, when we finally got to our seats. The point I'm trying to make is, this restaurant is huge! But it was fairly empty when we got there--probably cause it was a Thursday night.
