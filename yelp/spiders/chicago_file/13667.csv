Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went on a Wednesday evening because I'd heard so much about it. Ordered a small The Lou to share with friends. The crust was delicious - crispy and buttery. But the pizza as a whole left me underwhelmed. I've never had deep dish before so take it with a grain of salt, but it was more similar to thick crust than what I thought deep dish would be. The pizza was bland and didn't have enough cheese into opinion.
