Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was pretty good and the salad was fresh. Â I didn't eat at giordano's or other well-known Chicago-style pizza joints so i can't use that as a point of reference. The only reason I'm giving them a solid 3 and not higher, is the atmosphere. It just seemed like you're in a basement.
