Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started with some oysters and duck terrine that were average and a wedge salad that was very large with delicious bacon.  Then I had the ribeye which was the fattiest piece of meat that I've ever been served, especially at a restaurant of this quality.  I was shocked that this pice of meat was even served no matter what the price.  If the waitress ever came back to our table I would've returned it.  However, I didn't see her until the end of the meal and told her then.  She didn't seem to care about the food as she was just trying to get us to order another drink.
