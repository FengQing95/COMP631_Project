Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I haven't been in the mood for tapas in a long time. I have to say that the menus usually exhaust me. LOL. But our good friend suggested we meet here for brunch, so we happily gave it a try. My husband is always excited to see any kind of Benedict on the menu, so he went with that. One of my favorites is what I usually like to get anywhere, bacon wrapped dates! These are extra tiny and super satisfying! My other favorite of the morning was the ham croquettes! I loved how moist and flavorful they were!
