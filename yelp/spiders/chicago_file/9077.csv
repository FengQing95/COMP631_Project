Art Institute of Chicago////Accessibility to the public overall I rate as "mixed", but it is very good with a few exceptions. I, like many of the museum's visitors, enjoy fine art pieces on a casual basis. The museum has its gallery walks and express talks, which are free group walks to view a specific piece or pieces, led by a volunteer docent or frequently, even by a staff museum educator. Thirty years of occasional lunch hours on these walks has, through my education, greatly increased my enjoyment of the museum experience.
