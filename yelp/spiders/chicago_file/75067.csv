Little Goat Diner////Sean delivered in service and nudged me toward the Sloppy Goat over the Goat Burger. Right on! Succulent and served on a squish squash roll (buttery brioche) with tangy slaw on top. Although I loved the spices, this made the goat more subtle in taste - if there's a way to make the goat more prominent, just imagine. Wait, there's more. The Corn Elote side dish was heaven...fresh grilled corn sliced off the cob and I'm guessing tossed in a creamy chili sauce with a squeeze of lime and a sprinkling of cheese. Crunchy, spicy, nutty and tart -- no better way to taste the final days of summer.
