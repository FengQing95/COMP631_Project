Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Well today I discovered I was charged $80.67. I texted my best friend who confirmed she was ALSO charged $80.67. So I'm wondering since when does a restaurant charge double the check? My BFF called and spoke to a manager who apologized and gave some explanation about how their system always does that when you pay with a credit card but it should clear up n a couple of days.
