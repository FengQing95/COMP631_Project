Art Institute of Chicago////I went there during the holidays and as a first time Chicago visitor, I must say this is definitely a must-see. Their collection is so huge and diverse, you'll walk into rooms that lead to further rooms just like a maze full of artworks by world-renowned artists. For the first time I saw the paintings that my professors discussed back in college years ago. Such a surreal experience. If you love art, expect to spend at least 4 hours here.
