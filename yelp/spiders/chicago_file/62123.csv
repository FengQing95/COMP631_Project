Smoque BBQ////That being said, the food is very good. Flavors are excellent. Why, however, has food been received cold or room temperature, if it's coming from the staff to me? I don't know, but about 1/3 of the time, that's happened. I will say, the staff is friendly even as they rush people from one position to the next. They are handling high volumes of food and people, so it's to be expected in such a small space.
