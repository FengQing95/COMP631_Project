Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////First time Â at this restaurant and the food was great!! We started off with the maine lobster. It is served cold with butter, cocktail sauce, and dijonaise. The butter was served cold twice (it supposed to be hot). But the portion was big and enough to share for the table.
