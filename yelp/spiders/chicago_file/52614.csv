Smoque BBQ////I had the sliced brisket, which was very tender and delicious--I would definitely recommend it!  You get to choose two sides with the entree (standard bbq sides: baked beans, corn bread, , mac 'n cheese, etc.), plus the coleslaw.  If you like BBQ, this is definitely a place to check out!
