Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered a personal sized deep dish and a salad for delivery tonight, and probably won't be ordering from here again. The pizza was decent, which is why I gave 3 stars, but the salad dressing was completely spilled in the bag. Not only did it make a mess, but I didn't have any dressing for my salad...
