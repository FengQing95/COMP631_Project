Smoque BBQ////I've had the pulled pork sandwich and the sliced brisket sandwich with all of the different sides.  Everything on this menu is exceptional.  Even the slaw is good for someone who doesn't really care for coleslaw.  The meat is savory and tender with just the right amount of sauce.  They offer you a cup of additional sauce if you want to add more.  All the food is served on a metal cafeteria like plate with a sheet up cooking paper.  A nice touch to the scrappy eat with your hands kind of meal.
