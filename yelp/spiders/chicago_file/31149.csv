Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I already had some pretty high expectations of the place and was doing my best to not get my hopes up too high.  Walking in mid-afternoon on a weekday the place was already very busy.  Asked to be seated and was also asked for my order ahead of being seated (genius really).  Picked the classic and waited to be seated.  Only waited about 10 minutes and then another 25-30 before the pizza came out.  It was fantastic, nothing showy or fancy, just simple ingredients that made the perfect pie.  I'd say the thing that really separates Lou's from the other is the crust, so buttery, cooked to perfection and really brings everything together.  Definitely the winner here.
