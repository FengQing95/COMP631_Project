Little Goat Diner////{pork belly pancake}    most anticipated but most disappointing. Maybe the cut of the pork belly was wrong as it was not tender and absolutely did not melt in my mouth. I also did not appreciate the scallion pancake that was on the harder side. Saw many people who ordered this and were blown away. I guess you just have to bear your own risk.
