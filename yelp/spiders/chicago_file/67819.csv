Little Goat Diner////Thank god for the vegan menu! This was our second time coming here and it was an even better experience! The nachos and cheese fries were DELISH!! I highly recommend them! The veggie burger was the best we've had! The veggie rice was okkkk... More veggies than rice. Â The veggie quesadillas were also really good!
