The Purple Pig////Amazing food and taste. Popular spot to eat in Chicago and definitely worth the wait. Get there early to make sure your wait time is less since they do not take reservations. Â Not one plate I had was disappointing. Great wine selection as well. Plates come out at the chef prepares them to allow food to be as freshly cooked as possible. The team working there is a synchronous machine making your experience seamless.
