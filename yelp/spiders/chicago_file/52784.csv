Smoque BBQ////I have to say that Smoque has changed my mind about not liking BBQ! So when I say how great the food is you can be sure it is! I was amazed at the amount of people that were waiting and already served by the time my husband and I arrived.We were greeted by the owner and the employees all looked happy as it showed in their inter-action with each and every customer.
