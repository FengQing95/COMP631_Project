Little Goat Diner////We decided to share an appetizer of the lump crab cheesy dip with ritz crackers. It was good, especially on a freezing cold night, though we ran out of crackers and had to settle for using our utensils to finish the remainder. For my entree, my buddy had the sloppy goat with an order of fries and I had the fried chicken which was served over mashed potatoes and gravy. We both enjoyed our dishes but thought the prices were a little high given the portion size. The fried chicken was $22 and included 4 pieces of chicken; however, they were on the small side. I partly ordered it thinking it would be a large amount and I would have leftovers when in reality I had no problem finishing it. My friend thought his sandwich would have been a better deal if the fries were included.
