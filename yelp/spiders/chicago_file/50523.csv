Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. They have the best tapas!  Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba's atmosphere is dark and romantic with soft lighting. Service has always been superb.  Sangria is fantastic.  Must try patatas braves, goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, garlic shrimp, and garlic potato salad.  Enough gluten-free options to satisfy the mother-in-law as well. I visit every time I return to Chicago. LOVE IT!
