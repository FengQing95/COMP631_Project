Little Goat Diner////Had the eggs and hash browns. My friend had the Â French toast with chicken. Mine was good and simple. I only give 4 stars because they didn't have any chicken sausage or turkey sausage. But the hash browns were delicious. The French toast and the chicken were so good. Not sure if I would go back but it was good service.
