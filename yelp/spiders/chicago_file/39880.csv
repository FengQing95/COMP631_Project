Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////All the hype about this place is true. The best restaurant in Chicago hands down. It is more on the expensive side, but well worth it for celebrating special occasions. It is super difficult to make reservations so definitely make them months in advance for a decent time. You'll probably still get a late night reservation around 8PM even if you try to reserve in advance.
