Smoque BBQ////Good BBQ here, but "Mike" and the team don't pick up the phone.  Since the line to order is usually stupid silly, I tried to phone in my order, but no one would pick up for 30 minutes.  I tried and I tried, and then I tried to leave Mike a message just to complain, but even then I just get dropped from the phone enroute to Smoque.  Here's the rub (no pun intended), when I finally got here the restaurant was half full and the line was not that long.  What the faaaaaaah?  I know the ribs are good, but do I need to kiss your ass to get food in my belly ?  I think NOT.  PLEASE GET A BETTER PHONE SYSTEM IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS.
