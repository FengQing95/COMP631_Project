Little Goat Diner////We got the shrimps and grits and the apple cinnamon pancakes. Both were delicious. The pancakes were sweet but not too sweet and the granola was delicious on top. My husband's shrimps and grits were good. Like others, it's not necessarily the food for the four stars but the value. The service was slow and I know it is busy but I like my coffee filled up within ten minutes of it getting empty when I'm having breakfast. Would go again but know who to bring and who not to!
