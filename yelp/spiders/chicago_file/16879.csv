Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Where do i even begin. I am from California on a road trip, decided to stop here and grab a bite, one of the greatest decisions I have ever made. Amazing food! Amazing staff specially our server Laura! Had a great time! The food is beyond great! Ate so much, everything was amazing except the wait, and that's because I hate waiting. But it was absolutely worth it! Garlic bread was so good. The pizza was just the best I have ever had, I don't think it could get any better, and remember to look for Laura, she's very helpful and a great server.
