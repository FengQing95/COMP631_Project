Smoque BBQ////I like BBQ. It holds such memories for me. Lazy, hazy summers, burgers, the charcoal, fun times with friends.... yea forget all that, I have a new one. For months I thought of Smoque. I heard about it, talked to people about it, wonder if it could ever hold up to my hopes and dreams. I went a little hog wild and had about half of the menu and it all good. I had the following: pulled pork sandwich, chopped brisket sandwich, baby back ribs, mac and cheese, fries, cole slaw, beans... and it was GOOD! Damn skippy it was awesome. I love how they put the sauce on the side, because I wanted to try the meat on its own, which was tender, moist, succulent and falling apart. I do have to vote for the chopped brisket as my favorite. The sides are limited to just the top favorites, but the beans win out as my favorite, how can you argue with beans that have meat in them?! Be aware, you may have to go early, they tend to run out of certain meats. I will be back, again and again and again.
