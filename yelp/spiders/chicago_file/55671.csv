Smoque BBQ////Please know before you go in, this is not a typical restaurant with waiters and waitresses that take your order and bring you your food.  You walk in, place your order, and they yell your number when its ready.  Your food comes on a huge metal tray covered with butcher paper, just the way God intended.
