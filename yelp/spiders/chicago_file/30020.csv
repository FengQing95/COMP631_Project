Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The restaurant sells both deep-dish and thin crust pizza. They come in four sizes from personal to large (serves 4). The standard pizzas have simple ingredients: cheese, sausage, and pepperoni. The cheese comes from Wisconsin, the sausage is local (not sure about the pepperoni), and the tomatoes come from California. They have a veggie deep-dish as well as their trademarked "Buttercrust" which you can add at an additional cost ($0.75 per pizza) plus over 10 additional enhancements/toppings if you so desire. In addition to pizza, they have appetizers like bruschetta and calamari; soups, salads, pastas, sandwiches, and desserts.
