Smoque BBQ////This is our major complaint about Smoque. It was not overly busy the rainy, Wednesday evening we went (not like the descriptions of other reviewers). Yet, people were still seated, cafeteria-style, right next to one another. Literally. I could move my elbow a few inches and jab my neighbors on either side of me! It was noisy. M and I could not have a conversation. That characteristic alone is enough to keep us away from Smoque. After all, if we're going to travel out of our way for food, we'd like to savor the experience with a dollop of conversation.
