Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Delicious pies and great service. I was visiting for a day and needed my fix of Chicago famous deep dish, I do not regret having this be my only destination. The Malnati salad was also very tasty, highly recommend if you want something salty and savory. Great for groups and come with a huge appetite.
