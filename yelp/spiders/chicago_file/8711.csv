Art Institute of Chicago////It was a Saturday around noon so I expected there would be a huge crowd.  Indeed, there was a huge line going out the main entrance to the Art Institute on S Michigan Ave.  I decided not to go in since I didn't want to wait in line for 324234243 hours and walked around the block to check out Millennium Park (which is gorgeous).  Anyhow, upon rounding the corner to E Monroe St, I noticed that there was, in fact, a second entrance to the museum through the modern wing and the line was very, very short!  Therefore, using my powers of deduction, I surmised that a visit to the museum might, after all, be feasible and painless.
