Smoque BBQ////Belief the hype.  The best barbecue I've ever had in Chicago.  The owner borrows from all of the great American barbecue traditions, which creates a best-of-the-best of each kind of meat.  Like, central Texas brisket, Memphis-style pork ribs, and North Carolina pulled pork.  All of the sides are spot on, too.
