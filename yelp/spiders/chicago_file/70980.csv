Little Goat Diner////Split a reuben and the fried pickle plate + onion rings. Rings and pickles had a light batter and I liked the curry aioli thing it came with. Reuben was a real good sandwich. High quality meat and a sandwich that i'd order again. Sat down at the counter at 7pm on a Friday with no wait.
