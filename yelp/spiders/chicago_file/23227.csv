Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was in town for a conference and didn't feel like venturing out so I ordered delivery. I loved the online ordering and that I could customize my pie right down to how done it was. My order came earlier than promised and was piping hot. The personal pizza really hit the spot. Prices were spot on, not too high for the food you get. I'll definitely hit them up the next time I'm in Chicago!
