Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When in Chicago, one must try a Chicago deep dish pizza! ... so we relied on Yelpers and they didn't steer us wrong!  It was good to know that the pizza's take a while (30-40 minutes per most Yelpers) so we started with a Spinach Salad with the goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette on the side with tomatos.  Our waiter Jaime was super friendly, welcoming and helpful when we asked for menu suggestions.  We decided on two personal pizzas: the Chicago Classic and a Custom Spinach mix (spinach, garlic, onions & basil) on the buttercrust.  The pizza's did take about 30 minutes but definitely worth the wait. The buttercrust was like no other pizza crust we've ever had.  Not doughey and filling but crusty/crunchy much like a corn meal crust.  Loved it!  The toppings were very well distributed, not too heavy on the cheese or meat.  We both had tap water for drinks and the bill (without) tip was $29.84.  Can't beat that!  We're fans!
