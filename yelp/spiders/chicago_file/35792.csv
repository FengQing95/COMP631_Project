Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've been to a good amount of steakhouses in Chicago, and this one is easily my favorite. The atmosphere is perfect and so is the food. Started with a dozen oysters, and their presentation was just as great as their taste. Followed them with a bone-in ribeye, which was cooked to perfection. Hash browns and creamed spinach for sides, and both were delectable. All the while, the staff was extremely helpful and friendly.
