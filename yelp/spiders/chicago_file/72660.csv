Little Goat Diner////I haven't tried the food, so I can't really speak to that, but I did come here for a rooftop Oktoberfest party, and it was great! I didn't even realize they had a rooftop, but the space is really nice during the summer and I love restaurants that partner with breweries to throw fun events. The wait was pretty crazy, since it was first come, first serve, but when we finally made it up, it was well worth it. When summertime rolls around again, I know where I'll be!
