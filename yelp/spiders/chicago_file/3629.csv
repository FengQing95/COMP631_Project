The Purple Pig////NO reservations and always crowded. TOo much hype because it's an old establishment?  We ( a party of 4) got lucky when we showed up around lunch time and didn't have to wait.  Yes, they sat us at a communal table but who cares?  we got to know our neighbors and saw what they ordered.
