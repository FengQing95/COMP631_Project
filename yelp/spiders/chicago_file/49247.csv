Smoque BBQ////BBQ is huge in my family. The talent is high enough that I don't go to Chicago BBQ restaurants, they just can't make the cut. Smoque is the only place that can do ribs/sandwiches on par with my old man. If Memphis style, dry rub, lightly sauced with good, slow cooked smokey flavor is your style, this is the spot.
