Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I would rate this place 10 stars if it was available. Phenomenal sangria, its the first thing people rave about when this place is mentioned. All the flavors are awesome.....the spicy potatoes, curry chicken, and short ribs are all totally delicious. Service has always been pretty good nothing overly special. Definitely recommend reservations here always, its always packed. Can get a bit pricey after a few pitchers of sangria and the food but totally worth it. The banana carmel whatever dessert too is great. Go go go here!
