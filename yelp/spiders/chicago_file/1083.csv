Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////My husband and I stopped by while we were in town for a few days. There was a long line, but we heard such great things, we decided to wait. It was well worth the wait! I had the red velvet pancakes and they were AMAZING. I thought I was going to be having dessert for breakfast, but it wasn't overly sweet. My husband had the Mexicana Skillet. It was packed with flavor (the chorizo made the dish) and he enjoyed every last bite! Highly recommend it.
