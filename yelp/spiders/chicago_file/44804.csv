Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Next, we ordered some seafood and meat. I must say, the grilled squid felt like it was missing something...it needed good squeeze of lemon. However, the ahi tuna with meyer lemon, olives, capers, and tomato was just AMAZING. It had a slightly crunchy exterior with a very juicy and flavorful raw interior..and I must say, I've never been much into olives and capers because they can really overpower a dish, but the combination was perfect. There was a good balance of saltiness and sweetness from the olives/capers and tomato and nothing too overpowering.
