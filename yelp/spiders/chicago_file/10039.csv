Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute doesn't seem as big as Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC but I like it better because it is a succinct representation of various genres of art that can be seen in one day. My favorite parts of the museum are the miniature rooms and paperweights in lower level, and Nighthawks by Edward Hopper.
