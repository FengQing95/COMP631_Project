Little Goat Diner////The macho nachos and goat chili cheese fries which were a REALLY good for something that seems so simple and great finger food to share. Had the Moscow Goat as a beverage which was tasty but felt like it could have been "done up" more. I understand this is a diner, but it is a $15-$20 entree plate diner. Which leads me to my next point: our waiter was one of the least friendly I have had in Chicago. Every time he came to our table we appeared to be a hassle to him. Again, diner atmosphere (go to a Jersey diner and try to find a friendly waiter) and prices aren't too expensive, but also aren't diner prices so let's act like we give two hoots (or bahhhs).
