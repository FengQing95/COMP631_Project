Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////-If you are celebrating something special, they can personalize your menus by putting something on top. I called in a week ahead and I had ours say: 'Happy Birthday, Faraz!' They were very sweet about it over the phone. I also pre-ordered dessert and they went over the choices over the phone. It was brought right after we were done with our entree portions.
