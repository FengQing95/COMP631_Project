Little Goat Diner////Now on to the food.. for our sides, we ordered goat chili cheese fries - AMAZING and mac and cheese, which was a bit disappointing, it was pretty bland... so didn't eat much of that. I ordered the burger, which was tasty.. and my husband ordered a roast beef sandwich and the spanish omelette.. he liked both and said it was the best omelette he's ever had! I've heard a lot about their Â chicken and french toast.. so that's what I'm going to order the next time I go! Unfortunately, I ate too much and didn't have any room for dessert.. so hopefully next time... since I'm sure I'll be going back soon!
