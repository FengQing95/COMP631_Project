Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Food was basic, service was ok, wait to get a table was long. All the food sounded good, but the dishes were not executed well. The plating was sloppy and the food lacked flavor. None of the food was hot. The beet salad was very odd looking and was over dressed. The location has potential, but the food need improvement.
