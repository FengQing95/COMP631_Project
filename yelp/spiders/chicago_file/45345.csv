Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////-This place always seems to have a wait even on a Monday night so I'd highly recommend reservations. Â It also means that I wouldn't recommend meeting here for a drink at the bar (i.e. on a date) around dinner time because it's packed with people waiting for tables on any night and pretty loud.
