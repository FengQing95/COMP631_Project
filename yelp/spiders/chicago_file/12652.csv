Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Overrated, but still pretty good.  The sausage is under-seasoned for my taste, and my wife didn't like the tomato sauce.  The butter crust is nice, but this pizza is so intensely filling, you don't get to much of the butter crust in the first sitting, and it gets soggy when it sits around.  Lou Malnati's did not live up to its reputation.
