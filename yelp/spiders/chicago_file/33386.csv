Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was Amazing!! The bacon tomato watercress salad was delicious, the bacon melts In your mouth, my duchess steak was cooked to medium rare perfection, the sweet potato and Brussels sprouts sides were delicious.  Classic cocktails and classic vibe.  The star of the night was our server Brandon. He is hands down the best server I have ever had!! He was attentive, funny, kind and every other positive descriptive word.
