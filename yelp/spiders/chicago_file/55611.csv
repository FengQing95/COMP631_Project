Smoque BBQ////Now the positives: my husband and I each ordered the brisket plate. We were in agreement that it was the best brisket we ever had. The sides were also very solid: we got beans, mac and cheese and cornbread. I thought the beans were the standout (I pretty much drank the extra sauce in the cup at the end) and my husband thought the mac and cheese was the best. All of the sauces were fabulous as well: we stuck with the Carolina and the "Spicy" Memphis.
