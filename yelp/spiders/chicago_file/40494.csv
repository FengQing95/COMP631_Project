Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is a must go to especially if you're in the mood for bone marrow. I kid you not. Pics speak volumes. Best I've ever had. Fried chicken, Caesar salad, Elote are also delish. Will be returning soon. My 3rd time in 6 months lol. Service and ambiance is also wonderful. Portion sizes are solid!!
