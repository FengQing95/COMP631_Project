Smoque BBQ////Still there is one meaty reason for Smoque and their ilk to ignore my review and my advice... they have great reviews and tons of customers.  This leads me to acknowledge that there is an entirely different way of preparing BBQ ribs which a whoooooole lot of people love and appreciate...the Northside way.  To everyone who enjoys Smoque and their buddies - enjoy!  Eat it up!  Sop it up!  Love it!  I truly envy you in your bliss.  Whatever you do, do NOT go to the Southside and eat real BBQ, such as at Lem's on 75th, as you will find yourself in my position...forced to drive 18 miles for enjoyable BBQ ribs.
