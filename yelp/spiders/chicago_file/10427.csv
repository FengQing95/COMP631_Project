Art Institute of Chicago////My favorite Chicago Museum bar none! Tripadvisor has also agreed and has ranked the Art Institute among the best in the world. What's great about this museum is that it not only houses the most famous artists: Picaso, Greco, Van Gogh, Renoir, Monet, etc. The actual architecture of the museum is a classic landmark within Chicago! I believe it was build for the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 so it has that classic Beaux-Arts architectural style. The curators do an amazing job of switching exhibits throughout the year to exhibitions that are both culturally significant and relevant to today's society. The modern wing is beautiful with it's own cafe and restaurant (Terzo piano) upstairs! Tip: become a member and save on the restaurant, complimentary beverages, and be the first to know about upcoming exhibitions! Plus your membership can include guided tours and discounts. Â The modern wing also hosts first fridays which is absolutely a great social event with music, dancing, and small bites. There are gardens among the grounds as well that include fountains -ton of weddings are held here. Hands down a must see museum if you're in town and like art and learning! Thank you Chicago Art Institute!!!
