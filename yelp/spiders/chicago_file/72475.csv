Little Goat Diner////Stopped in on Saturday after work. Got in before the dinner crowd. Cute spot! I love the diner vibe and that family's and dates were all around. I got the Blue plate special, scallops in a pork broth with Brussel sprouts and a sweet potato purée.  DELISH. Mi amor got a burger which was tasty and cooked perfectly. He likes them medium rare. And we split the chili fries. Cecilia was our server and was awesome, I love me some good service! Price point is what you can expect being off Randolph street. Will come again for breakfast that they serve for early dinner as well!
