Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Hands down the best deep dish there is out there because of it's delicious crust and sauce.  These two things definitely set it apart from all other deep dish pizzas.  I've been 3 times and everytime I went back the pizza was just as delicious as I had remembered!  The prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere was very fun and energetic.  Definitely a good palce to go with family or friends.
