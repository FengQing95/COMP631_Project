Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////* Royal Lump Crab Cake. Again, overrated. Ok, there wasn't actually any rating on this dish but when you pay these kinds of prices you expect more. Andy doesn't "get" crab cake. And after this dish I cannot blame her. IMO, you need to have massive chunks of crab jutting out the sides of the crab cake and screaming, "Someone just slapped this together right from a dead cooked crab." It needs to have chunks of crab meat. A crab cake that is pulverized into a patty and served like a hockey puck is fodder of the Jersey shore. Not so good on this front.
