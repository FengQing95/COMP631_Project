Art Institute of Chicago////After visiting some international art museums this past year, I can definitely vouch for the Art Institute's status as one of the top museums in the world. We recently visited to check out the Van Gogh's Bedrooms exhibit. The Art Institute did an amazing job curating the show, managing traffic flow, and allowing the pieces to tell their story. I loved getting to see the trinity of paintings together and seeing some of them for a second time (Van Gogh's chair, Bedroom #2) while on loan from the National Gallery in London and the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.
