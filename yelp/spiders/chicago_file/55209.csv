Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Who doesn't love tapas. Amendment: who doesn't love tapas at a place that has 5 varieties of sangria. My sister and I were in the area, and it's her favorite restaurant. We didn't have a reservation, but we thought we'd try out luck. At 5:15 on a Saturday, we were seated no problem. We found our table and immediately were presented with a basket of rustic bread- crusty outside, soft inside. And that was just the bread, friends. First order of real business was ordering sangria. I'm not one for sweet drinks, so we went with the Cava variety. It was pretty good. Still a little sweet, but not bad. We ordered a whole pitcher for 2 people (ambitious, I know). It was a lot of carbonation considering how many glasses we ended up having, but tasty nonetheless.
