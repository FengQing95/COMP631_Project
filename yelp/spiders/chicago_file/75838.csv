Little Goat Diner////I could not have been more disappointed with the service today at Little Goat Diner. I'm a vegetarian Â and I keep Kosher, yet was brought an omelet with tons of ham tucked inside--even though the omelet was supposed to be completely vegetarian. In fact, I even had a lengthy conversation with the waiter about how I was a vegetarian.
