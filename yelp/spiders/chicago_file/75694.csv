Little Goat Diner////I've been wanting to come here for a while. I finally got a chance to come for dinner. I arrived around 5pm on Saturday and there was a table available immediately. The atmosphere is neat with an upscale cafe style appearance. It would be a good place to bring guests from out-of-town.
