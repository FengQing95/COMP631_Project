Art Institute of Chicago////As for "Membership" - it begins the day you sign up and lasts one or two years. There are different levels...many perks, to name a few: You receive a discount if you use one of their designated parking lots.  And don't worry about having to haul your load...even the bag check is "no charge" if you're a member. Also, there are museums with reciprocal memberships across the nation, meaning that admission is covered there as well.  I'm free to roam!
