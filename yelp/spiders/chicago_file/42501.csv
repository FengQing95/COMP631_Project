Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The cons: The spicy potatoes with tomato aioli. The aioli was again delicious here and was definitely the star. The potatoes kind of tasted like homefries. They were on the well done side, so for those of you that don't like almost-burnt food, stay away (I happen to love it). What I didn't love about this dish was the MASSIVE AMOUNT OF OIL that was in the plate. You literally saw the red oil seeping out of the potatoes as you speared them on a fork. You know there's too much oil when an Â INDIAN person is dabbing the food in an extra towel.
