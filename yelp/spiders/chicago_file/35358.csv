Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The restaurant is elegant and cozy at the same time.  Loved the dark wood and lighting.  The old fashioned's were excellent.  The filet was very good but I must say I have had better elsewhere.  Over all worth trying, may not go back though because I know I can get better steak at other restaurants.
