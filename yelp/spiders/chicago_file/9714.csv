Art Institute of Chicago////Art Institute of Chicago. The exhibits and art mesmerized us when we traveled to Chicago during our break. This was definitely one of the best museums we've been to. The price itself is very reasonable and with the price, it's worth it. However, the special exhibitions are an extra $5. Since this is a museum, flash is NOT allowed.
