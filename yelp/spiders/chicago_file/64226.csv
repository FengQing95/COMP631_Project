Smoque BBQ////I kinda wish I could have sat outside and eat but I was in a rush. My friend and I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and cornbread with peppers based off the recommendation of a complete stranger.. Yes sometimes I let a stranger tell me what I should try but it doesn't mean that I will always do it..
