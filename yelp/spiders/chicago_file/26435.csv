Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I took my friend's son out for pizza.  Everything we ordered was very good.  The restaurant wasn't packed and it was a weeknight.  I was concerned about how long it took to be served since we didn't order a deep dish pizza.  I did get a little impatient, but overall everything was very good.  My friend's son enjoyed the food.
