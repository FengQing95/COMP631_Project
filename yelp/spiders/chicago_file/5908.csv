The Purple Pig////Highlight for us was the Potato Ice cream which are potato chips topped with savory flavors (caviar, salmon roe), with a side scoop of vanilla ice cream. The harmony of the sweet & salty will surprise and delight you! The sardine dish was okay ... not the juiciest or freshest, but then again we're in Chicago not Lisbon.
