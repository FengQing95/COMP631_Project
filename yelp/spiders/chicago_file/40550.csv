Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Exclusively a review for desserts. I feel like this is a much slept on secret that no one does. You can walk in or call for an order of chocolate pie or carrot cake. Bavettes is a steakhouse, but definitely don't sleep on the dessert! The chocolate pie is phenomenal and great tasting. It is a bit dense, so one order can definitely be split among 2-3 people. Carrot cake was great as well but very sweet. If you ever go to Bavettes or are just feeling a nice craving for sweets you can swing by and pick some up!
