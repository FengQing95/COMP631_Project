Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place was simply amazing for a weekend brunch. Start by mixing your own Bloody Mary to your liking. They have all the fixings you could possibly want in your drink. Add a beer back for $1. Order a pitcher of sangria to share with some friends. The tapas were all so good. My favorite was the grilled octopus. I never knew octopus could be so soft to the point that it melts in your mouth. The fried calamari were great. Bacon wrapped dates give you something salty and something sweet. Lamb kabob was tasty. Top everything off with some dessert. I very much enjoyed my flan. You can't go wrong with brunch here. Just know that you'll have to wait to get seated but you can always grab a seat at the bar first-come first-served.
