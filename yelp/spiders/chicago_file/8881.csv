Art Institute of Chicago////At the end of the Mag Mile and past Millenium Park across the street from the businessey buildings...a partner at my firm said that you have to visit the art institute in Chi-town, so we did. Â Entrance was $12, but I guess you can pretend ur a student and pay $7. You can't bring any foods or liquids in and they have coat check for $1. The collections are grand, the museum is spacious and modern and there are rooms after rooms of collections. Since I was sorta tired, I just wanted to hit up the big pieces. I love the Renaissance (madonna and childs) saw a Botticelli here and there, hit up the French Impressionism and then walked downstairs past the buddas...The information desk is especially helpful downstairs as well and they are well catered to tourists.
