Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The bread is amazing!!! It's actually the best sourdough I've ever found in Chicago. The crust is crispy but not hard. And the bread itself is a perfect balance between chewy and moist. I even ask our waiter tonight to help me pack some bread home. Our waiter is just so nice hahahah.
