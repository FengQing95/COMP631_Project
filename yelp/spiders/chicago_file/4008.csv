The Purple Pig////Worth the wait! If you're planning on a romantic quiet place, don't line up. If you're looking for good food and to make some friends, definitely get in line! Even before they open, there's already people hungry and waiting to eat. The Purple Pig doesn't take reservations so don't bother calling ahead, just prepare at least 30+ mins of wait time.
