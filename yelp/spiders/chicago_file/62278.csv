Smoque BBQ////The brisket more than lives up to the hype. I recommend getting the sandwich with BOTH sliced and chopped meat on it. The fries are fresh and a good side, but the smoked beans take this place over the top. Chunks of brisket, onions, and a plenty of sugar make these beans the best I have ever had.
