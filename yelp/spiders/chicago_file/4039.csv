The Purple Pig////I know there are a lot of mixed reviews for The Purple Pig, but definitely, it was easily the one of the best, if not the best meal, the BF and I had during out short Labor Day Trip to Chicago. We're so glad that we made the decision to hit up this spot approx 20mins before they opened on a tuesday right before our flight back home.
