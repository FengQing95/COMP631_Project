Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I ve been to this restaurant 3 times in the past. Yesterday we dined here and I will NOT be back with all the choices to fine dine in the city. Bavettes will NOT make the list again. The service was subpar as our waiter Steve should be trained in your liquor list and what you may offer, said they had no bloody mary mix , as we ordered them first? Ordered a bottle of cakebread cabernet and our glasses were never refilled by waitstaff, we poured them ourselves? We were asked to put in our order 3 times as we were eating our salads! We came ti relax, not be rushed out like a breakfast cafe...ridiculous! Had to ask for salt and pepper for salads. I am in the fine dining Â industry for 35 years, I know what impeccable service is!! Bavettes falls way short. Pick a different steakhouse as there are many choices in Chicago.
