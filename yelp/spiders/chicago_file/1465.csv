Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I went here for brunch with some friends and we waited for like 35 minutes. The food and the service was alright. I had better breakfast food elsewhere. I didn't even finish my food and I didn't even want to take it home so from that you know the food wasn't good. I will not go back to this place or recommend it to others.
