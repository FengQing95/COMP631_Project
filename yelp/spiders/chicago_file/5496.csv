The Purple Pig////This was my first meal after landing in Chicago. My friends and I came by on a Saturday for brunch. We placed our name, walked around, and was called to our table in a little over an hour. Luckily since The Purple Pig is so centrally located, we were able to walk around and explore the city during that time.
