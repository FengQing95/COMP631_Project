Smoque BBQ////There are those who would be grimacing if they saw me give this excellent BBQ joint only 3 stars. But I tell the truth, and the overall truth at that. Yes, their food is delicious. But the four times I went there (seems like enough times to be considered fair), one time they were a victim of their own success outright, having a sign in the window which said they were out of many of their items. Sadly, we had waited in line just to get to that point. The other three times, even with a shorter line, the experience is very much a 'cattle call' style: wait in line to get in. wait in line to place your order. wait to get an open available table. mull around for your name/number to be called when the food is ready. It's not table service, in other words. It's counter service. And for these prices, I'd like to have a better dining experience.
