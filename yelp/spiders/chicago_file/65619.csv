Smoque BBQ////I am from the South, North Carolina to be exact. Needless to say I grew up around good BBQ. I have also tried BBQ all over the country, from texas to oklahoma, nashville, to st. louis. This place is pretty average, and i don't see all the hype. The meats are pretty average quality, but seem to be smoked pretty well, though the flavor overwhelms you. I'm not a fan of the sauce, which seems to be pretty much the same at all Chicago BBQ places. The sides are nothing to write home about either, i had a tiny portion of mac and cheese, which was pretty bland to me. Cornbread is not great either. I may be a little biased here, but it's not the best place in the world.
