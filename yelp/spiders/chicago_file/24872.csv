Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm not a deep dish person, but Lou's pizza is so good! The sausage they use is the best and they put a lot on their pies! What I loved though was how the crust came up the side of the pan and stayed nice and crispy on the edges. We didn't have any salad, but their salads looked amazing and I can't wait to go back and try one.
