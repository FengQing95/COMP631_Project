Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's was recommended to me by several people when I arrived to Chicago and trust me, it won't disappoint. If it's a cool summer night the outside sitting is perfection. Their menu holds a large selection of items ranger from appetizers to dessert and each one sounding equally as delicious. We decided to get the bruschetta and a deep dish pepperoni pizza. The bruschetta was so refreshing and fresh that we almost ordered that as our meal. A few minutes after the pizza came out and I must say, there wasn't much of a waiting time. We were also really entertained by the people watching and the awesome service that time kind of flew by. Note: the Chicago style deep dish pizza has the sauce on top and the cheese on the bottom. Kind of different from your typical pizza and very filling.
