Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They shouldn't call it "deep dish pizza".  They should call it "thick crust pizza"  Someone told me that it was their style, having the crust thicker than the rest of the cheese and toppings, but sorely disappointed.  All the other deep dish pizzas I had were filled with toppings and cheese, but I felt like all I ate was crust.
