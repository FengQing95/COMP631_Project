Smoque BBQ////Sliced brisket was very tender, I loved that - but I agree with what several people said, it lacked some flavor and definitely needed sauce.  Good portion of meat....I was stuffed after eating maybe 1/4 of the meat.  I wished I had a piece of bread or something with it though...next time I may just get a sandwich instead and save some $$.
