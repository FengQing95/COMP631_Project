Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Yum, been here lots of times and never been disappointed in the food.  The restaurant is always bumping with people.  Most of the time, I have to wait for a table and its loud and crowded but I still like it.  The have really good sangria, which I dont usually say.  The service is usually pretty good.  I guess it just depends on what your looking for.  The restaurant is usually really loud.  I have liked most of the tapas that I had here...tuna, potatoes, etc.  I have never had empanadas or paella but the tapas are great.
