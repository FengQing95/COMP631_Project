Smoque BBQ////Smoque can hold their own with the best of them, and I'm not talking Chicago bbq standards.  These people are making bbq RIGHT, Mason Dixon line be damned.  The very best ribs I've ever had in Chicago and, in fact, some of the best I've had anywhere, period.  I got the combo baby back/St. Louis and, although both were excellent, definitely favor the St. Louis style. The brisket...oh...perfect pink smoke ring, gorgeous bark, tender juicy meat.  There isn't a brisket in town that can top it.  The Texas Link IS a Texas Link.  Holy moly, I thought I was at some German smokehouse in Texas when I ate that thing - beautifully marbled with fat, smokey, juicy, and a natural casing that gives it a fantastic snap. I'm a happy girl.
