Art Institute of Chicago////So much to see, so little time. Visiting for the weekend during the Van Gough bedroom exhibit. A must see if youre here around feb - april ($5 on top of org tix price). There's something extremely satisfying to see Van Gough work up close, the stokes and color - amazing.  However the star of the the exhibit for me personally were the Monet pieces, water lilies to be exact - I fell in love. Could of spend the entire day in that room. This place is a must visit if you're ever in Chicago or love art. Word of advice,  there is so much to see, pace yourself.
