Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You can buy a whole pizza or order it by the slice and everything was very fresh and hot. They had other things on the menu but I didn't pay attention to them. They had some really unique types of pizza and toppings and were willing to do whatever you want. We just ordered a couple pieces and had a variety. The slices are huge! Above all, they are very reasonable for lunch if you want to eat cheap, or at least cheaper than most places!
