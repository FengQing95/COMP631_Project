Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I just got off the phone with Brandon. Tried to make a reservation for an engagement dinner, party of 9. After a 4+ minute wait on hold, he curtly told me there was nothing he could do to accommodate my party size. Even when I offered possible suggestions, he rudely cut me off and said no. This easily would have been over a $2,500 dinner. It's a shame we won't be celebrating here. The restaurant should also make efforts to train their staff on phone etiquette.
