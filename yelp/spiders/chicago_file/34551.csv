Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our food arrived *maybe* ten minutes after we ordered.  And wasn't piping hot.  And gravy on the meatloaf and in the stroganoff slightly congealed-like.  I'm not saying there was a heat lamp back there, but that's the consistency of the food that arrived at our table.  It was tasty though - but nothing over the top. The fried chicken that I thought would be weird to order arrived at a table near us, and I decided I want THAT next time to share with lots of their delicious sounding sides!  Looked and smelled great!
