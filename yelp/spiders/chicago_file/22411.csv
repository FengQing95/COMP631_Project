Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Since we had to wait 40 min, we got the house/green salad in the individual size and it was perfect for sharing. The pizza came out pretty good, again, I don't really like deep dish, but it wasn't soggy like others I've tried and it wasn't as thick. It was way too saucy so next time I'd ask for less sauce.
