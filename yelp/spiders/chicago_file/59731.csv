Smoque BBQ////This place is ALWAYS crowded though, so I'd suggest calling in way ahead of time. We were around on Saturday afternoon, called for pick-up at about 5pm, they said it wouldn't be ready till 6:30. When we got there, there was a line for people waiting to sit down that was out the door...and it was sleeting outside! I know Chicagoans are hardcore, but standing out in the freezing sleet with no umbrella just to get some ribs? You know this place has got to be good.
