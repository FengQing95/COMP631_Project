Little Goat Diner////The dish as a whole wasn't that great only because the biscuits were kinda stale and my sunny side egg wasn't...sunny. Also, I'm a huge fan of kimchi, but was disappointed at the fact that the entire entree was covered in it. I realize that kimchi is supposed to stink up your nostrils worst than durian, but this stuff was DANK. I had to scrap it all off to the side to get to the good stuff. All in all though the flavors worked well together and I could see what they were trying to accomplish with the Asian twist.
