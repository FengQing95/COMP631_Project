Smoque BBQ////This place was fantastic !  I had the pulled pork, sliced brisket, slaw, and chili.  The pork was tasty, but the brisket.... mmmmmm.  It was amazingly delicious.  I probably could have eaten a pound of it.   The slaw was great - nice and tangy.  And the chili was a big surprise, it looks like they may use yesterday's brisket meat for the chili.  It was some of the best chili I have ever had!
