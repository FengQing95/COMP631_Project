Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Amazing experience at Lou's. It was a wet and cold day yesterday but we found comfort and delicious food at Lou's. You should trust all the hype about this. The service was excellent - shout out to Anna! We ordered a salad (so we wouldn't feel too badly about ourselves), a small deep dish with sausage and spinach, and a pepperoni with peppers thin crust pizza. Everything was delicious, including the salad. I live in New York and love New York style pizza but after visiting Lou's I'm now questioning my loyalty...
