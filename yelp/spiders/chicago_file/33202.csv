Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Everything you recommended last night was marvelous.  The oysters, the crab and avocado salad, the bone-in ribeye, the goldbrick sundae with bourbon ice cream...  When you offered to leave the fries so that I could dip them "Wendy's style" in my ice cream you elevated yourself to best waiter of all time.
