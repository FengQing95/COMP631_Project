Art Institute of Chicago////One this I'll say is when I tried to get close and feel the beauty of paintings with my fingertips the guards started to scream at me to back up and stay away.  I asked a guard what the painting was worth and she shrugged and then I asked about silent alarms and she looked very suspiciously at me.  I didn't like this look and decided to find a place to get some peace  and quiet.  Luckily there was this big hallway that was empty and behind a barrier and I found a bench and laid down.  In just a couple minutes though this scientist looking guy started shaking me and asking me how I got into "the Modern Wing" and I told him same way as you buddy and he started calling security.  Needless to say I saw a lot of great paintings and culture before I was thrown out I think forever.  I can't afford to go to that museum again anyways since the price is outrageous.  It made me realize that I have to start painting because the money must be great and I could have painted almost everything in there.
