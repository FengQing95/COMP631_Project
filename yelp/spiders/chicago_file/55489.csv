Smoque BBQ////Best brisket in Chicago. It's as close as you can get to the southern style BBQ. The macaroni and cheese is delicious and so as the peach cobler. I like their bun it's kind of yelowish bread with light sweetness that melts in your mouth. The owners are very nice people and very freindly. I highly recomend this place.
