Art Institute of Chicago////This place was just utterly boring I really didn't have fun here, everything is all over the place it's really poorly organized. You really have to try to get interested in the art really want to be there. Pictures are okay nothing stellar I heard the science museum is a lot better I feel like I should have gone there my friends recommended it but they close earlier. I guess the only good thing is this place close at 8 on Thursdays so I ended up going here definitely not worth the ticket though. I probably spent about 1 hour here until me and the family took off out of boredom. Some of the Galleries and stuff we're just not so exciting. They did have a good rum to create stencils on paper rubbings I believe they're called, that was the most interactive fun they really have there, I think my one-year-old stop crying literally the moment I got out of that place I think she was more excited to see the buildings and the scenery outside in Chicago
