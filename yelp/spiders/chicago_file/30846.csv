Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Overall Lou was a great place. As I walked in I was greeted by a server, there was not a long for waiting and I proceeded to the bar immediately. The server took slightly a bit to approach me as I was just sitting on the bar and waiting. She recommended I try the Lou pizza and hence I agreed.
