The Purple Pig////It isn't often I see a menu and want to order everything off of it. With a group of four, the six dishes we ordered was a bit much. I'd recommend five dishes for four people if you want to try a bit of everything. You can't really make a wrong choice here though. Great food, great vibes (although it does get loud and oily), great experience overall.
