The Purple Pig////Every dish is beautifully plated and more importantly we SAVORED every bite and almost licked the plates dry.  Not surprising that it is a James Beard awardee and a Michelin Guide Bib Gourmand recipient. Truly well-deserving of the accolades and 5-star reviews.  Thank you Chef Effy and Mauro for a delightful dinner!
