Little Goat Diner////For food, I went with my tried and true diner order of All American Burger with Slagel beef and side of fries. The burger was a nice, hearty size but fry portion was skimpy (and the burger doesn't come with fries!). My friend ordered off the breakfast options (served all day) and got the Bull's Eye French Toast. I had serious food envy. The Bull's Eye French Toast is like a spin off of chicken and waffles but so much better. The chicken was crispy and every component of the dish just works with each other.
