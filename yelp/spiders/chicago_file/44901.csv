Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Aw hell yeahh! Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is the place to be for tapas! Walking past it a few times, it always is super packed so when I actually got the opportunity to go try it (with Firebelly Design + their campers ) I was supremely excited. And what's more... I wasn't let down. I recommend making reservations btdubs.
