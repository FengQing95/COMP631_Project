Little Goat Diner////Great place to dine. Food is familiar with top quality and expert preparation. It is fun to eat such delicious food in such a casual environment. This is NOT your average diner! The extensive menu has something for everyone, including the vegetarian I was dining with. I would definitely recommend this spot in the west loop if you aren't looking for something super swanky.
