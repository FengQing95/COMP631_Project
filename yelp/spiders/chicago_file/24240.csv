Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Unfortunately had really bad customer service - were told we'd have to wait 15-20 mins for a table after 30 I went to check and was sent to a different person to ask who pulled up the screen and from what I could tell from the screen he clicked on they'd tried to text and it hadn't gone through (no call out though when we were seated there? No apology for the mishap?) From there we were seated straight away but became the forgotten table - no knives, had to ask twice for them and took ages to come, no water which we had to ask for even though every other table for it. The service was fine but at the end of the night our check was just thrown on the table as she walked past. It was so rude.
