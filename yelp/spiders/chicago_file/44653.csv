Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It seems they've raised the prices since I was there about 6 months ago.  Maybe it's the economy, maybe it's because Emilio's has closed, but I payed $30-40 more for essentially the same food as last time.  And they're not hurting for patrons.  There was still a waiting line at 10pm.
