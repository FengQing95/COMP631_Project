Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service here is spot on.  The peach sangria was delicious once the ice melted a little.  Every dish we ordered seemed to best the previous.  I'd definitely recommend the goat cheese in tomato sauce - that was by far my favorite dish of the night.  Their Pintxo platter is fantastic as well, a small taste of some popular tapas.
