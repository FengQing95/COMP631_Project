Little Goat Diner////Now, the cocktail I got felt very experimental. I can't recall the name, but it had smoked pineapple juice with a dragon fruit salt rim served in a martini glass. It was a nice, surprising flavor in the first sip, but this is the type of cocktail that shouldn't be in a martini glass. There's so much more juice than alcohol, and having room temp. pineapple juice is unappetizing. Not to mention, the smoky scent is so strong and the dragon fruit salt so pungent, there's just too many overpowering things in one sip. I would prefer a regular pineapple juice cocktail, stronger on the liquor, with the dragon fruit salt, served with ice.
