Art Institute of Chicago////!#$%%@&!!! Seriously! you gotta be effing kidding me! How did I not know more about this place? Before my first visit ever to Chicago during NYE weekend, I came on the thread talks and asked fellow Chicago yelpers for suggestions on things to do. Anna "bookmaus" H. informed me that the AIC was free on Thursdays from 5pm-9pm, so I wrote it down on my schedule google spreadsheet thinking no more of it than just a pleasant way to spent the afternoon.
