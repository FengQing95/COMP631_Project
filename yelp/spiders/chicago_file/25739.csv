Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I HAD to try deep dish while visiting Chicago and this place happened to be along my walk. It was a Saturday night and it was totally packed. We put our name in AND our order (because they take a long time to make) and then went to get a drink at a bar next door while we waited. They called when our table was ready and we went back to be seated.
