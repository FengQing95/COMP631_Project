Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My last visit was about ten years ago and so happy to come back to such good food.  I live in the OC but visit Chicago regularly so we all agreed on tapas.  between the four of us we had 12 plates and a pitcher of sangria...delish!!  I luv the tortilla espanola, rioja short ribs, citrus cured salmon..so good!
