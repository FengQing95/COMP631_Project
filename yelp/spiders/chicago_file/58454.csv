Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here for New years eve, & sat outside in their closed patio. We didn't feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good & food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria & that is delicious. I'm obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well & delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting.
