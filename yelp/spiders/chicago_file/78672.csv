Little Goat Diner////Okay I love this place.  The hashbrowns won my heart.  The spanish omelette was so refreshing and tasty.  The little piggy went to china reminded me of why I didn't like "Girl and the Goat" (the chili sauce just doesn't work...) but was still good.  And the okonomiyaki was delightful, fluffy, and tasty.  I will DEFINITELY be going back to try the Sourdough pancakes, the bulls eye french toast, and the smoked corned beef hash. 4.75/5
