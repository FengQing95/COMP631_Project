Little Goat Diner////Interested in the fusion dishes, we ordered the Bull's Eye French Toast, This Little Piggy Went to China, and reuben. None of them did their compelling descriptions justice. You could only very barely taste the sweet onion in the brioche used for the french toast. The kimchi was nowhere near pungent enough in the reuben, which may also have been due to the absolute smothering of cheese. My personal disappointment was This Little Piggy Went to China, which featured the saltiest biscuit of my life and a bland McMuffin sausage patty. I was so excited for the promised szechuan and chili flavors, but all I tasted was salt.
