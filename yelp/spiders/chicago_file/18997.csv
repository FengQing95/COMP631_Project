Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now, I understand that not everyone can pick up their lives and go to Chicago for the weekend to eat pizza, but being that it is 2013, we should all have access to the internet and a credit card. Lucky, that is all you need to get your pawls on this cheesy goodness if you are not in the Chicago area. Order your Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza now and you won't be sorry!
