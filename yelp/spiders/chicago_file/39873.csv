Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////There's not much more I can say about this place other than WOW...and oh. my. God. Everything was incredible, including entrees, sides and cocktails. Also the waiter (Joe) was lovely. He gave us complimentary pickle back shots because a patron accidentally whipped me in the face with his backpack, lol. I wasn't even that upset about it, but our server saw it and decided to surprise us with something nice. Very much appreciated. This is a can't miss spot in Chicago.
