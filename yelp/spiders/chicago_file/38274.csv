Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I came here with my boyfriend for my birthday at our reserved 5:45pm. He ordered the chicken pot pie and I got the petite 6oz filet mignon. At $18 the chicken pot pie was really worth--it was generously portioned, rested on a ring of buttery, delicious mashed potatoes and was jam packed with filling. Though Bavette's is known for their steaks, I wouldn't mind coming back for any of their other special entrees. We also ordered 2 sides--the truffle mac and cheese and elote corn. Ugh, both of them so delicious.
