Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Admittedly, I do not have a lot experience with Spanish tapas. I have been to two highly rated Spanish tapas on yelp now and have not been impressed. This is much better than Aventura in ann arbor, but overall the food was underwhelming. We ordered brussel sprout salad, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms, goat cheese, iberico pork, roast dates with bacon, paella so we had a pretty good variety of what they had to offer. The only thing I can say that was very good was the brussel sprout salad. Everything else to me was soso to marginally good. Service was also very poor. Waitress was non existant. The mexican workers did much more work than the wait staff. I wish I could give the tip to them rather than the waitress. Only positive thing I can say is that the meal wasn't that expensive for the amount of food we ordered.
