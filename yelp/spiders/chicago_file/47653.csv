Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place! I've only come for dinner but It takes reservations, it's fairly priced, the food is delicious which there is a WIDE variety of, the sangria is really good, the restaurant is a comfortable size, it has a fun atmosphere, food doesn't take too long. I would come here way more if I wasn't trying to go to a different restaurant every time I went out since I live in Chicago and there are so many unique places. I recommend it to all my friends.
