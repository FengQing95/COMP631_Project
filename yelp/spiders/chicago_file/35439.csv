Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One of my favorite spots in the city.  Great ambiance- 1920's vibe, dark, romantic, and sexy.  Trendy but not pretentious.  Customer service is phenomenal- everyone is super nice, cool, and most importantly knowledgeable about their wine and food.  Great for dinner and/or cocktails.
