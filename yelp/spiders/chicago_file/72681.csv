Little Goat Diner////The coffee? Really good. The appetizers & side items? Really good. The main courses? Â Good, creative, but not great. I had the "famous" Bulls-eye French toast, and while good, it was lacking in amount of chicken. Lots of bread and syrup, but only a few pieces of chicken. The cheesy grits were hot and flavorful; the patty melt & breakfast spaghetti merely average. Not bad, mind you, but nothing exceptional.
