Little Goat Diner////How this place doesnt have a consolidated 5-star rating beats me.  For the quality and quantity of the food, you cant beat the price.  We moved to Chicago 7 months ago, and I have been here 5 or 6 times.  Favorites include the club, the fish tacos and of course the goat almighty!   Thank god they started taking reservations b/c the wait can be very long depending on the time you go, but thankfully there are plenty of bars nearby!
