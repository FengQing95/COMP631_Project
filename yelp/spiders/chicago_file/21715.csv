Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Count me in anytime. Lou's in my opinion is the best deep dish in Chicago. Nice crust, not too doughy and a nice combination of sauce, cheese and sausage. I've gone to several locations. Oak Park, Gold Coast, Lincoln Park, Lincoln Square and the original on Lincoln near Skokie and they are all consistent. I even pick up the frozen ones from time to time to eat at home.
