Little Goat Diner////I like the bright atmosphere for breakfast/lunch with the huge skylight.  I was a bit disappointed with the food.  We ordered, and the waitress left and returned to let us know that they were out of cinnamon rolls and a ginger ale beverage that one of us ordered.  Mexican soda was ordered instead.  Waitress came back again to let us know that they were out of Mexican soda.  She said that a delivery must have been missed.  The smoked corn beef hash was good.  The hash browns at first seemed to be crisp on the outside yet uncooked in the center until I realized that there was cheese (Gruyere?) folded into the center which also made the hash browns seem a bit too oily and salty.  The smoked corned beef was also good on the Reuben sandwich with the correct level of salt; however, they used kimchi instead of sauerkraut which made some portions of the sandwich chunky, too salty, and vinegary.  I usually prefer things more salty than most; however, the hash browns and Reuben definitely needed balance in my opinion.
