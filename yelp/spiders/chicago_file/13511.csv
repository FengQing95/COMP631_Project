Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What a waste of time.  The service here was so bad.  Apparently dicing tomatoes is a big deal and needs supervisor approval. Basil is not allowed on your "create your own pizza" Lol - The beer came out warm like piss and our waitress decided to hand us the check while we eating (F U) Gino's tastes better and the service is top notch.
