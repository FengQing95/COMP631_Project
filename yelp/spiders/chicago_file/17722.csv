Lou Malnati's Pizzeria//// Here's another Establishment I get the pleasure to share with others. Don't take your children to this location. I repeat DON'T take your CHILDREN TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT ! Yesterday after flying home for some R and R a friend wanted to take me out as a welcome home present of sorts, I love pizza, cheese, beef anyone sans the pork toppings, I traditionally stay in the land of Giordano's and or Edwardo's for my pizza satisfaction. Never being to a Lou Malnatti's and hearing the fan fare of this establishment, I wanted to try.
