Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Q-tips say: Great place for tapas(small plates) and good drinks and service. The Q's shared: Beef Empanada, & garlic shrimp - which was to die for. All delicious along with their delicious homemade bread, great drinks and lively atmosphere made for a great dinner.  All tapas we ordered had 2 pieces of food per plate and some, like the shrimp had four pieces of shrimp.  Of course, the Mr. had to have the meatballs. I wanted to try their Carpaccio. Eat in the bar area, there are TV's to watch a ball game or news but the TV is not loud. Choose from a few "specials" at a discounted price.
