Little Goat Diner////I loved the asian take on American food. I had high expectations as all I ever hear about in chicago are the goat trio. I ordered the bimbimbop bowl and was actually shocked to see It naturally came with cauliflower rice...my healthy senses were tingling. My dad was raving over the corned beef. I'd want to try everything to get a little taste of what they have to offer as a unique brunch place!
