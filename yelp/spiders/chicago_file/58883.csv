Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We got the Patatas Bravas, Tomato bread, Garlic Shrimp, sangria flight, and Chicken/Veggie Paella and everything tasted great. Paella elsewhere is always like $40+ but here ours was $26 and could definitely feed 3-4 along with other tapas! However the server mixes it up for you and splits it up; I wish he just let us eat it from the pan!
