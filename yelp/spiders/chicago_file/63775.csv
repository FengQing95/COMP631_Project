Smoque BBQ////Sooooo good! BYOB and DELICIOUS. I've seen lines out the door and down the sidewalk, but I have never personally had to wait too long. Very simple menu, very tasty BBQ. I've had the sliced brisket sandwich which is my favorite, the pulled pork, the chopped brisket, and the Mac n Cheese side. When you want hearty, stick-to-the-ribs "Boy Food" I like to call it- this is probably my first recommendation for a pig-out session.
