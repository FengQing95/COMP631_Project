Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love the hard boiled eggs, the rib entree and the sangria.  I've also gotten a few different specials in the past, and have never been disappointed by those either.  If you are looking for a brunch or Happy Hour place this is perfect!  Go in a big group and share a wide variety of choices.
