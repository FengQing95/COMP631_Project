Smoque BBQ////My sense is that this place really picks up at the key dinner hours, but damn, if rollin' in around 5:30 PM on a Friday doesn't give you curbside access to the counter.  Rolled in here for my second visit last week, with mummy and little bro in tow.  Given that the last time I'd come to the spot was last August, and that visit did not disappoint, I figured it was time for a second go.
