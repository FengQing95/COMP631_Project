Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I used to love this place but just dont' think I can go back again...at least for awhile. Went here last night and LOVED the goat cheese croquette and chorizo wrapped date but was severely disappointed (and even slightly disgusted) by the beef empanada and the beef brisket. The brisket was seriously inedible. It makes me a little sick to think about now, well that and the fact that I've had a stomach ache ever since having even a small bite. It may have just been poor ordering but I think I'll stick to the better tapas places out there (People Lounge, Iberico). Sorry Ba Ba, if I could JUST eat goat cheese croquettes and chorizo wrapped dates for dinner, I'd come back often. Unfortunately, it's just not enough any more.
