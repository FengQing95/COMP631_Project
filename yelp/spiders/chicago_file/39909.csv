Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This might be my new favorite restaurant. My husband and I sat downstairs in the parlor. We shared the crab legs, porterhouse special, and mashed potatoes. Hands down the best meal I've had in such a long time. The service was also amazing!! We didn't have to wait for anything. They were so quick and on top of it. I loved the vibe, food, and service!! Do yourself a favor and splurge on the porterhouse!
