Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came in here as a first-timer for lunch on a Tuesday. Wait time wasn't very long but the restaurant was still pretty full which should tell you something! Ordered the classic, the Lou and the Malnati's salad all of which were great. The buttermilk crust was the best part of the pizza- so buttery and cooked just right.
