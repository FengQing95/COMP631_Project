Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I lived in Lincoln Park for two years and somehow never made it to this restaurant. I went with two friends a few weeks ago and loved every minute of my experience. We had a reservation for 7:30 on a Saturday night. We got there a few minutes early and the wait staff seated us promptly. It is wise to make a reservation,as this restaurant was still on a wait at 9:00 pm when we finished up dinner. We were seated right away.
