Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I loved the idea of tapas as the three of us could share smaller plates and try a variety of different dishes. We started off with the Peach Sangria which was amazing. All of the dishes that we did try were full of flavor. The patatas bravas are a must try when dining here. We also had dates wrapped in bacon, sweet potatoes which I am not a fan of to begin with and ended up loving. We also got a goat cheese with marinara sauce that was served with garlic bread. We ended up ordering the seafood Paella, which was enough to make us full at the end of the night. You should order this ahead of time as it does take 30 minutes to make.
