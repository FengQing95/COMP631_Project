Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////While looking for a spot to grab pizza, we found that Lou Malnati was able to fit us in on a busy Mother's Day with very little wait time, and what was even better was that we could order while waiting! After about another 15 minute wait we got both the classic deep dish meals and the crusts ARE SO BUTTERY ITS AMAZING. pair any one of the classic deep dishes with a coke and you have yourself and excellent dish. Don't be fooled by the sizes of the pizza either, the combination of cheese, meat, crust, and sauce is incredibly filling.
