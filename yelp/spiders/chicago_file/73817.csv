Little Goat Diner////Our waiter was fun, friendly and was happy to joke around with us. He was attentive, but not overly so. The whole atmosphere in the place was lively but not jarring, a perfect place for a Saturday night meal after a long day of exploring downtown Chicago. And for a Celiac like myself, being able to have a banh mi sandwich on gluten-free bread was just what the doctor ordered.
