Little Goat Diner////First I want to start of by saying I love-love Stephanie from Top Chef and was very impressed with her restaurant Girl and a Goat but this new diner experience at the little goat was very disappointing!The decor and ambiance was fantastic however our silverware was dirty and the food was lacking the robust flavor I anticipated having eaten at her other restaurant. I completely get its  a lot more "wallet friendly" but they have no excuse for lack of flavor and for a diner our bill was still over $80 bucks!! My braised beef sandwich was bland and my sister's Mac cheese was generic... Kraft made a better box version it was just horrible. I'm a big foodie and don't mind paying a lot of money for food but this was by far very unexpected from  a Top Chef.  We should've gone to UrbanBelly like I wanted instead...
