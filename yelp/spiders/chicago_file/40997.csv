Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've heard a lot about this place and have been looking to try it out, I went for dinner before a second city show and was a little disappointed. Nothing was bad and the service was good, but I was expecting to be wowed. However the sangria was great and I never saw the bottom of my glass (a good thing.)
