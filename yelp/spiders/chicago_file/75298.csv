Little Goat Diner////Honestly I think this place is overrated and I've given it 5 chances. The service isn't the greatest, the food is a mix of flavors that aren't always appealing. The space is super airy and bright, and make for a great brunch and lunch atmosphere. I haven't been to the roof but have heard great things about that space and view.
