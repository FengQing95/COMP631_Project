Smoque BBQ////In awe of all of the reviews deeming this the best BBQ. Â We split a half slab (ok, but not very meaty), sliced brisket (somehow managed to be too dry with the charred fat cap still in tact), and sausage (the best thing we had!). The sides are so so small for the price and completely forgettable. Mac and cheese and cornbread were so dry - I felt bad for my bf who took one sad bite of each before giving up. Sauces on side were nice touch.
