Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I absolutely hate not being able to give this restaurant 5 stars. The ambiance alone deserves 10 stars. It's romantic, dimly lit, classic and beautiful, it looks like something out of Boardwalk Empire. It is screaming Chicago. It is far away from the tourist zones. At the same time, the noise level is great and I could see this being an amazing date night spot. Service was spectacular and attentive. The homemade bread was delicious. And they even have a coat check. So WHY in the world can I not give it 5 stars?
