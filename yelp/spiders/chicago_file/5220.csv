The Purple Pig////Great place for a casual sit down or a night out with friends! The food is absolutely amazing and reasonably priced. The style here is small plates and shareables so you get plenty of variety through out your meal. Our server was occasionally a little difficult to get ahold of, but they also were absolutely packed so that makes sense.
