Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The server was absolutely AMAZING. He began by detailing the oysters on the menu and almost immediately asked if either of us had food allergies. I have a horrible shellfish allergy, so I was impressed by the fact he asked and cared to tell the kitchen. Both the bus boy and server checked on our table regularly even though the restaurant was rather full. I was amazed at how quick and courteous they both were, I can't say I've had service like this in any other restaurant.
