Little Goat Diner////Everything I've had at the Little Goat diner has been phenomenal.  I've been there probably a half dozen times now, trying new things each time and I'm always amazed.  My favorite is the sloppy goat, followed closely by Los Drowned.  If you are a coffee fan, the Little Goat is worth stopping in to try by itself.  I highly recommend trying the Little Goat, even more than the more reputable Girl and the Goat restaurant.
