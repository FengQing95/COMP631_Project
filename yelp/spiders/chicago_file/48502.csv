Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here for visits throughout the years and I'm pleased to say the food here is consistently delicious, appealing to the eye and a wonderful eventful time for you and a friend if you sit outside in the summer or come here alone. A friend of mine was dying to try this place so we ordered with confidence knowing every tapas would be tasty and shareable. We split an order of mushrooms and shrimp appetizers. Last week I took full advantage of their "happy hour" which occurs weekdays between 4pm till 6pm and you can choose from a wide array of $1 mini bites for one or their generous portions of tapas from about $2 or $3 so if you choose 4 tapas and don't order beverages expect to sample four satisfying tapas dishes for approximately $10. I had the spicy grilled potatoes, tiny omelette, dates with bacon and tomato bread with cheese do I picked well and even had leftovers for my pets to enjoy. Â By the way this is a great place to enjoy a Sunday brunch with a good friend because if it's summer you can sit outside here, share some incredible tapas with a good friend and share a pitcher of sangria which is a specialty drink of theirs.
