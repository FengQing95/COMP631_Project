Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am so glad that this isn't in Austin, Texas!! This is -hands down- THE BEST PIZZA ON THE PLANET!! The deep dish crust is an experience all it's own, not to be compared by any other pizza place that I've had. They are very generous with the toppings and if you get sausage... well, that's a LAYER of the pizza and you get it in every bite. Then there's that Malnati salad! I know what you're thinking... "salad?!?" Trust me. Get the salad. My teenagers ate as much salad as pizza. It's that good. This is your pizza stop. You'll thank me after the first bite. You're welcome.
