Art Institute of Chicago////If you're a student, don't forget your student ID at home like I did. Save a few bucks. The highlights of the Art Institute for me were the Impressionists and the Thorne miniature rooms. Going on Black Friday will be a terrible idea if you hate crowds. There are two entrances, one of which is used less than the other. Be sure to pace yourself. You can leave and come back, which is nice if you don't feel like paying for overpriced museum refreshments.
