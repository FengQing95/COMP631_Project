Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Wanted to love this place.  Sadly, both the food and service didn't meet expectations.  I went on a Monday night when the restaurant was half empty. Sat at the bar and ordered a personal pizza.   It came out one hour later.   Turns out my order ticket fell on the floor of the kitchen.  If the restaurant were busy, I may have been sympathetic.  But considering that the staff stood around talking to each other and complaining about customers' orders and neediness (not a good look), I would have expected prompt and efficient service.
