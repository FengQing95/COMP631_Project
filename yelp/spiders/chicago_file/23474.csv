Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My family was in Chicago for a mini Family Reunion. We simply asked a cab driver "WHERE'S THE BEST PIZZA" Of course he asked Deep Dish or Thin style. Â And he sent us to Lou Malnati's. We had a Perfect Pizza Experience....Great Deep Dish, tasty appetizers( mom said she could've eaten just those...pesto bread chunks).
