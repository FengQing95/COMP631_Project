The Purple Pig////Absolutely awesome food experience. We started with the cured meat of duck and then ham. Paired well with sweet pickles and bread. Then we had fried brussel sprouts seasoned with lemon thyme. (Awesome taste). Our server, Jorge, recommended a great wine from Spain which paired well the the meat.
