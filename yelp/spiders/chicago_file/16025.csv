Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our waiter was funny, although I doubt he intended to be. He has his spiel perfected. My boyfriend was being dull, so I eavesdropped on everyone else's conversations, and our waiter had the same greeting for every table: "Welcome to Lou Malnati's! Is this your first visit? Just to let you know, our pizza takes about 35 minutes to cook. I'd suggest you start off with the Malnati salad - it's the best salad you'll ever have. Are you guys hungry? The small pizza is usually good for 2, unless you want to take some home. Are you ready to order?" I have no life.
