Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite places to go to in the city for tapas and sangria! Plenty of options on the menu and it is a great restaurant to bring your girlfriends/group of friends. It is usually busy though so definitely call before to make sure there is seating available. The location is great too. So happy I live near this restaurant now so I can stop by more often.
