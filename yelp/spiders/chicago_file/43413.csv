Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been coming to this restaurant for 6+ years and LOVE IT. With that being said my experience on 2/24 was awful. We had a table for 11 and our server continued to mess up our orders. I have only ever dined at this restaurant as a vegan and have never had an issue, on this particular night every small plate I ordered came to the table without the correct substitution. I at one point asked where an order was and she put in another order for the particular item as it arrived to our table, I told her never mind we did not need the order to be put in again and she acknowledged that. About 10 minutes later another order for that same menu item arrived at our table... She was just awful all around, zero attention to detail, could not get a single thing correct. Who ever serviced the party of 11 under my name on 2/24 needs some serious retraining because that is not the level of service I have come to expect from Lettuce Entertain You establishments. Very disappointed that this is the caliber of employee representing the restaurant during prime time.
