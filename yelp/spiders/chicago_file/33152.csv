Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////After giving Bavette's another chance, I have no other option but to give them a raving review. The host/hostess problem that I had encountered on my 3 previous attempts to enjoy Bavette's has been fixed with the most wonderful young man with large granny glasses and a huge smile! He was a breathe of fresh air after preparing myself for the worst. The server was fantastic and the food was mind blowing! Our table ordered oysters, shrimp cocktail, meatloaf, dry aged ribeye, salmon, cheesecake, and lemon pie. Simply amazing!
