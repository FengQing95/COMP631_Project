Little Goat Diner////My husband and I went to Little Goat, it was my first time and my husband was willing to 'give it a second chance.'  What we had was the patty melt, fat club sandwich and chocolate malt shakes.  The shakes were the winner here the other items were fine but typical, which is not what I expected from Little Goat. On the first try my husband had the fried pickles and onions and chicken cordon bleu again uninspired meh diner food.
