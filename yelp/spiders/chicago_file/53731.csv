Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I liked the dessert menu and the fact that those are all $3 each. We got one free dessert for checking in on Yelp, and we ordered another one to sing Happy Birthday to my cousin. We ended up getting that one taken off the bill as well, which was nice. I wanted to try one of their coffees, but decided to wait until next time.
