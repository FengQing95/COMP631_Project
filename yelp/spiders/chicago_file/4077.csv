The Purple Pig////Burrata - This dish unfortunately also did not impress anyone.  Burrata is a soft mozzarella like cheese that is mixed with cream.  The presentation was BEAUTIFUL as they made it look like Cannoli but unfortunately it was bland and unimpressive. Two misses in a row, we were a little worried.
