Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's doesn't need another 5 star review but they've earned it. By far my favorite restaurant in the city and if I choose my last meal it would include their bone marrow and the ribeye. God, even their bread is to die for... and their chocolate pie.. heaven on Earth. You cannot go wrong with any choice on their menu.
