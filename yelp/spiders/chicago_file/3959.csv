The Purple Pig////Duck neck rillette - Last time we were here we ordered the turkey rillette, which was one of our favorite items. I'd say the duck rillette turned out to be just as good. I still don't know what the hell a rillette is, but picture a meat spread which a texture halfway between pate and shredded meat. It was salty and very dense, just delicious. When you spread it on the toast it cuts some of the saltiness and is just a great appetizer. Throw a little strawberry mostarda on there too to add a little jam-like sweetness. I'm getting whatever neck rillette they have on the menu from now on.
