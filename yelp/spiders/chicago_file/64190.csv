Smoque BBQ////Smoque BBQ has some really tasty BBQ! My husband and I have tried their pulled pork, chicken, sausage, and of course- BRISKET. It's definitely our go to when we are really craving BBQ. We would have it more often but the wait, even when calling in orders ahead of time, can be a little lengthy. Some of the sides (mac, chili, beans) can be hit or miss! Recently had the peach cobbler and the peaches had a strong tinny taste. Service is always friendly, and the meats are always good!
