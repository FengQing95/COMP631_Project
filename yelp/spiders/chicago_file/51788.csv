Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was also bemused by what I received when I ordered a vodka on the rocks. I was presented with a cup filled to the brim with ice chips. It was absurd. So much ice for no apparent reason. Idk who trained the bar to do that. Maybe it's a Chicago thing, but it was way too much and looked ridiculous. Another indication that this place is feigning sophistication. I wonder about the quality of ingredients. It felt like a factory or mall restaurant, not unlike Applebees or something, which I suppose, is why they give out rewards cards like a common department store.
