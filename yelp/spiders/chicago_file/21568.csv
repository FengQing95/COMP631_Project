Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had one each of the "Lou" and "Chicago Classic".  Both of them were decently made, tasted fine, if just a bit greasy.  The amount of food was a bit overwhelming.  This might appeal to families.  We also had the chicken wings which were all right.  Nothing was especially memorable.
