Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For dinner, I had the crab cake and dabbled in the truffle macaroni and cheese as well as the mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were delightful with lots of garlic flavor (but not too much!). The macaroni and cheese was not my favorite, but still strong fare. The crab cake... yeah, I devoured that thing. The remoulade served with the cake seems hardly necessary as the crab cake alone is filled with so much flavor. I had to take a few bites without it just to appreciate the crab and really take in all the flavor.
