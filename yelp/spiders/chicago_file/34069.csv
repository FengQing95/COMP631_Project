Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We really enjoyed our visit to Bavette's.  We ate in the basement and really loved the atmosphere down there.  The food was excellent.  I had the lamb chops which were perfectly prepared.  So moist and so flavorful.  My wife had the rib-eye which she also really enjoyed. She loved the marbling and the flavors that were created.  She had the Lillet Rose Martini and she absolutely loved it.  The seasoning they make for your meat is incredible.  We really enjoyed the mashed potatoes - loaded with flavor!  Great service, although a tad slow, our waiter was helpful and courteous.  Next time I will try the filet - was a tad bit disappointed I didn't get to try it, but the lamb just looked too good to pass us.  I don't think you can go wrong with anything here.
