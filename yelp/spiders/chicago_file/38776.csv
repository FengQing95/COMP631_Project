Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavettes is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I just love the atmosphere in that place; it's a darker, intimate place to dine. We always get the "we're getting your table ready right now so if you want to grab a cocktail at the bar" line from the hostess no matter if we show up late or early to the reservation. So we always grab a cocktail at the bar and before the drink is even made, the hostess comes over to seat us and transfer the cocktail from the bar tab to our table tab.
