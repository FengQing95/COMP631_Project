Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////it took about 45 min to be seated, and it didn't seem busy. we had to order our pizza while we were standing around, and after half an hour i thought i was going to have a hypoglycemic attack. when we were seated, the decor was lame, i thought -- very kitchy, a theme at some italian restaurants that i will never understand or embrace. the pizza came and it was okay but i would have rather spent my caloric intake at PIECE or really anywhere else. buttercrust? why doesn't it taste like buttery goodness? it doesn't taste like anything. it tastes like a ball of dough. i don't understand chicago pizza, and the supposed best of the best couldn't even convince me. blah.
