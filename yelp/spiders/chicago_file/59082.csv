Smoque BBQ////* Overview: This is indeed some of the best BBQ you will find in Chicago.  And at a very reasonable price, if you ask me.  (Not cheap per se, but inexpensive for BBQ -- you can get a sandwich and side for like $7-$8 and they sell sides and small portions of everything for like $4 if you want to sample it all.)
