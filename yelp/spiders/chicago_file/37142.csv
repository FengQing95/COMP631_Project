Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Chicago magazine gave Bavettes a stellar review so we had dinner Sunday night. Whatever good you have heard is exceeded by the actual reality.  The food is fabulous and the service was perfect (thanks, Meredith).  Next time we will request the lower level which seems even more romantic!
