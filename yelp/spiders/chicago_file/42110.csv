Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place was fantastic.  Every dish was a flavor explosion in your mouth.  The only thing that didn't totally grab us was the sangria (we chose the raspberry) - guess we just like alcohol that tastes more like wine and less like juice. But I would go there again in a heartbeat!  And the dessert tapas gave us  that little sweet at the end to complete the meal.
