Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////bone marrow was fantastic but the presentation is an illusion. everyone posts these big big bone pieces that take up the entire table but the amount of marrow is about 5% of what you see since its just a tiny scoop in the middle of each of those bones. the price does not justify and im the one who will easily drop 200-300 on a good meal
