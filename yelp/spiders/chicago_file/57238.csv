Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Delicious food and equally delicious sangria! I've been here a few times now and the tapas are always amazing and a pitcher of sangria will definitely have you feelin' some type of way..white or red! For tapas, I always get the spicy potatoes with tomato aioli and garlic shrimp. The paella is also pretty good and easy to share with a large group.
