Art Institute of Chicago////My only minor boo, is to the fact that they recently tightened their member policy, and that now the membership card holder also has to show an ID to get inside w/up to only 2 guests, and that you can't just hand it off to a friend anymore. Still, I guess enough people abused that old policy with how many people were trying to get in when a member handed the card off to a group of people to go inside, that it likely ruined it for all members.
