Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////After acquainting ourselves with the bar with a couple of cognac sazeracs and Manhattans (both drinks were spot on), we were seated at an elevated booth that was great for people watching and helped us generally feel pretty good about ourselves (the vibe and alcohol were working their magic). Our server was pretty talkative and, luckily, we were feeling chatty.
