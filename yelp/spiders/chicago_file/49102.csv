Smoque BBQ////Had fantastic catering from these folks.  First, food is Ah-mazing.  All my guests were raving about the make-your-own pulled pork sandwiches.  Nice and professional folks on the catering staff--they managed a last minute request from me and still got everything done on time.  Someone even had a cart and helped me take all the food to the car. Highly recommend the catering! :)
