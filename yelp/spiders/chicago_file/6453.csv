The Purple Pig////Came here highly recommended by all my coworkers who recently visited Chicago. So we booked this place 3 weeks ahead of time, and came with pretty high expectations. And we were not disappointed! It is located inside the 444 Michigan Ave building. Staff members were not wearing masks. The place was packed and fully booked out because I tried to push my reservation back and could not find any openings. But I also came on Father's Day so not surprised. The staff members were super nice. We ordered a half bottle of the special red wine that was chilled - Podere Pradarolo Indocilis Emilia. It was unlike any red wine we've ever had and even had a slight fizz to it. tasted Very smooth, and apparently is free of any added sulfites. And I'm usually not a red wine person and I enjoyed it very much!
