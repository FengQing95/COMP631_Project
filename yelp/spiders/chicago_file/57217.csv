Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I finally was able to try this place out yesterday and it was an absolutely wonderful dining experience.  I came here with a group of friends for their happy hour and it's awesome how they have happy hour everyday (including weekends) from 4-6pm.  I also really like that they have food included in their happy hour deal, not just drinks.  I loved the ambience, the decor, and how many different rooms there were.  You don't feel like you're in Lincoln Park in there, which I like.  We had a nice table by the bar.  We ordered a pitcher of sangria for $16, really tasty and did its job.  They serve you nice bread with extra virgin olive oil at the table.  I always appreciate when restaurants do that.
