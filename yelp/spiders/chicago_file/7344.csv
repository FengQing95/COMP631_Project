Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is one of my favorite places to visit in Chicago and should be a must-visit destination for anyone living in the city as well as visitors.  All summer admission is free from 5-9 on Thursday and Friday nights.  Definitely stop by to see the magnificent new addition and enjoy some of the world's greatest art.
