Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My gfs and I decided to leave the pleasant 70-80 degree weather of SoCal and visit an old college gf in Chicago this past weekend. On our last night there, we wanted to do a nice dinner before a night out in the town. Unfortunately we got our day started super late (3 pm!) but our gf heard a lot of great things about this place and the deciding factor to come here - they close at midnight!
