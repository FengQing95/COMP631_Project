Smoque BBQ////As a southerner, I am a fan of good BBQ and so far SMOQUE is the best I have had in Chicago! The brisket and pulled pork are mouth wateringly delicious... and their sides equally tasty. The Mac and Cheese is rich and creamy, the baked beans are flavorful (from the meat they cook it with), and the fries are phenomenal. Portions are huge... but no worries... SMOQUE left overs taste just as good the day after!!!
