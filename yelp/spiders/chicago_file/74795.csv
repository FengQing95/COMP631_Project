Little Goat Diner////Once the food was brought to the table, we had to wait a good 5 minutes for someone to look at me to ask for utensils. After getting someone's attention, someone other than my waiter, I asked, "Can I please have some utensils?" He gave me a dirty look and said "Do you mean you want silverware?" Our waitress was nice and sweet, but definitely not on the ball.
