The Purple Pig////Hummus Shakshouka - OK....this dish was a dud.  The menu described it beautifully and I thought we would actually get Shakshouka but it was pretty much de-constructed which is not how the menu described it.  We got an egg, some sauce and hummus.  Honestly, this dish was beyond not worth it and I'm surprised it is on the menu.  Do NOT waste your time/money on this.
