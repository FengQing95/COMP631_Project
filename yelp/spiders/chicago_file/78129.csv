Little Goat Diner////To get a table at lunch time was a 1 hour wait. They have an espresso bar and outdoor seating so we enjoyed espresso drinks and cookies outside while we waited. I got an americano (surprise, I know) but the others got lattes and macchiatos with goat milk - except wait they were out of goat milk. All good nonetheless.
