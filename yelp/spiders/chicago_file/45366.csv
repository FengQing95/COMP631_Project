Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Things must have changed quite a bit since the other reviews mentioning gluten were written about this place. They now have a dedicated gluten-free menu, which is an enormous plus in my book. Though - not being super sensitive myself - I can't speak for how diligent or careful they are with cooking things gluten-free.
