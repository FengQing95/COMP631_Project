Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If we didn't have guests in town, we would have left after speaking to his manager about the snarky service. We put our name in, placed our order with the register as instructed and were added to the list which thankfully was updated via a website so we went to Pink Taco for drinks. An hour and 15 minutes later we were sat, then WAITED ANOTHER HOUR AND 15 MINUTES for our pizzas. What was the point in putting in our order ahead of time? Our server, while nice was aloof and did not take good care of us on drinks or time updates. We asked for water several times, refill on beers and iced tea with no luck. Â The pizza is good, do not get me wrong because it is my favorite deep dish in the city. The crust is the secret!
