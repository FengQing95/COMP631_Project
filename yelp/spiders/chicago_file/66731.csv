Little Goat Diner////You know my favorite thing about this place?  It's something you don't see of a ton anymore, when you come in, or when I came in, I noticed all the nice things about the space, the choice decor, the high low ambiance, but, the thing that stood out the most was the sense of pride coming from the staff working there.   You can just tell that the people who work at this place just love it, must be treated well, and take a real sense of pride and ownership of this space in a completely genuine way.   I think that says volumes about the owner on so many levels.  It was really impressive.  I will need to go back when I am hungrier, they give you a LOT of food.
