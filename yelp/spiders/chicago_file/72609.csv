Little Goat Diner////Beyond the food, the decor of the restaurant is quite charming, befitting the cute name and mascot. Even though we went at a late hour, the staff were still on point, answering all our questions and generally providing good service and a welcoming atmosphere. If I find myself in the area again, I'll likely stop in again.
