Smoque BBQ////Having been to Texas recently and eating some AMAZING BBQ, I was excited to try this place. And I wanted to love it as I'm on a never ending search for some good brisket in Chicago. Unfortunately, this one isn't as good as I need it to be. I'm not saying their brisket is bad but I don't believe it's as amazing as everyone says. Yes there was a smoke ring on it but it was tiny. If you got a bite with that, the flavor was good. But the meat in the middle was almost bland. I really don't like BBQ sauce and think the meat should stand on it's own so I can't comment on that. My boyfriend enjoyed his meal. I know he got ribs but couldn't tell you what else other than the brisket chili. This was pretty good but a really small portion. And it's not cheap either.  Between the two of us, I spent almost $30 on lunch.  I suppose I understand the lines out the door as there really aren't too many places that it's competing with.  I would say that Chicago is starved for some truly great BBQ.  Unfortunately, this place isn't going to hold a candle to true Texas BBQ.
