Little Goat Diner////Visit #2 - Two little half breeds in tow, ordered the smoked corned beef hash.  Salty!  I mean to the point I tried to choke it down and finally told the waiter it was inedible.  I can't remember the last time I sent a meal back to the kitchen.  The waiter was cool and took it off the bill, but really.  It tasted like someone dropped a salt shaker in the corned beef.  BTW...Corned Beef Hash is my measuring stick on a breakfast place.  Izard you friggin' failed.  The only redeeming part of the meal was the kimchi cream cheese.
