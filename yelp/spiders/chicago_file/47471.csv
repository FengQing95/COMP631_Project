Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba was SO incredibly busy and such a HUGE place that I was overwhelmed when walking in. But we got a couple spots at the bar in the back and settled in quite quickly. I was surprised at the volume level for the mass amount of people that were occupying the restaurant, which was nice. Service was great we were served drinks almost immediately upon sitting down and had food orders in shortly after. There were three of us and we each ordered three tapas items from the menu. Everything we tried was excellent. My favorite, strangely enough, was the spicy seasoned potatoes. So simple, yet so delicious! One can never go wrong with a bacon wrapped date either. Highly recommended. I would come here again.
