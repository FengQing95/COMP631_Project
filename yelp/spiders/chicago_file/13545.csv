Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The best thing about Malnati's deep dish for me is that you can get sausage as an entire patty spread about the whole pie (or crumbled/spread out, your choice).  The crust is more crunchy than flaky - and I personally prefer the flaky style from Gino's East.  But, overall, Malnati's deep dish is a very good Chicago style pie served in a great sports themed atmosphere.  I'd give it a solid 3 stars!  The extra star here (bringing it up to a more-than-respectable 4) is because they have Peroni on tap.
