Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My husband and I went here on a recommendation from a friend in the area.  We wanted to grab a drink while we waited for our table and were lucky enough to find two seats at the bar that were just vacated.  ROB asked if we would prefer to eat at the bar... we did as we were watching the hockey game that was on and were grateful he made the offer.
