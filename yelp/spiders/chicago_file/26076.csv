Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This the best pizza place I've ever been. The hubby and I were recommended this spot from an uber driver. We were visiting from California and we were heading to a different restaurant and when the uber driver started to describe the pizza and how it's his favorite place we decided to skip on the plans we had and headed to Lou Malnatis Pizzeria instead.
