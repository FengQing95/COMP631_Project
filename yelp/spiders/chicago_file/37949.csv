Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I heard so many amazing things about Bavette's Bar & Boeuf from friends, co-workers, and fellow Yelpers, but trying to make reservations for dinner was always a hassle.  Finally, I scored reservations for dinner on a Friday night for two.  It was three months out, but nonetheless I was finally going to experience what the hype was all about.  I decided to invite my sister since she appreciates food as much as me.
