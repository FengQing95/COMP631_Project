Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was super excited to visit Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba and it didn't disappoint. We enjoyed many of the tapas which you can view in my photos. My favorites were the beef empanadas and spicy potatoes. The chicken paella was also fantastic. It takes about 30-40 minutes to prepare and you only get an hour and a half reservation so be sure to order early during your meal. The sangria flights were also pretty tasty and a good portion for a flight.
