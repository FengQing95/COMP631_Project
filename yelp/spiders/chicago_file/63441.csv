Smoque BBQ////I would always tell my friends to go here if they want some BBQ and they will not be disappointed. But I would suggest that you come in early because the line are always all the way out in the streets, but they are fast in getting your orders out. If you don't want to wait in line you van always call ahead and just eat it at home. You will still get to eat the best BBQ but at comforts of your home.
