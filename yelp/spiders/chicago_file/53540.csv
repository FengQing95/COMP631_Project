Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The sangria reminded me of the sangria I used to drink in Barcelona! All the tapas were really good too. I loved loved LOVED the bacon wrapped dates and the patatas brava were just the right level of spice. The one thing I wouldn't order again was the sea scallops. I just wasn't a big fan of the flavor and there were probably other things on the menu that I would have liked better. Our server was so fantastic too! She was on top of her stuff and just a great, enthusiastic waitress who really helped to make this experience top-notch. Overall had a great meal here, but would highly recommend a reservation before trying to come here!
