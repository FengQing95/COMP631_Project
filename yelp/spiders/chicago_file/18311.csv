Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There's always an intense disagreement about the best Chicago pizza in town. The place isn't by favorite, but it was solid and good. It's super busy on the weekend but worth the wait. Take a walk around the neighborhood while you're waiting for your table. You'll want to burn some calories before you partake.
