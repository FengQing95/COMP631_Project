Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place is the epitome of what a glorious steakhouse should be! From the moment you walk in, you know you're in for an amazing culinary experience. The vibe is old Chicago which is awesome and the decor sells the look as well. We went to the bar first and the bartender worked his magic and made me a fantastic old fashioned. Then for dinner I had the NY strip cooked medical rare and it was absolutely delicious. I chewed as slow as humanly possible to enjoy it fully. I had the mash potatoes as the side and they were fantastic too. Definitely a must go in Chicago!
