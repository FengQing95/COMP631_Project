Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is not really a steak house... not in the way most people think of steak houses at least.  They don't have a porterhouse or even a strip steak on the menu!  These are classic cuts of meat that ANY true steakhouse would have (often in multiple forms). They also do not tout the origins of most of their meat and only one is listed as being aged at all (dry aged with no length of time mentioned).
