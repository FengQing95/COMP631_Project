Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I had heard a lot about this brunch place and am glad to say it finally loved upto it. Strongly recommend that you be prepared for a 30-40 minute wait, might just to useful to take a walk down millennium park then. Omlettes and pancakes are just amazing and the service very friendly !
