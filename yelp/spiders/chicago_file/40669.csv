Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba kicks butt when it comes to food and service! The food is always amazing! And so is the sangria! AND the service!! We had a big group and ended up being seated in a tight space, but not enough to bother us. The manager came up to us, apologized, and quickly moved us to a bigger table. He also told us he would have a little surprise for us in the end. We ordered TONS of food and forgot all about the surprise, but he was sure to remind us. He gave us 50% off for the inconvenience and then gave us a gift certificate or two. We saved like $150-$200. He really didn't have to, it's all of our favorite tapas place.
