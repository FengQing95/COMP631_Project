Smoque BBQ////We had lunch on a Tuesday, so there was no line and service was quick! Ordered chopped brisket and pulled pork, and I must say - best BBQ joint in Chicago!! Absolutely gorgeous meat that falls apart at the fork I almost cried T T. pork was exceptionally great, but I just prefer brisket for my taste. Mac and cheese was creamy, Â cornbread was nice, and peach cobbler is a must buy for a side. The only side that was average was the chili, but even then it was ok. Will definitely go again!!
