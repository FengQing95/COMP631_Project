Little Goat Diner////But this time I came with a good friend and we ordered real food -- I got the Korean goat burger and he a goat patty melt. Oh boy, was it good. I understand the hype. The fries were great too. It sure is a hell of a lot of food and I'd probably split one next time, but really pretty innovative and fun things going on here, and cute atmosphere.
