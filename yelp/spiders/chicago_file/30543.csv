Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have never written a Yelp review, but I felt obligated to create an account after my experience last night at Lou Malnati's on Wells St. Â Never in my life have I witnessed such incompetence. We arrived at 7:45pm and were told it would be a 45-minute wait but they would take our order to get a jump start. No problem, as we figured that their deep dish pie would be worth the wait. Boy, were we wrong about that...
