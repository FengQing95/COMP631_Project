Little Goat Diner////Came here at around 6 on a Saturday and was seated immediately. We just wanted an appetizer/little sampling of food, so we ordered some sides. The Mac and cheese is some of the best I've ever had and the Brussels sprouts were very solid. I'd definitely come back again. Some of the entrees were priced more expensive than I would expect, especially given that it's ala carte, but the flavors are all there. The nachos were huge - definitely more than enough to share and worth the price.
