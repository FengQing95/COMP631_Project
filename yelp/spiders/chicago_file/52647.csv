Smoque BBQ////Best BBQ in Chicago and it stands up with those in the south.  Brisket is amazing, I don't know how they do it so much better than everyone else.  Feel free to message me if you disagree, fully prepared to stand up to this statement, as I have several times in the past.  Sides are amazing as well and the patio is great in the summer.  I used to make the special trip when I lived much further away but it has been one of the biggest fringe benefits to living in the area the past couple years.  Only knock is closed on Mondays (I get it, just been a heartbreaking revelation each time I picked up the phone, mouth watering for what I was about to get into, only to realize it's a Monday...But when you're this good you probably deserve a day off every now and then.
