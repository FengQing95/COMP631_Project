Smoque BBQ////Love their BBQ and pulled pork. By far the best I have found and I've always on a mission for good BBQ. I love that you get extra sauce when you order since I'm an "extra sauce" type of girl. This is my favorite place to go for lunch. Great atmosphere and while it's a little busy during the lunch hours, it is definitely worth it. I've talked to the owner a few times and I love how he's always there and enthusiastic about his restaurant.
