Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When the salad came, it was a lot bigger than what we expected.  I wish our server would have informed us that it would be too much as that was enough for 8-10 people!  We ate as much as we can, but most of it unfortunately, went to waste.  The bruschetta was pretty good.  Nothing fancy, but still tasty.
