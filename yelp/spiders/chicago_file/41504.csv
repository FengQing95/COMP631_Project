Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////SANGRIA, oh yeah need i say more. I am a man who loves red sangria. I was first introduced to it in NYC at Empanada mama, ohh yeah the large pitcher is the way to start your evening, esp if yours started at 3pm. A bad sangria has made certain that I will never return to cheesecake factory so Sangria will make or break it for me. Now the sangria here was very good, not as good as Empanada Mama but close. The food was pretty good as well. I lucked out that I got to eat on the patio in October on a warm evening. All in all I will be back for more sangria. OH YEAH
