The Purple Pig////Friendly and helpful staff. Clean restrooms with good smelling soap and very moisturizing lotion. Although street parking is available, walking or public transportation are better ways of getting there. This restaurant is located near a lot of stores for those who are interested in shopping nearby. There is indoor and outdoor seating available. I did feel, however, rushed to eat and get out even though I was only a table for 2 eating at 4:30pm. Â
