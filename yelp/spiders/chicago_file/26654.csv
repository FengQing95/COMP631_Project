Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The other night, I was feeling like pizza but not feeling deep dish.  Decided to try their thin crust sausage pizza.  To my amazement, the crust was the same used on their deep dish but just thinner and less cheese.  So if you're thinking about thin crust at Lou's, I would definitely vouch for it.
