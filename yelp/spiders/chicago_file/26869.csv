Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For all the hype, we were not impressed especially for the price (come to around $40 with tax and tip). My sister had just had Giordano's the night before and she said she preferred that to this place. It may be a different experience if we had dined in and got to enjoy the food fresh out of the oven/fryer but in the case of delivery, just.... don't.
