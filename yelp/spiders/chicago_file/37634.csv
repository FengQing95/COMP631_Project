Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is a fairly large venue and we were seated promptly after our arrival in the downstairs portion of the restaurant. While I've seen other reviews complaining about the basement area, I thought it was incredibly lovely and intimate. We were the first seated down there but many other guests arrived afterwards so it got a bit louder but we felt pretty special those few minutes we had the place to ourselves. In fact, because of the excellent service we felt pretty special the entire time. ;)
