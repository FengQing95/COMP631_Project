Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was a very good deep dish pie.  I came in on a Monday evening right around five and placed a to-go order for a deep dish cheese.  I was quoted 30-35 minutes on the pie and it was out in 30 minutes.  While the pizza wasn't super hot when I got back to where I was staying, a/ that is my fault for walking 10 minutes in a cold wind and b/ to be honest, I don't prefer my food to be so hot that I burn myself so I can't count that against them.  Thought the cheese / sauce ratio was very good, and the crust was very tasty.  Additionally, on the value scale, I'd say that Malnati's gave me a lot more pizza for my buck that Giordano's and Gino's East (at least according to what their websites said before my trip).  A couple days later I had the leftovers for breakfast, and they reheated nicely as well.  Four stars up for Lou!
