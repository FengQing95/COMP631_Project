Little Goat Diner////We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We'll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn't mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide.
