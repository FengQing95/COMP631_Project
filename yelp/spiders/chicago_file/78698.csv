Little Goat Diner////Redemption occurred in the form of two excellent dishes. The Okonomiyaki was solid: salty, savory, and sweet. The chives were a great touch as they brough some freshness to an otherwise intensely decadent dish. I think more bonito flakes would have dialed the flavor up even more. My Los Drowned sandwich, a plump stack of juicy braised beef and fixings in crusty bolillo bread, was excellent and insanely filling. Factoring in the acidity of the pickled onions, the creamy and potent Havarti, and the fresh crunch of the cole slaw, the dang thing was so flavorful that the accompanying jus became sort of an afterthought. Little Goat gets a solid B+/A- from me.
