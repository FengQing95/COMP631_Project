Smoque BBQ////INCREDIBLE, AMAZING, FANTASTIC BBQ...in Chicago!?!  Listen, Chicago loves it's food and love's it meaty, hearty, and delicious!  This place is the brain child of a Texas transplant, and this is far and away, hands down, no questions asked the best BBQ in a "non-traditional" BBQ place I have ever been!  Top 5 BBQ of my life!  The meat is outstanding! The sauce is incredible! The sides are out of this world!  Do not let the line discourage you.  A line means something great is worth the wait!
