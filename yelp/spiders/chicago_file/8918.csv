Art Institute of Chicago////Where else can you stand in front of a Georges Seurat and count the dots, wonder what Grant Wood was thinking while painting American Gothic and wonder what lurks around the corner of the diner in Edward Hopper's Nighthawks? Not to mention some of the most well know works of art from European masters old and new. A beautiful place and a must see if you are in Chicago!
