Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It was very easy to make reservations, to my relief. I made my reservation for 3 a couple days in advance and the time slots were wide open. I'm not sure we needed reservations, as the space is very large (there are multiple seating areas) and there was plenty of seating when we got there a little after 10 am on Sunday. Even when we left, there was still plenty of seating open, though it was starting to fill up a little bit.
