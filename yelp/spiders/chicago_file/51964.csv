Smoque BBQ////We went on a Saturday at 6:30.  There was a short line out the door.  The line was full the entire time we were there.  One of the men that works there said it had been that crazy since 11:30 am!  They do a good job moving you through the line and they help coordinate seating after you've ordered.  And if you have any left, they're happy to provide to-go boxes.  If you enjoy a cold one with your BBQ, it's BYOB.
