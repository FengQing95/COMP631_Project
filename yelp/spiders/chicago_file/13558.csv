Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chicago.  Sure D. Rose and Los Toros got bounced from the playoffs.  And I know it looks like the Bears won't be playing anytime soon ... and when they do they're stuck with glass-knee Cutler at the helm.  And yeah the Cubbies and the Sox are both below five hundred, and one hasn't won it all since the Model T was cruising the streets.  BUT YOU'VE GOT PIZZA!  And not just pizza ... but Chicago style pizza.  And not just Chicago style pizza ... but Lou Malnati's Chicago style pizza.  It must have been pretty weird for Lou growing up as a kid.  I mean, imagine it ... family gathering around the Thanksgiving table, and while every other family in town was about to pass around some pumpkin pie ... well you know what little Lou got?  That's right ... keep it coming Grandma, send me over a slice of that mind-blowing, deep-dish pizza pie.  I mean, seriously?  If you had a recipe this good up your sleeve and you were looking at a lineup of pumpkin, Dutch apple, and sausage and mozzarella ... do you really think you could resist?  And keeping up with tradition, The Good Grub threw down for the same ... a giant pie filled with hearty sausage, a heaping-helping of mozzarella, all layered with rich chunky tomatoes and nestled into that buttery, flaky crust ... aptly named the Malnati Chicago Classic.  We rolled into town starving, and as always, with eyes bigger than our stomachs.  So when the three of us saw that a large served three to four, we didn't realize that the fourth dude had to be a truck driver.  Seriously, this pizza is thick ... but unlike some other thick things I know ... this one you actually want to introduce to your buddies.  Every bite is an adventure to flavor town ... such a jungle of juicy sausage, rolling around with that gooey cheese, all tucked neatly into bed under that blanket of tomato madness.  It's enough to bring a weak man to his knees ... and a strong man to GRUB glory.  Sure there's a lot of food, but don't hesitate to pile on some grated parmesan, oregano, and chili flakes ... everything at Lou's can partake in the glory.  So as we begin to wonder what housing prices are like in Chicago, we start to do some mental calculations ... yeah it's freezing 50% of the year, but this place is dishing out mouth-watering pizza 100% of the year.  And I'm no math major ... but I'm liken them odds.  So if you're traveling through Chicago, or you're lucky enough to live there, say hello to Lou for me ... and promise you'll be thankful for the GRUB about to hit the table.
