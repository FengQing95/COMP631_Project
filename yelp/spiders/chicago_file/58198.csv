Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Amazing!! From start to finish simply amazing! Paz was our server and she was great and very attentive. I can't say enough about their octopus and squid, simply stellar!!! This was the most tender and perfectly done octopus I have ever eaten, so evenly cooked! The paella, white, and red sangria were also so flavorful and worth it. Make sure you ask for your paella to come with the crust because that's where allll the flavor is!
