Little Goat Diner////Coffee is worthy doing recommendation too:) Â I ordered a latte wiz goat milk, lol yah goat again:) love this place, except needing to loudly speak cuz of the place has the loft design, and our waitress was so weird, can't find her all the time, but when she showed up she is very busy/hurry to take plates.....so annoying
