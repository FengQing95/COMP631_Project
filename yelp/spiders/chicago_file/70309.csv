Little Goat Diner////Food was very good. Air conditioning was almost non-existent. Hostess said A/C was having trouble that day. We were told by our waiter that they  had to close on Father's Day because of the heat so it wasn't just the day we were here. You expect A/C at a restaurant in Chicago during the summer.   If it's a hot day and you don't mind sweating while you eat - eat here. In addition  the noise level was 9.5 on a 10 Point scale.
