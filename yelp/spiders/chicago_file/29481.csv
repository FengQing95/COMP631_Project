Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Sadly the famous deep dish pizza was very sub par and I regretted wasting a meal and stomach space on it. We got the smallest deep dish size, which is a small. There's a "personal" size but apparently that is not a real deep dish pizza? When the pizza came out the top did not have that slight char you usually get from pizza ovens. The crust was not crispy on the bottom. It was extremely doughy. There was no flavor. I just couldn't taste anything except dough. Usually the toppings are supposed to give the pizza flavor but I guess the flavor was so light it was overwhelmed by the amount of dough. We had to cover it in parm and red pepper and salt. I have never had to salt my pizza before.
