Smoque BBQ////These folks are the best BBQ in Chicago, no question! The food is simply awesome every time I've eaten here. The seating is more German house style where tables are set right next to each other. This makes it so you make new friends. I always overhear newbies talking about their food, then I butt in to open the conversation. The owners are almost always on site and will make the rounds to see how folks are enjoying their food. If there is a line out the door, be patient and wait it out, it's totally worth it. Also, for parking on the weekends, check out the wooden gated area just behind smoque, there is almost always a spot or two. BYOB.
