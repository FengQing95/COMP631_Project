Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I adore Au Cheval and I love Maude's, but Bavette's was kind of meh based on service alone. Our waitress at our table downstairs (short blond haired girl wearing a bandana headband) was not very attentive much of the night. She seemed to only walk around aimlessly and each time I tried to make eye contract with her because our empty drinks needed refilling or our first course was done and we wanted to order more things, she seemed to glaze over and walk by the table for a few times until she finally asked us if we wanted anything else 10-15 minutes later. This happened multiple times throughout the night. She just seemed to be walking around in circles and doing the same thing to most other tables too.
