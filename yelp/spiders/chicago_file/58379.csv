Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////An iconic Chicago restaurant! I've been here a couple times and have enjoyed my food and the service immensely. The food is great because you can order a couple different items and share them with your friends. I've not been disappointed by any of the brunch or dinner items I've had. Also they're sangria is the best! If you enjoy sangria you have to try theirs. Will definitely be back!
