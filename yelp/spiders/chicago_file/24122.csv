Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The calamari was delicious and I could tell they do have quality ingredients (apparently they hand pick tomatoes once a year). Then our "small" pizza arrived. It was not small. I was struggling to finish that last second piece. It was sooo cheesy and the sausage is more like a sausage pancake in the cheese instead of the bits I was expecting.
