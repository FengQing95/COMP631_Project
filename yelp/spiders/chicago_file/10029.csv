Art Institute of Chicago////Beautiful, educational & exciting, the Art Institute is legendary for a reason. One could easily spend days getting lost exploring the masterpieces in this museum. The frequently changing exhibitions make recurrent trips a must. The staff is friendly and personable, and the building in itself is not only in the center of downtown, but an icon of Chicago.
