Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////In the end, the app was okay...and he didn't warn for how large it would be so we chowed down and were nearly full by the time the pizza came. Again, the waiter was great allowing us to go halfsies on putting meat on only one side since I'm the only non meat eater here. With the small veggie (and added half meat), it came out to two slices per person. The immediate slice was good - not great. And within minutes, the cheesiness was no longer that ooey gooey goodness that I was hoping would last throughout my first piece at the very least.
