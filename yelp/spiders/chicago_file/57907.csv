Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is the toughest review I have written yet because the night was a blur. Ba Ba Reeba is a tapas joint and we just kept ordering small plate after small plate, pitcher of sangria after pitcher of sangria. I tried to keep up with pictures, but during a meal--a really good meal with fun people--you just have to let go and just be in the moment. I missed a couple dishes and I can't remember them, but know that they were delicious. You can create a meal with a variety of tapas, or choose a selection as an appetizer and enjoy one of their paellas as your main course.
