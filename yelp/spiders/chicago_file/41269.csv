Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here recently with a group of 12 on a Saturday night at prime time, and they made our night fantastic. Most of the group showed up 45 minutes late, but they didn't give the table away and got us right in once everyone arrived. The service and food were great, and the tab extremely reasonable. We will be back!
