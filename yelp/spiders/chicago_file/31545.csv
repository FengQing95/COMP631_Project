Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am from the NYC/NJ area so I can be biased oh what I think pizza should be like. I got the sausage deep dish (with sausage pieces) and just wasn't into it. The sauce was ok but it's just too much dough for me. One piece of this and I am all set. I'll stick to my thin crust pizza which I hear Chicago has a decent amount of. I hear this is the best place to go though if you want the classic deep dish Chicago pizza
