The Purple Pig////I went here just for dessert because I keep hearing how amazing the Sicilian Iris is. Well it Lived up to its expectations! It's like a  warm cannoli! I love it and will be bbrinfing my family back to try it.   However, this place is just soooo loud. The music is blasting. And everyone's conversations echo about with the high ceilings.  Not a pleasant place to spend any significant amount of time.  I was happy to be out of there.  Maybe next time I'll order dessert to go
