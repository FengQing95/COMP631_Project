Little Goat Diner////I had a ton of things go wrong accidently (two different drinks were spilled, etc) and they bent over backwards to make sure they took care of everything and reimbursed me.  They are so, so kind and gracious, which is rare in a place this popular.  They take such great pride in what they do.  Everyone from the people at the host stand, to the bartenders to the waitress and even the assistant manager were all the loveliest.
