Little Goat Diner////All the hype about this place is legit.  You get delicious large portion food with a decent price and impeccable service.  Definitely a must try if you haven't already.  There were many more entrees my sister and I wanted to try, but with those three entrees our tummies were screaming "no more please!!"  We are going to return soon to try out some breakfast items.
