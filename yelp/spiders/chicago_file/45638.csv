Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered the specialty Mango Sangria, Yum!  The dishes add up quick because you just want to eat and eat and eat!  We ordered the Calimari, Scallops, Shrimp, Ribs, Beef, Stuffed Mushrooms, Spicy Potatoes, Roasted Sweet Potatoes.  Overall it was good.  For the prices, fantastic, if you don't mind the greasiness, oiliness, and saltiness.  I prefer some other places just for presentation and overall taste.  Not complaining bout it because it was still good.
