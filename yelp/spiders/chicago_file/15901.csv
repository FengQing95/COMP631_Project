Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For the dessert we got the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream, which was delicious- probably tastes the same everywhere.  When it got crowded the waitress came back a little less, which was fine, but completely forgot our dessert order till 30 minutes later.  She did not even take it off the receipt, but oh well.  I decided to order a fresh frozen pizza to take back to DC, which worked out well and hopefully that tastes as good as the one in the store!  I would have given it 4.5 stars, due to the service and I really liked another pizza place, so it was not "As good as it gets," but I am a FAN!
