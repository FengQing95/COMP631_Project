Smoque BBQ////Had a pulled pork sandwich here with my friend. The atmosphere was kind of loud and uncomfortable (bad acoustics + crazy noise) and they tried to seat us at a long table knocking elbows with a screaming kid (no thanks). We sat off to the side somewhere else. The food itself was pretty good, but I think we crammed ourselves too full and got nauseous. The bread they put the sandwich on wasn't really my favorite (I shouldn't be eating bread anyway but couldn't resist), it was like a dinner roll or something.
