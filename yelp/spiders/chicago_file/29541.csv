Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is definitely the place to go for some awesome Chicago-style pizza. It's usually pretty busy, so be prepared for a bit of a wait. When we got there, we were told our wait would be 25-35 minutes and were able to put our pizza order in so it could be made while we waited. We were seated not even 20 minutes later, which was pretty awesome.
