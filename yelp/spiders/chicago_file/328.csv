Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Their claim to fame pancake - Berry Bliss tasted like borderline cough syrup to me. Yes, I am Queen Robitussin over here.  It didn't quite cross that mark, but it was close enough for me to make that comparison.  We also had the tiramisu and the oreos pancake and I think my favorite had to be the oreo's one.  What left me the most disappointed was due to the fact that I build so much pressure on it exceeding the hype that these pancakes should've been out-of-this-world good.. I definitely didn't reach that conclusion.
