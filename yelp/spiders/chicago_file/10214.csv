Art Institute of Chicago////This was also my first time checking out the gorgeous Modern Art Wing. Even if I don't really get modern art, it sure is interesting. The space is this wing is well lit by natural light and huge and open. You'll find works by Picasso, Dali, and Pollack here. After looking around, make sure you head to the top floor where there is a great restaurant and outdoor sculpture exhibit. Here you will also find a bridge that you can take to the park and there are fantastic views of the city.
