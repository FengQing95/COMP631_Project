Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////With a half dozen parties ahead of us, and a quote of 35 minutes, you can imagine our shock when we were seated less than ten minutes later.  I'm glad we got to pre-order of pizza at least.  Rylan made a wonderful server.  While we were waiting, J ordered a bowl of minestrone that was only lukewarm.  Rylan was able to get it heated efficiently (we told him microwave was fine) and with no worries.
