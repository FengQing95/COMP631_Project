Little Goat Diner////This place really did not live up to the expectations set by all the lists it appears on for great dining in chicago.  Appetizers and dinner came out within two minutes of each other, the temperature in the restaurant was too hot, and food was just average. Don't get me wrong it was good -just not worth all the hype and I don't think would return  for dinner -maybe for brunch.
