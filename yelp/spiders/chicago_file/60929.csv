Smoque BBQ////If you go here hungry, don't order a small side of anything expecting a huge amount.  It's literally a small portion.  Also, don't expect a quiet, private conversation with your bestie or a date.  The tables are communal and just enough elbow room to keep the person at the next table from slopping BBQ sauce your way or swiping a nibble of that brisket.
