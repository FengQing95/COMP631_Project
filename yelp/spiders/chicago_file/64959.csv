Smoque BBQ////The cornbread was unimpressive and also very dry; the Mac n cheese was watery and not super cheesy; the bbq beans were also very watery and sour/ vinegary. Beans are usually my favorite thing to get with bbq, but I didn't like these. It's OK though, I don't come for the sides -- I come for the meat and for the fun of eating a ton of meat here.
