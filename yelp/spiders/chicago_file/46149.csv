Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was great, I always love the baked goat cheese, and the bacon wrapped dates are yummy!  Also really enjoyed the braised short ribs, and lots of others looked fabulous.  Plus, who doesn't love tiny desserts?  It's almost impossible to overindulge!!  But although tapas do make for a great time, it's almost better when there are only 3 or 4 in your group and everyone can share.  We ended up ordering 2 or 3 dishes per couple, so we didn't really get to diversify since each dish only feeds about 2 to 3.  But oh, the sangria!  My favorite part of the meal.  Passionfruit? Yep.  Classic Red?  Pour me another.  Peach?  Refill at table 54, por favor.  You just can't wrong with pitchers of these!
