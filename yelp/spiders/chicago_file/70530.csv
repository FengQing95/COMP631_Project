Little Goat Diner////Underwhelmed. I'm a little over the "Goat" hype. We came for lunch and ordered fried pickles & onions- they're more tempura style and were just okay. My grilled cheese with smoked tomato was mediocre. The smoke was super overwhelming and killed any other flavor the sandwich may have had. It wasn't very brown on the outside either, which meant it was a little soggy. My grilled cheese sandwiches are better. The razzle chai was pretty good, but I can make that at home too. Sorry, goats!
