Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I am so impressed with their happy hour specials. From 4-6pm every day in the bar area they have tapas and drink specials. We ordered one or two of everything on the happy hour tapas and everything was delicious. My favorites were the bacon wrapped dates, the garlic potato salad, and the patatas bravas. We also ordered a pitcher of delicious sangria. Our server was attentive and quick. With how much food we ordered and our drinks, we were shocked with how cheap our bill was. I can't decide if for the small sizes of the tapas if it would be worth it to pay full non happy hour prices...
