Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There's a lot of debate about best deep dish in Chicago, ask any Chicagoan. But I also reach for Lou's. The crust has a nice buttery flavor to it and the sauce has just the right amount of garlic. The Lou is one of my favorites but you also can't go wrong with pepperoni! I sometimes get the personal size and a side salad which is just perfect.
