Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best pan pizza (deep dish) in Chicago.  That's the only reason to come and it's a winner.  The crust is a traditional cornbread crust and is the right amount of chew and crunch.  Toppings are very good.  If you want thin crust, don't come here-but if traditional pan is what you want I wouldn't go anywhere else.
