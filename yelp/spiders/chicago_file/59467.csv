Smoque BBQ////So. I kind of did. I got a half slab of the St. Louis ribs and a side of brisket. My lovely boyfriend was so kind to get the pulled pork sandwich, so I got to try some of his as well. Everything was delicious. I don't know what brisket these other people are eating, but mine was quite tender and not dry at all. The ribs had the nice pull to them that you expect from St. Louis ribs, and I really appreciate the fact that you get different sauces for different meats. A-plus.
