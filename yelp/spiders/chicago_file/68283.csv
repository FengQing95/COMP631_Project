Little Goat Diner////Was visiting from out of town with my girlfriend. This place came recommended from the owner of a great restaurant in Ann Arbor, MI. It calls itself a diner but is so much more than that. The special that day was a bit out of my comfort zone but so expertly done that I loved it. Corned beef hash isn't a dish that I frequent but only because I've never had it quite like this. If I were local, the corned beef hash and I would be thick as thieves. We sat at the bar and Peter was a pro. He was the perfect host for our first time there. He wasn't over bearing and annoying but he was super attentive and informative. Settling between those spots is an art form, one which Peter has mastered. Congratulations on creating a wonderful spot. Well done!
