Smoque BBQ////Great barbecue! At even better prices!! The only thing that bothered me was that the cashier didn't really explain the process. I wasn't sure if it was table service or if we had to get our food at the window. We figured it out but no one talked about the way they worked things there. That definitely would've been nice to get a heads up. It's a bit crowded inside but the outside patio is nice. I will definitely be coming back!
