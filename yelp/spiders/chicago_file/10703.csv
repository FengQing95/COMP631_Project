Art Institute of Chicago////Wow! This place is huge and it has a lot of great artwork. They let students in for free and side note if you have a Bank of America card you can also get in for free. Expect to be there for at LEAST two hours. There is just so much to see, but the building itself is beautiful and the employees are rather friendly. (Just don't get too close to the artwork)! Parking can get expensive especially on weekends, I paid $37 for the Millennial Garage, there is a Lakeside Garage right next to the Millennial and the prices are pretty identical, to avoid the extra expense you can buy a parking ticket online for half that price. The museum had a great cafe downstairs with chiefs and everything! It was a bit expensive I paid about $17 for a burger,fries and a slice of pie (because I'm a fat ass). But the food was surprisingly good. Very enjoyable. This place is a really great place to see some beautiful art. Great attraction of Chicago.
