Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You must have a deep dish when visiting chicago.  You just must.  This is my favorite location to obtain the need for deep dish when in Chicago.  Place is super old school yet managed great.  You can put your name down and via a text be notified when your table is ready.  They also recommend you order your pizza so they can have it in the oven before you are seated to cut down the wait time.  Food tastes great.
