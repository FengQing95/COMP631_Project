The Purple Pig////*Secreto (Red Pepper, Meyer Lemon Relish + Scallion) - this followed the bavette steak so it's hard to complete when the flavor of this is so bright & light. Regardless, it's rare for restaurants to have this cut (like the skirt steak of pork) and it's PERFECTLY cooked. Not a dry piece of meat in sight.
