Smoque BBQ////Return trip and got to try the chili this visit.  Arrived around 4:30 on Saturday.  No line and plenty of open tables.  We found it interesting that parked in the back lot was a Sysco (food services) trailer.  Business must be good!! Everything was top notch as usual (brisket, slaw, fries, and beans) and Barry Sorkin (co-owner) was keeping on eye on things and making the rounds to each table.  The chili was very good (no surprise).  Not very tomato-y with just the right amount of heat.  And loaded with brisket, of course.
