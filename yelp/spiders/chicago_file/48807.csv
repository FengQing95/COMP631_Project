Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here a few times and usually leave pretty satisfied.  The atmosphere is very fun and is great for groups.  Last time I tried the cava sangria, which I found to be very tasty.  The tapas are pretty good, but definitely not the best I've had.  The service is always friendly, which makes for a nice experience.
