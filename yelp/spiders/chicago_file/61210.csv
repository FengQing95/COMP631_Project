Smoque BBQ////Interestingly the owner hovers near the place where you order, and turns out to be there to help you enjoy the food.  When asked what is the best thing on the menu, he recommended the sliced brisket (I had had the pulled pork at the recommendation of a friend, and that was very good, but more of a foil for the sauces).  He asked what sort of 'heat' we liked, and then came over with a variety of sauces to try (I guess you have to know about the additional sauces and ask...??).   Anyway I loved them all, for different reasons, but forget which was which, so I guess I have to go back this week.  Outstanding BBQ and service.
