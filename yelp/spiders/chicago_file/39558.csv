Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One of my favorite steak houses in Chicago! Highly recommend hitting up this spot, definitely check out the down stairs speakeasy-esque vibes. The cool part about this restaurant is their wine corkage fee policy in the downstairs area. The fee is sharing a glass from your bottle with someone else in the room! Really cool experience with great food! Truffle Mac n cheese is a must!
