The Purple Pig////In terms of food, I enjoyed most of the dishes I had. My favorites included the octopus and the bucatini. There was one dish that I didn't like which is the milk braised berkshire shoulder. The item seemed interesting so I decided to give it a try. The pork was tender but I didn't love the flavor profile of it.
