Smoque BBQ////Overall Smoque is a filling and fair priced meal.  Their BBQ sauce is very good, and you everything here really is homemade.  Its a very informal setting and the only small issue is that the place can get VERY crowded around peak meal times, but that's usually the case with any good food establishment.  They don't have a ton of parking, but it's not hard to find a decent spot around the restaurant.
