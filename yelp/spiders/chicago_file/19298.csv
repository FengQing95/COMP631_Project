Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////        We started with appetizers. We got the Malnati salad, and mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella sticks were AMAZING! The cheese was so gooey, and it was breaded perfectly. The salad was out of this world! It was fresh & crisp, but not too filling, so that we had room for the amazing deep dish.
