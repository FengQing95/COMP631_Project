Little Goat Diner////4.5 stars.  Very pleased with my experience here. We made reservations for a Saturday night, and were ushered to our table within a few minutes of arriving.  Server was lovely - nonintrusive, helpful in understanding the menu, and upbeat.  It really is a diner - there aren't any appetizers, no bread before the meal, etc. So ensure to set your expectations clearly before coming for dinner.  Best part: they have an all-vegan menu, making it not only easy to order vegan dishes but also means they are well thought-out and tasteful.  I got the blue-plate special, and it was excellent!  Drinks are strong, too.  Only complaint was that the scallion pancake (vegan) was way too salty.  But there is plenty on the menu I want to try, so I will definitely be back.
