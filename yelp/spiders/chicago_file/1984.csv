Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I generally wouldn't write an update review this quickly, but being that Wildberry Cafe is next door to my work, I've been a few times in a short period of time.  If you order off the breakfast/brunch menu, you won't be disappointed.  The Southern Benedict may be the tastiest breakfast I've ever had, and the Bliss Berry crepes may be a close second.
