Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I couldn't recommend this place enough... it's not a place that will be buzzing with annoying tourists, but it is busy because Lou's isn't a secret.  The service is good but be patient, it takes a while to cook the stuff.  If your in a rush you can call ahead and put in your order (or if there is a wait, you can order so it cooks while you wait for your table... do this, be smart don't wait until you sit down to order a pizza that takes more than 20 min to cook).
