Little Goat Diner////Otherwise, what I usually order for brunch or lunch is the okonomiyaki, which is sort of like an asian pancake with pork belly and bonito flakes on top. If you're feeling a tad adventurous I'd recommend this! Little Goat is more often packed than not, so if you can, make reservations ahead of time! When you can't, put your name down and hang out by the bar! I usually stop by for a Sofie while I'm there. Not sure how often they rotate their beers!
