Smoque BBQ////Wow, the food here is unbelievable.  If you like Texas beef brisket, you will probably love Smoque BBQ.  The baked beans are insanely good, the cole slaw great as well.  Recently picked up two pounds of brisket, a quart of baked beans, a pint of slaw, and on the way home a loaf of white bread (yeah, good ol' American white bread, the kind that's not good for you, but is a necessity for Texas BBQ!).  The food is so close to what you'd find in Texas, that during dinner I found myself saying 'dang' a lot, and afterwards had this ridiculous urge to go buy a pick-up truck.  Uh, huh.  Y'all gonna like this place.
