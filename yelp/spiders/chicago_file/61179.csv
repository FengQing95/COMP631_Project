Smoque BBQ////I've got catering delivered from here a few times and it's delicious! The staff was super helpful getting the order setup and worked out over the phone and email. The delivery person actually worked for the restaurant vs a delivery service which was great because she actually knew what was going on. The food was all around good. The only thing I wasn't blown away by was the coleslaw. It wasn't bad; just the only thing that was standard vs exceptional.
