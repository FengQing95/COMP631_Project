Smoque BBQ////2 stars for the sides...I must have caught this place on a really bad day...Smoque is one of the best BBQ spots in Chicago but not today...Absolute trash...The 2 stars are for the cornbread and the mac and cheese...Brisket was dry and overcooked and I asked for juicy fatty cuts....And the slab of baby backs was one of the worst baby backs ive ever eaten...You could find better baby backs at your local Chili's restaurant...Just dryed out and useless...I wouldn't give to my dog...I wont be back here for a very long time.
