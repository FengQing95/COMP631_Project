Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love it here! Prices are reasonable. We always share a lot of different tapas and get drinks and we don't end up spending too much money. The stuffed mushrooms, the goat cheese and the chickpea stew are all amazing!! Order something that looks interesting and just try it out, you won't be disappointed!
