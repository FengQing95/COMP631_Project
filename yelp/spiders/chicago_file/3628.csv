The Purple Pig////In Chicago for a college tour and needed a place for lunch.  Not wanting to hit some fast food chain, I pulled up trusty Yelp (IMHO).  Purple Pig was 2 blocks away.  A little more $ than I wanted for a quick lunch with my so. but I figured why not eat a little better on a couple day vacay.  It was INSANE!!   Kind of like tapas but the plates are a little bigger (which is nice). Got the polenta and tomatoes.  Perfect.  Just the right savory.  Then Tuna and then meatballs.  3 Great dishes and not too full - just right at roughly $13 a plate.  Definitely worth it for such great food.  Highly recommend.
