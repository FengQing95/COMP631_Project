Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you love and I mean LOVE Chicago style deep dish, pass over Lou Malnati's.  Compared to some of the other fantastic pizzaria's Chicago has to boast, this one is not up to Chicago standards in my opinion.  I had no complaints about the crust, but the rest of the pizza, toppings and flavor made me feel like I was dining at Pizza Hut.  There was nothing overly special about it and it had a fast food feel to it.
