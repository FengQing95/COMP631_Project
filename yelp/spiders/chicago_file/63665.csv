Smoque BBQ////I had been meaning to try out Smoque BBQ for weeks but there was always such a long line! Long lines tend to mean great food though so eventually my roommate and I decided to suck it up and go. Boy were we glad we did! The line actually moved quite quickly, it's just constantly growing. The service was great and the perfect blend. You place your order at the counter and someone will seat you. Then, they let you know when your food is ready and you go pick it up at the counter and take it back to your table. When they called me, majority of my order was ready except one thing. They offered me a free cornbread to apologize for the wait and said they'd bring the last thing to my table. It was a nice, thoughtful, simple touch.
