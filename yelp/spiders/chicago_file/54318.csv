Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came this past Halloween for the first time, because on past trips to Chicago this place was always packed with a wait time of over an hour. This time I came on a Thursday and made sure to make a reservation! It was pretty busy so it's understandable that our server didn't come around as often as we wanted her to when we kept adding orders...
