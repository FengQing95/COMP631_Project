Little Goat Diner////My second experience: good food, poor service. I had the grand burger(at least a foot tall) and the soup of the day, broccoli cheddar. The burger was awesome and the soup was tasty. Service forgot to bring the lemons I had asked for (twice), but otherwise my meal was pretty satisfactory. I had my unfinished meal(the burger was huge!) packed to-go, but my server instead dumped the contents. This happened near closing time, so take this with a grain of salt.
