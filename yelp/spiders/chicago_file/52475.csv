Smoque BBQ////So my next visit, I decided to do something else. I bought the smoky Texas sausage (actually, I wanted to just take a bite and take the rest back home). Not too spicy but smooth (it could be spicy for others with much lower tolerance for heat). I had the St Louis ribs my next visit. These ribs are fantastic!! I could say they could stack up with the legends in this area. The ribs were not fall off the bone but nice and tender (I think fall off the bone took a wrong turn from what was originally meant; I believe fall off the bone meant pulling away from the bone NOT literally falling off the bone). For the record, I'm not a pulled pork fan (when I BBQ it, I prefer to slice it; pulled pork not bad but just prefer sliced). Bottom line. The spot is pretty visible and easy to get to. If you find yourself in that neck of the woods, stop by and have a taste. Sit down and eat it or take it home to eat later. You won't be sorry.
