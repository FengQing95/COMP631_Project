Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been to numerous tapas restaurants here in Chicago, and by far, Cafe BaBaReeBa is my favorite. Â From the wonderful sangrias to the large and varied list of tapas, this is both a wonderful place to bring a date and a great place to go with a large group... and that's not an easy bill to fill.
