Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The good news is that by the end of the evening, the food will have won over your affection; but here's a truth: I survived the 1990's.  Survived.  Maybe you did, too.  Want proof?  Experts can trace the origin of the Yet-ster (a portmanteau of "yeti" and "hipster"), one of the earliest known hipster subspecies to the "Two Princes" video by the Spin Doctors, but as you can see, the Spin Doctors rocked the khakis rather than the skinny jeans.  Before you reach through your computer screen to choke me for even reminding you of the dam "Two Princes" video, please keep in mind that I did not choose to bring back this terrible tragedy in American history.
