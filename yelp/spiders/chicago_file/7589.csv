Art Institute of Chicago////Cold winter's day is perfect for a stroll through the Museum.  Honestly, how can I even write a review for the Art Institute.  I should stick to just writing about food.  But, it is fun to see the prints from your Art History book hanging on the wall right in front of you.  We missed Picasso somehow.  Guess i'll have to go back.
