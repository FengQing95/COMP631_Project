Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This restaurant has been around for a long time now, and for good reason. If you come to Lou Malnati's when it is warmer weather in Chicago walk around the neighborhood and explore the River North neighborhood (known for art galleries and antique shops). The area has changed a lot since we lived here over 15-years ago, but it is still a vibrant, trendy, artsy section of Chicago. Â It is difficult to find street parking around here, so you may end up having to park in a nearby parking lot (which could be pricey) or simply take a cab or public transportation to this location. Reservations are not accepted. You may have a long wait if you come on a Friday or Saturday. Expect to wait any where from 45 minutes to 1-1/2 hours!
