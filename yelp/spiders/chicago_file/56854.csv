Smoque BBQ////I however was disappointed. It's quite possible that it was talked up a bit too much for me... My husband and I went the day after the 4th of July (when they were closed) so I suppose the ribs werent as low and slow as they could/should have been. They did not fall off the bone, they were not tender, they were chewy.
