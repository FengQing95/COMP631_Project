Art Institute of Chicago////I have been to some amazing museums across the globe. I couldn't be more proud that I live in a city with such a great museum of it's own. Get a membership if you love art. That way there are no lines and it is easier to get tickets to the new exhibits. It has a great mix of all different styles of art. I won't even go into it because you need to go there for yourself to experience it. It's my favorite place to go and just absorb things. Granted when it is crowded it is much harder to that. In the same token it is intruiging to see how many different types of people are interested in art, no matter how seriously. Bring your friends and enjoy an afternoon just wandering and finding different things that you have never seen before. I learn something new everytime I go there.
