Smoque BBQ////Nonetheless, I was relatively unfazed.  My biggest issue was with the uncomfortable dining environment.  This struck me as a lunch place: cavernous, very harshly lit, bare floors, cafeteria seating, the food counter, all the way down to the self-serve pop machine.  Not like I'm any huge dining snob, I was just expecting something a little more laid-back and condusive to dining.
