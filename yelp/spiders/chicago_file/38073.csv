Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We also had the CREAMED SPINACH, ELOTE STYLE CORN, TRUFFLE MAC & CHEESE, and WILD MUSHROOMS. None were as good as they've previously been, except perhaps the mushrooms (though my GF's the big mushroom fan; I'm not). The creamed spinach was a BIG disappointment--I'd say 1/3" of creamed spinach. It was sort of a "taste" of creamed spinach. The Elote was the same. It seemed like more of a "lite bite" than a side. Not nearly worth the price.
