Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A friend of mine wanted to take us to a fancy restaurant in Chicago.  As the number of reviews speak themselves, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is a very popular spot to taste Spanish tapas.  As we had to change our schedule multiple times to find the most ideal time for us to get together, we ended up making a reservation at last minute.  It was Sunday and the only opening they had available for us was 10AM for brunch.
