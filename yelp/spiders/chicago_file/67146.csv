Little Goat Diner////Where do I begin?  Diner heaven. Comfort food with amazing twists. Great vibe. Good service and amazing food. I sat at the counter and watched countless creations come out of the kitchen.  We were only 2 people,which limited what we could try. Portions are big. After much debate we went with Tonkatsu pork sandwich and Torpedo french toast. Best french toast I have ever had. Runny egg inside with crispy fried chicken breast pieces and maple syrup. I cannot wait to go back and try 10 more items. Run,don't walk to this place!
