Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here on a weekend trip to Chicago, wanting to try some real Chicago deep dish pizza. I have to say it felt like your standard Italian chain restaurant (which I guess it is). Everything--food, service, atmosphere--was all perfectly solid, but nothing special. We tried the "Lou" pizza (spinach, mushrooms, tomato and cheese), which was all right but a little bland. Same with the garlic bread we tried. Seems like a safe bet for a decent meal, but next time I might venture out and try something a little more independent to get something more interesting.
