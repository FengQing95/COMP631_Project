Art Institute of Chicago////I'm a hopeless romantic. I've always looked at museums as a place of wonder, enchantment, and romance. A place to get lost. A place to lose track of time. I've been to museums in Paris, Rome and Florence, and I've even explored many of New York's finest museums. I'm proud that our very own Art Institute can compete with some of the best from around the country and the world. I've visited the Art Institute many times and recently had a chance to peek in again. Â
