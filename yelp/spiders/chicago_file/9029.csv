Art Institute of Chicago////Every couple of years or so I get out of town/out of country visitors so I get to play tourist guide and hostess in my town and this happens to be at the top of my list of places to visit, especially if your visiting from a different country. My error is that we came 3 hours before closing and this is not nearly enough. I'd suggest a day and going alone!
