Art Institute of Chicago////Unfortunately, one extremely rude and out of line staff member ruined this entire experience. It was a fantastic museum with beautiful art. But in one exhibit an art guard of sorts lost control of his temper when he erroneously believed he heard someone say something "provocative". I kid you not no one said a word and the exhibit room was silent. He then proceeded to continue his lecture and described how quickly individuals would be escorted out of the facility due to the use of provocative language. He began to follow a few visitors that were with us from out of state within one foot behind them and was very aggressive and intimidating. Once the visitors attempted to walk out he opened the door for them and acted as if he was part of the security detail for a head of state. This is not acceptable and very upsetting. We left shortly thereafter with confusion and feeling humiliated. It would have been a different story if something had been said that was offensive but we have no idea what he heard. Don't make visitors feel inferior and intimidated, that's customer service 101.
