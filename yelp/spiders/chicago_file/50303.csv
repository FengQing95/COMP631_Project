Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place gets super crowded because it's delicious, the sangria is awesome (and on tap), and the atmosphere is really laid back. If you don't have a reservation you should expect to wait. Also, this is a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant so if you're expecting a cheap meal then you're going to be disappointed. That being said, the prices are reasonable for the quality of the food that you're served.
