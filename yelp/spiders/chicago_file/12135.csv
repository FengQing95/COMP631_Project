Art Institute of Chicago////The art is separate by genre and/or artist: modern wing, photography, mini rooms, Islamic art, textiles, paperweights, asian art, african art, american art, greek/roman/byzantine art, folk art, european art, medieval/renaissance, contemporary, modern...  The exhibits are fantastic and museum is artwork in itself.  The museum is gorgeous.  Additionally, we went on a Saturday and although there were lots of people in the museum, it was not overly crowded.
