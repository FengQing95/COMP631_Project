Little Goat Diner////We also ordered the biscuits and gravy, and informed the waiter that we wanted to share the dish. We both were very impressed when he brought it to our table as though it was an appetizer. As to my review of the dish.....it was amazing the mushrooms were an added benefit and if you are not a fan of mushrooms, but loves biscuits and gravy I suggest giving it a chance I doubt you will disappointed.
