Smoque BBQ////Now, the food is outstanding but the setup really sucks.  You wait in line to place your order, with the line out the door for us last night.  Likely about 30 minutes.  Then they assign you a table to wait for your name to be called to get your food.  It was very chaotic.  The seating area is very small.  The time between when we ordered and when we got our food wasn't too bad but I have no idea why the line to place orders was so long.  It was just super in-efficient.  So, the food is the best but if were rating based on total experience, this place would get a 3 at best since I would rate everything but the food a 1.
