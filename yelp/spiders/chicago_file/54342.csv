Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Never get tires of this place and one of the places I go when I don't know where and what to eat. Before you know, you finish plates after plates of yummy food. I am a vegetarian but can find lots of things I can eat along with my carnivore family. A very lively place so not for a quiet date if that is what you are looking for.
