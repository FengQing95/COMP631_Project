Little Goat Diner////I truly don't know how this place has such stellar reviews!! The flavor of everything was fine but everything was debilitatingly salty... like truly inedible after three bites. The first three apps came (chili, nachos, crab dip) and we were like, ok pretty damn salty. But then ALL the entrees were also CRAZY salty!! Here's a pic of my SALAD... tell me why those ball things have visible chunks of salt on it. Didn't realize a salad could be salty ‚Äç I really wouldn't recommend this place unless you're chasing a heart attack.
