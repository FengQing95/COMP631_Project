Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love the idea of trying a little of a lot of different things! There are so many things to choose from, It was hard to decide. It's definitely the place you go and order a bunch of things and have to go back and order a totally different spread of items, unless one from before really stuck with you (mine was the chorizo wrapped date). I didn't get to try the sangria, which I heard is a MUST. The spicy potatoes were something to talk about, and everything else was yummy, but I wouldn't mind replacing them with all new things next time around
