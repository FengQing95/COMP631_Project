Little Goat Diner////One of the best diners I've ever been to! The menu is full of unique dishes and offers a few twists on the usual staples you would find at diners normally. My wife and I ordered the Okonomiyaki and Shrimp & Cheesy Grits, both very delicious. I also ordered the Little Goat Latte, which was interesting but probably wouldn't order again (made with goats milk, personally not a fan of it. I do love goat cheese though).
