Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I cannot possibly say enough wonderful things about Bavette's. My girlfriend and I decided to celebrate our one year anniversary here during a recent trip to Chicago, and we could not have made a better choice. Walking through the doors feels like stepping back in time into a 1920's lively jazz bar - dim lighting, great music, and beautiful decor. We were seated in the downstairs space, which takes on an even more intimate and speakeasy feel. The host team greeted us immediately and warmly, wishing us a happy anniversary, and ensured we were sat promptly. Once we were at our FANTASTIC table, our waiter also immediately greeted us, wished us a happy anniversary, and served us a complimentary champagne toast for the occasion.
