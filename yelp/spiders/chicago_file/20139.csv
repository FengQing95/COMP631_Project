Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The lady loves Lou's so we get it every time we go to Chicago.  The crust is buttery-perfect.  The wait can be long but they have a good option to pre-order with the hostess when you are put on the wait, that way you are not waiting long for your pie once you get to the table.
