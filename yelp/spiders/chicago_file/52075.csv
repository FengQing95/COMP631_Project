Smoque BBQ////But when I took a bite of my long-awaited brisket, my BBQ dreams deflated a bit. Though the meat was incredibly juicy, I found the brisket to be lacking in spice, even with the sauce on top. It tasted a lot like the kind of brisket you would have with your Passover meal (not a bad thing, but I was expecting more spice).
