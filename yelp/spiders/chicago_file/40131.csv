Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Wonderful experience at another one of the Hogsalt restaurants. Having been to 4 Charles and Au Cheval in New York I had high expectations for Bavette's and all of my expectations have been met. The atmosphere is intimate and speakeasy like. The service is impeccable and the food is top notch. Highly recommend the Ribeye, and the Cheeseburger. Also recommend the side of bacon, very thick, fatty and delicious. For desert, the chocolate cream by is to die for and a must order. I will certainly return if I am ever back in Chicago.
