The Purple Pig////The broccoli was also excellent, one of the best broccoli dishes I've ever had. The broccoli is actually a full dish here and I want to figure out how to make broccoli more like it at home. The brown butter truffle mushroom capellacci was also delicious and we were left wanting more.
