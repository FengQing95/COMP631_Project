Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Get the classic sangria. Just do it. This restaurant is bustling with energy and I love it. I like to go here on date nights or with friends. The small plates are great to share and order one or two at a time while you enjoy company. If you order the paella, getting only one or two other plates for the table will be good. It's a pretty big portion. If the wait time is too long, they have a massive bar area with a ton of tables and counter space which is first come, first served. On Monday's their cocktails are half off which is a great deal. Cafe Ba Ba Reeba will always be high on my list.
