Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavettes never dissappoints. I most recently had the pleasure of sitting at the bar upstairs and the bartender Joel was AWESOME! He saved a night that didn't start out that well due to another restaurant messing up our reservation. He also made it special for my wifes bday! Great mixologist who knows his drinks.
