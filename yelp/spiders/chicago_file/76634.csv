Little Goat Diner////I had the blue plate special - scallop taco, slaw and baked beans. I expected two small tacos but the monsters that arrived were huge! Very tasty, perhaps a bit sweet for my palate but I was really impressed with how everything went together. Who would have thought baked beans would work?
