The Purple Pig////Not even sure how I knew about this place but it's just one of those places that everyone seems to need to try and I'm very glad I did. Came on a Tuesday for a late lunch and the place was still pretty full. Luckily I was dining alone so I immediately got a seat at the bar right in front of the kitchen action. Service was very polite and attentive the entire time.
