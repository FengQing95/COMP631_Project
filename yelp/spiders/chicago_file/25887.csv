Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We arrived and got seated promptly. Our waitress was super friendly and help us decide on a half Lou's (vegetarian) and half Malnati classic (sausage). I've never had Chicago style deep dish so this was a great experience. I was expecting a thick bready-type crust and bottom, but instead, the deepness was filled with mostly cheese, sauce and toppings. I loved the sausage on the Malnati classic, it was like a huge sausage patty. The pizza was so good that I decided to buy a frozen one to take back to LA for my parents to try! And they loved it!
