Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My wife and I ate here our first night in Chicago. We shouldn't have, because it just set us up for disappointment the rest of the week. It was a special occasion, so I sprung for the aged ribeye, and it was perfectly done. My wife had a salad which she also thought was fantastic. Even the sweet potato we split was excellent.
