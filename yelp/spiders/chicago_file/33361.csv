Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I love Bavette's and other restaurants owned by these people. But as a professional musician, I must point out the volume of the music. The music choices were great, BTW, a nice surprise. But as most people are not musicians they don't realize the importance of a well balanced background. In fact, people are usually so unaware of the music they don't even realize the conversation is getting compromised.
