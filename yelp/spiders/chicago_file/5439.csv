The Purple Pig////Do NOT recommend their new outside seating - it's literally in an alley, and next an alley. Plus it looks super shoddy and like they set it up last week (because they did). They've set up a port-a-potty outside for people eating outside (uhh.....). And there's like a highway in the next block, so the ambiance score is about 0.
