Little Goat Diner////Two friends and I had our weekly ladies night here and we had the kale salad, macaroni and shrimp & grits. We all split a side of the smoked fries and they were great. Â I had the shrimp & grits and I have to say being quite the foodie that they were AMAZING! The best I have had in Chicago and my friend agreed.
