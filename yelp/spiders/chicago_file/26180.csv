Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I selected the "Lou" personal, and my husband ordered The Malnati Chicago Classicâ„¢. Though hard to believe, I think this may have been my first true deep dish experience. It was definitely soupier than I had expected (is that normal?), but I thought the pizza was really tasty.
