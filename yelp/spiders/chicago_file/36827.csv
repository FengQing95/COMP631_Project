Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As soon as you walk in, you are warmly greeted by the hostess and once you enter the actual dining area you would think that you were transported into a different era. The warm lighting and environment really adds to this place, and the service is top notch! Â Every time I have been here, I am impressed at how knowledgeable the servers are (even sat at the downstairs lounge before)! And how attentive everyone is to the diners. Again, love love love their service!
