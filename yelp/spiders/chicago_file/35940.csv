Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Yup. All that it's cracked up to be. Very good steak place with great seafood and cocktails. Atmosphere is also good and squawk like an old 30s speak easy.  So fun in here as you are taken to a cool foreign place with beautiful decor.  Service is exceptional...from the time you wall in to the time you leave.  Door service, host, wait service, bar, all very good.
