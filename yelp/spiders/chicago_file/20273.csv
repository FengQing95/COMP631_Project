Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Excellent service and attentive servers. My personal recommendation/favorite is the "Lou" and don't forget to add pepperoni. It compliments the veggies perfectly. The Malnati Chicago Classic is good too but the sausage patty can be a bit overwhelming. They even have the option of ordering half and half of the different kinds of pizza.
