Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The deviled eggs with the bacon was my favorite dish! It had this nice fluffy texture with a Smokey flavor (bacon bits). Also, loved the papas with the tomato aioli aka crack sauce. I dipped everything in that sauce! Beef skewer with horseradish and caramelized onions dish was like having a bite-sized steak dinner- totally fits as tapas style! You can never go wrong with seasoned garlic shrimp drenched in a buttery sauce. The seafood paella filled the space with aromatic flavors-- the feeling of warm home cooked meals when you return home. Finished off the night with a complimentary butterscotch pudding with whip. Then, we also ordered chocolate ganache and flan (which turned out to be a little too sweet), but still good nonetheless!
