Little Goat Diner////Great spot. And what a great staff. Food was amazing. Had the bulls eye French toast, biscuit and gravy, and the corn beef hash. Also got to try the buffalo dip as well. All had great taste but my favorite must say is the bulls eye. The bulls eye had a egg in the middle! Banging.
