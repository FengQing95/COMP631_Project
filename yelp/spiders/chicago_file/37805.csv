Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We spontaneously decided one Saturday at 9pm to book bavette's and the only available spot was 10 15. We got there on time and had about a 15 minute wait. The server was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu, and while the restaurant was a little noisy with jazz music it was the perfect atmosphere for date night. Since it was so late we decided to just have entrees. I had the burger while my husband had the steak frites. I must say, that burger was one of the best I've had in Chicago. Only let down was the fries which were a little too salty for my liking. The steak was very succulent and well seasoned. We will definitely be going back.
