Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They had amazing deep dish pizza. The butter crust (caroline K loves it too), was out of this world. You can come up with any kind of combination to put on your pizza and they deliver every time. I did not have a great experience with the thin-crust but the deep dish is why you go to Lou's place.
