Little Goat Diner////The reason I am giving this place 3 stars and not 5 is because of the wait. It's crazy! Their waiting area is way to small so you have to wait outside which is not very good especially when it is like 10 degrees outside. Our wait was about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Unless you have loads of time to kill on a Sunday you probably should avoid. This place is really close to where I live but the wait is a killer.
