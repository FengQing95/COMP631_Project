Now how is it? The same, right? The tempura really didn't add much. They serve it on a tray with some sauces drawn out so you can do that, but it's not really that good. I'd consider this a side-grade to regular ol' mashed potatoes. Quick Tip, though, it's decent if you put crab dip on top of it. It lends some of the salt and flavors to it.
