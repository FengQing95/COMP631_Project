Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service, ambience, food--everything deserved five stars. Took the BF here for his birthday and he said it's the best ribeye he's ever had! And the bacon.. oooh you cannot forget the bacon, so good! I ordered the petite duchess, it was good but after trying my BF's ribeye, it was amaaaazeballs! I gotta come back and order the ribeye next time. We also tried the elote and mac & cheese, both were good but I think I'll skip the mac & cheese next time (good but too rich). We'll be back for my birthday!
