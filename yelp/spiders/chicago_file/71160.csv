Little Goat Diner////Delicious! We stopped in as a final destination on a birthday gastronomy tour celebrating our 19 year old daughter's birthday. Chef Stephanie inspired our daughter's dream to be a chef. Delicious, creative comfort food with a twist. I had the BLTA. So good. Loved every bite. Our server, Megan, was excellent and even gifted our daughter with a "Wookie Pie" birthday treat since she tried to have our daughter meet Stephanie but alas, she was not there. Excellent staff, excellent food.
