Smoque BBQ////Awesome BBQ place! I had the half and half combo which includes half a brisket sandwich and half a pulled pork sandwich, slaw, and a side. I got the mac and cheese for a side and it was very good with a baked crispy top. The brisket was the winner of the meal and I also tried a friend's peach cobbler which was amazing. Good portions, decent price, and the outside seating was great for such a perfect summer day. Also very quick service.
