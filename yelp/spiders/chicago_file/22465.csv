Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'll keep this one short and simple. Awesome pizza and wings! The pizza crust was nice and crispy. Excellent service and they stay open late. We came in around 10:40pm and they closed at 11:00. But they never once rushed us. Clean restrooms and lively atmosphere. Awesome spot for a bite!
