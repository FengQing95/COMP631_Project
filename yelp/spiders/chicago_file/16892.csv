Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you're coming to visit Chicago you have to find a place to try quintessential Chicago deep dish pizza.  I really recommend Lou Malnati's.   I really like this place. The Decour wasn't what I expected for a pizzeria , hockey shoes on the wall couldn't really make sense of the rhyme or reason for the decorations. But otherwise is a busy hubbub of a  place to eat pizza.  Great bring kids because it's so loud in there nobody will even notice that your kids are behaving poorly if indeed they do.  Judging from the way the locals talk about it the food is pretty consistent too.
