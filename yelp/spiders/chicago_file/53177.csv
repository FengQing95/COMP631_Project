Smoque BBQ////-I'm not fancy - as in, I walk into Lillie's Q and I'm like "whoa...what's this...where's the line?  Why so fancy?"  BBQ places should feel like a joint...or a dining hall where people from Defiance, OH have their wedding receptions (I was born there, I can make fun - you, on the other hand should not).
