Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I order 3 COROMANDEL (FOOD POISONING)  raw oysters, roasted bone marrow and my husband gets the beet salad for apps. We order the the 24oz Bone in Dry Aged Ribeye and potato to split, plus drinks. I quickly change my potato to go for the wedge salad (I am a connoisseur of them). I get my 3 oysters and not only does one taste really funky, but all 3 taste like they are sitting in a saline solution bath. They literally tasted like someone soaked them in a  bucket of salt and I am a seasoned oyster eater (Shaw's loves me).
