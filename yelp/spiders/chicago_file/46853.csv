Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So.....went here for brunch filled with excitement as it's been a while I mean years since the last time and I was very disappointed with the flavor inconsistency. Maybe they were having an "off day" but the seafood paella was lacking flavor and it was not prepared that way it should be. It needed more punch and where is that famous crunchy rice as one would expect!!! For 34 bucks it was absolutely the worse dish of the day. The seafood was over cooked and the veggies in the rice was an after thought...it just seemed like it was rushed in preparation and the seasoning was forgotten! The Hanger Steak and the stuffed mushroom was good, the shrimp and grits almost made top 3 but the grits needed just a little more chorizo or more cheese and the shrimp was again over cooked! Sangria of the day tasted like stale white wine with apples! Overall I will probably not go back here, thank god we had a gift card from Christmas otherwise the $100 bucks spent for brunch for two people was not worth the drive and finding parking! Sorry for the bad review but the the lack of flavor and presentation was not there. TIP: The Chef needs to close attention to what comes out of the kitchen.
