Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Plain Cheese Pizza- Wtf? I thought I was eating reheated mozzarella sticks on top of dough. This is the cheesefail part. I was concerned that I was eating pizza hut ( I've had it once in my life! ) in another dimension in Chicago. The crust was crunchy, doughy and carbalicious, but the cheese was terrible. It came off in giant clumps and if you pulled them they would stretch --but not break, like mozzarella sticks. If this pizza were a 11th grade student taking the NYS english regents, it would fail by 5 points.
