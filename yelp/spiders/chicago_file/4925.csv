The Purple Pig////This restaurant has been on my bucket list for years.  Yesterday, (December 30th) I was finally able to check it off my list.  My wife and I stopped-in late afternoon, and luckily only had about a 10 minute wait.  The place is tiny, and tables are shoehorned in.  To that point, if you are a large person and your table is toward the back of the restaurant, you might have an awkward moment getting to your seat.
