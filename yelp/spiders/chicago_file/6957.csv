Art Institute of Chicago////First of all, how many art museums can you go to and feel like Ferris Bueller and company?  That is cool enough for me.  But, they have an excellent modern art exhibit including a ginormous Warhol that leaves me happy every time I see it.  Since they always have a new exhibit, going here never gets old and tiring.  And, to boot, they have a discount for Chicago residents!
