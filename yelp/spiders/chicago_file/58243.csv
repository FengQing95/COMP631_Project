Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This restaurant in Lincoln Park is definitely nicer than any tapas places in the Loop. Great atmosphere, beautiful restaurant, and a great spot for brunch or dinner. A large selection of tapas and its known for its Sangria, which was delicious. We had the shrimp with garlic, fried calamari, lamb, a couple empanadas, and the scallops. Small portions, but delicious. Definitely order a few dishes and then you can split them among yourselves since some are larger than others.
