Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As it seems most people are saying, this seems to be the Chicago deep dish pizza spot!  Super excited and the people are incredibly friendly.  We were told the pizza would take awhile because they made it fresh (30-40min).  When it arrived, it was cheesy and the outside crust was slightly buttery which I like!  However, the flavors and amount of meat was a little disappointing.  It seemed as bit bland to me, but maybe it gets better if you get a larger pie?  Not sure, but for me, Chicago has a plethora of food options not restricted to deep dish pizza.
