Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I could go on about the classy yet cozy ambiance, the delicious old-school cocktails, the overflowing chocolate sundae we somehow managed to put back at the end of our meal, but now I'm just gilding the lily - you get the point. If you're in Chicago and you don't go here, you need to seriously rethink your priorities. And if you're not in Chicago, you just may want to plan a trip there just to go to Bavette's. It's that good.
