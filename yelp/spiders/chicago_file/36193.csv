Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I dine out often but I don't usually write reviews.  We went to Bavettes on a Friday as a walk in because there were no reservations available(always booked and I see why).  We were seated immediately at 6:15pm. We ordered shrimp Dejohgne( nice flavor),  baked goat cheese(so good),  and smoked trout Ceasar salad(surprisingly very good).  We shared the pork chop(melt in your mouth seasoned... Excellent ),  and elotes corn(oh my... kinda good).  Great service,  personable staff, and nice Atmosphere.  We will definitely be back!
