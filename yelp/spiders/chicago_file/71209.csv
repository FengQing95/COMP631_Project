Little Goat Diner////My mom had the Sloppy Goat which is a sloppy joe "gone goat" topped with rosemary slaw upon a squish squash roll.  Still unclear was a squish squash roll is, but I got to try a bite and it was amazing!  The combination of goat meat and rosemary slaw was an interesting variation of the traditional sloppy joe and both my mom and I were impressed.  Overall, two great choices that we definitely recommend to anyone visiting the diner.
