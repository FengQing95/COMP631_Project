Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our waiter was friendly and patient with our large group.  But one there are a few things I've learned from doing tapas with large groups:  Someone needs to take charge of the group, or everyone needs to chose 1-2 dishes, AND there mustn't be any picky eaters in the group.  CBBR is good for groups, even large groups, but without some guidelines and willingness to try different foods, there will be chaos.
