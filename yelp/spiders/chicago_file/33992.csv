Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We received a gift certificate to Bavette's as a wedding gift, and I have to say...it was an AWESOME gift!  We started off with some oysters and some garlic shrimp.  They were so good that my wife actually enjoyed an oyster for the first time in her life.  The shrimps was so tasty, that we used the bread to mop up all of the great garlic sauce off the plate. I ordered the short rib stroganoff because I knew I wouldn't have room for the steak....since I really wanted to try the elotes and bacon as well.  Everything was delicious!  My wife had the crab stuff avocado salad, which she loved.  We will definitely be back, if we can get a reservation.
