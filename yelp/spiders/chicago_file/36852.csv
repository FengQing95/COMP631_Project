Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We capped off the meal with some salted caramel ice cream and some unexpected complimentary chocolate covered strawberries since it was Valentine's Day. We were satiated without being stuffed. Our dinner was just over 3 hours and we were never rushed out the door (despite being one of the last tables to leave.) It demonstrated that the owners and staff appreciate that dining out isn't just about the food; it's about the overall experience, and ours was a great one.
