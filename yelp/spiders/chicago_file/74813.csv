Little Goat Diner////It was ok. For the price, I was fairly disappointed. Well over $20 for a burger and fries was kind of annoying, and all I could taste on the burger was the sauce because they put way too much on. However, all of the food "looked" good, and I'm sure they're popular mostly for other things, not the burgers lol. I would recommend getting something other than the burger if you go. The corned beef hash was also thin and dry, but did have a good flavor, if you're fine with that style of corned beef hash.
