Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First of all, what did we enjoy?  We enjoyed the fact that you could order ahead and then pick it up.  When we arrived at 8:15PM for our pick-up order on Saturday, September 3rd the wait was over 2.5 hours.  Not only was the sidewalk blocked creating a safety hazard; however, people were ordering to go and then sitting on the sidewalk outside and eating, creating a mini camp of sorts.  It was really weird.
