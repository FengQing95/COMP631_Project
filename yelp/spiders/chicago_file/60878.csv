Smoque BBQ////The girl that handled my food order (not the cashier) saw me and asked if something was missing from my order so I told her no and clarified that I was overcharged. She told me the cashier could help me when she was done with the current transaction she was ringing. So again I had to wait. The girl (pretty much the only bright spot) asked me if I wanted some chili while I was waiting "because it seems like this has been one huge pain in the neck for you." I acknowledged my annoyance but declined the chili, but I thought it was a nice gesture on her part.
