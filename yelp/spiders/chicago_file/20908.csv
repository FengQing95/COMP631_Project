Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have never written a review before however I must.  This Pizza is not worth the high cost.  We got both thin crust and deep dish delivered to our hotel.  In the town I am from we can get twice the amount, quality and flavor for 1/2 the price.  Also the cheese bits were sooooo salty you could not even taste the cheese.  3 cheese bread tasted like  It had freezer burn.  Also had a coupon for a free desert cookie and still got over charged.  Like I said I have never written a review before but I thought I must warn people.  Go to Papa Johns or something like that.
