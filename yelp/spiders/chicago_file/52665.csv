Smoque BBQ////Best place for Ribs and Chili in Chicago. We have been fans and hooked on these Ribs since we first saw the Guy F. from Tripple D air it on the food network. The Ribs, fries, chili, corn bread, etc. it's all good. Don't get me started on the peach cobbler, its heaven to your taste buds. We went to honky tonk, daddy's in humbold park and famous dave's but let me tell you people, Don't waste your time going elsewhere, stick to smoke, Better quality, taste, BETTER PORTIONS are done at SMOQUE. Please go on empty stomach to enjoy your food, works for me.I always take a quart of Chili for later in the night and another peach cobler, can't get enough of it. Try the spicy sauce to take home and added to your grilled chicken, its too bad that they dont offer it at the restaurant to have rather than the regular sause( the regular sause is till good).
