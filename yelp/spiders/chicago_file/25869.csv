Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was told it's a great deep dish pizza place during my first time staying in Chicago . I guess I'm not a fan of any pizza at all. (Yelp and google for this pizza restaurant have so many reviews!!!). Service wasn't great, but I guess because restaurant is busy, understaffed so it's understandable.
