Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////ABSOLUTE BEST STEAKHOUSE IN CHICAGO! My husband and I have been here five times and it is better each time. Absolutely everything about it is great!!! The food is amazing, the service is perfect, the place is beautiful and the prices are great for the incredible experience. The shortrib stroganoff is delicious, the foie gras is amazing but the dry aged bone in rib eye may not be compared with any other rib eye in town. This is the one place you want to have dinner if you have a night in Chicago, wether you are here with family, friends or for a romantic date, everything about it is just AMAZING!!!!
