Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I think I'm just not the biggest deep dish fan. It tastes good, and Lou's is known for its butter crust, which I like. However, I definitely think there is better pizza in the world. One thing I also dislike is that the temperature of the pizza is not hot enough when it comes out. I think the cheese should be very stringy, but wen you actually cut into it, it's not that stringy, and not as satisfying.
