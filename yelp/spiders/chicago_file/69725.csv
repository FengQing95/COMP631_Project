Little Goat Diner////All in all I think Little Goat has a lot of promise.  The staff, if they stay this nice in the long term, are really great.  I think they know it's a little insane to wait 25 minutes for a sandwich to-go and they appreciate that people do.  Hopefully the kitchen will get a little more streamlined and the sandwiches will come out faster.  Looking forward to trying other sandwiches there in the new year!
