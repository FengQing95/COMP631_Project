Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Now, no one in this party was apt to complain at a restaurant but in this case, we felt justified, as the waiter had not told us the price, nor had he discussed the apparent uniqueness of true Dover Sole from the English Channel.  And who knew?   I sure didn't.  I thought sole was something you can get in the supermarket.
