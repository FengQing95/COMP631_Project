Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Since I was visiting Chicago, I had to make pizza a priority on my restaurant list! After doing my research, my boyfriend and I decided on Lou Malnati's. We walked from our hotel in River North on a brisk March day to find a busy, packed restaurant streaming with people, many of whom were on their way to St. Paddy's celebrations. For a first-timer, the process can be a little overwhelming, but we quickly checked in with the host, received a menu, and we were told we could get in the line next to us to place our order. Here's where it got kinda bonkers. There was a counter with two people taking orders, but the lines in front of it weren't really defined because there were a host of people standing in front of it that were both waiting to place an order and those who had placed orders, but were simply waiting to seated. We had to figure out who was who--which was a little complicated--but we finally asked around and figured out where the line ended. This is important to know: you can only order pizza in this line (you order everything else at your table). We opted for the Pan Chicago Classic since this is clearly one of the restaurant's specialties (no need to deviate from the tried and true on a first visit, right?).
