Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you are visiting Chicago and don't like deep dish pizza, I recommend trying out Lou Malnati's! They're thin crust was excellent and even had a nice crunch to it. The inside of the restaurant was very spacious and even though we ordered to go on a busy Saturday night, our order came out quick and hot.
