Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Place is iconic for deep dish though since you have to try when in Chicago. We tried another Chicago deep dish place (Peqoud's) and that blew our minds! But still come here to compare! And it's like one of the godfathers of traditional deep dish. We don't regret coming here and enjoyed the atmosphere!
