Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Dinner was fabulous!  Hostesses as you enter a small front area need more training and education.  They just appear to be "hanging and chatting"...annoying. Valet between Gilt and Bavette's the worst and most unprofessional ever.  Pouring rain. Offered no umbrellas. Don't open car doors for either driver or passengers.  I want my tip back on top of the $14 they charge and didn't earn or deserve.  So, dining very good...staff greetings and farewells to this fine dining experience need work.
