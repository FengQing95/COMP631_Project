Smoque BBQ////Lots of hype, didn't quite live up to it.  Service was excellent, nice place, but food only OK.  We went on Friday nite and they were out of the dry ribs. Babybacks were over cooked and not much meat.  Pulled pork was good, brisket as well.  Sides were average.  We wanted to check out the buzz since we were in the area, and came away slightly disappointed.  With many other places to choose from, wouldn't go out of my way to go back.
