Smoque BBQ////I love pulled pork, probably too much for my own good, so I was really looking forward to eating here after having heard such glowing reviews. Maybe it was the anticipation, maybe it was a bad day, but I was sorely disappointed. The pork was just barely OK - way too dependent on the BBQ sauce for flavor, and way too tender. What's too tender, you ask? Well, if you could take the pork and sell it as baby food, you may have crossed the line from "tender" to "mushy." I didn't know this was possible to do with meat, but Smoque showed me that it is.
