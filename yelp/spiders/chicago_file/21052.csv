Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I can't comment on the service and decor as I have only had it delivered. My favorite is the thin crust pizza (which is still considerably thicker than the St. Louis-style pizzas I normally eat at home). The corm meal crust is just the best. I haven't tried much more of their menu as the pizza in Chicago fills me up all by itself.
