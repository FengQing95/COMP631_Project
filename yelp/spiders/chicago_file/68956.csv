Little Goat Diner////The inside of the Diner was gorgeous! When we arrived we noticed couples, families and groups of friends dining and eating happily. The setting is very casual and comforting, but modern and retro at the same time. It made me feel super cool and trendy just by walking in the doors. Theme's are created through use of bold textures and patterns: like refurbished wood, aged leather, and the strong presence of metals. I especially loved the light fixtures. (But hey, I'm an electricians daughter through and through.)
