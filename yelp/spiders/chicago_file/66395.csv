Little Goat Diner////When I walked in, I was immediately welcomed by two hosts that smiled and were friendly.  I was meeting a friend who arrived 10 minutes before me and was waiting at the bar for a table to become available for us. The craftmanship of the bar is brilliantly clever and I like that pathways are wide enough to give customers room to move comfortably.  The bartenders served me promptly and the bar was chill and agreeable.  My friend mentioned our wait was another 10 minutes but it ended up being 45-60 minutes.  I wasn't bothered because I enjoyed the ambience and the music in the bar.  However, my friend was not happy and went up to the front to ask a host when a table would be ready.  About 7 minutes later a table became available for us.  However, when we arrived at table it was full of dirty glasses and silverware.  The table was not ready but she directed us to another table that was not ready either but a busser cleared the table as fast as he possibly could. I ordered the BBQ pork sandwich and will be back. The only real complaint about the service was the waiter.  I'm in the service industry and just felt he wasn't too friendly.  Could just be an off day.  We all have them.  Again, food was scrumptious and just about licked the plate.
