Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place really surprised me! The food here is great although it's a bit pricy for the portion sizes. But good Spanish food doesn't come by often so I can't complain too much. One of my favorite dishes is patatas braves and the one here is great! However their best dish is definitely the seafood paella! Good paella is hard to find so I'm so glad we were able to stop by this place!
