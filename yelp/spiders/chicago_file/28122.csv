Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Hello, Gretchen! I'm glad that our staff provided you with excellent service, but I'm sorry they made you feel bad about not ordering ahead of time. I'm very concerned to hear that the restrooms weren't properly cleaned and that your pizza tasted rotten. We take cleanliness and food quality very seriously. I'd like to have a manager follow-up with you to discuss your experience and restore your faith in our quality of service and food. Please provide us with your contact information by filling out our contact form at
