Art Institute of Chicago////Simply put, a world-class art museum located in downtown Chicago. I love coming here whenever I can. There is such a rich variety of art from different traditions and different time periods that you cannot fail to find something to love. One of my favorite exhibits is the Thorne miniature rooms on display at the bottom level. The exhibit displays a series of spaces, from a Medieval church sanctuary to 17th century English and French drawing rooms, to 18th century French and English grand halls and Victorian parlours, to modernist living rooms. There is also a series of American living spaces on display in the same exhibit, each room representing a specific region and/or time period of the nation. What makes this exhibit so fascinating is the artist's ability to render each scene with ample dramatic detail to bring it to life. That's not an easy thing to do when replicating a dramatic scene in miniature. The Art Institute also offers extensive exhibits displaying traditional art from China and Japan, as well as India and other ancient and ethnic traditions. The Art Institute's exhibit of Western art from different time periods is simply amazing, from Medieval and Renaissance religious art, to old still lifes and portraits, to works of the impressionists, surrealists, and other more modern movements. It's at the Art Institute where I first encountered Ivan Albright's dark and macabre "magical realism" paintings. Definitely cool and morbid stuff. In addition to its exhibits, the Art Institute also has an incredible gift shop offering quality art-related gifts. The Art Institute is a fantastic art museum and one that I use as the measure by which to judge the quality of other art museums. If coming to Chicago, you have to check it out.
