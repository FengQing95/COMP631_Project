Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Yeah so be prepared to wait for a table, but it's really worth it. Delicious pizzas and great service. My only bugbear was the menu selection wasn't fantastic. But for deep-dish pizza you will literally think about for the rest of your trip, this place wins hands down. Don't get lured in by the hype over Gino's East, walk three blocks to Lou's and take in what Chicago eats.
