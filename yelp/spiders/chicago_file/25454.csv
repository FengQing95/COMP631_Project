Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was our food highlight in Chicago! We ordered "the Lou" deep dish pizza and the stuffed spinach bread as an appetizer. The bread was the bomb & the pizza was so good , the crust was crunchy and did not get soggy despite all the toppings. There is a bit of a wait but understand this is a thick pizza & made to order . Also , their serving sizes are pretty accurate, so unless you intend on leftovers, get the right size for your group !
