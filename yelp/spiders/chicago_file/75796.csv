Little Goat Diner////It was hard to pick a item off the extensive menu that was offered, too many items that I wanted to try out - usually for breakfast I go for the pancakes / french toast but what caught my eye was the smoked hash in duck fat, not sure why I picked it maybe because it sounded good. The food came fast and at first glance, looks very appealing but after a few bites, the dish started to accumulate grease and getting heavy to eat, though washing the food down with coffee did not help the cause. What helped me finish the dish was to tilt the entree in a slant to help drain the duck fat.
