Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Let me just say this is worth all the hype and more, such a classy steakhouse, love the ambiance and service! The drinks are great too, wish they had a bit more options but still great! The food is divine, worth the 1.5 hour wait, we wait too long to get reservations so we waited at the bar! We got their crab cake and smoked salmon salad for apps, and for main course filet mignon for my husband, and I chose the spicy chicken and mashed potato dish since I don't eat red meat! And let me tell y'all the best damn fried chicken I had in Chicago, we also had the truffle Mac and cheese sooo good! And then we got the famous chocolate pie and they sent over a ice creame and fudge dessert for our anniversary. Our server was so engaged and had fun conversations with us! Absolutely loved it! It as a hefty bill but justified! It was a lot of food! And we had so many leftovers but we will be back, I literally ate the leftovers for 2 days! Loved it! We will be back!!
