Smoque BBQ////The food at smoque is great, the dining area is cramped.  I really enjoy the food here.  The sauce is tangy, and the ribs are great.  I like the mac n cheese also.  This place is byob, but I would caution you from going here to enjoy a dining experience.  It is crazy busy, and they move people in , and out.
