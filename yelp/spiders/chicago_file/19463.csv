Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Got the Classic, which says it has extra cheese but omg was it a lot of cheese.  Another reviewer said it best, the first few bites were great, but after awhile the cheese cools down and becomes kinda rubbery.  Combine that with a thin layer of sauce and a slightly-still-doughy bottom crust, and eating became more of a chore.  The outer crust was buttery and good enough to eat.
