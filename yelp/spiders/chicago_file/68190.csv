Little Goat Diner////We loved the decor which makes this an atypical diner.  The okonomiyaki dish was the most memorable because it was not heavy unlike most breakfast items.  The dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes were good but not special. The Fat Elvis waffles were heavy (as the name implied) and the sauce didn't cover the bottom so well.
