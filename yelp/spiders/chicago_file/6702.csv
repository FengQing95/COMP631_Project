The Purple Pig////This was our first group meal in the city and I'm SOOO GLAD it was! It's unassuming to enter via an office building type of space but Â you go all the way to the end and you get solid views of the water. Definitely make reservations for brunch since it was busy when we came and they weren't seating people without a reservation. I did at least 2 weeks in advance for a group of 8.
