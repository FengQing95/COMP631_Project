Smoque BBQ////The best dry rub pork ribs in Chicago. I get the St. Louis cut. They are pull part tender with just the right mount of smoke. These ribs are accompanied by two sauces. Memphis (sweet and tangy) Carolina (vinegar base) both good but I prefer the Memphis for these ribs. Carolina goes great with the fries :)
