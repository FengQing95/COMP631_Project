Little Goat Diner////Go here to indulge, brunch was fantastic, you will definitely come out full and satisfied. I had the Bull's eye French toast which didn't need the fried chicken, and was delicious with the bbq maple syrup (sweet/salty combo). The pork belly pancake and regular pancakes were a favorite, the Little Piggy went to China was heavier on the flavor/meat side. If you want to be daring, go for the Little Goat latte (made from goat milk, which is really more of an after taste)
