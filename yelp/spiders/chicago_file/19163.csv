Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time in Chicago, and headed out for some deep dish pizza.  My only experience with deep dish was via the Pizzeria Uno chain back in Poughkeepsie NY and Fairfield CT in the late '80's, early '90's.  I liked it then, but would being IN Chicago, home of the real deal, surpass my memory?
