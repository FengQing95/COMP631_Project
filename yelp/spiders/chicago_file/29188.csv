Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is a solid 4.5. Service is a bit slow despite pre-ordering your pizza. The clam chowder was DELICIOUS; creamy and lots of clams. The calamari was good too, crunch batter, perfectly salted. We ordered the Lou's deep dish. My husband and I shared the small and it was more than enough. We had left overs. My daughter ordered the cheese thin crust, it was good. Do yourself a favor: order the ranch dressing. It's homemade and AMAZING!!! Our hotel gave us a free dessert appetizer so we got the cookie; so good!!!
