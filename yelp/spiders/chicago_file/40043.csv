Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service and food was amazing! Would definitely recommend. Celebrated my boyfriends birthday and he definitely enjoyed the environment. We ordered the seafood tower, the ribeye steak and side order of truffle Mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. All of it was done well and no complaints.
