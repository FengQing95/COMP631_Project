Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was absolutely blown away with this place! I had overlooked this restaurant because of the "cafe" in the name. However, I decided to try it based on a couple recommendations from friends. I'm so happy I did! They had a wide variety of small plates (vegetarian, meat, seafood) and different paella dishes. All of the waitstaff were very knowledgable of the food on the menu, and were able to make helpful recommendations. We tried about six different tapas and a paella, and we're not disappointed in the least! I'm not a huge spicy person, so I was nervous that since the food was Spanish it would be too spicy. I was glad that that wasn't the case. The portions are perfect, in that you get to try a variety of different dishes and not feel stuffed. If the food wasn't enough, the atmosphere was adorable inside. We sat in a room that simulated an outdoor square, with brick walls and strings of lights on the ceilings. Overall, great atmosphere, food, and service!
