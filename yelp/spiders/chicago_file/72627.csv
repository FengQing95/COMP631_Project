Little Goat Diner////okay, I'm gonna be honest - it's not that great. I'm not just saying that because girl and the goat is so amazing; I actually came to little goat first. I haven't had an entree here that I've liked yet, after multiple trips, and I usually end up eating off of my friends' plates or filling up on drinks. I will say the milkshakes are absolutely worth it, but the asian fusion items on the menu are big misses. if I want an affordable but upscale brunch in west town, I'd go to flo instead.
