Art Institute of Chicago////We have our own Museum of Fine Art at home in Boston, and I am not typically a modern art type of girl (well, unless it is fun - like a large rubber ducky (Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman please bring your duck to Boston Harbor!) or a sinking yellow meeting house (recently tipped over in the Greenway by InterContinental Boston, by Mark Reigelman).  So my goal for the museum was the Impressionism exhibit (most specifically, the Sunday in the Park with George painting - formally known as Georges Seurat's A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte) and their miniature rooms exhibit (I wanted a doll house when I was a kid - never got one though).  We also checked out American Gothic in the Modern American Art rooms - this was located in a whole other building of the museum, which we had to return to the ground floor to gain access to.  It was also quite popular, as the security guard who directed us on how to get there ended up telling the following group that chatted her up to just follow us.
