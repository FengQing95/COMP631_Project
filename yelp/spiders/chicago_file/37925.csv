Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Beginning to end, this was an exceptional experience. The ambiance was romantic and the server seemed extremely knowledgeable about the menu. She was able to make recommendations, tell us about the size of the portions, tell us what foods and drinks would pair well together, etc. She had several tables but did not seem rushed at all - she took her time with us. Everything came out exactly as it was ordered - nothing was missing or over/undercooked. Only complaint would be that there was not much space between our table and the table next to us so I felt like I was on a double date with the couple sitting beside us. We could hear their conversation and I'm sure they could hear ours. Overall, the food tasted amazing and experience was awesome.
