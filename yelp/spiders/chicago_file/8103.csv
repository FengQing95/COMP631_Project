Art Institute of Chicago////One criticism though is that the informational placards next to some of the paintings were really tiny. I mean, I understand that you don't want to take away from the paintings with these huge signs of text, but think about your audience. While the museum is popular among younger people with 20/20 vision, it is also popular among old people who - let's face it - can't see that well. I think it would help if the placards with a lot of text were a tad bit bigger. My mom, for one, had to get within inches of each sign to read it with her glasses. It was kind of ridiculous.
