Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I like that they pre-take your order and then seat you as seating becomes available and take your drinks and appetizer order then.  The pizza does take awhile to make so this shortens the wait a bit.  The line could be long but it was worth the wait - come on off times, around 3pm between lunch and dinner for a little shorter wait or during the week for no wait at all.  The restaurant was very classic Italian decor and style.  I'm drooling just writing this review and want to fly back to Chicago just for Lou Malnati's!!!
