Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My mouth is watering just writing this. I now live in Seattle, WA and would give anything to have a Lou Malnati's pop up here! I know Chicago is best known for their deep dish, but I'm telling you, the thin crust is where it's at...Both are actually amazing, but the thin has the most perfect consistency and you can control how much you're eating a little easier :) My office still orders this regularly and it never gets old!
