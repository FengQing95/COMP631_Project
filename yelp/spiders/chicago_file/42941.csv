Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I hosted a bridal shower here, and the service, food, and ease of planning were fantastic!  We had a wonderful time and a memorable event.  Our server took great care of us, and the food and sangria were delicious.  The event planning coordinator made logistics a breeze. Every detail was taken care of. I would definitely recommend Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba for a private event!
