Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is delicious! I'm still not sure if I like it better than Cafe Iberico though...We had a party of 6, but it seems like a good place for people to bring larger groups. We started off with the pitcher or red sangria. It was good, stronger than I expected, and we all got about 1.5 glasses from it.
