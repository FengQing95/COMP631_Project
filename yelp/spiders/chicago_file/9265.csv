Art Institute of Chicago////With its vast collection of works, from the iconic to the Avant-garde, every art lover is certain to find something that appeals. The fact that I can visit my favorite works while also exploring new exhibits season after season keeps the experience fresh. There is always some new facet to discover and I find myself awaiting the next member preview event or lecture, especially during this stretch of winter when the default seems to be staying indoors and surfing through the recently discovered roster of HBOs that I'm sure will be stripped away pretty soon (it was good while it lasted, Comcast). I can't wait until spring, with its promise of the reopened courtyard and other outdoor spaces and the unveiling of several eagerly anticipated exhibits.
