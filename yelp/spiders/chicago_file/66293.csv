Little Goat Diner////The tempura mashed potatoes were amazing (5 stars), but the other two dishes were only a "solid good" - french toast (with chicken) and the Asian pancake dish.  The chicken didn't compare to Paramount Room, Farmhouse or Carriage House, which have the best chicken dishes in the City.  Service was exceptional (for a diner).
