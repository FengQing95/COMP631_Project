The Purple Pig////The place encourages you to order dishes however you like - total freedom to choose, no getting boxed in with appetizers and mains and getting looked at like you're a freak when you order too many apps. Crispy pig's ears are as awesome as advertised, Spanish octopus is exquisite (so tender!), and the meat - pork belly, pork jowl, and gyros - are the best thing to happen since Devin White. Go Bucs.
