Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Boyfriend and I decided to try out some of Chi town's pizza when we were visiting for a game at Wrigley Field. I can't believe how delicious the deep dish (AKA - chicago style) pizza really was. We love our thin crust here in St Louis, but the deep dish was a wonderful change! I ordered the deep dish cheese pizza with a spinach mixture inside which was the best pizza I've ever eaten and my boyfriend ordered the thin crust - I felt kinda sorry for him because it wasn't nearly as tasty as my deep dish.
