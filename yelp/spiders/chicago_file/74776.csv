Little Goat Diner////We had a reservation for 4:30pm and only had to wait about 10 minutes to get seated. Theres a cute little photo booth that kept us entertained while we waited. Our server wasn't the friendliest of people which is probably why my 4 stars isn't a 5 stars. I'm all about customer service and our server was very short and didn't seem like she wanted to be there. Also probably because my Hemingway tasted mostly like grapefruit juice and not enough rum, but i'll excuse that for now. Let's move on to the food though. The goat chili cheese fries were my favorite thing ever. The fries are shoestring so they have the perfect crunch to them, and the goat cheese tasted so good with their chili. I ordered the bimbimbap and it was tasty. The fried chicken sandwich is bomb and has a spicy twist to it. Overall, it was a cute little upscale diner with a lively vibe that serves breakfast all day, which is pretty AWESOME. The logo is also the cutest thing ever. I definitely liked the Girl and the Goat way better, but this place is good too if you're looking for a casual Chicago experience.
