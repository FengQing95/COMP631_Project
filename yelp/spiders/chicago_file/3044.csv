The Purple Pig////Absolutely LOVED The Purple Pig. The milk braised pork shoulder was out of this world. Super tender,  nicely paired with buttery potato puree, and topped with crispy capers. The white asparagus was tender and sweet on its own but  between the poached quail eggs, crispy bacon, and dollops of apricot, held a different taste at every bite. The truffle and foie hotdog was a fun play on the Chicago style dog, and if you're not a vegetable person... the broccoli will definitely change your mind.
