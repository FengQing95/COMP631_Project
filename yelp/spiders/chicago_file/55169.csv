Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas style is great to try a bunch of things, which is what we did! Been a few times, for dinner and brunch. There's too many to name, but we've enjoyed most dishes either menu. It's known for paella, and I'd only recommend it if you have a lot of people. It comes out later, and it was too much after everything else we ordered (table of 3). One that I will remember for next time- skip the honey battered chicken sticks.. idk what that should've been, but it was so strange. Service is usually quick.
