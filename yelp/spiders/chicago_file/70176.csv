Little Goat Diner////And then there's the actual Little Goat branding - which is so cute and well done that I could throw up. The logo is adorable and EVERYWHERE. It's on the windows and the plates and the coffee cups and the to go bags and everywhere without being overwhelming. Again, this place gets some serious design points.
