Art Institute of Chicago////Good news is that for your $$s, you're getting certified good art that has been vetted by experts.  Great.  Who wants to wonder if you're looking at something that's inspired and magically terrific or just a weak copy by some so and so who probably works at Argo tea.  And used to be rapper first until he figured out nobody digs his dope rhymes.  No I think I'll stick to the vetted art.  I don't want to be fooled into liking something that's not good.
