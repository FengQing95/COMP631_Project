Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tapas were excellent! My first time at this location and I will be back. The wait was really long but the server next to the bar greeted us and sat us at the bar tables. The bartender that served us was excellent. He was very knowledgable of the menu and gave great choices . The food came out very quickly to my surprise and was delicious, fresh, and hot. Great place to dine on a date, casual dining, and just hanging out.
