Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The one thing that came around after we were super full was the paella. The server spent time to prepare it by the table and it looked like he spent a lot of good time on it! After he went to serve us, we realized there was sausage in it, which we made clear when we ordered we didn't want. Â It sounds like there was a miscommunication from the server to the kitchen.
