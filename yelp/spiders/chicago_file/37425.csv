Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So the food. You start with huge chunks of delicious bread and butter. Two thumbs up. I ordered the 10 oz filet mignon and my girlfriend got the roasted chicken. Steak was phenomenal. Perfectly cooked, juicy, great flavor, everything you could want. Chicken was super succulent and so tasty too. For sides we got the truffle mac n cheese and butternut squash. Both great. (I'm running out of adjectives)
