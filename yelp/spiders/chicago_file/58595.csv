Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went here for a date with my husband. We were seated immediately but unfortunately sat at some kind of elevated nook by the bar. Though I had a bit of difficulty getting up to my seat (I'm 5'1") I thought it was a cute unique dinning experience. My husband who is 5'7" was not feeling it. His legs did not fit comfortably. The places was book so we decided to make the book work. The service was fantastic and we loved everything we ordered especially the dates and the goat cheese bake!
