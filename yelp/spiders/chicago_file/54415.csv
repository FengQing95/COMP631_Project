Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////With relatives in town, and them already experience steakhouses and italian, we wanted something different for this dinner and landed at Ba-Ba-Reeba! Our night didn't start out on a positive note, right after we ordered and were chatting, our table split in half... yep, you heard right... broke down the middle just missing our guest's toes (one in sandals). Miraculously, no one was hurt and we all recognized a once in a lifetime freak accident. Their tables are thick wood. This was the binding done in manufacturing that failed! Restaurants first concern was if anyone was hurt, cleaned and replaced the table, and took care of the bill and dry cleaning for one of the guests. So they did the right thing!
