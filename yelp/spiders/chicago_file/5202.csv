The Purple Pig////We started out with some drinks and decided to go for a charcuterie board to start. You can have one cheese selection for $9, three cheeses for $24, and I believe 5 selections for $35. The meat choices are individually priced but you could get a whole platter for $50. We choose one of each type of cheese (gran pecorino, cremeaux di citeaux, and a mushroom cheese) and then two meats (prosciutto and spicy chorizo). Their meatballs are very popular here and we didn't get to try them because they ran out! Definitely will need to come back here. A true gem.
