Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Part of a local chain but don't let that deter you from choosing this pizza place. The deep dish pizza was delicious. Crispy crust and not soggy. It takes about 35 minutes to get your pizza so order a salad to bridge the gap. Clean, family friendly and roomy for big groups.
