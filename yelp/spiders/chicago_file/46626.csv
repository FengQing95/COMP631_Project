Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Really enjoy this spot, we've been twice and have recommended to friends. Great tapas and excellent sangria. This trip we tried bacon wrapped dates, so delightful. We also had mango sangria that we loved and a smoked salmon and caper dish. I would skip the heirloom tomato salad, somewhat bland and very expensive for one tomato cut up with cucumber. Also tried a chocolate almond dessert, delicious and dense like a creamy fudge. Loved it!
