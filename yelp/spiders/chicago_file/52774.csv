Smoque BBQ////You know a place is going to be top quality when the line of people waiting to order includes BOTH cab drivers and police officers.  Smoque did not disappoint, at all.  I've spent a lot of time since coming to Chicago trying to find quality bbq (for a city of foodies, our bbq offerings are sorely lacking), and smoque is definitely my go-to place.  Highly recommended.
