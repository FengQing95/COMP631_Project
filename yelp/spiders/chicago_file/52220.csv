Smoque BBQ////Had heard about this place from several people, they said it was good, they should of said great! AMAZING brisket! They cook it for like 15 hours and it shows, it is so tender it just falls apart and then melts in your mouth. My husband picked up his napkin, pulled it towards him and the napkin brushed across his brisket and it fell apart! That's how tender it is! The portions are generous as well, I always have left overs to take home, you get your money's worth for sure. The Mac n Cheese is made to order in a personal ramekin, which is really cool and it is so creamy and gooey, yet crunchy on the top. YUM! I just did a not so nice review for a bar b q place(County bar b q), stating in the review "if you want good bar b q, go to Smoque"! Seriously, it is amazing food, good value and a cool atmosphere. My only complaint is it is far from my house!!!
