Smoque BBQ////Let's start with the good.  The brisket was cooked perfectly.  One thing that I really liked is that the meats were not drowned in barbeque sauce a priori.  The sauce is given separately for the diner to freely decide how much or how little he wants to use.  As a person who wants to taste the meat above all else, I really applaud Smoque for this decision.
