Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food: We started out with the thick-cut bacon side dish, which came with four delicious slabs. We lost track of time enjoying our drinks and conversation, but apparently our server thought the entrees were taking a little bit longer than expected, so they treated us to the Mixed Greens and Apple Salad, which was light and refreshing. For the main course, we ordered the Petite Duchess Cut Filet and the Lamb Chops. Both were amazing and cooked just right. Normally, we like mint jelly with lamb (they didn't have any so we were a little worried...), but this entree was perfect on its own. For the sides, we ordered the Truffle Mac and Cheese and Brussel Sprouts. Both were great, but the Mac was definitely my favorite side! Last up, the Chocolate Cream Pie (with celebratory sparkler)! Creamy chocolate pie with crunchy oreo crust and the most delicious whipped cream-like topping was the perfect end to our evening!
