Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Seeing that Opentable only had 10 pm reservations, I called in on a birthday and they were able to seat us at a booth. We had returned to Bavette for the dry aged ribeye, which was nicely seasoned and grilled and as delicious as we had remembered. The ambience and noise level is perfect and unique compared to a regular boothed steak house.
