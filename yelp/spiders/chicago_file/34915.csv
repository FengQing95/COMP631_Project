Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm not going to add much to what has already been written about the restaurant, but I can tell you that all is deserving. The wait staff was phenomenal - they were personable, respectful of our privacy and knew when the right times were to check in on us. Our waiter also made spot on recommendations on portion sizes and menu highlights.
