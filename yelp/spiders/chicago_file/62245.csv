Smoque BBQ////This place is worth the hype.  I ordered the half slab of the St. Louis ribs with mac n cheese and beans. It comes with coleslaw. My husband and I shared the peach cobbler dessert.  We were stuffed--the food was awesome! The ribs were super tender, had a great outside, the sauce was delicious...I am looking forward to coming back already!  Service was fast and friendly.  Note, it's BYOB--there is a liquor store/bar about 2 blocks south of the restaurant if you want to pick something up.
