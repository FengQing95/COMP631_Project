Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered tapas separately (I know, you're supposed to share! We just really all wanted the same thing). I got an eggs benedict tapa, a paella tapa and had a cafe con leche. I wasn't super impressed but at least the poached egg on top of the eggs benedict was very runny and delicious! The hollandaise was standard as well. The paella tasted like regular fried rice and I felt that the dishes weren't salted properly (especially the bacon mac and cheese which should've been salty from the bacon). My friends and I had to add salt on multiple occasions.
