Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My biggest gripe with this place ended up being the service. All 6 of our dishes were delivered within 5 minutes. Â Therefore every inch of our table was totally filled, and all of our dishes got cold before we got a chance to enjoy them. They also kept trying to take our dishes away before we were done. We felt totally rushed. I want to feel like my business is appreciated rather than having them just try to turn the table over. It actually took awhile to get our check, which seemed strange considering the rest of the meal indicated that they couldn't wait for us to leave.
