The Purple Pig////Great food, excellent service! It was really busy here when my wife and I visited but you wouldn't know it from the service. Our waiter was really nice and attentive ...being patient (despite how busy they were) and offering suggestions. Altogether, we had the Half Duck, Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Smoked Pork Tongue, Grilled Broccoli, and Orecchiette ...and all were great and tasty! ...oh yea, we were hungry ...lol
