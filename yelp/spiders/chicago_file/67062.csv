Little Goat Diner////I've been here several times - for lunch, dinner & a private party - and I've never had a bad experience. The food is consistently amazing and I've tried something different every time. The drinks are also fun and delicious. Everything is a la carte which makes it easy to order several items and share with your entire party. Definitely one of my favorite places in the city.
