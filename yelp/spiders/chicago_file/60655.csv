Smoque BBQ////Arriving at probably the peak time to eat (8pm), there was  a line from the counter out the door, but it did move at a nice clip.  Now your first inclination is to ask, "why don't they have outdoor seating?"  Well, I overheard another table say that the neighbors are against it, which is evident by the big signs on the side street indicating that parking along that street is for "RESIDENTS ONLY."  But there is plenty of parking on Pulaski, so don't sweat it.
