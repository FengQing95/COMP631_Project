Smoque BBQ////I'm a huge fan of BBQ and always make an effort to try new places when I travel for business. If there's BBQ being served, I'll give it a try. Â I've been to the well known "hot spots" such as Austin, Memphis and Kansas City to little known places for BBQ such as Green Bay - and yes, this place loves up to the hype.
