Little Goat Diner////One tiny tiny gripe: urrr, I love me some Chef Izard and I love me some goat. However, this place does a real number on your wallet. Yes yes, I know, you get what you pay for, but I thought this was supposed to be more accessible than girl and the goat? Looks like demand is going to keep that from happening.
