Little Goat Diner////At that point, I should have asked for a manager but I try to be a courteous and pleasant customer so I ask that they please do so. My friend is sitting where she can see into the kitchen and she sees the waitress show the chef, who also seems irritated. I assume they zap it in the microwave for a minute or so and return the plate to me. The chicken is much more tender and the right color, on the surface. Once I slice further into the meat, I again notice pink. I uploaded two pictures of the chicken, both taken AFTER it had been returned to me. Notice that it is still a shade of pink that indicates it hasn't been fully cooked. Then go back and read the first sentence of this review.
