Art Institute of Chicago////The ground floor house an amazing miniature collection which are tiny scenes of Japanese, Chinese, English and French rooms built to scale with accurate time period furniture. Each one was constructed artfully and you felt like you were peering into a royal's living room. Most impressive was there were multiple rooms that gave the illusion of outdoor scenery or additional rooms. One of my favorite parts of the museum.
