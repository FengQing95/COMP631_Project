Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The atmosphere is dark with pops of lighting and there's music playing that's sort of fun but not too loud. We were seated in a booth on the main floor and our server came over after a few minutes. She was nice enough but seemed a little out of it, and she didn't make as many visits as I would have liked.
