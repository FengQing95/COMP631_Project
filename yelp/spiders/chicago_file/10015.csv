Art Institute of Chicago////As a fan of impressionist paintings, I found myself inspecting every stroke and color used by Monet, Manet, and Renoir.  The Van Gogh exhibits were fascinating to see too.  Don't ignore the architecture of the entire facility! It's gorgeous. Point being, give yourself ample amount of time to go through the 3+ floors that this museum has to offer.  A casual fan can whiz through this exhibit in less than an hour and a half, but a more involved person would take about 2.5-3 hours.  Hunger can be a huge distraction so make sure to eat before or bring a clean snack.  Employees see any crumbs dropping on the floor, they'll ask you to leave.
