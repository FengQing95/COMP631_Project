Smoque BBQ////The BBQ was good.  I can't say that it was the best I have ever had but it is definitely worth returning for carry out.  So I give this spot 3 stars because it's Chicago and there was actually a good BBQ joint.  I took one star away because it really should never take 45 minutes to get inside of a place to eat.
