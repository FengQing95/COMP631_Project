Art Institute of Chicago////I visited with my baby in a baby carrier in the front and my diaper bag that looks like a backpack. When we bought our tickets I was informed they didn't allow backpacks (I had no idea), i informed the ticket salesman that it was a diaper bag and they were free to check. Being that it is a large museum and I knew we'd be there for a few hours I NEEDED the diaper bag. The salesman said ok and to just let the guards that would check my ticket know. The guards were mean, had nasty attitudes and pretty much told me that bc it's a backpack I couldn't take it in and that I needed to pay to check it but they would give me a "courtesy bag". My diaper bag comes with a thermal pocket for breast milk and a changing pad. I also offered to pull it up on buybuy baby website to prove that it was indeed a diaper bag. Never mind that I offered for them to search it. Their "courtesy bag" only fit the changing pad and a couple diapers... Another bag for wipes... Another bag... At this point I was furious and frustrated. Really??? They told me I could that I could return if I forgot something but depending on where I was in the museum "that would be super inconvenient"... Ya think?!? You want me to not only pay you to hold my diaper bag but now we've gotta carry multiple tiny bags to replace it? Luckily an employee found me a brown paper bag that fit everything but it was just the fact that they were being so unreasonable moreover extremely rude about it!
