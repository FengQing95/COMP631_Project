Art Institute of Chicago////All that being said - this museum is ridiculously expensive and out of reach for too many. One free day a week is hardly enough. You're even charged to check your coat! This sets the stage for (again, IMHO) an elitist space that has so much to offer but can't be offered to too many. Even in these tough economic times, there is simply no excuse for this.
