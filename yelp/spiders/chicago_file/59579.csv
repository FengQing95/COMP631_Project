Smoque BBQ////It's pretty good but I have definitely had better. I wouldn't wait 30 mins in line for it. There was no line, no wait. I guess 3p was a good time because I didn't see any of the crowd that's been raved about. Found a park easily on the side. Walked right in, ordered and was seated. Pleasant staff, clean. Nice sized portions but it definitely wasn't what it's been hyped up to be. Would I eat there again? Sure... If I'm in the area but I wouldn't take another 40 minute trip just out the blue.
