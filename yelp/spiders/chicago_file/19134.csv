Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My boyfriend and I went on a Sunday around 1pm and they took us in right away, there was no line. We ordered the Ceasar Salad and cheese sticks to start. Both were very good. We also ordered the classic deep dish pizza. Everything tasted so fresh. I wish I could have ordered to go and bring some back to Los Angeles.
