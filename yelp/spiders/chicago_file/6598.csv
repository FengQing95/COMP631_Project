The Purple Pig////The Purple Pig was a treat! My friend has more of a vegan friendly diet than my everything-but-the-kitchen-sink lifestyle, so it was nice to have options that weren't fried and appealed to both of us, since everything is meant to be shared. We had 4 vegetarian friendly dishes for 2 + 2 drinks each and left satisfied.
