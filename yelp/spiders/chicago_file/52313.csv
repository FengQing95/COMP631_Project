Smoque BBQ////with all this corn going to subsidized ethanol initiatives, it's getting harder to get good beef at a reasonable price.  nevertheless, and despite a few recent forgivable inconsistencies*, smoque has managed to deliver a quality product while still maintaining value to the customer.  the store keeps no inventory, and hence, their capacity for the day is their smokers' capacity.  fresh food at a reasonable price means long lines and when the food's out, it's out--this used to be a major issue, but has become more reasonable in recent months.
