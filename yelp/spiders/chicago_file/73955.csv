Little Goat Diner////I ate here twice in 10 days while in Chicago. Once for lunch and once for breakfast. Wow! What a fun place to eat. The food and service are excellent. Sit at the bar if you can so that you can appreciate how hard the kitchen is working and get to see all the dishes as they head out to the lucky people. Get a cinnamon roll - seriously special. And the Pork Belly Pancake. The play on chicken and waffles fell short for me - I wanted more chicken and less sweet. And I ate every last bite.
