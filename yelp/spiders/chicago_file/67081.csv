Little Goat Diner////this was a repeat breakfast visit to little goat and this time things were just off. Â we did not have to wait for a table which was nice, the server was friendly and there as we got settled. Then it started to go sour. the server began to disappear, coffee arrived with cream but no spoons. We asked for spoons and received spoons large enough to ladle gravy from a tureen. Then one of our food items arrived which we were going to share. We asked for sharing plates and received bowls. so we managed. One of our food items was the elvis waffle which was very good. another was hash browns which were kind of glued together into a big blob except at the edges which were crispy. eggs and toast were as good as expected. Considering the difficulty of getting to the restaurant and it only being mediocre, it might be a while before i venture back there.
