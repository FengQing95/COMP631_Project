Smoque BBQ////In a word, awesome!  I am a firm believer that a BBQ place should be known equally for its meats and its sides, and both I can assure you were wonderful!  The ribs were fall off the bone, the brisket melted in your mouth, all accompanied by a tangy, sweet BBQ sauce.  For sides we tried the mac & cheese, creamy yet with a delightful crunchy bread crumb topping; baked beans, smokey with bits of bacon; french fries, absolutely to die for; and of course cole slaw that helped break up all that grease in my belly.  Oh, and don't forget the peach cobbler for dessert... almost better than Mom's.  At first I thought that perhaps the mac & cheese side was too small, but after eating everything else it turned out to be just the right size.  Definitely an affordable outing, plus you get enough food to put you in a coma for the rest of the afternoon.
