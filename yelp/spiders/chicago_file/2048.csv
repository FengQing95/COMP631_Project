Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This place was at the top the trip advisor restaurants for all of Chicago and it was conviently located for our site seeing plans on a Monday morning.  I was expecting a greasy spoon where they give you heaps of Midwest style breakfast.   But, this place looked nice.  It was in a newer building and everything was clean.   The food was excellent.  We both had skillet meals with pancakes and they did everything right.   The meat, especially the ham, was top quality.   I have been to so many places where they give you cheap ham or lunch meat that this was a big treat.
