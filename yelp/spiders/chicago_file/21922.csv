Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Malnati's is only the second deep dish we've had in Chicago, the being Uno. However, after our visit to the Wells St location, we see no need to go anywhere else. We chose to sit at the bar instead of waiting for a table, and the bartender was very attentive. My wife had not been a fan of deep dish, but that quickly changed after we had "The Lou" specialty pizza with pepperoni. Just the right balance of cheese, sauce, and ingredients, and the crust was perfect, not too thick. A small was enough for both of us. Just right. We will be back!
