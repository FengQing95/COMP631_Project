Little Goat Diner////Ordered the chocolate crunch pancake and small side of biscuits and gravy. Sat at the diner's bar, where I could watch a busy crew make it through brunch rush which was fun. Made a few friends next to me who were excited about the food I had ordered. Both dishes took breakfast food in a really tasty and unique direction. The service was excellent as well. My server was very knowledgeable and friendly. She explained all the dishes and flavors I was tasting. I had a great time, can't wait to come back with friends!
