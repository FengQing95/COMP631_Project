Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I died last night and went to food heaven!  There were friendly angels there to gree me at the door.  The atmosphere was rich and dim,  set in the prohibition era. The cocktails were superbly crafted. Our server John was enthusiastic and knowledgeable.  We stayed with garlic shrimp (a must). We had the lobster and the fish on special.  Then wrapped it up with a brick Sunday.  I recommend this place to anyone looking for a special night!
