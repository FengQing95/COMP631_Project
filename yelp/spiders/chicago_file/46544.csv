Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have heard a lot about Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! for a while.  My boyfriend used to live right by there and said it was his favorite place.  We finally went a few weeks ago and I'm so glad we did.  I'm not a huge tapas fan, but decided to try it anyways.  My boyfriend demanded we get the Potatas Bravas since those are his favorite (and that he got his own order).  let me tell you, if you're going to make a good decision, it's going to be getting these.  They're spicy with a tomato aioli sauce to dip.  I could've eaten only those and been happy.
