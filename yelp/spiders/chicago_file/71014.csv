Little Goat Diner////Now to the food.  Considering the name of the place, there are quite a few vegetarian and pescetarian options.  And our waiter was very accommodating and full of great suggestions.  The fish tostadas are unbelievable!  The spiced apple pancakes were also pretty good.  Oh, and the breakfast menu is available all day!!
