Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have two complaints. Despite the many open tables, they decided to sit us between two other couples. It was uncomfortably close and I was intimately involved in my neighbors conversation. Other complaint: watch out for the mysterious clumpy white sauce they dump on top of the salsa that accompanies the calamari. Its nasty.
