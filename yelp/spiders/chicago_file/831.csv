Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The service was amazing and the pumpkin pancakes with the Mexican skillet makes for a delicious breakfast! I ordered a flavored coffee to go and they mistakenly gave it to me in a ceramic mug. My serve immediately realizes the barista's mistake and corrected it before I even had to ask.
