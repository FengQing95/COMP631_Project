Art Institute of Chicago////I have been lucky enough to visit multiple world-class art museums and I can honestly say that The Art Institute of Chicago is one of my very favorites. I love the diversity of art and artifacts on display and especially love the manageable size of the museum. You don't feel overwhelmed but you can still spend an entire day in there if you so desire. It's probably best known for the huge Georges Seurat piece "Sunday Afternoon on the Island of Grand Jette" and its extensive collection of other French Impressionism paintings. I love the the gorgeous collection of Degas and Renoir, the colors in the paintings are magnificent.
