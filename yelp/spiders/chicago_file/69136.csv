Little Goat Diner////Let me preface this by saying I am such a picky eater. The menu was hard for me to get through because there were so many odd combos. I finally decided on a pulled pork sandwich and it was devine! I am really sad I didn't try anything with goat in it... this place is always busy so be prepared for a short wait.
