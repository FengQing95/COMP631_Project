Art Institute of Chicago////I am a people watcher! I love helping tourists get perfect snapshots! A trio of young ladies now have a memorable shot amid the sculptures. A lovely couple held their little guy and posed by American Gothic! Seeing this an older couple tapped me on the shoulder and of course I obliged for them as well!
