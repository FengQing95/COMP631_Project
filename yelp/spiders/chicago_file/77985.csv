Little Goat Diner////I've been to little goat several times and i go back and forth between 3 and 4 stars.  They have some interesting twists on breakfast/ brunch but I don't feel it is Chef Izard's forte.  Today I had the big biscuit and gravy.  First it's just that, for $14.  I know it's a Stephanie Izard restaurant but that's at least $4 too much.  The biscuit is large but normal, not groundbreaking.  The gravy is a sausage and mushroom gravy.  I like the gravy okay but it's little on the sweeter side and in my opinion lacks salt and pepper, I'm more of a savory gravy kind of guy.
