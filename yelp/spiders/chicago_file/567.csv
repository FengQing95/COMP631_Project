Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The sweet crepe was delicious. I had to ask our waitress if they were French style, because often times crepes come out looking like pancakes. My crepe came out thin, stuffed with wildberry mascarpone and drizzled with FRESH fruit and syrup. Writing about it makes me weak in the knees.
