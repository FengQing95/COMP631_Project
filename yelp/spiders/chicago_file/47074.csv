Smoque BBQ////The line was longer than the number of idiots who follow Kim Kardashian on Twitter.  However, the food at Smoque is very damn good.  I must start with a major disclaimer.  The baby back ribs were an epic FAIL!!  They did not fall off the bone.  The meat was tough and difficult to pull off. Also, the ribs were very boney.  The meat was limited.  I have had better ribs at Portillo's and Fridays.  I was not a big fan of the BBQ sauce.  I prefer something tangy and sweet.  The sauce is flat and spicy.  It does not make you want to lick your fingers.  NOW lets talk about what is excellent.  The chopped brisket sandwich is beyond belief.  The meat is very tender and flavorful.  The sandwich is huge and the bread is very soft and melts in your mouth.  You must must must try the fries.  These are one of the best in Chicago.  I fully understand why the lines were so long.  Also, the mac and cheese is average.  I did not hate it but I also did not love it.
