Little Goat Diner////It was our 1st time there and definitely comparable to Girl & The Goat as far as unique and off-the-beaten path menu. The four of us went at 9am and the wait was only 15 minutes so I highly suggest that you go early to avoid the wait that seems to come during brunch/lunch time.
