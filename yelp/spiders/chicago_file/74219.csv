Little Goat Diner////We were seated at the counter and my eyes would start to blur if I stared ahead at the half wall that separates the kitchen from the dining area. Don't be like me. Being seated right next to each other at the counter was good for us however, as it is a bit loud in the restaurant just due to the number of people all having conversations at once. After dinner and pre-drink drinks, we were ready to hit the bars.
