Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Glad we were able to come here for my hubs birthday. Although no one asked us if we were celebrating anything and other tables seemed like they were getting special treatment, we had a good time. We really appreciated how safe and clean all the servers were throughout our time there. Menu and check were paperless which was convenient and also appreciated. The filet was so juicy and perfectly cooked. The chicken was deliciously crusted on the outside and also filled with juicy flavor. Salad was refreshing and the mac was creamy and also very delicious. The ice cream was mediocre, nothing super special. Would we go there again? Perhaps.
