Little Goat Diner////The bi bim bop bowl is amazing for breakfast, just a fair trace of Korean flavor but delicious and filling. It has cauliflower rice mushrooms and you can place two eggs however you'd like on it, it also has some yummy bacon! The club is filling and everything you'd want on your sandwich. The side of hash browns has melted cheese on the bottom and the sausage patties have a sweet taste and are the item I order EVERY time I'm here!
