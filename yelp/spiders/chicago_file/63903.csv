Smoque BBQ//// I got the sliced brisket platter with cole slaw, Mac and cheese, and cobbler. Hm... As a Texan though, I was slightly disappointed. I mean, I know REAL BBQ but I felt Smoque was very average. Sure, the meat was tender and tasty and the sauce was divine, but I was expecting out of the world flavor when I heard Smoque had the best BBQ in Chicago.
