Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered mozzarella sticks in the meantime which was a great idea since it took extra long for the pizza. I really enjoy all the food but mozzarella sticks and their homemade marinara sauce was my favorite. Was it worth waiting 1 1/2 hours for pizza, probably not but I really enjoy the authentic experience!
