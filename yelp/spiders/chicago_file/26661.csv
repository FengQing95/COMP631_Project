Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We came here pretty late on a Friday and expected a long wait. Our wait ended up only being a little more than an hour. We were able to easily get to the bar to get drinks while we waited and even ordered our pepperoni deep dish (I had not previously known this was ordinary since the pizza takes so long to cook).
