Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Lous on Higgins and Wells are the best. Maybe it is the cheeze baked into the oven walls? Who knows - but it always warrants a stop when I'm staying downtown for a trade show at McCormick Place. Straightforward working man's deep dish, unlike those that start with G that have gone a little too froofy and upscale with the works.
