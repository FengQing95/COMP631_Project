Smoque BBQ////So, at 11:00 am. on a Sunday, be prepared people will start arriving at the open. By 11:15, all seats were full. That was a good sign already. A restaurant with that kind of regular traffic has to be good. Between two people, we ordered a full slab of ribs with mac and cheese and cornbread and the brisket platter with a side of pulled pork, coleslaw, beans and fries. First of all, I am gluten and dairy free. I was so happy when the manager confirmed that all meats and sauces are gluten free. He also assured me that most of the sides were, too. Including the fries!!! You have NO idea how happy I was since fries are usually a no-no since they share a fryer with gluten items.
