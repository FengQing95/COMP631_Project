Art Institute of Chicago////I also should add that they have a decently priced cafe, a notch above standard cafeteria-type food. If you're anything like me and intend to spend the day from opening until the Institute closes its doors, then you should feel happy to know you can have a nice lunch break. They also have outdoor seating.
