Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Had such a wonderful experience at Bavette's this past Friday and I couldn't wait to write my review. We reserved in December and this was the first available reservation. We valet parked at Gilt bar for $15 and walked in. We were early so we sat in the lounge and someone right away came to ask if we wanted a drink.
