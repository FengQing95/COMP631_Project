Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I are visiting here for our anniversary. By far the best dinner we've ever had in our life. The steak was to die for. All of the size we ordered were absolutely delicious. We had the mushrooms and the truffle mac & cheese. I highly recommend them both. We had the tenants fillet cooked medium and it was absolute delicious. Erik, our waiter was the best. He really made our dining experience over the top. If we are ever back in Chicago, this place is definitely on the top of the list.I highly recommend this place for any kind of special occasion or if you're just trying to look for a good steakhouse in Chicago.
