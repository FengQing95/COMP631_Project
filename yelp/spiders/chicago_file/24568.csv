Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's is our favorite pizza place in the city. If we're not going with the classic Sausage deep dish with butter crust, then we get "The Lou" with sausage pieces. Super tasty. Best to have fresh in the restaurant as with delivery all of those delicious toppings can get a little soggy. The Malnati Salad is delicious - we bought their dressing to bring home. So good! They also support the community, which is very admirable. They have donated to our fundraiser the past two years. Thank you Lou's!!
