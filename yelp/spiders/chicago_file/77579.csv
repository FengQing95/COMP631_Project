Little Goat Diner////I like the atmosphere of this place, it's got a cool layout and there's a coffee bar in the back for while you wait.  We visited on a Friday around 11 and only had a 20 minute wait (compared to the next day when we tried to go again and it was 1.5 hours for walk ins).  My husband had a conglomerate meal of French Toast berries, over easy eggs inside, and chicken.  He enjoyed it!  I had a hash, but there was almost too much meat compared to eggs and no other veggies that I recall.  They did have really yummy shoestring potatoes in the hash!  We had bloody mary's and I don't know if they ran out of mix or just have a bad mix but they were awful and I couldn't drink mine- which is unheard of (especially when I'm paying $10/drink).  It tasted like straight tomato juice.  Overall I recommend, just not the bloody!
