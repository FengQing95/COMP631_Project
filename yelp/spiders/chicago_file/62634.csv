Smoque BBQ////The ribs are great, but the brisket is better than most that I have had in Texas. For those who don't know Texas brisket, just think about the most tender, juiciest beef with a good smoke flavor. The bark (or crust) is good enough to be served as a dish by itself. It is juicy, fatty, perfectly crusted goodness.
