Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've had pizza in Brooklyn and I've had pizza in Italy.  Lou Malnati's was my first foray into Chicago deep dish pizza, and I have to say, I'm impressed.  If you are a fan of New York style pizza and you are expecting something similar, stay away.  This is a completely different experience, but delicious none-the-less.  Be warned, it does take 35-40 minutes to cook even a 9 inch pie, but if you have the time to wait, it's worth the trip.  The appetizers were very generous, and the pizza itself was fantastic.  The service was also very attentive.  Now I have to find a place that does a good deep dish in Washington...
