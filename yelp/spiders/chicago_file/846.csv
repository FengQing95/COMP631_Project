Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Ate there a couple of times...food is quite good, it's breakfast, so don't know what the big deal is and wonder why so many wait so long for a pancake.  Since I live in the area I am quite peeved with the crowds blocking the sidewalk and surrounding area.  But what I really object to is the amount of space the sidewalk cafe takes up and resent that they will lock the gate surrounding the stacked tables after closing where pedestrians are obligated to squeeze on the outside.  Bothers me so much, I will not dine there again.
