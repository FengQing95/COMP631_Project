Art Institute of Chicago////My favorite art museum and I've only visited it once just recently. Upon walking in and paying for my admission, I was asked where I was visiting from. I said Arizona and was given the warmest welcome (thank you!). I truly loved every minute at the Art Institute of Chicago. Anytime I had a question, it was answered kindly and if I needed help finding specific art collections, I was guided with clear directions to the exact location. Even visiting the gift shop was fun. While I admired the jewelry, I was encouraged to try on the beautiful pieces. I can't say enough good things about this museum. I absolutely loved the art, but the people made it an even better experience!
