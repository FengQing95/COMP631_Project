Smoque BBQ////I get ribs and brisket. I love the smokey flavor. They give you BBQ sauce but it doesn't need it.  However, I do buy several bottles now for home.  I've been to The Dinosaur in New York and this is hands down better. I guess you have to like that flavor and if you do or not sure give it a try!  What's it going to hurt?  My Arizona runner up is Piggly's at the Fair in Mesa, AZ.  There is nothing to eat in Arizona!
