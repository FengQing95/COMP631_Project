Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got The Lou instead of the classic since I'm a vegetarian. Despite not being stuffed with sausage, the two guys I was with said it was delicious and very flavorful. I really liked it as well. I'm not a deep dish fan but once in a while it hits the spot. The crust was thick and crispy which is great; I like it over thick bread-y pizza. I think we got the medium for three people and we couldn't finish it but we tried to.
