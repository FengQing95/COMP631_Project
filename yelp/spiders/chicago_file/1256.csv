Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I chose between the Southern Eggs Benedict or the Nutella Crepes, but I wasn't trying to be that (why isn't there an italics option?) bad, so I got the Eggs Benedict covered in sausage gravy...with a side of hollandaise on the side. Ew. The hollandaise was weird; or at least I haven't tried one like it. It was the thickness of yogurt and unsavory? I think syrup or pancake batter somehow got mixed into everything on my plate because it all tasted unusually sweet. Hashbrowns included, which were undercooked and had zero seasoning. If you have to add S&P to anything you order at a restaurant, that's just a lack of knowledge in the kitchen. The sausage gravy was good, but the english muffin was nothing like my Thomas' sourdough.
