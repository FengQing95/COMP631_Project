Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This place is amazing! The pancakes are truly to die for and the fresh fruit on top makes them really stand out from the rest. My boyfriend got the biscuits and gravy and they were the best I've ever had. The only down fall to this place is the wait. The first time we waited an hour to be seated and the second time we waited an hour and a half. Is it worth the wait? I think so, I will be returning here again!
