The Purple Pig////A couple of other top plates in addition to my favorite roasted bone marrow and the milk braised pork shoulder are the pig's ears with crispy kale - to die for!! and weirdly enough, the Proschetta panini - a weird selection when you have so many other choices but this is one of the best paninis I've ever had and honestly does not cost much more than regular paninis you can get at cafes. It's huge too!
