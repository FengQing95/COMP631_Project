Smoque BBQ////Smoque continues to be one of my favorite places for BBQ in Chicago. The beef brisket is so tender and falovorful. They smoke their meat for 12 hours on Monday so they are closed, but this is a guarantee it will be all you hoped for. For sides my top choices would be the mac and cheese and the cornbread. They give you a large portion of fries as a side option too. Although, they wouldn't be my first choice as a side. Don't skip this place, it's worth the trip.
