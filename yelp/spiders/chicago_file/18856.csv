Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friend and I where visiting Chicago, decided to go here after reading reviews online. The restaurant is run like a spaghetti factory style chain. You are rushed through with no personalized service. The staff where nice but seemed over worked. They where constantly running around not spending any time with you. Revived the calamari which was excellent. The pizza however took 45 min to arrive as advertised. While eating the pizza a sharp shard of metal was found In the pizza the waitress and manager both knew where it came from. They both seemed as if this has happened before. The manager did offer to take of the food but not the drinks that was a total of $14. Luckily no one digested the metal shards from the cleaning brush. Totally disappointed with this restaurant.
