Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////One thing I do not love about Lou Malnati's is the wait, but they do have their system down. They allow you to order your pizza while you wait, and we got some drinks at the (crowded) bar and were able to make due for the 40 minutes or so until our names were called. Once we sat our pizza was already on its way. Pretty impressive!
