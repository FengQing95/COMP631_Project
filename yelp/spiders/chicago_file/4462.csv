The Purple Pig////Amazing food! It's tapas style and meant to share. I don't think they take reservations but we went Sunday ~2pm and there were a few available tables. We had the crispy pig ears which was absolutely delicious! The peppers provided a nice tangy acid that complemented the fried ears. It pretty much tasted like crispy bits of meat! Delicious! We also had the cauliflower with cornichons which was probably the best tasting cauliflower I've ever had! The octopus was good, delicious, soft but maybe a bit oily from the sauce. The gnocchi was amazing. This was not vegetarian since the rag√∫ sauce had meat in it. This was rich and delicious. To end, we had the loukem...... not sure how to spell it but the Greek fried dough with honey. Best donuts. Better than beignets ;-)
