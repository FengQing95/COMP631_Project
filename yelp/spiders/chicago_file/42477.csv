Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place used to get an F and was full of Schaumburg a few years ago, but I think they upgraded their chef. Lots of good stuff: steak skewers great, shaved Brussels sprout salad, and very nice octopus dish moves this place up to a 4. Calamari is standard but aioli is good. Chicken thigh bites are avg. Cocktail list is copy cat and the drinks are only ok, but sangria is good. Worth revisiting if you gave up like us a few years ago!
