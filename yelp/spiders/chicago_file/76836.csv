Little Goat Diner////My second dessert was really to appease my curiosity - the smoked pork and toffee crunch shake. OH DEAR LORD. The savoriness of bacon with the sweet crunch of toffee. It certainly wasn't a "light" milkshake (does that even exist??) but it was so amazingly delectable, my tastebuds went wild!
