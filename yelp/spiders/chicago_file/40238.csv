Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were looking for a steakhouse while visiting in Chicago and this one was recommended a lot. We booked a reservation for a Thursday night and I am glad we did because it was pretty packed! It was really dark but the interior was nicely decorated. The restaurant had good music and a cool vibe to it.
