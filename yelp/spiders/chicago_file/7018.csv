Art Institute of Chicago////I'm a bandwagoner when it comes to art. This place was rated America's no. 1 art museum, so had to check it out. A handful of famous paintings hang on their walls and that's pretty much all I came for. Admission was a bit pricey just for that, but it's an ideal indoor activity for them freezing cold days for tourists. After, I recommend crossing the bridge from the Art Institute to Millennium Park - great for photo opps.
