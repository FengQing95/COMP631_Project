Little Goat Diner////Overall, I liked the meal, but wasn't leaving with the feeling of "OMG. I MUST GO BACK!" I'm not sure why I haven't jumped on the Izard train yet like the rest of Chicago has... I think the food here - and at the Girl and the Goat - are solid, but I think the hype holds more weight than the food.
