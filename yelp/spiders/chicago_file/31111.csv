Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////All in all, super glad we tried this place after the disaster of a pizza we had at Giordano's. However, although Lou's restored our faith with the Chicago deep dish, I do believe NY style pizza is still where it's at. But ya know, if this is your first time in Chicago, do check it out!
