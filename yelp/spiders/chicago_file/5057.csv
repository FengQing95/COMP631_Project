The Purple Pig////Seating ranges from private tables to communal to barside and standing room only. Theme is Mediterranean tapas but some of the seafood, pork and beef dishes are full-sized entrees. Price points are more than fair and reasonable for the quality. Perfect location to impress a date or friends visiting from out of town.
