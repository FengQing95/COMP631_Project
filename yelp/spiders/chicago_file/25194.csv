Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The malnati was great!!! Their sausage was rly yummy. The Lou was a little soggier for our tastes. We also made the mistake of ordering a Large and a Medium for just 4 ppl when the menu says it would normally feed 7 ppl. I was with pretty hungry young adult men so they were able to finish the majority though.
