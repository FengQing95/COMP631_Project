Smoque BBQ////Amazing customer service on top of the amazing BBQ! I ordered a half rack of ribs, and went to pick it up, after my number was called. The employee behind the counter said "that half rack is small, hold on a minute." I thought it looked great, but she insisted and proceeded to give me another half rack for free to make up for it. Cornbread and brisket chili were great too!
