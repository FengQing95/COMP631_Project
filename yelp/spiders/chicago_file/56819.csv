Smoque BBQ////Holy Smoques. Been here many many times and it never disappoints. Most recently, my lunch partner and I shared a brisket platter with cornbread, mac & cheese, a 1/2 and 1/2 sammich, fries, cole slaw, and peach cobbler. Everything was delectable.  The peach cobbler is silly good, like about to have a crisis good.  All of the meat we had (which was a lot) was tender and juicy.
