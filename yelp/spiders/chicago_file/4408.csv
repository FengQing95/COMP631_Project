The Purple Pig////Would I return here? Probably not. Again, the food is good but I just have no desire to try and fight for a table when I'm in town visiting friends or for a conference. Service was great, even for the busy Saturday night and our waiter had some great choices for bourbon for me and was spot on when I told him what I like. Just -2 stars for the whole system.
