Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We went there on a late Saturday night while we were visiting Chicago. There were lots of ppl waiting for tables, and we waited about 30 mins. We ordered a cheese pizza, a the "Lou" pizza, and a Malnati Salad. The pizzas were good, and the Malnati salad was the best salad I have ever had. I miss it so much. I wish I could order a delivery to LA now!
