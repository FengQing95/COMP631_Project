Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's makes what is in my opinion the best pizza on the planet, and that goes for all of their locations. Fantastic buttery crust, rich, flavorful cheese, and zesty, spicy pepperoni and sausage, thick and chunky tomato sauce, perfection. This is the best Chicago deep dish around, even beating Gino's and Pizzeria Uno.
