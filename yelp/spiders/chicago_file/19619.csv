Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were expecting an hour wait but when it grew longer, I was on the verge of angry.  Our waitress was sweet but slow.   BUT then we ate the salad and pizza.  We got the Lou Malnati salad, and the two main deep dish pizzas.  So delicious.  Worth the wait?  I'm glad we got it before we left Chicago but next time, I would go at an off time.
