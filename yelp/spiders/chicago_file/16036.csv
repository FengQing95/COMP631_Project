Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here on a Saturday afternoon with the BF at around 1:45 pm, and was told it would be about a 45 min wait. We put in our orders for our pizza first - we got a medium Chicago Classic. After we got seated, our server recommended the stuffed spinach bread and so we ordered that too. Our pizza and bread didn't take long to arrive.
