Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I loved the speakeasy rustic atmosphere, but it's dimly lit, so we were trying to figure out where we were allowed to sit to wait as the bar was completely full. I talked to the hostess 10 min later and told her we were going to the bar downstairs so we weren't in people's way, but made it clear that we were antsy to eat, explaining we had plans in an hour. As we are sitting at a table in the downstairs (which is so dark, you can barely see 5 feet in front of you) I hear a scuffle from the table in the entryway between a 4 top and the hostess. There were some terse words exchanged about them being told they could sit there and the hostess telling them they had to move. I offered our table b/c I knew by this point we should be seated any minute (it had been 20 min). I am pretty sure had we not offered up that table, they would have stormed out, it wasn't pleasant as I could hear them 10 ft away and they were pissed (and in their 40's, not some young kids).
