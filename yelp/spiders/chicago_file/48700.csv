Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went here for our pre-valentine meal (2/13) and ordered the pitzoks (spelling) platter along with 2 tapas and a paella for each of us. We also ordered half a pitcher of the passion fruit sangria. I enjoyed the sangria and the pitzoks. The octopus tapas was overcooked and tasted like charcoal. The paella was not any better. I have gotten better paella at a mom and pop place in south florida. It was disappointing with all the positive reviews this place gets, you would think you don't have to eat charcoal octopus. Heck, it probably would taste better uncooked.
