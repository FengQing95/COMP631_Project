Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great cheese, great, crusts, great quality.  Every time I've been to Chicago I come down here for some personal pans.  The cheese is fresh and the crust is buttery and crispy with that distinct after taste.  Yet, and this is important, there is NO TRASHY feeling at the end of the meal like you'd get at Pizza Hut or most other pizza joints.  This is tasty, deep dish pizza ,made without so much of that commonly found grease on other crusts out there.
