Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We are visiting Chicago from Florida so of course we had to try deep dish pizza. Everyone recommended this place. I had the Lou's (which is the veggie option) & my husband had the classic (it was the meat option). The personal is really small. You'd need two of those to be satisfied. So we ordered a small on top of that. I gotta say, I had my hopes up too high because this tasted like ordinary pizza. Nothing special about deep dish pizza. At least not at this place. And we paid $70!
