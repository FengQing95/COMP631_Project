Art Institute of Chicago////Opted to check this place out and got to the building at 5pm to find a VERY long line. Waited about 15mins to get in. With the decent weather, it was not bad, however, I would say, get there at 4:45 so you have less time waiting and more time inside...why? This place is HUGE!
