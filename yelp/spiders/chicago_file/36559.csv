Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came here on a Sunday evening with a party of 4 to celebrate a friend's birthday. I have never been here before, but I've heard great things. And sometimes when you hear great things about a place, it's hard for it to live up to your expectations, but this was absolutely not the case here.
