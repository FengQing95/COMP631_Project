Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Love Lou,  this was a much better experience for Chicago pizza than our last restaurant.  The server have the timing down to a science, expect to wait and hour for seating and another 40 minutes for your pre ordered pizza.   Try the Lou salad, best salad we have had in a long time.
