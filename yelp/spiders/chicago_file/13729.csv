Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you're into stuffed pizza, this is worth checking into. Service was friendly and professional, the waiting time was about what we expected (given that stuffed pizza is basically a casserole made from scratch) and there's a generous enough selection of beers and drinks. My only complaint is that the pizza is a tad too saucy.
