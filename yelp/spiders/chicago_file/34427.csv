Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Appetizers- We got 6 oysters, 3 from the West and 3 from the East. First timer on the oysters. I have to say these things had no taste. Nothing on the Bavette's I just think oysters have no taste. We also got the salmon tare tare. This was incredible except a bit too much sour cream on my plate.
