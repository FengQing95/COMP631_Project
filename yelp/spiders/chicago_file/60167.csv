Smoque BBQ////Smoque is the best barbeque you'll find in Chicago. The brisket is the most popular item on the menu. I got the chopped brisket sandwich - with a side of fries. My girlfriend had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. I will give them credit for having a "taste" option on the menu where you can order a small portion of basically any menu item... which i did take advantage of. I also tried the St. Louis ribs which in my opinion was best thing I tried. Â
