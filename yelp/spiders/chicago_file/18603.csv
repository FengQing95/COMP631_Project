Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As for the famous Malnati Chicago Classic, it was pretty damn yummy but I wish there were other veggies such as green peppers to balance out the layers of tomatos and sausages which does get overwhelming after the first slice. My favorite part was the crust which was perfectly crunch and not too doughy, and so delicious that you could probably munch on it as a snack later.
