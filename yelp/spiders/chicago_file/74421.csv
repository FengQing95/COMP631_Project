Little Goat Diner////So, I get it. I wouldn't risk serving someone with a serious food allergy something that could make her very sick. But why do they have a gluten free menu if they can't serve the items to people who aren't choosing to be gluten free, but HAVE to be? Seems a little silly. My friend had been so excited to peruse an entire menu of stuff she COULD eat, and then to find out she couldn't, was a bummer. Friend ordered a gluten free corned beef hash and we waited for our food.
