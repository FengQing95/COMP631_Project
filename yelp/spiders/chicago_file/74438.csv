Little Goat Diner////We arrived at peak brunch hours on a Sunday and requested a table for 3. They said it would be a 30 to 45 minutes wait and we decided to wait. We waited in the "Little Goat Bakery" that is attached to the diner. We ordered a couple of coffees and a croissant as we waited. It was some real good coffee! The wait was really long. I have usually seen that they exaggerate the wait time so as to not disappoint you, but this was a different case altogether. We got a table after a long wait of 50 minutes. I just wanted some food at that point.
