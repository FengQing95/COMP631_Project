The Purple Pig////This is like the staple dish for this restaurant! I was actually disappointed it came last as we pretty much stuffed our bellies eating all the other dishes. The meat is really tender and flavourful - if you focus hard enough you can taste a milky flavour braised in the meat. Absolutely love the mashed potatoes - definitely goes well with the sauce.
