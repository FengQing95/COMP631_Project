Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our waitress, Marilyn was exceptionally nice. She understood when ordering, we would appreciate it if only two dishes came out and not all at once. She timed it so there was a heavy dish paired up with a lighter dish. Our dishes complimented each other in taste and they didn't fight against each other. The only time we were stumped was when it came time for desserts. I opted for a chocolate truffle cake. It comes with kuluha and a dollop of whipped cream. I can hear my waist line popping. So worth it. I'll run on the treadmill for an extra hour. Yes, it's that incredible.
