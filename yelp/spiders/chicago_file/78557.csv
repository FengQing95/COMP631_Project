Little Goat Diner////- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it's not much of a burrito and the flavors didn't go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces.
