Art Institute of Chicago////This is a pretty big museum, with almost every conceivable kind of art from all over the world, but is not so overwhelming that it can't be tackled in a few hours. It's also great for those on a budget because it is free on Thursday's from 5:00-8:00, but be prepared for bigger crowds.
