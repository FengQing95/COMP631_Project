Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you're a deep dish person or visiting chicago this place is great Â they know how to get you in and out which is great because it is a busy tourist area. If you are craving deep dish without the wait though I would recommend getting a frozen one from the take out area and make it at home!!
