Little Goat Diner////Bryan - I'm very sorry that you weren't more impressed with your visit. We want to go above and beyond for our guests and I apologize that your meal didn't come out at once. I will share this review with our team, and I hope you consider dining with us again so we can deliver a five-star experience. If you would like to discuss anything further, please reach out to Tina Majethia, Assistant Director of Operations, at (312) 888-3455. Thank you.
