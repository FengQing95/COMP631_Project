Smoque BBQ////I haven eaten at Smoques on occasion and it is always consistent. The food and service is quick! I always get the pull pork and my boyfriend gets the slice brisket. He gotten the chopped briskey previous, but thought it was on the dryer side. I suggested the slice brisket and it made a big difference.
