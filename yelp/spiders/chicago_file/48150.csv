Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place has gone down significantly since it opened i found a piece of glass in my onion jam and didnt even get a apology just oh we will take it off the bill. Really it was glass i almost ate!!! I ordered the calimari it was over fried like eating rubber bands.i would not spend any money here again.
