Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can't say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing.
