Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We ordered a 6oz fillet mignon with truffle macaroni and cheese and cream corn as the side and a crab cake salad. Since we had a hotdog for Portillo around 4pm, what we ordered became a little too much that we couldn't order dessert. Luckily the server still gave my husband an ice cream with a sparkling candle for his birthday!
