Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Mike, our server was phenomenal.  He was super friendly and gave us the best recommendations.   We preordered our pizza after we put our names down for a table.  We waited for about 30 mins.  Not long after we got seated, our orders came out.  The deep dish pizza had a good crust and the filling had just the right amount of cheese.   The Italian roast beef sandwich was juicy.  The restaurant was run very efficiently and staff was friendly.  I would definitely be back next time I'm in town.
