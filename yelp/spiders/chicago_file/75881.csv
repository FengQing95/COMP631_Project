Little Goat Diner////Cute ambiance.  Love their shirts.  Was sad they didn't have a larger selection for me to buy one!  Great service!  Our waitress took the time to explain how Little Goat came about and about the 3 restaurant total (The Girls and the Goat and Duck Duck Goat).  Such a lovely experience for our first visit to Chicago!
