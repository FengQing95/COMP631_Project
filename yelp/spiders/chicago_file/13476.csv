Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm normally not a deep dish pizza fan (okay, get over it), but this place rocked! The menu told you how much food was enough for how many people, and it was right. Before I get into all the details, their beer selection was pretty bad. They had six beers, all bottles, and nothing too great.
