Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Like any great restaurant, management was visible and Aime stopped by our table several times to see how things were going.  We were running out of words to describe to her how delightful our evening was!  The only thing I forgot to do was to check out the lower level "parlor" as I wanted to see the entire restaurant but that will have to wait until the next time.
