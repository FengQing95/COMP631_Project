Smoque BBQ////It's difficult for me to give and fast food bbq joint high ratings since I grew up on the south side and my uncle made the best bbq ever so my standards are extremely high. Â Also, my granny makes awesome cobbler and my aunt makes the best mac & cheese hands down so compared to these, Smoque is OK.
