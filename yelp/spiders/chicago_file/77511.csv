Little Goat Diner////For my main course I went with the Sloppy Goat. This is one incredible sandwich. The bread is perfect: fluffy on the inside, crunchy on the outside, and toasted to golden perfection. The goat itself is drenched in a sauce that I don't know how to describe besides TASTY. The real star of this dish is the rosemary slaw. This may seem crazy, but believe me. This slaw completes the dish. I want to eat this slaw every day. It's crunchy, creamy, refreshing. I had to leave a few bites just to take home so I can eat it again.
