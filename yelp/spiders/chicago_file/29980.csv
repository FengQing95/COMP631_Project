Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Food: We were a party of three so we ordered a small size of the Malnati pizza (served 2 ppl) and one serving on the Lou Pizza. The pizza was delicious (you eat this type of pizza with forks, something I had no clue about!). Pizza was cheesy and flavor. Pizza serving was also more than enough.
