Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The ambience is very interesting. They have nooks and corners everywhere and low lit areas alongside bright natural light section. It's perfect for date nights and also just hanging out with friends. Not overly noisy nor eerie quiet. They start you off with nice warm crusty and soft bread with Spanish EVO. So yum that I could easily be full by that. Or server was very warm and asked us before stating how much time we have and he will work our order accordingly. Of course we didn't want to rush in such a pretty place!
