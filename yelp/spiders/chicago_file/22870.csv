Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So our last night in Chicago and my friend texted me saying we have to try their deep dish pizza. Initially we were planning to go to Giordano's but they closed at 10pm. Not giving up, we continued our search and realized that Lou Malnati's was opened till 11. It was already 10:15pm, and we were pretty far so I called to placed an order for take out (it takes 30 mins to make) and then we ran through Chicago getting lost multiple times before we finally made it at 11:15pm. Fortunately, they still let us in to pick up our pizza and we left happy. Â With regards to the pizza itself, I ordered the small 10" Lou deep dish, but that was enough to feed all three of us. It was very heavy and filling.
