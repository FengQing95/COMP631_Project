Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I have only gotten food poisoning one other time in my life, and that restaurant (a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant) mailed me a $50 gift certificate. I still go to that restaurant this day because of their customer service. Â Because Bavette's is a high-end restaurant, I would've expected their customer service to be on par with that... But it was not. Instead, they implied that it couldn't have been food poisoning because they hadn't gotten any other complaints.
