Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The real Chicago deep dish. Great. The long wait is worth it. There are other deep dish hot spots in Chicago, but the sauce and the crust at Lou's is truly great.  They can handle two or twenty very efficiently.  We got two individual size for lunch and brought two slices back to the hotel.  The use of texting for the waitlist and to order was fun and efficient.
