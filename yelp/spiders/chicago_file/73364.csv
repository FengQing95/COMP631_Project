Little Goat Diner////Okay, I HIGHLY recommend the Tiramisu Shake. It's reallllly good. I ordered a cup, a friend of mine tried it, and the next thing you know, she ordered one too. It is rich with a great balance of sweetness and creaminess. You may wonder what that scoop of white cream is. I THINK it is a heavily whipped cream but it does taste buttery. So maybe a combination of both whip cream and butter? The mushroom burger was a really great dish as well. Patty was juicy and the bun was crispy. Don't be afraid to hold the burger with both your hands and dig in! As for the Los Drowned sammie, the beef was really juicy as well. It came with this sauce. I highly recommend pouring it to the beef. My friend decided to dip the sammie to the sauce, so it got pretty messy.
