Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This establishment houses my favorite Pancakes in all of Chicago. I'm not usually one who enjoys waiting over an hour to be seated but for those pancakes I'd wait for three hours. I ordered the Denver skillet and the pancakes come with the eggs. The portion sizes are huge! I could barely finish half of my order but took every last piece to-go and ate it after napping off my food-induced coma. Don't skip the fresh squeezed orange juice either. I don't drink alcohol, if I did i'm sure the mimosas are fabulous!
