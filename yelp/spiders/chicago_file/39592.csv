Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Frankly, playing loud filthy music while charging what they do is inexcusable, but the on-duty manager's snotty attitude made it worse. The guy even seemed to hint that I was lying by claiming 'we have a vendor that provides our music, they screen it for offensive content.' Â Uh, no they don't, pal. I know what I heard, as does my wife. We were the last of about four customers left down in the Parlor when the trash came on, there was zero noise outside of the clearly audible music.
