Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friend and I came to Chicago for the first time and wanted to try the infamous deep dish Chicago pizza of course! The host said it would be a 30-40min wait, so we decided to take it to go. We had no idea in general it takes about 45mins-1hr for the pizza to cook, but when we did finally get it, very delicious. I recommend coming for a sit down rather than a take out because you'll be waiting a bit. They do take your name and number though so you could walk around until they call you letting know your food is ready.
