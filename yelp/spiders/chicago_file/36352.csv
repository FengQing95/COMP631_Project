Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food itself for the most part was good, the steaks definitely shine more. Started with salmon tartare, nothing to write home about served with creme freiche. Very light dish, the salmon shines but not much wow factor. The peppered duck and goat cheese terrine was another bland and boring dish. It was tasty but again boring. It was served with mango jam that definitely lit up the terrine. The crab cakes ($21) were fantastic. Unfortunately, it's just one big crab cake served with a dill type aioli super delicious and garlicky. Definitely a stand out from the appetizers. As for the meat, all of them were cooked perfectly, the way we wanted too but could have used a bit more seasoning. I ordered the 20oz dry aged prime rib eye ($60). Very tender and marbled piece of meat dry aged for 50 days. My dad ordered the lamb t bone ($38) which he absolutely enjoyed. All of the steaks are served with bernaise sauce, not my favorite here. My boyfriend ordered the regular rib eye with a side of bone marrow. It paired very well with the steak but again steak was under seasoned. As a side, we ordered the mashed potatoes ($10). We were able to share it between four people, no problem. I loooove potatoes.. Can't say these appealed to me much. Maybe they added too much cream but something was off. As for desert, the chocolate cream pie ($10) really hit the spot at the end of our meal. Truly delicious and actually light!
