Smoque BBQ////Second: the main dishes.  The ribs were okay.  They were very smokey and flavorful however the tenderness was off.  For both slabs we found that the ribs were somewhat tender but not exactly to our liking.  Basically not "fall off the bone" tender, unfortunately this is a huge pitfall for us.  The brisket was NOT "to die for" like many other reviewers claimed.  The texture was very grainy/rough like and was uncomfortable for me to eat.
