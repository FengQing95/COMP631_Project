Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Holy cats!!! I am shocked at the value/ food quality and service. Everything was amazing and very affordable. Between the 2 of us we ordered 5-6 tapas. We were very satisfied and it came out to be $15 a person!! Wow! The service was quick and friendly. The food was delicious! Highly recommend!
