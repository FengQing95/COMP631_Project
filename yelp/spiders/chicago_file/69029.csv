Little Goat Diner////Well, I know my beer, and I was pretty certain you will not find a stout that you can see right through, but fine, I drank it anyway. Â At the end of the meal I showed him on my phone that I was correct, and at that point he apologized, and then brought me a free sample of the beer I had actually ordered with the check. So, that was a nice touch that saved him from a less than enthusiastic tip.
