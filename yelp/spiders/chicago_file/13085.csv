Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Probably the best thing in the entire world to eat when you've spent the last 26 hours on Amtrak and have only ingested a corn muffin and four granola bars in that time span. I pretty much kicked in the door at 11am, demanded a big ass pizza and Malnati's was happy to oblige.
