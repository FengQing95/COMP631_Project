Smoque BBQ////the service was amazing. Super nice gentlemen (manager i think) was walking around seating people/taking orders. helped us get through so easily. from ordering, finding somewhere to sit, bringing us whatever we need (although it is not a restaurant environment it's self serve) he made the process super easy!
