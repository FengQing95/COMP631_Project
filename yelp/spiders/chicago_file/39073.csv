Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Best steak I've had in my life. Same for the salad. Great dark wood vibe, charming service, and, very important, GOOD MUSIC. So many places like this have a Frank Sinatra compilation on repeat. Not here. There was traditional jazz album playing when we walked in. Followed by an entire Red Garland album. Then another 50s jazz album, which I forget because I was intoxicated by the steak and booze. (Mostly the steak.) Reserve early and often.
