Art Institute of Chicago////I did find the older part of the museum a little stuffy and boring, but we found some interesting stuff in there as well.  Only complaint about the museum overall is that the air circulation / conditioning needs some work.  We found some areas to be really hot and stale and then other parts were very cool (almost cold).
