Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As for the pizza, obviously you gotta go for the butter crust upgrade.  We ordered a large plain cheese, and a large deluxe (I think that's what it was called).  Normally, plain cheese pizzas bore me, but not this one.  Fantastic sauce and really good cheese.  I'm not sure if they use a blend of cheeses here or what, but it was outstanding, and was surprisingly not heavy or oily.  Despite being a butter crust, deep dish pie, this was one of the lighter tasting pizzas I've ever eaten.
