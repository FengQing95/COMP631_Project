Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////In my opinion this is the best steak in Chicago without comparison. The restaurant is small but comfortable with a French flare to the styling. The food is over the top and decadent in all ways. I have yet to find something on their menu I wasn't impressed with. Their bar selections are top notch as well.
