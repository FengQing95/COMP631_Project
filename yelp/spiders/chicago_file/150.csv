Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I think the best time to come here is on a weekday rather than a weekend. A friend and I had breakfast here this morning and just had the best one in a while! There was no waiting in line, our waitress was very attentive, and the food, besides being very pleasing to the eye and in generous portions, tasted very good as well! Their coffee comes from local Intelligencia, which my friend has taken into great liking.
