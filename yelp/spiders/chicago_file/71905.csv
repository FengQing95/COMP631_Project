Little Goat Diner////Fun spot! Came here to have a couple drinks and really enjoyed my experience at the back bar. The bartender was very knowledgeable and made a mean cocktail (I got the pear one - don't remember the full name but it was goooood). She also recommended the fish torta dish which was an EXPLOSION of fun flavors. Recommend!
