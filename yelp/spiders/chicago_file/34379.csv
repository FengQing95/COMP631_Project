Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We've been here twice so far and haven't been let down even in the slightest! The first time we split the large steak among 2 people and it was amazing. Perfectly cooked and amazing seasonings. We were celebrating a birthday and were surprised to have some chocolate icecream brought out to us at the end of the meal, which was probably some of the best chocolate icecream I've ever had and I'm not even a fan of chocolate icecream!
