Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There are different sizes for the pizza. You can get your own personal one or get a small for 2, medium for 3, large for 4, etc. We decided to share the Malnati Chicago Classic which comes with lots of cheese, tomato sauce, and sausage and of course that famous deep dish style. They do have a large selection of beer so we ordered one each. The pizza took about 30 minutes to arrive, but we didn't mind.
