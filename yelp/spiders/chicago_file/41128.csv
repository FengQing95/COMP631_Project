Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////then, my bf snuck away and made sure the waiter knew we were celebrating, and asked for one of the desserts. our (very knowledgable) waiter brought out the one dessert with a candle in it, and then 3 other desserts, all on the house! very, very kind, and DELICIOUS! the carmelized banana dessert was 100% the best in my mind. the rest of my table liked the butterscotch cream.
