Art Institute of Chicago////Now to the artwork. The quality of the artwork here is hit or miss. There are some great masterpieces and a bunch of lousy ones. Too much open space with TOO little artwork just doesn't work well unless you're going for a minimalist gallery look. The building and name, "The Art Institute of Chicago" over promises, yet is extremely underwhelming.
