Art Institute of Chicago////Thought sure I had reviewed this in the past, but if not here goes. This is one of the jewels in downtown Chicago. For more than a century the Art Institute has brought a touch of class and beauty to the area. The grounds around the Institute are beautiful, but inside the building is where it really shines.
