Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////this is such a great atmosphere for dining with a group of people! you've gotta try their sangrias, the seafood is always a hit... i'm not too crazy about paella in general (not enough flavor). Â even the fried hot peppers were interesting... and of course the deserts were yummy :)
