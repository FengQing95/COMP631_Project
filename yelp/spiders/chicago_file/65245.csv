Smoque BBQ////Fall off the bone, perfectly charred St. Louis riiiiibs, woooooooo!! I just had the best slab of ribs here at Chicago's own Smoque BBQ. Until now my local hometown buzz and neds reigned supreme...but this rich, juicy, tender, Smokey charred meat marshmallows in my mouth goodness Â the brisket here is amazing too, I would recommend the sliced brisket and the St. Louis ribs over the baby back ribs.
