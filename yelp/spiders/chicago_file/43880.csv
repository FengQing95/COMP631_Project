Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We were a party of 6 adults and 2 children on a very busy Saturday night. We had a reservation but they were running 25 mins late. We didn't kick up a fuss and waited at the bar. What followed was spectacular service, beautifully flavored food and free dessert!!! Yes they said dessert was on the house for making us wait that long.
