Art Institute of Chicago////Much like the other museums in the city, The Art Institute offers Chicago residents some opportunities to visit for free.  Currently, they offer free admission on the first and second Wednesday of every month.  However, it is always a good idea to check on their website to find out when the free days are, as they have changed over the years.   Also, they will occasionally have an entire free week or even a free month (yes, it has happened), so it never hurts to visit their website for the most up to date information.
