Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Honestly, you cannot oversell this place.  The atmosphere, service, drinks, and food were all exceptional.  We ordered the wedge salad with thick bacon as an appetizer and split the delmonico strip steak (mid-rare).  The blue cheese dressing was excellent and the bacon was unlike any we've ever tasted before.  The steak was perfectly seasoned and seared on the outside while tender and juicy on the inside.  Absolute perfection.  I also had a baked sweet potato with butter and brown sugar that was so good it tasted more like a desert than a side dish.
