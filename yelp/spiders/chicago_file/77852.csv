Little Goat Diner////All in all, I would definitely go back and try some of the same and new dishes when back in the Chicago area. Such a creative menu (those desserts going by to other tables looked amazing). I loved the little goat touches, especially the coffee mug. I couldn't resist buying it in the cafe next store. Thanks Chef Stephanie and team for such an amazing meal!
