Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Speaking as a true Chicago gal that loves her deep dish, Lou Malnati's can suck it! If you want real Chicago deep dish go to Pequod's pizza down on Clybourn. The crust is buttery and crunchy and the suace is divine! Lou Malnati's has soggy crust and the pizza suave taste like SpaghettiOs suace. Make sure when you got to Pequod's tell'em I sent you and order a sausage and onion pie!
