Little Goat Diner////Had birthday brunch! This has been added to my 'Must Have' list for my Chicago trips.  The wait was about 30min without a reservation on a Friday afternoon.  It was well worth the wait. I got the French toast, it had a over easy egg in the center with chopped fried chicken.  It was soooo good, however I would recommend getting the BBQ maple syrup on the side, its thin and caused the other slice to get soggy.  My best friend ordered the shrimp and grits, OMG, the best I've ever had.  Everything was fresh and full of flavor.  Going back before heading back to AZ!
