Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love Caf√©-Ba-Ba-Reeba. It has a great menu and such a vibrant atmosphere. I've come here a number of times with rather large groups and still had great service. The dates, baked goat cheese, spicy potatoes, and beef tenderloin are some of my favorites. The sangria is great too - I'd recommend the standard red or white over the flavored versions.
