Little Goat Diner////I started with the soup of the day, which was a butternut squash.  It was fantastic.  My mom had a taste and said it might be the best soup she's ever hard.  For my meal, I had a steak sandwich (I cannot remember the cutsie name).  I liked it a lot but not 5-stars a lot.  Something about one of the textures in it was strange and there were a lot of flavors, which was a bit overwhelming.  Honestly though, the soup was 5-stars on its own, so I am landing on 4 stars with a lot of plans to go back and try new things.  Everyone else's meal looked great, and it's so reasonably priced for food of that calibur.
