Little Goat Diner////I had the American Burger and it was delicious!! The flavor profile of this was so cohesive and just succulent to perfectly explain it, haha! Our server was excellent and her attire and attitude gave off very calm and almost rockabilly. I think you must get a reservation just to simply have a set time because I've heard they get super busy. Perfect for family dinners, first dates, eating alone.
