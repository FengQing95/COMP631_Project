Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The "Lou" was what I opted for, a whimsical affair featuring spinach mix, mushrooms and sliced roma tomatoes covered with blended Mozzarella, Romano and Cheddar cheeses on a thick, yet flaky garlic "Buttercrust". This Pizza is very good. No, scratch that... it is excellent. A perfect cheese to tomato ratio and the crust is doughy in the inside but does not overwhelm the other flavors. The meats follow through in the finish along with a hard hit of Garlic. One piece had me feeling pretty full but I went all in on a second slice since we simply do not have pies like these out west and I walked out feeling like the Michelin man.
