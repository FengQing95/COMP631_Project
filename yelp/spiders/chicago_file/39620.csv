Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////But, we really came for the MEAT. The steak were cooked to perfection, tender and juicy. I can honestly say I can pass on the Bone Marrow though. The sides were delicious. You definitely don't have to get 2 side dishes, but try 1 at least. Service was great. The waitress was very nice! I don't think service would ever be a problem here!
