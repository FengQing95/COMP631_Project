Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the wings and some soda to start.  The guy was awesome and brought out a pitcher of soda for us to share.  The wings were wonderful... perfectly cooked and flavored!  We ordered 2 pizzas--a sausage and pepperoni for the group and a personal cheese for me (I don't like toppings on pizza.  shoot me)  The pizza was sooooooooo good.  The crust was perfectly cooked and it had just the right amount of sauce.
