Little Goat Diner////After loving our dining experience at Girl and the Goat and hearing good things about Little Goat Diner we decided to try LGD for brunch. We couldn't get reservations for our large party so initially we came on a Friday, but after being quoted a wait time of 60 minutes we decided to go down the street instead of waiting for our table. Come to find out later, that it was ready just 3 minutes later. So we decided to try again Saturday morning knowing the wait time would probably be longer. We were right, they quoted us an hour to 90 minutes for our party of 9. However, 25 minutes later we got the text that our table was ready! We were happily surprised to see they pad their wait times so drastically, but it's well worth putting your name down and hanging out in the area.
