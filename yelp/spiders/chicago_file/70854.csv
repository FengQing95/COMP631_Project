Little Goat Diner////Meh: My bull's eye french toast was just alright. The fried chicken on top was delicious, but the underlying brioche and eggs were pretty whatever. I would've liked more syrup, heavier seasoning, or something to make it more than a mound of bland-ish dough. My friend had the boar sloppy joe and we both agreed that it was too salty. It was good, but there wasn't anything special about it. I think he was trying to relive his experience at Longman & Eagle with the sloppy joe, and it didn't happen.
