Art Institute of Chicago////Then enters me- into the Art Institute on one of their infamous free Thursdays. Im immediately excited with the ancient Indian and Asian art that first greets me. Then the Greek, Roman and Egyptian make the Archaeologist in me all a-twitter. The Americas section is where I start to realize the Art Institute is truly something special -- Mochi pottery (from ancient Peru) is some of the most rare and prized items in the cultural world -- and there are like 8-9 of them in ~perfect~ condition. I then move onto the Modern Art wing and start getting slammed with paintings and artists i've only ever experienced in books. From the infamous to masters -- im being confronted and genuinely moved by what I am seeing in front of me. O'Keefe, Bacon, Pollack, Polke, Van Gogh, Matisse, Picasso, Dali, a random Bottecelli Â -- one after another after another and my anxiety starts to creep up. I then make it to the star visiting exhibit -- Caravaggio and the sheer SIZE of the paintings, let alone the beauty is simply awesome (in the real meaning of the word, ala awe inspiring). I bat back some tears and somehow stumble into a room full of Renoir's when I just have to sit down because I am overwhelmed, dizzy, and full on crying now. I can't help it -- im blissed out to be experiencing all this at once but I look more like a sad drunk and am worried I am going to be asked to leave. I've seen the majority of the museum at this point, so I somehow manage to find myself outside -- calling my mother and practically sobbing as I tell her about it all.
