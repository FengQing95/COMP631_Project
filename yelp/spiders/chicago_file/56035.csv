Smoque BBQ////We decided on a 1/2 x 1/2 of the baby back and the st louis.  I am not sure the difference but the longer chewier ones I liked better.  The only thing I would knock on the ribs is that the flavor of smoke for me was slightly more intense than I liked but I would positively make the drive to come here just for the food.
