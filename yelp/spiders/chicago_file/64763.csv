Smoque BBQ////MEAT: I have really only had sliced brisket at both places. Green Street's, while very tasty, is not as good as Smoque's. Why? The fat. Smoque's brisket (at least the slices I got) was laced with amazing, melt-in-your-mouth smoked fat. If I could, I'd order their fat trimmings and spread it on a cracker or eat it with a spoon. Don't go to Smoque if you think that saturated fat is really bad for you.
