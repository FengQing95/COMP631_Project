Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////If I could I would give this place 6.5 stars. I loved it THAT much! We came in with a party of 7 and our reservations were for 6 - they dont have a lot of seating that accomadates 7 ppl. But they made it work for us and we only waited for 20 minutes! Unbelievable service!!! We got seated downstairs in a corner booth. The lighting was very very dim and we had to use a flashlight app on our iphones to read the menu! But it was coool :) we also flashed our waitress and she thought it was funny ha!
