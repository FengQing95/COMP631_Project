Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been here a handful of times for dinner with a group of friends and it never disappoints! Its lively, the services is great, and the food is probably some of the best Tapas this Chicagoan is going to get. Its sad and true. We recently went back for Brunch and it was perfect! Chorizo, potatoes, Olives, and Mimosa = Happiness. I can't wait to go back again.
