Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is an unbelievable place. The staff is friendly, and the collections are, literally, world class. Every room will make you say "Oh, I've seen that painting before!", and the special exhibitions are really outstanding. As of writing this review I have just been to see the exhibitions on Greek, Roman, and Byzantine art, and Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity. Both were incredibly informative, and awe inspiring. This is one of my favorite places to take both Chicago natives (I'm always surprised at how many people have never been!) and tourists alike.
