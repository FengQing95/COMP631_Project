Little Goat Diner////And like Girl and the Goat, I felt very rushed.  I'd taken three bites of my dish and was literally holding the fork in my hand when asked if I needed it "taken out of my way." I realize y'all are busy, but can I enjoy my breakfast for at least 10 minutes before being hustled along.
