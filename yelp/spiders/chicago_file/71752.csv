Little Goat Diner////Absolutely amazing place. To be honest, the wait at 10:45am on a Sunday morning was over an hour, so don't come hungry, or else you'll leave mad. They have an excellent system where you can put your name down and they will text you when your table is ready. There is even a little link in the text that will say home many parties are ahead of you. Excellent planning strategy, especially since La Columbe coffee is two blocks down the street. Grab a coffee and wait it out since there's no room to wait inside.
