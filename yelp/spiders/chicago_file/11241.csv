Art Institute of Chicago////I've been here three or four times and I really love this place.  Despite multiple trips, I still haven't seen everything there is to see here.  Because of the size of the museum, it's pretty much impossible to see everything in one day.  Plus they have some other great exhibits and programs you can check out.
