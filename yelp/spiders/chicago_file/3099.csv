The Purple Pig////I FINALLY made it and I did not have a wait. I know. I get it. I was just as shocked as you probably are right now. The potential waiting time has discouraged me time after time. Because while I heard nothing but great things, I struggled to bring myself to make the trek and potentially wait to eat in a city with good restaurants every 40 feet. But I packed my patience and did not need it.
