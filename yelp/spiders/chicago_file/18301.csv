Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's as we regulars call it is the best Pizza in town, bar none.  The thick crust is out of this world.  I eat a mostly vegan diet, but have to splurge on Lou's every few months.  The salads are really good as well.  I go to the original Lincolnwood location which is really fun with lots of Chicago sports memorabilia throughout.  They now have on-line ordering for take out which is great.  Love Lou's!! Been going there forever and will continue to go for as long as I'm around the planet.
