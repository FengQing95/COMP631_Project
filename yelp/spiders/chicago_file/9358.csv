Art Institute of Chicago////The one hour suggested "must sees" on the back of the brochure are a fairly accurate way to gauge how to spend your time if you only have a short amount of it. They've got Van Goghs, Monets, and all that nice impressionist stuff on the second floor, that's probably what was most popular. I'd recommend dedicating more time to this facility as it's somewhat overwhelming if you're just looking to browse.
