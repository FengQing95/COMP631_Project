Little Goat Diner////All I can say is WOW! We stumbled upon this hidden gem while looking for a place to eat. We walked in with no reservations and had a seat within 30 minutes. It was a Sunday and was very busy so I recommend reservations on any day if you want fast seating. I had a reasonably priced pint of beer for around $6 and the Goat Almighty burger for $20. Everything is a la cart, so we ordered the pork belly fries to share. I wish the waitress would have warned me how big my burger was going to be. It was HUUUGE! It was layered as a normal burger patty, a bunch of roast beef and topped with chicks of goat meat. All of the meat was delicious and very tender. The bun was amazing and all I can say is that it defeated me. I didn't even make it half way through before I gave up. The fries were great with chucks of pork belly mixed with the potatoes. Before we came here, we did not realize that the executive owner was the winner of Top Chef on TV. Now I can understand why. This lady has some talent and I feel honored and very lucky to have experienced her skills. If I lived in Chicago, I would be a regular here. Highly, highly recommend. P.s. The service was fantastic also, but overshadowed by the quality of the food.
