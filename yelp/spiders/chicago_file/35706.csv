Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place can be a great place to attend with a significant other. We told the waiter we were her for an anniversary celebration. Our food took very long to come out. Our waiter wasn't attentive and we had to return the dish to be redone because it was cooked incorrectly. It would have been nice to be offer champagne in celebration of the anniversary like other reviews mentioned. We didn't get much of a great experience. I personally wouldn't go back. They turned up the music louder half way into dinner. It was too loud to have a normal voice conversation. The price wasn't worth the experience.
