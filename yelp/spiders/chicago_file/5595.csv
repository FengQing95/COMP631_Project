The Purple Pig////I went here three years ago and gave it 5 stars. I was raving so much to my bf about how great this restaurant is and finally I set a reservation for us on Saturday at 630. I ordered exactly what I did three years ago cause even to this day I remembered how delicious each dish was. Dishes ordered were the bone marrow, octopus, pork shoulder. My bf ordered the a pasta dish. Each of the orders were a complete let down. The marrow was extremely small that we could only use two pieces of bread. The octopus was covered in lemon and you could not taste much else. The pork should which I was extremely excited for since it was the most tender piece of meat I've ever had, was a bit dry and lack luster. The pasta was good but nothing to write home about. Although, the drink I ordered was delish, it was a mezcal drink but I can't remember the name. I also ordered the espresso with ice cream but it didn't come out til my bf was done with his drink, I almost forgot about it. Are server was great though. Unfortunately though we both left dissatisfied and disappointed. We even heard a guest as we were leaving that said it didn't taste as good as last time she came, not sure what she was eating though. Sucks after talking it up so much.. most likely will not be back.
