Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After recently relocating to Chicago, I have tried 3 pizza places thus far: Pizzanos, Giordanos, and Lou Mlannati's.  I would rate Lou's third out of the three.  I got there around 5 on a weekend, and beat the rush!  There was a 5 minute wait for two..not bad for a vastly yelp-rated pizzeria.
