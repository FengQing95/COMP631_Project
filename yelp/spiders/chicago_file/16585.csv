Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Here's a tip that I know from serving hundreds of these pies.  If you call ahead, Lou's will pre-cook your pizza for you and take it out of the oven with 10 minutes to go so that it can be finished when you arrive.  The only way that this makes sense is if you call in 20 minutes before you get there.  That way, the pizza is already cooking but doesn't get pulled or if it does, doesn't get pulled for too long.  Otherwise, the pizza's just not the same. DON'T DO IT! (sorry Lou's)
