Smoque BBQ////"Best bbq I've ever had" says my boyfriend. He also points out that he hasn't tried any bbq food outside Kentucky and Illinois. I'm not a big fan of bbq so I went with him and got simple chicken which was good but I know their highly rated because of their bbq. So I'm basing my rating mainly on my boyfriends experience. He loves the brisket, pulled pork, and the ribs are the best! The ribs are his favorite he could eat all the ribs in the restaurant. He also loves the corn bread, baked beans, and bbq's sauce. He pretty much said everything on the menu was amazing.
