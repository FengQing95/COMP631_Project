Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have found deep dish heaven in the form of Lou Malnati's! This is my second visit to Chicago and now I can finally compare two Chicago-style deep dish pizzas and Lou's definitely kicks Giordano's in the behind. After my daylong flight and four hour wait at the airport, I was looking forward for some good Chicago-style pizza. I was not disappointed at all and actually pleasantly surprised by how much I liked Lou's.
