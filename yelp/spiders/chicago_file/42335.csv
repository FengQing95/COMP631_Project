Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tasty Passion fruit Sangria, the tapas, eh, not so much. I feel their food is very inconsistent and sometimes a little over done, especially the meats. The bacon wrapped dates are delicious, but I like going to restraunts where most of the food is good, and Im not limited to the same few things or the usual.
