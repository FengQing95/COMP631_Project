Smoque BBQ////Long overdue review!!! Let me start by saying I don't eat very much meat, but when it comes to Smoque.....my mouth waters and I CRAVE it regularly!! My first of several visits to Smoque was sometime last winter, when it was freezing cold and miserable.  Delicious, creamy, homemade mac n' cheese, tender sliced brisket, and their absolutely AMAZING peach cobbler is just the kind of comfort food I needed to lift my spirits.
