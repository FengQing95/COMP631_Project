Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It seems like everyone that goes to this place, esp on a weekend, are celebrating something.  From bachlorette parties to birthdays this place is swamped with large parties.  Not a good place for a romantic date since it's so loud in there, but fun for a night out with friends.
