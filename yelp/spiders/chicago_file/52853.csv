Smoque BBQ////Both my wife and I had the brisket.  The brisket was moist and tender.  The sauce was outstanding.  Perfection is the best way to describe it.  My sides were the natural cut french fries and corn bread.  Both were outstanding!  My wife's sides were the mac and cheese and peach cobbler.  Those too were fantastic.
