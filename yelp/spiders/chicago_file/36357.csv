Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is the perfect spot for a special date, an intimate dinner with family or friends, or a just quick cocktail before a night on the town.  With a drink menu that includes sparkling cocktails (M Laurent is my fav!), old fashioneds (go with the hardy vs cognac), thoughtful classics (thoroughly enjoyed Bavette's Punch), perfect wines (the Sangiovese pairs perfect with the short rib stroganoff), and an expansive selection of scotch, whiskey, and bourbon, they've got a little something for everyone!  If you can't choose, their fantastic bartenders can undoubtedly steer you in the right direction!
