The Purple Pig////We ordered the broccoli dish, the roasted beets with goat cheese, fried manchego, pork shoulder and the chicken kebab thighs. Loved it all. Â It was very filling. The plates are small plates intended for sharing but 2-3 per person is plenty. Anything more is going to be left behind or taken to go. There's little chance you can eat much more than that. Trust me, I tried. It's practically impossible.
