Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We arrived early for our reservation so we went downstairs to the lounge Â to start off our dinner with some cocktails. The vibe is so chill and you are still able to have a conversation over the music. When our table was ready someone came down and got us and waited patiently while we closed out our tabs and then carried my drink for me while we were led upstairs.
