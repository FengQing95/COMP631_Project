Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ok, so me and my boyfriend came to chicago for my birthday and he's never been before and neither of us has had deep dish pizza. So i took to facebook for suggestions "Lou Malnatis or Giordano's" (majority of people on Facebook said Giordanos). But i trusted my gut and some locals opinions and went to Lou's. And boy am i glad!!! (I am also writing this review after having Giordano's the next day to compare fairly). We ordered the chicago original i think what its called - just cheese, sauce, sausage and of course on their butter crust that is to die for. It is the perfect balance of the ratios of cheese sauce and crust. We even said to each other that we didnt need to try anything else to know which was best. The small size was perfect for me and my boyfriend who definitely likes to eat. They also have great drinks as well. From the pictures and the "cheese pull" videos I've seen, Giordano's does look like it would be better than Lou's... but it definitely isnt!!! I cant wait to visit Chicago again to come back. You can also order these frozen online and get them shipped to you, which I may do!
