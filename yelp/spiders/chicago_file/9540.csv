Art Institute of Chicago////Then again, you also can't spell the word "fart" without "art."  And, since I'm more likely to discuss that second word than most words that would denote that I was the first like "star chart," "Descartes," or "Sartre" (it rhymes, sort of), I had never visited this museum in 10 years of living in Chicago.  But I'm glad I finally did since this places is every bit as great for people who discuss "go-carts" as those who can dissect "play parts."
