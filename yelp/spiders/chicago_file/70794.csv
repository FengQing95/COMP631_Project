Little Goat Diner////So the good ... the service was nice enough. Our water glasses and coffee mugs never went empty. The bread basket we started with was amazing. So soft and buttery. And the butter to go with the bread was perfect as well. Slightly sweetened so you don't need jam. Also the cinnamon roll was also amazing. It had cream cheese frosting, which is always a hit in my book. We got one for a table of 4, and we were fighting over the last scrapes of it. I also got a glass of orange juice.
