Little Goat Diner////Hospitality: This was a big part of my 5 stars. As I explained our plight and failed quest of AC to the hostess she laughed and said it would be also a 3 hour wait. As soon as she saw our shocked faces she quickly laughed and quipped that she'll have us seated in 5 minutes. From there she was very diligent in explaining the menu to us and making sure we redeemed our night. Very nice and explained the quirkyness of the diner.
