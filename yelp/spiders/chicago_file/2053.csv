Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Discovered this gem while visiting Chicago last weekend . Â We couldn't decide between the egg dishes and signature pancake .The waitress was nice enough to offer a smaller version of the pancakes. Not to be missed. Looks like a dessert but not gooey sweet at all. There may be a long wait but it's well worth it!
