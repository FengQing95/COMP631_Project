Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Absolutely terrible pizza! This was my first time in Chicago and we had Giordanos, Gino's and Lou Malnati's. If you're going to a pizza place, the only one worth going to is Giordano's. At Lou Malnati's we ordered a deep dish and calamari. There was no flavor to the pizza whatsoever.
