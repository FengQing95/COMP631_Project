Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's all about the dang buttercrust here.  It's flavorful, flaky, and really satisfying.  I prefer the original sausage deep dish (dish deep sausage heh..) vs The Lou, but both were pretty good.  In my opinion, the cheese, sausage patty, and tomato sauce are a step up from Pizzeria Uno.  If I ever come back to Chicago, Lou's would definitely be a place I would revisit.
