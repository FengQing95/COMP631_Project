Smoque BBQ////I love this place!!!  I saw this resturant/dinner on Food network and found it to be interesting.  Apparently these guys went around the counrty and found BBQ that was good, then they brought it back to Chicago.  I've had Texas BBQ and it's pretty much the same, but they have more types of BBQ.
