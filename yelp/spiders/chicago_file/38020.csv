Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Maybe the best steak I've ever had. Bone in filet with the Gorgonzola topping. It was amazing. I plan to go back and try it without the topping because the steak was amazing. Threw in the thick cut bacon and it was tremendous. It's thick cut bacon... how could you go wrong? Â Had some Brussels sprouts to make the whole meal health and they were very well seasoned. They had a little mustard taste that was superb. I went without a reservation and since the place doesn't have a TV the crowd is smaller during major sporting events. Drink - I went with a dirty martini and blue cheese olives. Had a vodka gimlet as well. Both drinks were great. This place definitely lives up to the billing.
