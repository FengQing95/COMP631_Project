Smoque BBQ////Went there after seeing the show & cannot say I was disappointed.  The food is absolutely tasty, the portions are very generous & the prices are decent for BBQ.  Have tried the brisket, baby back ribs, St. Louis Ribs, and the pulled pork--all of it is great.  Although I have come to the conclusion that I prefer baby back ribs to the St. Louis kind.  All meals come with sides & corn bread (YUM!).  The sides are delicious from the mac n cheese to the fries.  If you are watching what you eat--you may want to consider eating somewhere else--this is not light by any means.
