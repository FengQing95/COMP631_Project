Smoque BBQ////Everyone loves this place and it is warranted. After eating here since it first opened I finally got a 1/2 rack of the St. Louis style ribs and was not disappointed. The biggest tip I can give for this place is to either go at 11:30AM or 1:30PM, the seating is very tight and you need to experience the food....not be stressing over where you are going to sit. They do a very good job of getting you in and out, but even when you are eating there during the lunch rush you feel those eyes glaring at you to wolf down your meal so that they can have a place to sit. Better to go when you have a little leeway with your lunch hour and you aren't in a rush, I guarantee you will be back. Typically when you cater from there they don't have fries on the menu because they don't travel very well, but if you are close you should order the fries for sure they are amazing, and if you are eating in they are a must. It just isn't about the beef and pork people....they have amazing bbq chicken as well, so don't pass it up.
