Little Goat Diner////We went to Little Goat Diner as a party of 4 a couple weeks ago.  They had only been open for 7-10 days.  I was wowed by the interior when we walked in!  However, finding the door to the bathroom was ridiculous.  The hidden door in the wallpapered wall?  Seriously?  That's going to get old real fast.  I'm sure the servers are loving having to point it out to everyone, as it's located right by their station.  Anyways, after a 45 minute wait (we were expecting this), we were seated in a ginormous booth.  Very comfortable.  The server came over quickly and was very friendly and knowledgeable.  I had the parathas burrito (delicious!  fried naan stuffed with eggs, topped with a mild chili sauce, avocado, kidney beans, and frisée salad), my husband had the bouillabaisse, and our friends had a taco salad and the porkchop (I think).  Only a couple complaints (aside from the bathroom door): They have specialty sodas like ginger beer.  They were out of a bunch of the flavors.  Okay, fine.  But you just opened.  How can you be out of them already?  And second, we had to wait forever for a to-go milkshake to be brought to our table at the end of our meal.  They presented my friend with a milkshake with 3 inches of whipped cream on top, and then a flat lid for her to put on herself.  It ended up being quite a mess.  They need to get the domed lids like what Starbucks has for their frappuccinos.  And the servers need to put the lids on for the guests.
