Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went here for a late night dinner and wow it was packed and our server took quite long to get to our table. But once she got our orders in they just kept on coming! My personal favorite was the chicken curry salad! OMG that dish is absolutely to die for!!! Though we did wonder how Spanish the dish was.
