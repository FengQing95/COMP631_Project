The Purple Pig////I was quite surprised that we scored a table on the patio right away on Monday afternoon. I came here a few years ago when I first visited Chicago so I was excited to be back. We skipped the cured meats and pork dishes this time around since we wanted a lighter lunch but it's a must if you are a first timer. We decided on the calamari, grilled octopus, and pig's ear.
