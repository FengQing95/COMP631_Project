Little Goat Diner////Fantastic food at an affordable price and reasonable wait time. They also have a bar/bakery where you can watch them make all their baked goods which is really cool. Aside from the booze we all know and love, they also have a coffee bar. Under the bar counter top is not only coat-hangers but also outlets. Yes, you can finally plug in your phone & battery pack so you can go all night without a care in the world and your charged phone to guide you.
