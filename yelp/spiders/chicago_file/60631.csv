Smoque BBQ////During the 15 minutes I waited for my takeout order to finish, No less than 3 CPD cruisers pulled up entirely separate of each other, EACH cop picking up separate orders (for at least 6 people).  The cops didn't even know each other... If this place is good for 3x6=18 cops on a late Saturday afternoon, you know it's something special.  And there were about 20-25 other diners there at the time, so it's not by any stretch just a CPD haven.
