Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had a long layover in Chicago and had enough time to hop on a train, grab some deep dish pizza in downtown Chicago, and get back to the airport. We got to Lou Malnati's around 2:00 p.m. and the restaurant had only 3 other tables with customers. We were seated immediately because it was so empty.
