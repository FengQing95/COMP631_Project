Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////OK, onto my experience. The wait was ridiculously long. It's a famous place so I understand and we had 6 people so OK, I get it. But what confused me the most was them explaining we can order while we wait... But they don't actually start making it until we actually sat down and even then we have to wait for someone to confirm the order. What was the point then?? It was about an hour wait for us. Then when we got seated, waited another 5 mins for them to get us water 4/5 waters and then confirm our order. And then another hr to get the food. Hmm... If the food is good, I guess the wait is worth it.
