Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I went here for the first time last week, and it was great! We were seated downstairs, which has a speakeasy feel. Our server was very attentive and informative. We started with bone marrow, crab stuffed avocado and shrimp scampi; all were amazing and portions were a lot bigger than expected (even though our server warned us it was a lot). Ended up packing 1/2 of the apps up. I'm a pescatarian, so my only negative is that there was only one fish option (salmon), which was okay. I was expecting a nice center cut piece of fish, but it was rather small/thin and a little over cooked. My husband had a fillet, and he said it was one of the best he's ever had. Next time I'll probably just get appetizers!
