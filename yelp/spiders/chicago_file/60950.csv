Smoque BBQ////After seeing it on DDD, Smoque was one of the first places I went to after moving to Chicago a few years ago.  I was not disappointed!  Smoque has the best BBQ I have had in Chicago, and probably the best brisket I have ever had.  The sliced brisket with BBQ beans and mac and cheese makes an amazing meal.  Both kinds of ribs are also amazing, and the dark horse on the menu is the smoked chicken.  It is amazing.  The best part of Smoque's menu is the "add a taste" section where you can add a small portion of many of their meats to your meal.  It is a great way to try many different things.  All of the sides are incredible.
