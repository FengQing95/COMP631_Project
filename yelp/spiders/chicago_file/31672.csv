Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For anyone who wants to try Chicago pizza, this is the place to go. Just be prepared for a bit of a wait. I do wish the pizzas came out a little faster but I understand that they make them fresh so it does take some time. This probably isn't the best place to go if you just want a quick bite or if you're on a time crunch...you should probably plan for at least an hour and a half here (probably 2-2.5 hours on weekends and during peak hours)
