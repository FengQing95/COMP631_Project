Little Goat Diner////Lastly, the vegan bahn mi burger - the patty was filling and delicious, and I think they made them out of potatoes. It had a texture of a creamy mashed potato inside which we really enjoyed about this vegan burger. Unfortunately, it seems like they didn't put a lot of effort on the "bahn mi" part. It lacked flavor, and I didn't really get the flavor of a Vietnamese sandwich. It's like they just added to veggies just for the presentation or for the look of a bahn mi sandwich. I think they should add more tangy/sweetness to the burger. Other than that, the burger was great!
