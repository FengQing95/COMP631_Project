Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Their food is pretty damn good. The only reason I'm giving in 4 stars is because around lunch time the wait time is ridiculous and deters me from going sometimes. However, their food definitely makes up for it. Their strawberry nutella crepes are TO DIE FOR. I'm not one for sweets but it's very good. Their blackened chicken sandwich is delicious as are their various skillets. Their Oreo smoothie is definitely worth it as well. It is reasonably priced and I'm never let down when I eat there. If you're ever downtown you should check it out if you're in the mood for a good brunch experience.
