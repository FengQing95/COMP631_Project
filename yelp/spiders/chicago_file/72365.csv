Little Goat Diner////The atmosphere is that of an old American diner, which we enjoyed, but the noise level was so loud, we found it difficult to speak with the other members of our party. Service, on the other hand, was fantastic. Both people who helped us were polite, friendly, knew the menu, and we're just good at their jobs.
