Little Goat Diner////I had the cuban breakfast sandwich, which was the special of the day. I wasn't blown away by it, but it was pretty delicious. Enough so that I want to come back and try more items. There are a lot of options for breakfast, and time and care is put into preparing your meal, so everything looks fancy when it comes out. For that reason, it's a little pricey for a breakfast diner, so I think of this place as more of a special occasion breakfast than anything else.
