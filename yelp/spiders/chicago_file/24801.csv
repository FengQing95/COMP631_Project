Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Service was fine, but we were a little letdown by the feel of this place. Didn't have that established, old school pizza place feel - felt more like a newer chain. The pizza wasn't an event, so I guess we should have gone somewhere with more history. Beer selection was underwhelming, but that's expected.
