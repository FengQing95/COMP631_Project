Little Goat Diner////This Little Pig Went to China - Way too salty, too much going on.  I tried to avoid the sauce as much as possible and the food was still oversalted and overseasoned.  The pepper in the dish was paralyzingly numb.  The food could have been served without any sauce and it would have been fine.
