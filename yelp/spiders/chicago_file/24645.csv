Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The line was kind of crazy but it's all about planning. We wait about 20 mins to get our name on the list then went straight to a bar close by so that we won't waste our time Â Got a text in the middle of drinking (it was fairly fast), so we finished and rushed back (should have planned it better lol). We barely made it but were managed to get a table after another 10 mins wait, which I am pretty happy about. If there is one tip I would give is to order your deep dish ahead of time. It takes around 40 mins to get baked in the oven, but it was worth the wait. We ordered half "Lou" with extra pepperoni (Lou by itself is vegetarian) and half Malnati Chicago Classic. It came in less deep than I pictured in my mind haha but it was delicious. The crust was well seasoned and crispy but the toppings were fresh and juicy. I liked the Lou better cause it's more refreshing and well-balanced with the protein, and bf liked the meaty one because of course. Service was great. Very attentive even during the waiting time. I would like to go back and try out their cheese deep dish.
