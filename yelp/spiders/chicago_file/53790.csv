Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here twice - once a while back for a friend's birthday and once recently for dinner before heading to the movies and loved it both times! My friend said a friend of hers isn't a fan of Ba-Ba-Reeba because the tapas aren't authentic, but I say screw authenticity when the food is just so darn tasty! It's a really long wait to get a table without a reservation on the weekend, so I recommend making one in advance or sitting at the bar if your party is small.
