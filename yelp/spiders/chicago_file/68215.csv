Little Goat Diner////There were so many vegetarian options, I was really pleased. And breakfast all day! i felt like I had so many options to choose from. We got the veggie burger with mushroom toppings, side of hashbrowns, and choco taco sundae. The burger was tasty, I loved the toppings. Probably one of the best I've ever had. We also loved the hashbrowns (the potatoes were in spaghetti like strips). And got some of their house habanero-apricot hot sauce--yum. The sundae was good, but after trying the sour cream ice cream (almost had a cream cheese taste), it made me wish it was regular old vanilla ice cream. I must be so boring, haha!
