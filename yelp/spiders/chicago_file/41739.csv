Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Yes, it's owned by Lettuce Entertain You, which owns tons of other restaurants, but this is not a chain!  And I must say that LEYE does know what they're doing-- I've been to plenty of other tapas restaurants in the city and I haven't enjoyed the food at any as much as at Ba-Ba-Reeba.
