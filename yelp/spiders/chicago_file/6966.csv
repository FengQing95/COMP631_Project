Art Institute of Chicago////nearly every time i visit chicago, which i manage at least once annually, i visit the art institute of chicago. i skim past most of the impressionist work, making my way through the renaissance, and finally landing myself in front of the caravaggio, the father of baroque art, where i sit and stare to my heart's content.
