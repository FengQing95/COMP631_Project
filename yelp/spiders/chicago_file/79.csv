Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Here in Chicago on a quick trip from LA. Saw this on our bus tour on the weekend, came following morning that happened to be opening day. Loved it. Came the next two mornings as well. We had the Berry Bliss pancakes, pumpkin bread French toast, Los altos Benedict, loaded baked potato omlette, pot roast Benedict. Our 18mo old had eggs & side of berries two days & a PB&J the other.  All were very good. The winners were the Los Altos Benedict & Berry Bliss pancakes.  Tons of flavor! The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. it seemed to get busier each morning and they were great. We wish them well & hope to see them in LA soon!
