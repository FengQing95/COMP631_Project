Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This place is definitely a 5! We came here and there was a 45 min wait for two of us, so be prepared to wait! When we got seated I knew I immediately wanted the Mexicana skillets which I substituted the chorizo with chicken chorizo and did the over easy egg the runny egg was so delicious in the skillet. Our waiter Mike made the great suggestions of the chicken chorizo and also recommended the signature berry bliss pancakes which were honestly to die for the best ones I have had, they had this berry custard in between them which I really enjoyed not being a fan of custard. My hubby had the combination of fig and walnut multigrain and banana cream pie pancakes the suggestion was made by Mike to combine them. They were so good that you didn't even need any syrup! I definitely give this place all the stars because with the service and food it was amazing, would definitely come back and recommend to anyone! Worth the long wait!
