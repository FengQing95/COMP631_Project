Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We came at an 'off" time around 3pm but we still had around a half an hour wait.  I swear to you I would have waited 2 hours for this pizza!  We ordered The Lou and the Chicago Classic.  I LOVED The Lou!  It was so delicious with fresh spinach, tomatoes and a what I believed really cinched it in... a blend of mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese.
