Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great food one little plate at a time!  Good server but food delivery was a little sporadic - our garlic shrimp showed up as we were ordering dessert!    The potato salad and spicy potatoes were excellent as were the croquet's. Calamari had way too many tentacles for me.  Loved the paella too. mmmm
