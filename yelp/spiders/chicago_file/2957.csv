The Purple Pig////Pork shoulder - I watched the people next to us being served this. It looks so tender and tasty I had to stop my mouth from watering. When my waitress recommended it and said it was what they were known for, I knew I had to get it. The meat was so tender I could cut it with my fork. And the flavors blended nicely together.
