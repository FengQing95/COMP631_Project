The Purple Pig////Our second round of dishes started with the ricotta gnocchi. It was served with what was called "neck bone gravy". I have no idea what neck bone gravy is except that I like it. It included some type of braised meat that seemed to have broken down so much it became one with the sauce: utterly delicious. It topped the ricotta gnocchi which were the absolutely perfect velvety texture.
