The Purple Pig////-Grilled Broccoli - You can go really wrong with veggies--especially for certain restaurants to focus on meat. Not here. This was delicious and stood really well amongst the heavy protein in our meal. The garlic sauce in this was something else causing the BF to inquire if there is anyway i can recreate the dish at home.
