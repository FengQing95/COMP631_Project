Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The waitress was so helpful giving us recommendations--we tried a little bit of everything!  Goat cheese pinxtos, great!  Blue cheese wrapped tenderloins, crab and shrimp dip, grilled shrimp, beef tenderloin stuffed pepper, calamari...I don't think there was anything we didn't like.
