Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Began the night disappointed with the overall service provided. We ordered prior to being seated and did not receive confirmation of seating, so we made our way back to the hostess who informed us that there where some availability. Thereafter, our server neglected us which resulted in me having to speak to the hostess about getting service. I would have left but the food was incredible. The deep dish hit the mark and the calamari was crunchy and moist. The deep dish pizza was savory, salty, and the crust was made perfect to the crunch. I was incredibly impressed as I wanted to give this restaurant a negative rating for the service. However, Jose made up for his mistakes and picked up after realizing we were neglected.I would return even though I was shown no courtesy initially. The food speaks for itself and well worth it. Would highly recommend the deep dish pizza and calamari.
