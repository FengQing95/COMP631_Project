Little Goat Diner////Personally I went with the braised beef.  I figured that I could burn off the calories since spring is starting to peek out in Chicago and I can bike instead of CTA.  Great choice.  Dripping with delicious beef juice and some avocado to help me feel healthy.  Next time I going to try that grilled cheese though.  My lunch date had it and it looked like simple eating pleasure.
