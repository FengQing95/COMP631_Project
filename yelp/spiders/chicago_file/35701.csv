Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food:  Smoke Trout Caesar Salad is amazing.  It was originally made with whitefish, but it's still great with smoke trout.  It has crispy potatoes (or potato chips) instead of croutons, which puts this salad over the top.  The portion is huge.  I typically can't stop eating it because it's so good, which creates an issue for the rest of the meal.  Around 2013, Bavette's added Griddled Burger with fries (I add the fried egg).  The burger is very similar to Au Cheval, but Au Cheval is better.  Since I don't have to wait 2-3.5 hours at peak times, I will settle for the burger being slightly less than Au Cheval, but it's still really good.  Elote Style Corn is great and another must. My husband gets the Ribeye or NY strip, which he loves.  Other items that are good - Broiled Salmon, Fried Chicken, Shortrib Stroganoff, and Crab Cake. As much as I love Bavette's, I would skip the desserts here and go to Gilt Bar for dessert (same owner and amazing desserts: Toffee Cake with Coffee ice cream, Brownies with ice cream (ask for hot fudge), Carrot Cake (ask to have it warmed slightly with vanilla ice cream) , etc).  If you must have dessert here the Goldbrick Sundae is good.
