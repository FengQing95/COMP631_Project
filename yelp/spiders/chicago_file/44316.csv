Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I heard a lot about this place but when I went there I was not really impressed. Food is not that great neither is the service. I mean the food is okay but I did not feel like it deserved all that attention. I think it is a bit over hyped. It is a nice place to hang out with friends over a few drinks but not for a substantial meal.
