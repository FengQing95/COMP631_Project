Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Another great meal! Went to Cafe baba reeba for brunch during restaurant week. I had never been for brunch so this was a new experience. Really enjoyed everything I got from the menu. The bacon Mac and cheese and the chicken and waffle dishes were the stand outs for me. As always the passion fruit sangria was delicious. The desserts were good but not as excellent as the rest of the meal
