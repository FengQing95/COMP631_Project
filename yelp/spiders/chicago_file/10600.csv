Art Institute of Chicago////I'm originally from Chicago, now living in DC, and I've always loved this museum. I came here alone on a business trip and really enjoyed my time here. Definitely give yourself about 3 hours if you want to see everything. They have a great app that describes certain sculptures and painting and walks your through to where you need to go to see everything in time.
