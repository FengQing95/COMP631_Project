Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I wanted to try this place so bad as I have heard that it's the best in town and I have to say that it is not what I expected.  My expectations may have been too high.  We were not happy with the service either, it was very busy and I'm sure that's the reason it was not up to par.  Every time we have tried to get into a Lou's (which is only 2 times) it's always been super busy which is obviously a great sign that the food is off the charts, but it just wasn't for us.  The wings were overcooked and we ordered a small deep dish pizza and I'm not normally one to complain about wait times but this one was pushing and hour and fifteen minutes which to us is a long time for a small.  The appetizer came out in 10 minutes which surprised us, but as I said before it was overcooked and the time between the 2 dishes was a little too much.  Maybe we should come back when we don't expect it to be as busy.
