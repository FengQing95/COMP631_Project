Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We moved to another booth in the Parlor.  We ordered a couple cocktails, and then the manager, Kaitlin, stopped by again to ensure all was right in our world.  Such a doll! Personable and so kind! We chatted about life and laughed a bunch! I mentioned I wrote a glowing Yelp review back in 2012. I looked it up on my phone and she chuckled, stating they discussed this review in a staff pre-shift meeting. Wow...I think I blushed a little! ;)
