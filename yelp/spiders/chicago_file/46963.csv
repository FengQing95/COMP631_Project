Smoque BBQ////Smoque BBQ knows what is going on.  I am originally from Texas, and in Texas we know BBQ!  Smoque is the closest thing up north that we have found.  The Brisket falls apart the way it should, the Texas style sausage is nice and peppered and has that ever important snap.  This gives me a little taste of home and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants some BBQ that is not just St. Louis style ribs.  Oh and by the way the Mac and Cheese is ridiculous, let alone the hand cut fresh fries and awesome peach cobbler!
