Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm craving that pizza as I write this review. The deep dish pizza we had was absolutely delicious. I liked that the crust at the bottom wasn't soaked with grease as it has been at some other places. The pizza arrived steaming hot and delicious. Â We took some slices home and they heated up very well!
