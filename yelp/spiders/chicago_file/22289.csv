Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm a big fan of deep dish pizza and have frequented a few in the area.  Lou's just didn't do it for me. We had the classic and it was a little bland for my liking. Very crowded so clearly it's popular. My stomach was upset after  (TMI sorry) so that definitely knocked off a star. Bartender was quick and overall service is good.
