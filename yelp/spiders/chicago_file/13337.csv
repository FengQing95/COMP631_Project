Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Swoon! My absolute FAVORITE Chicago deep-dish pizza. From the crust to the sauce, we are talking sheer perfection. The lunch special can't be beat - a personal pizza, soup or salad, and a big soft drink for around 6 bucks. Lunch in River North for 6 bucks? Who knew it could be Lou? And you're in and out with time to spare... and you'll need it to waddle back to the office with a full belly.
