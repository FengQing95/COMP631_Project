Little Goat Diner////There is a lot that can be said of Little Goat. The food is a unique blend of Southern comfort food and Southeast Asian cuisine. It is presented beautifully and tastes even better then it looks. The one downside is the place fills up fast. Be sure to make a reservation or there will be a long wait. So if you live in Chicago or are just visiting, Little Goat is a must.
