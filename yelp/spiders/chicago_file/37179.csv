Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////If you weren't already aware, Bavette's has a "corkage fee" - the fist glass from whatever bottle of wine you bring must be sent to another patron in the restaurant! We sent ours a few tables over to a woman celebrating her 50th and shared a toast with the group. Over the course of the night, we were lucky enough to receive thee glasses back from various groups around the room.
