Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I hadn't eaten here in several years, but decided to eat here on a recent visit to Chicago.  It was not at all as good as I remembered.  The sangria was okay, but I wouldn't order it again.  And I love sangria.  It just wasn't as good as I remembered it.  My spicy potatoes and brussel sprout dishes were fine, but my friend had the paella and said it was definitely not very good.  We gave the leftovers to the cabbie.  Service was very slow as well.  So, overall, too bad we wasted a dinner on this place.
