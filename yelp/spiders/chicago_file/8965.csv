Art Institute of Chicago////Loved it. I especially enjoyed the contemporary art section cuz they had a rich set of artworks from variety of backgrounds. I visited on Monday so not a lot of visitors were there... I even got to hang around Andy Warhol's marilyn munroe alone for like... 5 minutes ( which usually doesnt happen in crowdy museums right?).
