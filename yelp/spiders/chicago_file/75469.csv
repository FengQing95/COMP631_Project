Little Goat Diner////But the Choco taco. Only disappointment is it is more of a sundae with chocolate covered tortilla chips placed in it. But wow was it good. Really just wanted the same thing as a 7/11 Choco taco but with better, fresher ingredients. However this was delicious and a great dessert. Perfect size for 2 people to split.
