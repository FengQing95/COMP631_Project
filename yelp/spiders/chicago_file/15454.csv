Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A solid deep dish place. We ordered the "Lou" and the Malnati Chicago Classic. The Lou was our personal favorite but both were quite good. The buttercrust is excellent and I think makes the pizza in many ways. It's worth noting that the personal-sized pizzas are not very big; a reasonably hungry person could definitely handle a small by themselves.
