Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've waited YEARS to come to this place, as I could never snag a reservation before 9pm (there was the occasional 530 slot, but that's too early for dinner, and after 9 is too late unless I'm drinking heavily.) Thanks to the good Lord, a spot opened up @ 8pm on a Saturday night...I snagged it without hesitation.
