Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My wife (a true New Yorker) had trouble making this adjustment, so she wasn't super amused by this Chicago treat. I, on the other hand, found it quite delicious, although the crust was definitely a bit too hard. What I've been told by a couple of Chicago buddies is that when you order the personal sized pizza, the crust tends to be a bit more firm. I was able to confirm this at two other places after this one, where we got the sharing-sized pizzas.
