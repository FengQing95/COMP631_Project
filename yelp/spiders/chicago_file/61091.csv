Smoque BBQ////I'd been looking forward to coming to Smoque for a VERY long time. The boyfriend and I came in on a Tuesday night and there was no line which was exciting. We had both anticipated a wait! The ordering process is easy and we were directed to a table right after we ordered/paid. Everything is very reasonably priced!
