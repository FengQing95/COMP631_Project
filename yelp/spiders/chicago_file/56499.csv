Smoque BBQ////Got a pulled pork sandwich, it was delicious, and I guess it's cool that the sauce is on the side, it was the highlight for me, and would taste good on anything, sweet yet tangy. Â Mac-n-cheese was good, kinda small portion, but included with the sandwich, and let's face it, I'd probably eat as much as they'd give me, so portion control is good.
