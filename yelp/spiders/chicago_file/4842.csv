The Purple Pig////The Burrata and Poached Lobster Cannoli ($19) was a great idea! I loved the creamy milky burrata in the thin crispy cannoli. I was a little disappointed that the lobster was scattered around the dish and not incorporated inside the cannoli. The poached lobster was perfectly done, but only had a few pieces.
