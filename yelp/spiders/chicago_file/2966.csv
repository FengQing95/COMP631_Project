The Purple Pig////Very delicious food. I had this place bookmarked for a month as I had planned my trip to Chicago back then (I'm from Miami) and was determined to find the best restaurants I could on this short trip. Success! Everything was great. We came on a Tuesday and the wait was short, we also got here about 35 minutes till close.
