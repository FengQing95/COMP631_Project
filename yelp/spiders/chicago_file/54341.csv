Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Fun place to go! Food and drinks are a great combo here. Lighting is intimate and fun, so don't be afraid of going with a group of friends. Went on a Thursday night, and even then it seemed like a pretty popular spot. The whole menu definitely hit the spot. I would love to come again!
