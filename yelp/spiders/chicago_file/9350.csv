Art Institute of Chicago////Figure with Meat, by Francis Bacon.  This piece seems to move a lot from one room to another in the museum--is it contemporary, is it modern, is it an abstraction, should it be displayed based on its theme or simply in the context of when it was painted?  Bacon's works are difficult to interpret within art history because nothing comes close stylistically during the years he painted.  This is a major work by Bacon, and it is amazing that the Art Institute has this specific piece.  Amazing even more that few Art Institute publications reproduce it.
