Smoque BBQ////I always wondered why was there a huge line, that goes all the way around the corner, now, I know why.  Great BBQ, but I give them only 4 stars, bc of the service.  I felt that bc of the amount of patrons, they need to be more customer service oriented, especially when you are new to the place and do not know the logistics of the ordering process.
