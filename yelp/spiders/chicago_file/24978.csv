Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Liked this place way better than Giordano's.  One thing Giordano's had going for it was that you can order your pizza as soon as you check in, so even if you wait 45 minutes, your pizza is starting to get fired up so when you sit down, you don't have to wait as long.  Giordano's has more of a "stuffed" feel to it and way cheesier, but the flavor for Lou Malnati's was better for me.
