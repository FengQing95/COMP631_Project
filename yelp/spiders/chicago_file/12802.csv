Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first deep dish pizza experience & I could not have asked for a better place! A friend recommended this chain & spoke very highly of it so I had to try of out & it did not disappoint. We ordered the classic with sausage & added pepperoni & it was delicious! The only down side for me personally was there was a bit too much cheese & I prefer more sauce then there was. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great deep dish pizza!
