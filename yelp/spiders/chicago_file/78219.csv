Little Goat Diner////I had the okonomiyaki because that it what is suggested. I would not have this again mainly because of the smell of fish. I am not much a fish person at all and the ingredient on top, bonito, flakes I believe were the cause of the smell. With that being said, I wasn't really able to enjoy this item.
