Little Goat Diner////Fries were VERY good. Chili and cheese were flavorful. Sandwich was INCREDIBLE. delicious and juicy. I was surprisingly disappointed by the little piggy that went to China. It wasn't bad, but the sauce was a too soy saucey for me. The sundae was my favorite part for sure. I'm a sucker for sweets and the brownie was warm and the pretzel ice cream was perfectly salty. Will be back!
