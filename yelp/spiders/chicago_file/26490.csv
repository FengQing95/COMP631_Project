Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Horrible service, horrible wait time. They call us to let' us know that they would be ready for us in . We come just stand around for another 45 minutes. There excuse was that the table they had for us the people hadn't left so we were stuck waiting. I guess there not military friendly DFAC wait time isn't even that long. Not worth coming to if your military please stay away from this place rude staff. Food was mediocre according to them the pizza best in Chicago ? Little Ceasers costumer service and dish pizza is extremely better than these guys. Â After being seated and having our order take 50 minutes ago, food was not ready, drinks were not taken until another 10 minutes finally our drinks were taken. Once again how is this the best in Chicago. One of the guys ordered a salad that was supposedly 5-10 minutes make took another 30 minutes. This place was is horrible, I've been all over the country and I would never recommend anyone to come here, I would strongly recommend going somewhere else. It's not the best, not worth the wait, not worth dealing with unprofessional staff, not worth the almost three hour wait time.
