Little Goat Diner////When we were done I paid for the meal with my credit card and our server came back saying the card was declined. The error message was something related to "batch full" or something along those lines. My girlfriend owns a bike shop and told him that there wasn't anything wrong with my card, it was a problem with their system and they needed to batch out all the transactions from earlier in the day. After he talked to the manager, he came back and said indeed there was a problem with their credit card machine. So we waited... he came back about 20 min later and told us it was still down so we waited some more... 20 min later he stopped by and asked if we needed anything and apologized for the wait but the machine was still down. So we waited even more... at one point my friend and I heard a waitress tell the table next to us that the machines are down and the couple got up and left. I asked my friend if they paid or if they just got a free meal? Neither of us knew for sure. That's when our waiter finally came back and said they would have to use a manual machine to run my credit card. Really?! Um, ok.
