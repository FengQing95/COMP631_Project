Art Institute of Chicago////Strange. In spite of my initial appreciation of being alone, I found myself missing someone. I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm in the middle of a mystery and its all secret. That person compared me to their favorite painting. After today, I now fully comprehend all that I had and lost.
