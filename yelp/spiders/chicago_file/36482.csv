Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Excellent service and such a gorgeous restaurant with an ambiance of another era. We commented on the wonderful sound of the music....it sounded live. The food was excellent! 3 of us dining and all were very happy with our selections...petite fillets and rib eye. Â Brussel sprout side was delicious! Nice wine list too. Well worth the wait as we made a reservation very far in advance.
