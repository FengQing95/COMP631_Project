Au Cheval////Went to Au Cheval for lunch today with some friends after hearing several recommendations from foodie friends and reading the reviews.  Had the cheeseburger and shared an order of the fries with the table.  Cheeseburger was excellent...perfectly cooked and good flavor...bun was buttery and fresh.  Fries were tasty too and served with a decent mournay sauce.  The female contigent in our party ordered the fried bologna sandwich, which she said was excellent, but too much for her to finish.  Finished things off with an order of the Black Dog gelato (1 scoop each of chocolate, malted vanilla, and peppermint) and some crispy french pastry with a creme filling (sorry, can't remember what they were calling it).  The gelato was good, although not spectacular, as I was not a fan of the malted vanilla one.  The pastry was light and crisp and quintessentially french.  My dining partners thought the pastry could have used some raspberries and more powdered sugar, but I thought it was just fine with the warm chocolate sauce.  The list of beers on tap is impressive and there is something for everyone.  Only regret is I didn't have a cappuchino with dessert.  I'll be back for dinner next time, as there are even more savories I would like to try on the dinner menu.
