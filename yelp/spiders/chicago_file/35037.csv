Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We over heard one of the bartenders recommending the Whiskey Ice Cream to the couple next to us and my bf joked that now one told him about that. He would have order it! The bartender's response: "You were told. It is writing on the menu." Ok, jacka**... our bad. Needless to say, we hope to not deal with that kind of attitude next time.
