Little Goat Diner////When we found ourselves in Chicago for few days and I had a dinner for one on my schedule, I headed to the Little Goat Diner. I know the girl and the goat is not the same as the diner but upon entering the restaurant I was told it would be a 30 minute wait, but the diner was open for seating. Diner it is, I said.
