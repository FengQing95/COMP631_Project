Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For sides, Iiiii think we got all the popular things - and they're definitely well-made but I wouldn't say they're amazing. Brussels Sprouts, corn elote, and I believe a mac and cheese... It's like, if you're looking for pure value, I would skip these fillers and go for pure meat. But if you're looking to round out your meal with flavors changes, then these 3 are solid choices.
