Smoque BBQ////Been here several times and now I can compare it to the ones in the south. Brisket lacks flavor compared to others I've had. It was tender but doesn't jump out at you when you bit into it. Not as good a cut of meat either .Baby back ribs were tough not fall off the bone like I thought and expected. Brother had St Louis ribs and they were great. Cole slaw is just OK, mac n cheese is pretty good, I like how they bake it. They would have got 4 stars.
