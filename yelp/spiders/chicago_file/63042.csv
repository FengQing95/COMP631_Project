Smoque BBQ////I would like to go again and not share.  We split the brisket, pork and chicken with a bunch of sides amongst 6 people.  I couldn't be a true pig (pun intended) so i didnt get to really test the place by giving myself a food coma.  It was definitely good.  The sauce on the side was really awesome too; vinegary which is the way i like it.
