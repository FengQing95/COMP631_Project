Little Goat Diner////Living just a couple blocks away, we love going to unique places such as this.  Unfortunately, this particular establishment started sucking right after the one hour wait for a seat at the breakfast bar.  Our waitress was the absolute worst, taking forever just to bring coffee - I made the mistake of asking for sweetener which showed up maybe a half hour later, which was how long it took to refill the coffee in the first place.  My wife ordered a mimosa which at $10, is served in a typical small diner orange juice glass and pretty much tastes like orange juice.  I ordered the corned beef hash which was a huge mistake, it's really just excessively greasy hash browns with very bland strips of corned beef ---that's it.  Our service was the worst we've had anywhere in a very long time and at $80 for breakfast - we would have been disappointed has it been $20! ...$80 was just a total slap in the face of, "here, have some crappy food and even worse service... Now pay us!"
