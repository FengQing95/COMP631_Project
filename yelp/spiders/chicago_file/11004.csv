Art Institute of Chicago////If you are a Chicago history fan, check out desk and bookshelf in the Folk Art section. It was made for the 1893 Columbian Exposition! Also, check out Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg) by Renoir. It was Bertha Palmer's favorite piece and she supposedly always kept it with her, even when she traveled.
