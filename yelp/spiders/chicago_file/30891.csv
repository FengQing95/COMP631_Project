Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our food was fantastic and actually worth the wait!! Oh...thats pains me to write that..but I truly understand the stampede at this place. We had the Malnati chicago classic (deep dish butter-crust pizza with with sausage and extra cheese), and a thin crust pepperoni pizza-both we delicious. Thank goodness I dont live out there, cause my waist line wouldn't stand a chance against those pies. BTW, this was my first chicago style pizza...and now I may have to give back my east coast NY pizza loyalty card...but we'll leave that discussion for another review.
