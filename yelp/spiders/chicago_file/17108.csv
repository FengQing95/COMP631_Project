Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you're curious about trying deep dish then by all means LMs is the way to go. It's affordable though not quick. You'll wait a minimum of 30 mins as each pie is made fresh, which is a great thing. Being from NJ/NY Area we know our pizza and deep dish is a good thing to have once in Awhile but give me a regular or thin slice any day. I do love pizza though and I sure I'll give deep dish a go at another time lol.. We got a coupon from our hotel for a free deep dish cookie dessert.. 'Twas delish though they could've kept the ice cream and tons of whip cream.. After scraping that all off I found cookie gold!!
