Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We basically order the same thing every visit - the Lou's salad, yum, and the Malnati Chicago Classic pizza, yum. Certain locations also serve calamari which is very good, but it's not available at all locations. I've never had a bad salad or pizza from any of their locations, and the service is typically friendly and decent.
