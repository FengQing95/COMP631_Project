Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here again to celebrate getting a job and I just have to say HOLY PATATAS BRAVAS!!!! They were so good that we ordered them twice. The caracoles and short ribs and mashed potatoes were still magically delicious. This time I had the foresight to look up coupons and found a text club I could sign up for, which scored me a free dessert, the caramel dulce de leche. I inhaled that deliciousness.
