Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came here for the 1st time tonight and had the best steak I have had in a long time. Had the Prime Bone In Dry Aged Ribeye - medium rare. The dry aging made the steak incredibly rich and flavorful, the texture was terrific and it was extremely tender. Clearly this was a nearly perfect cut of meat to start with and was cooked exactly perfect. Our table shared the Shrimp Cocktail, which came with nice sauces was served on a big bowl of ice and was everything that classic steakhouse starter should be. We also had the baked goat cheese which came with a wonderful garlic bread and was also top notch. The Garlic shrimp de jonghe had outstanding shimp just like the cocktail and the garlic sauce was out of this world. Overall service was transparent and great. The thick cut bacon was the only disappointment, it was decent, not nearly as good as Peter Lugers. Skip it and leave room for the amazing steak. Also, the Lemon Meringue pie we split was humongous and delicious. Overall, while pricey, the steak certainly was among the best I have ever had. I find many steak houses to be disappointing, tired and costly. I overall felt that this place delivers on the steak and exceeds expectations.
