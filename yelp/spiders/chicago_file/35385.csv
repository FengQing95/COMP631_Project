Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The service was great here and I really liked the decor of this place. The overall atmosphere gave our dinner date a real romantic feeling to it. I also loved the 1920's vibe with jazz music playing in the background and all the wait staff was dressed very appropriate to the theme.
