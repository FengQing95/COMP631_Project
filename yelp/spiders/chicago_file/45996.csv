Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been here many times and this place was the first tapas place I have ever been to.  I fell in love with sitting outside when the awning is open eating small portions of food like the tomato and goat cheese thing, the spicy potatoes and the hanging shrimp.  I would suggest you skip the paella, I did that once and it decided I would just stick with the small plates that require no planning.
