Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Steak: ERMAHGURD. Without a doubt the most perfect and delicious steak I've ever had. THE TEXTURE, Y'ALL. Buttery, salty, perfect. Be prepared to drop serious coin on this ($40-$60 per steak). Steak is the saving grace of this place. The 22-oz I got was way too big, so next time hubs and I will probably split one. It was just massive (that's what she said). Â
