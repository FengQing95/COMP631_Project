Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Happy to have found this gem in our trip to Chicago! When we went to Chi, we were expecting to have an amazing deep dish pizza anywhere we went. Sadly, we were disappointed! Almost all of the pies we had were just "okay"....except this one. We went with the barbecue wings and a medium Chicago classic. First and foremost, you need to order the WINGS... TRUST ME. The pizza was absolutely delicious, and neither of us were big sausage fans. We practically ate the pan too!
