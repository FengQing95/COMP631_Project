Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Since the pizzas take ~45 minutes to bake, they suggest you pre-order and have it ready by the time you sit. Pfft. My friend and I took this as: we're giving you ample time so you might as well order some appetizers and enjoy. We decided on the pizza chips and dip, which came with thin slabs of dough and a nice assortment of dipping sauces. My favorite was the garlicky one.
