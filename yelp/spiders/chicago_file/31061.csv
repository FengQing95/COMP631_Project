Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was visiting Chicago with my friend; we would park our car and visit the city on foot. So, we got lost going to a pizza place; when we checked to see the closest pizzeria, this one popped up. It was said to be the best pizzeria in Chicago. So my friend and I decided to check it out.
