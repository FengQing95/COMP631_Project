Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Back to the sausage--I don't mean that there were "a lot of sausage crumbles" or "a lot of sausage patties"--I mean there was a gigantic wheel of sausage that was the exact diameter of the pan and a solid quarter inch thick. Every bite had sausage. Sausage. So much sausage. Sausage surrounded by cheese, topped with sauce, wrapped up in a big crust hug.
