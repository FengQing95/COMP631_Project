Smoque BBQ////My husband introduced me to this little BBQ place a few months ago, and since then I've ordered a brisket from there for Passover and dreamed about it no less than 4 times.  Look - okay, BBQ chicken = boring, right?  WRONG!  I've never had chicken like this before in my life.  Did you know that BBQ chicken can be juicy?  Flavorful?  Sexy?  Ok, maybe not sexy.  Nevertheless, Smoque's chicken tempts me away from my usual brisket or ribs staples.  I haven't tried the Texas sausages yet, but I'm sure I'll get around to it one of these days.
