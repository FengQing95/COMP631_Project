Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I travel all the time for work. I had met my coworker at a location to do some audits, etc. Anyway, we were listening to some 90's grunge and he said, dude this is the second best song ever. To which I responded, so you have a 1st and a 3rd best song. He responded with a list. I said, there's no way I could narrow any music down to a top ten list, especially 80's music. No you know my age range. Yup, "gen z." Â So I have teased him ever since naming coffee shops, songs, restaurants, or fishing spots at the second best when they are top of any lists of favorites.
