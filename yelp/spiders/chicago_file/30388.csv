Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The best pizza in Chicagoland. No else compares. Being the best place that makes Chicago pizza, that would make this place the best in the world, being in Chicagoland. Skip the rest of the items, and go straight for the Chicago Classic. And if you're daring, try The Lou, and add it with the Malnati Salad. You'll want to look up copycat recipes for the Malnati Salad like I did soon after.
