Art Institute of Chicago////Art Institute of Chicago is one of my favorite museums.  With the modern wing and the main collection together, it's the perfect stop no matter what you prefer.  In fact, I find it much less intense than either the Met or the MOMA in NYC (arguably their direct competition?), so I find it a bit more manageable & enjoyable.
