Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was in town with family, and we wanted to get some deep dish Chicago pizza. Five of us shared one medium and one large pizza. I really enjoyed the pizza, more than I remember enjoying deep dish pizza when I've had it in other (non-Chicago) places. The upstairs dining room was a little crowded, but our waiter was very nice. He even brought us an extra house salad on the house due to a mix-up from downstairs.
