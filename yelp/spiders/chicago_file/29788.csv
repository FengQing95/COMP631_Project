Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My Uber driver recommended this place for deep dish pizza. We ordered the small deep dish pepperoni pizza which is good for 2 people. It was delicious and I was full! If you are in Chicago this is a must try place. You will need to pre-order the pizza as it takes up to an hour.
