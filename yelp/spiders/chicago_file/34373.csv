Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I think this might be my favorite steak house of all time. I love the atmosphere and the food is perfection. It's been a while since I've been so I can only say that everything we ordered was perfect. The wine, the steaks, the sides, the desserts... all at 10. I compare it to Swift & Sons and I definitely prefer Bavette's. If I compare it RPM steak - I choose Bavette's. Just sayin'.
