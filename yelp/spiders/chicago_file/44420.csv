Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was my second time visiting Ba Ba Reeba and I loved it as much as the first!  The entire vibe of the place is relaxed and indulgent.  My mother and I were going to see Deepak Chopra so I decided to take her to a delicious dinner before hand.  We started with a jarra of the Vina Pedrosal...fantastic! For food, we got the endive salad, grilled squid, and the peppers stuffed with scallops (special of the night).  All three were great.  I could have eaten 3 orders of the peppers and called it a night! We then ordered the spinach stuffed mushrooms, the lamb kabobs, the bacon wrapped dates, and what they called "happy ham" (also a special of the night).  All were delicious.  The dates are a must for me.  We decided we could have done without the ham.  Though delicious, it was too heavy and we would have rather have stuck to veggies and seafood.  Along with these, we ordered a jarra of the Ergo.  It was much like a Pinot Noir and very good.  For dessert, I ordered the dark chocolate with orange marmalade and my mom ordered the butterscotch.  Perfect ending!
