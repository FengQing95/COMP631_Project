Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We decided to try a lesser known place(for out of towners)for deep dish.  The place has an amazing feel to it. You could tell it was a favorite for the neighborhood folks.   I understand it is a pizza/Italian place, but the appetizer menu didn't offer much outside of bread-based dishes.  Tried the calamari. It was a pretty heavy breading, but cooked perfectly.  The bloody was a little sweet, so make sure to spice it up with something.  The pizza was average.  The crust was a little thin and a little dry.  I'd still come back to this place for drinks and to watch a game. It was peaceful even during the lunch rush.
