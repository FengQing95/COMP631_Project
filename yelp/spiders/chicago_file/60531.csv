Smoque BBQ////Now for those ribs.  I'm drooling right now as I write this.  Boy, Pavlov would be so proud if he could see me now!  Let me sum this up quite simply:  Go to their website and take a look at the ribs.  Yes, their ribs look like that and YES YES YES, they taste like that!  They put the sauce on the side, which I feel satisfies both sides of the barbeque dichotomy.  You who love the sauce can slather that goodness as much as you need.  You who love the bark can grab a hunk and dip to your heart's content.
