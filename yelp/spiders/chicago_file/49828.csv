Smoque BBQ////Last weekend we decided to go to Smoque. Great reviews and all the fuss around it we decided to check it out. Well, parking was a little tough and we were greeted by a very long line outside but when we finally got there we decided it was worth the wait. I had the pulled pork and my other half had ribs he usually likes them a little less chewy but overall the experience was very positive. Next time we'll go during the week to avoid the crowds and for weekends there is always take out.
