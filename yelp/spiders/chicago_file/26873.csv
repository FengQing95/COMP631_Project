Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is one of the best deep dish pizzas I have had. I visited it during the weekend, so there was a long wait. The deep dish pizza takes approximately an hour to get ready so I recommend ordering the pizza just when you enter your name in the waitlist. A must try when in Chicago downtown. A small size is enough for 2 people.
