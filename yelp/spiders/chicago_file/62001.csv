Smoque BBQ////I have been going here for years, and I'm happy to say I think Smoque has managed to get even better recently. If you're reading Yelp and trying to evaluate whether it's worth the trip, pay attention to the outstanding 4.5 star average after nearly 3,000 reviews, which tells you far more than the handful of mediocre-to-negative reviews you can find here. No restaurant has 100% perfect consistency, and Smoque is no exception, but their range is from mind-blowing to, on their worst days, simply really good, and my last several trips were all in the former category. Have I just been getting lucky lately? I don't think so; I think their consistency is improving. For those that are giving sub-par reviews here, especially if they are saying the brisket wasn't juicy, I can only say you're depriving yourself if you don't give Smoque another chance.
