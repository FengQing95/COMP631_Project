Little Goat Diner////I didn't dislike LG enough to write it off, so I'd be willing to try it for lunch or dinner to see if my opinion changes (although I wouldn't wait more then 5 minutes to get in). I wonder what the reviews would look like if people were honest with themselves and not blinded by the high-trend factor...
