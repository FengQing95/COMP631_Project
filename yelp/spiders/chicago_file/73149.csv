Little Goat Diner////Came here for the first time since they opened and still just as good as I remembered. The menu is VERY extensive and really could suit anyone's palette. It was still very busy and crowded on a Wednesday night, but we had a solid meal. Service was great and the food was awesome. We got the Machos Nachos to start and OMG. Definitely the best dish we got. I ordered the Caesar Salad and it was just okay. Not the most unique dish I've ever ordered from there, but I was in the mood for it. Next time you go in, ask to sample a few of their beers. All of their beers are on tap, so they'll let you try them before you order!
