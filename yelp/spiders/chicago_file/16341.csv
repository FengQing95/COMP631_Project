Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I wasn't a fan of the pizza either.  The crust was not good at all.  It was very bland, and lacking in flavor.  It was also extremely hard, and seemed to be sopping in butter.  The waiter told me he accidentally gave me a butter crust even though I didn't order that, but either way it would not have been good.
