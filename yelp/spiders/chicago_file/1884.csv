Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We placed our order of tiramisu pancakes for me, berry French toast and hash browns for one friend, and a type of eggs Benedict for my other friend. I'm not a huge fan of berries but even still, the French toast was great and the hash browns were AWESOME. Even after I was full, I kept sneaking bites of it from my friends' plates.
