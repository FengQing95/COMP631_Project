Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So, yes, DELISH deep dish pizza. We went to the location near DePaul and it was CROWDED! But the '30min wait' was only 15-17min and they encourage you to order while you wait so, very efficient Â  LOL. Service was very pleasant. We LOVED the family photos on the walls! Thanks
