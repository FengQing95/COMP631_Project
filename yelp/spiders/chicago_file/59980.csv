Smoque BBQ////Smoque is as close to TX Barbecue as you can get outside of Texas. Living in Austin,  I would frequent Franklin BBQ monthly, Stiles Switch weekly and sprinkle in trips to Lockhart, Louie Mueller and Snow's on a regular basis.  Smoque could hold its own with many of the Central Texas places.
