Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////So disappointing. The stellar Yelp reviews and 90-minute wait led us to believe that Wildberry would be superior to IHOP, Eggcetera, etc. I ordered the cinnamon roll pancakes, which turned out to be a stack of 6 plain pancakes, with a little cinnamon/sugar swirled on the top one, and nothing at all on the remaining 5. My friends ordered the caramel apple pecan pancakes, which were much the same. The service was quick and pleasant, but the food isn't worth a return visit.
