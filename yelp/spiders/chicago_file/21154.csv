Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were seated and the server was incredibly cheerful and friendly. She appeared to have a couple of large parties in addition to us so although the service wasn't lightning fast, it was definitely fast enough given how busy she was. She took our drink orders, it took some time to get our beer because they were changing the kegs, which was poor timing but had nothing to do with the service of the restaurant. However, the food took a very long time to come out, which was odd to me seeing they took our order about 40 minutes before we were even seated to *avoid* the food taking too long. And when it came out, it was lukewarm. For a pizza that doughy, we both agreed it lacked flavor. I wouldn't say it was worth the wait.
