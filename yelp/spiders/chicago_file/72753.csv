Little Goat Diner////i love the diner vibe not to mention the staff is amazing! Waitress gave great recommendations and offered awesome suggestions of drinks to pair with the meals.  Had the seared scallops and shares the cheesy hash and both were amazing.  would definitely go again to try the breakfast options.
