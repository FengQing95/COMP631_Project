Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The sangrias and dessert selection are also a great way to start and end the night. The sangrias could be a little stronger but that's my preference. The flan and chocolate mousse are perfection and highly recommended. Absolutely love this place and would come back every time I'm in Chicago.
