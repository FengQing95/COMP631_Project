Art Institute of Chicago////Lovely museum. I came here by myself while waiting for a friend, and blown away by the amount of content. They are open late on Thursdays (until 8p) and the price isn't too bad if you are a student. The cashier adds a $1 for the coat check when you buy the ticket, so no need to carry cash. Obvi no food inside.
