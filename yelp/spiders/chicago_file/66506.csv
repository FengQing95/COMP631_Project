Little Goat Diner////Amazing. I am vegetarian and it had a great selection of food. SO TASTY. Very unique combinations. Service was fine. Veggy burger was delicious and the tempura mashed potatoes were a really cool side. Had the miso bloddy mary, awesome. Lived up to the hype. Went on a weekday so didn't have to wait.
