Smoque BBQ////I had the Brisket platter with slaw, baked beans, and fries.  Hands down, the best brisket I've ever had.  If I had to pick my favorite part of the meal I would have to say the BBQ baked beans...they were unreal.  Huge smokey chunks of brisket could be found in almost every bite of the beans.
