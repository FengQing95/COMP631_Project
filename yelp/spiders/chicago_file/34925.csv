Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My boyfriend and I have been trying to come here for months now and finally came out on a Tuesday. Although we had reservations, the place did not seem too packed. Immediately upon arrival, we entered a dim room that seemed to be only lit by candles...talk about romantic! The hostess was very welcoming and all the workers were super friendly and on top of their job. Our waitress was very knowledgable on the menu and very attentive. We started off with the foie gras and both agreed it was pretty good, but the highlight of it was the blackberry jam. For our entrees, I ordered the duchess cut filet with a side of fries and my boyfriend ordered the chicago cut. I absolutely LOVED my steak. Hands down, the best steak I ever had. I made quite the perfect choice ordering a blue cheese topping. My boyfriend loved his ribeye and said the best part of it, despite the phenomenal steak, was the bearnaise sauce. Another highlight was the fries! Hot and crispy to perfection. The side of sauce was delicious although I do not know what it was exactly. Overall the portions left us way to stuffed to even consider dessert! Although arguably the best steak house downtown, you definitely don't get the pretentious feel that many of the other steak greats strive for! Fantastic meal, fantastic ambience, and fantastic staff! If you get the chance to try Bavettes it's a must!
