Little Goat Diner////We shared the sides of brussel sprouts and broccoli, which were amazing.  For dinner, he had the goat korean burger, and I had the veggie burger All American style.  I tried a bite of the goat burger and it was delightful -- very moist and good flavor.  My All American was basically a veggie Big Mac.  Just so you know, the burgers come as-is on the plate -- no sides unless you order them.  We got french fries to share.  Yum.
