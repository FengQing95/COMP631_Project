Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After a dreadful experience with Gino's East, we decided to give Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza a try.  I was happy to receive a pizza that was properly cooked and arrived hot.  I don't know why people rave about this pizza, though, as it reminded all of us of Pizza Hut pizza with a lot more sauce and a lot less cheese.
