Little Goat Diner////My husband and I tried Little Goat for the first time this week, and it was completely delightful.  It's a really pretty space, nice and airy.  We went on a Monday morning, and it wasn't crowded.  My husband had a the french toast and waffles - completely amazing.  Nice thick piece of french toast, with crispy chicken bites.  I had their version of the breakfast burrito, made with Indian flat bread, and filled with goat cheese and sunny side up eggs.   Loved it!  I would love to go back and order it again immediately.
