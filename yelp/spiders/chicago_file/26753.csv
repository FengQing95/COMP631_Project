Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was excellent the service not attentive and somewhat lack luster. Order when you arrive helps cut down on wait time when seated. Placed order received text table was ready and they couldn't locate my order. Wait ten more minutes seated the manager expedites the order pizza arrives quickly. Server doesn't stop back for 55 minutes when Place order for their cookie dessert she tells me about 13 minutes to prepare she returns in 35 finally with dessert food good service not so great.
