Little Goat Diner////I have not been to Girl & The Goat yet, though I've heard great things, and can't wait to try it. However, I did get to try this little number last night. It wasn't bad. I will say, I love the concept of a little more upscale restaurant, with a diner feel. Super cute. We ordered the Macho Nachos to start, and I ordered the crispy shrimp salad, while my friend got the Los Drowned sandwich. The portions are huge, as they should be, with the prices. The food was not bad, but I didn't find anything especially flavorful. There is this ginger maple dressing that comes on the shrimp salad, which our server said he loved, but my friend and I both felt that it really just tasted like mayonnaise. We had a super nice server, who was really good at appearing personable when he was addressing us.. It was when we talked to him that he was a little less engaged. NBD, he meant well. In any case, I love the ambiance, and I appreciate the different take on good ol' fashioned American diner food. I understand that this place is still new, so maybe I will come back in the summer when they've really gotten the hang of everything.
