Little Goat Diner////I am hoping that with time most of the quirks will be worked out and consistency of the food will improve.  For now, I will go with my 3 star review.  We will be back to try dinner when there is no wait and maybe the score will improve.  While the diner is working on getting up to par, I will certainly continue to go to LG Bread in the mean time!  I already miss the upstairs dining option but hope that some classes or dinners are coming soon!
