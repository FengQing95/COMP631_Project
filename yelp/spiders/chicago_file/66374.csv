Little Goat Diner////I loved this place. We went for brunch a couple weeks ago- was nice enough we could sit outside. Food is innovative, creative & delicious. My friend had the Reuben- it had pickled cabbage on it, was amazing. I had the you guest w homemade granola- I I loved the yogurt - it was amazing. I had never tasted anything like it...had fresh blueberries & honey it. So unusual I kept wanting more. My husband had the biscuits & gravy (he's a southern boy) the biscuits were homemade & fresh out the oven. We all shared the hash browns which were stringy like spaghetti a, but deliciously light potatoes. They also have a Bloody Mary bar, but we were all behaving that day. I can't wait to go back & try more
