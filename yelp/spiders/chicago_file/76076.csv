Little Goat Diner////Great brunch spot! I had the little piggy went to China because I heard such good things about it. The chive biscuit was SO tasty with the over easy egg and pork. The blackberries were also a unique touch! Definitely an imaginative plate. All of the flavors worked really well together! Will be back.
