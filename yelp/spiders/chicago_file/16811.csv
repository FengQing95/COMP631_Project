Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We love Lou Malnati's Pizza, and we always go to the one in Oak Lawn.  We used to go to the original in Skokie, IL, but now that this one is close to our home, we save the gas and just drive here.  Either place, the pizza is to die for.  They even flew in Lou Malnati's Pizza to the White House when President Bill Clinton was prez.  Wonder if they will do the same when Hillary Clinton becomes prez.
