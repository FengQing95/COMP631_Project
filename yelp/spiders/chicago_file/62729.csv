Smoque BBQ////Probably one of the best no-nonsense BBQ places in Chicago. I was recommended to go here by my roommate and wasn't disappointed. Although I haven't had much exposure to "fine" BBQ, I would have to say this place was amazing! I ordered the brisket, half rack of ribs, and a few pulled-pork sandwiches. Everything was delicious! The meat had that smokey, but not overly charcoal flavor, only thing was that I though the meat was a bit dry. However, I had my first bite after having the sandwiches sit in my luggage for about 2 hours, so I won't knock them on that. If I'm ever in the Chicago area again, I will definitely be coming back, and this time to get some sides as well! I've read in the comments that their sides are superb as well.
