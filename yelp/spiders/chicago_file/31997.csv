Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There's no denying that Lou Malnati's is a popular Chicago pizza legend ... that has reached must-try pizza status. I'm glad I got to experience it with a couple foodies, but the consensus was that Lou Malnati's was just ok pizza ... best eaten as separate layers of cheese, meet, tomato sauce, and crust.
