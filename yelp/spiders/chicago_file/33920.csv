Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our waiter was awesome (I'm sorry I can't remember his name), and from the moment we sat down he was attentive but not overbearing. He was super knowledgeable about wine and food and made great recommendations. The byob "fee" is great and makes the restaurant even more charming. Â We started with oysters, which were super flavorful. I had the fried chicken, which was moist and crispy.
