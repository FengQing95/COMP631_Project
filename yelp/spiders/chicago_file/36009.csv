Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Again the food and service was great except.....the prime bone in dry aged ribeye.  The color of the steak was beautiful and the meat was cooked to the perfect temperature.  I went to take a bite and the steak was luke warm and bland!  I've had this steak numerous times and this was the first.
