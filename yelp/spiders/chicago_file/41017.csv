Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My wife and I have probably eaten here more than any other restaurant in Chicago. The tapas are delicious and consistent. The service is almost always great (we had one less than perfect experience with a large group). Â This place also appeals to all ages and is appropriate for many different occasions. Come with friends on Friday and Saturday nights, stop in for date night, stumble through the door after a Cubs game, even bring your parents here when they visit. Solid place.
