Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great lighting, great atmosphere, great steak house. We sat at the bar and they have anything from beer, wine to great cocktails, as a matter of fact the cocktail I like they didn't have it on the list but the bar tender did not hesitated in finding out the recepie and made it for me, came out great!. ThenHostess was very accommodating by giving us the option of dining upstairs or downstairs with a smile and welcoming manner. Our server Sarah was very knowlegable about the menu and very professional. We ordered several things on the menu and the food was terrific!
