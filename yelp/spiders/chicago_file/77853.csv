Little Goat Diner////Not bad as a diner. Using so much details and add ons for brunch class food is awesome. Bull's eye i would give 9/10 points, having an onsen egg inside the french toast gives extra texture in the mouth. With extra chicken stripe on top makes the dish very fulfilling. Shrimp and grits 8/10 points. I really like how they gave extra flavor to the fluffy texture of the grits by dropping a potion of goat milk inside. But the dish became over complicated with pistachios and lettuce. I guess the Big Bang intention came to a fail. Chicken fingers 8/10. Its rare to find restaurants to use marinated and well beaten chicken breast as chicken strips. Its very tender and flavored. But the batter seems a little too simple, would be much crunchier if battered and fried a couple more times. Goat milk latte is a must try if u like goat milk.
