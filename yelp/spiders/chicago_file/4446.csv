The Purple Pig////A-mazing, a must eat place in Chicago!! I had heard a lot about this place when researching for our visit to Chicago and planned it out so that we could eat here one evening. The other reviewers were correct in that they do not take reservations and it is important to get their early and put your name down. At 7:00pm on a Saturday there was an 1.5 hour wait and we were seated at our table around 8:10.. so off to a good start!
