Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This restaurant was AMAZING! We came here after getting a few recommendations from people. We got there and they said the wait was about 20-30 minutes, so we put our name down and were called in about 10 mins. The service staff was super nice, very polite and even with the long list of people waiting, we never felt rushed! I ordered a custom omelette and added the specialty berry pancakes on the side. The pancakes were AMAZING. I'm not usually a pancake girl, but these were super delicious! You get a lot of food for your money (we each spent under $15). My friend ordered an Eggs Benedict and she LOVED it. I would absolutely recommend this place and would most definitely come back! =D =D
