Little Goat Diner////Likes: Got a table pretty quickly early Thursday evening, great and friendly service(one of the bakers gave my girlfriend a free bagel while she waited for me at the bar), some of the food was great(Pork Belly Pancake was the best thing I tried), and it was cool to have a view of Stefanie working on the line for a bit.
