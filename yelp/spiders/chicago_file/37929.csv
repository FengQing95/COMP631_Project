Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food: Â the 22oz Dry Aged Bone In Ribeye, Slagel Farm Griddled Burger and beef fat french fries are some of the best in recent memory. The Baked Goat Cheese is one of the most unique appetizers we've experienced in a while. The dessert menu options were limited and nothing stood out to us, but we needed to end the meal on a sweet note and so we ordered the Hot Fudge Sundae Royale which was a pleasant surprise. Portion sizes are large, and great for sharing.
