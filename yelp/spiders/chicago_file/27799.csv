Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////OMG, one of my favorite pizzeria restaurants in Down town Chicago. Lou Malnatis ranks in my top 3 Chicago Deep Dish pizzas. The best way to order is select your pizza at the counter before you are seated. Â This location has two levels so it was extremely busy; even for a Wednesday evening. My family and I waited for about forty minutes to be seated. Since I ordered a large and smaller pizza, it took longer than usual.
