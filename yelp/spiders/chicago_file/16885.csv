Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is the best deep dish Pizza in the city.  I used to love Uno's but Lou's crust is more tolerable for me.  It is just the Best, and they're Malnati's house dressing is the bomb as well.  The dining experience is great. I love the Lawndale and the Randolph locations the best!!!!
