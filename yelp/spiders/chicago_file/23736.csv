Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First of all, I think it's a tourist trap and unfortunately I fell into it. Second, it takes FOREVER to get the pizza even if you order before being seated. Our pizza took an hour! When you finally get the pizza, you can't eat more than once slice because its super cheesy and not in a good way. The cheese was way too chewy and rubbery almost. The crust is so odd. I should've listened to our Lyft driver who told us not to go there! The only thing I did like was the sauce..that was ok. Immediately after eating my one chewy slice of pizza, I felt super gross! I ended up throwing up 2 hours later and had major tummy troubles! IT WAS A NIGHTMARE!
