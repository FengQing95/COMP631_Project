Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Absolutely terrible. Less than mediocre. I'm so disappointed! My friends and I were shopping and decided we'd stop and get a bite to eat. Let me say that the service was very good. Our waiter was nice and attentive. However, the food was disgusting. I ordered the chicken empanada. I never knew chicken could be black! It's like they took all the gross leftover pieces of chicken and put them in that empanada. It was gross and I nor my friend could finish it. Then I ordered the goat cheese and marinara sauce (which is a personal favorite of mine). The accompanying garlic bread was much to hard to chew and I could barely taste the flavor in the goat cheese. Finally the sangria also fell flat. It was all TERRIBLY disappointing.
