Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I guess I understand why they ask you to pre-order.  It was 8:25PM and our pizza still did not arrive (1 hour and 15 minutes later).  We were never told it would take this long at all.  Finally, we inquired and told the server unfortunately we had to take it to go, so we were not late for our next engagement at 9:15PM.
