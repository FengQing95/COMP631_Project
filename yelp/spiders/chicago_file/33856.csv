Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////First I want to say , we love your restaurants , Bavettes, madeus liqueur, and au cheval , we really enjoy all the concept of it , but IAM sorry I have to wrote this in tears , I have a concern abot Liliana Leon , and one of the server at bavettes her name is Sarah , we never complain , we love to have a good time and ignore most of the time any inconvenience , but this time was way too far , beginning with the manager , I was celebrating my birthday then I have reservation at 11 pm one Saturday night , we arrive me and my partner at 9 pm we decide to have some drinks and like other day we thought we going to be lucky to sit us quickly , well it was like 10:30 when I ask the manager why they don't give us a table , and she reply because everything was reserve , but more than 8 tables? Yes I counted she say no proble we will sit to you in a minute with attitude like if our money doesn't worth at all she don't help in anything , we never look for anything free , just an explanation , I don't want to argue anymore then we decide to sit to our table , then here come the nightmare the worst Birthday I ever had thanks to the server Sarah , she give to us the menu with attitude without asking anything , with a bad look in her eyes , I thought she had a rough day , but when she was so nice and polite with the people sitting beside us , she was helping then very nice then she came again , and she was very rude , I never feel uncomfortable and insecure about my ethnicity , we are Hispanic people Mexican and my friend Colombian , we feel discriminated because it was to obvious the difference treat between, and I guess this kind of situation shouldn't happened and a such a nice place and most of the staff are attentive and cordial, finally she give to me the Dessert menu almost throwing in my face at that time I want to cry I was mad frustrating and we just leave , the manager give priority to sit to another people instead us and they don't have reservation either , so what's the point I don't now and one of the hostess she  give us the name of the manager because she do nice and polite and she reply I can see everything how they difference people from the other one , IAM not write this to get anything , not even apologize because that's not enough , hopefully things change in the future for this kind a struggle moments , thank you very much if you read all this Mr Ryan Wagner .
