Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Best steak in the city. It's a bit hard to get a rezzie (tables open up 3 months to the date on open table), but you can pretty much walk in with a small group and sit at one of the two high tops in the back or at the bar most anytime. If you come right at opening (5PM) you have a better chance of getting a table. The food here is incredible, the steak is the best we've had in the city. They're big enough to share! Don't miss the roasted broccoli or their old fashioned... but know before you come that it's BYOB and you can bring in a bottle (or two) of wine - the corkage fee is giving a glass to another table and you can pick the occasion you want to help someone else celebrate (anniversary, birthday, etc). We've been here multiple times and have been impressed each time with the food and the service - our ultimate celebration spot!
