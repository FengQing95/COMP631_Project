Smoque BBQ////Some of the best pulled pork I have ever had.  Also try the Mac and cheese for your side it was incredible.  Went in after the lunch Rush so it wasn't all that busy but still very fast service and everyone was friendly.  They even have a "host" of sorts that even gets you started with a menu and busses the table for you.  It's expensive but we'll worth the price for quality smoked meats!
