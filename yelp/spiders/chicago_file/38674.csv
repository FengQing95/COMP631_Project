Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What a great place ! Every dish we had was excellent. We ordered the bone marrow, wedge salad and garlic shrimp to start. Portions are generous! I love the BYOB rule they have, as long as you share a glass with a neighboring table they waive the $50 corkage fee. For Steaks, we ordered the petite filet, NY Strip and the ribeye all were great !
