Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our pizzas of choice were the Malnati Chicago Classic and the Lou. First off, the Chicago Classic was easily the best sausage pizza I've ever had. Mainly because there was sausage in every. single. bite. We liked that it was an actual layer of sausage vs chunks spread all over the place. Good call.
