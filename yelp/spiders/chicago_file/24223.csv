Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Sorry, Giordano's. I seem to like Lou's better. In the 20 years I've lived here, I've never taken the parental units to Lou's. Like me, they're not fans of deep dish and prefer thin crust. And they're usually not in the mood for pizza whenever they are in town, until their most recent visit. I made the mistake of taking them before Memorial Weekend began. Wait time is as can be expected and I shouldn't have been surprised. Plus, this location is smaller, even with the second floor. The hostess suggested ordering while we waited (25-30 min approx.) so by the time we sat down, our order would likely be ready. It's a great suggestion but doesn't always work out. Expect about the same time frame when seated. But it all worked out because my parents left satisfied. Also, a small size pizza is good enough for at least 2-3 people. I didn't think it would be, and we ended up with leftovers.
