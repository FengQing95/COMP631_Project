Little Goat Diner////Our meal here which consisted of hot crab dip, pork belly home fries, Mac and cheese, the fish tostadas and a few drinks was easily my favorite meal of the trip. The food was delicious without being pretentious and the service was friendly without being fake. To top that all off, the prices were very reasonable, especially for the quality of food.
