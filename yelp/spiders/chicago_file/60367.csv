Smoque BBQ////We came here the Saturday after Thanksgiving.  Most of Chicago was still dealing with leftovers and heartburn, and this allowed us to place and receive our orders within about fifteen minutes of entering.  I think the Thanksgiving leftover crowd ran out of gravy soon after our arrival, though, because the line was to the door from the time we sat down to when we left.
