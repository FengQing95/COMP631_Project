Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I loved the variety in flavors and textures I got out of a single meal. I wanted to try everything on the menu! Ended up ordering a few pinchos plates, brussel sprouts salad, sirloin with Blue Cheese and the bacon wrapped dates. Everything was amazing, I highly recommend the bacon wrapped dates, try it out as a dessert!
