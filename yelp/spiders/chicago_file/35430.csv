Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We waited for a very long time before being greeted, and equally long times in between to place our order and receive our different courses. Even though they asked us to put the entire course in at once so the 'kitchen can pace us', multiple shared apps showed up at the same time crowding the table, and the second after they were cleared our next courses came. We all got the 22oz prime dry aged ribeyes and the steak was still good. the corn was also still just as good as I remember. However, the numerous other hiccups in the process made the evening and overall disappointment that just doesn't seem appropriate of a place of this caliber and price point. Big disappointment this time around.
