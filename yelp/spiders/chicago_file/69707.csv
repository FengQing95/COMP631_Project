Little Goat Diner////I'm a vegetarian, so I kind of expected not to be able to eat anything here, but the fried pickle goat cheese sandwich was amazing, as were the dark chocolate chip pancakes I had for brunch. I'm excited to try the veggie burger at some point as well. I hope they continue to add stellar and creative vegetarian options as the menu changes.
