Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We ordered a range of items to get the full taste of the menu.  I had the steak and frites which was perfectly cooked with plenty of fries to share.  Two at the table had the burger and there wasn't a prettier burger to be found (tasted great too)  But the real winner at the table was the fried chicken.  Yep.  More comfort food and while you might be turned off of it because it is all dark meat, the first bite of the juicy chicken under that crispy brown crust will have you shunning white meat forever!
