Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great food, good Bloody Mary, friendly bartender. Hosts ignored us when we walked in and seated people that walked in behind us (was super awkward) so we sat at the bar (which was fine bc the bartender was good). Salad was awesome and I'm glad the bartender suggested it because the pizza took a long time to make (as the bartender had warned us it would). So overall: very good.
