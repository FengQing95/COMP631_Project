Little Goat Diner////The employes are friendly and know the menu well, if you have any dietary restrictions they make sure you do not order something that you do not want. The atmosphere is great, you do not feel rushed even though it is always crowed! Â Based on my experiences I recommend Little Goat more for breakfast/brunch instead of lunch.
