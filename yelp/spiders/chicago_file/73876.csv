Little Goat Diner////LIttle Goat stands as proof in life that names and titles mean very little. While I admit that the building and atmosphere were pretty cool (reminiscent of some grand hipster places like the Ace Hotel NY with high ceilings, expertly placed white and navy tiles, and copper lighting), the food and service (but mostly the food) left something to be desired.
