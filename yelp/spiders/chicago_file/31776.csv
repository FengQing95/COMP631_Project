Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Seems that visitors in Chicago go for Lou Malnati's and Giordano's for their deep dish fix. Admittedly I'm not big on deep dish, but thankfully Lou does thin crust pizzas and amazing salads too. This location is a super crowded one so expect to wait at least half an hour for dinner. There are 2 floors with lots of tables and they have a nice waitlisting system: you get text updates when your table is ready and you can order before being seated!
