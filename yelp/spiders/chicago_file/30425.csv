Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Perhaps my high expectations didn't help, but I was a little underwhelmed.  I had the personal Malnati classic (with lean sausage), and while the crust was as good as other reviews said, the pizza itself was just OK.  From the presentation, to taste (the sausage was a little bland and there was hardly any cheese or sauce), I was just expecting more.  I truly do believe that if I had gone with a group and ordered a larger pizza (baked and served in the skillet), I may have added a star.  On the bright side, their house salad with the creamy garlic dressing was very tasty, and service was good.
