The Purple Pig////We choose this place and were nervous that they don't take reservations and the wait can get up to a 4-hour wait on a Friday night, we went on a Friday night. Despite this, we pressed on and arrived around 5:30. Our wait was 45 min. (However, during dinner we heard the time of 2.5 hours being quoted).
