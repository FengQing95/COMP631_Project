The Purple Pig////the food: its a tapas place, so small plates, but a bit pricier than most tapa places. i thought the portion was decent for the price. unfortunately, i dont think anything we ate really stands out as drool worthy except our cheese that we ordered which i sadly cannot remember which one!!! i thought everything was a overly salty or bland... =/
