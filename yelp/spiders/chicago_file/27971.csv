Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Spent about 2 hours there, 1.5 of which was waiting for our pizza. They burnt the first one, informed they had to remake it, it was trash. Asked for crushed red pepper, received 2 individual packets for 2 people and a medium pizza. Had to ask for more. Saw our waitress 4 times in 2 hours, no refills. Ordering, receiving appetizer, asking for check, and payment were our only interactions with the waitress. Ended up being charged and paying for both items ordered, despite being offered an appetizer after our pizza was burned. Informed them tip could be taken out of the food ordered.
