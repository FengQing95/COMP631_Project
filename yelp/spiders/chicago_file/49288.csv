Smoque BBQ////Amongst the BBQ restuarants in Chicago that I've tried (The Patio, County BBQ, and out in Wheaton, Steamboat BBQ) Smoque is arguably the best. When you go to Smoque's you will immediately see an incredibly full dining room and probably a ridiculous line. This is always a good sign to me. There is very little service involved here, walk up menu and then a host will seat you ("host" being a loose term as they are the waterboys, they clean and they help people line up if its getting crazy). When your order is ready you get up and get it, so again, service doesn't mean much here. That being said I've found everyone there very helpful and kind, though busy.
