Art Institute of Chicago////I enjoy museums, but they're usually not my first choice when I am on vacation. However, I paid the expensive ticket and all in all...I'd say it was worth it. There are hundreds of works of art to see! I didn't pay for an audio tour and I'm not one to read all the descriptions of the art, but I easily spent two hours looking at everything.
