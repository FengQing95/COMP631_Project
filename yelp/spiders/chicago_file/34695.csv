Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////If you can get a reservation here when you want one, go.  Bavette's is one my favorite restaurants in the entire city.  When my friends, or friends friends come to town, I tell them to come here.  I love everything about it - the food, the decor, the service, the drinks.  The only thing I don't like is waiting to go!  The aged rib eye is probably one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten in my entire life.  If you are a fan of marrow, get it.  Try one of their specialty cocktails.  Their burger is kind of life changing.  I always have much bigger eyes than my stomach when I go, and one day I swear I will save room for dessert.
