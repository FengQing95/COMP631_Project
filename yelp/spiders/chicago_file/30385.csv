Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They were not kidding when they say it takes about 35 minutes but watching tv for a bit and chatting it up and the time kind of flew by though I kept thinking about the pizza. It finally came out and after a photo, I dug in (with a fork and knife. Fork and knife not required but helpful. When you first look at it, the personal size didn't seem too big but it was deep and heavy so it is enough. The crust was amazing. It was the perfect crispness and felt almost like a pie crust. As for the filling, I felt the cheese was too tough and not gooey at all. it felt like a block of cheese underneath the sauce and meats. As for the meats, it was overwhelming. The sausage was laid out over all of the pizza and there was no other flavor that permeated through. The tomatoes on top also leaked out some water so if I didn't let out the juices, I felt the crust would get somewhat soggy.
