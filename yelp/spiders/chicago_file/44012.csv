Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Surprisingly, I'm quite down with this place. It all starts with my love-hate relationship with tapas. Love the small portions, speed at which they are served, the never-know-what-you're-gonna-get way they are plated, etc. Hate the plethora of options and my inability to choose 6 dishes from a menu of 90+ small plates. Yes, I understand that's a personal problem and I am working on it.
