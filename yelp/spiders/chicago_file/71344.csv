Little Goat Diner////Went there for brunch Saturday afternoon. It was pretty busy but we ended up only waiting for about 15 minutes. They don't mention it on their menu but all meat and eggs come from local farms! So the meat is pasture-raised and tasty! We ordered the cheesy grits which did not look like what we expected but were delicious! I got the banh mi style burger, my husband got the crab crumpets. Both were fresh and tasty! Their take on your standard breakfast fare is amazing. Definitely recommend (and already did) to all friends and family.
