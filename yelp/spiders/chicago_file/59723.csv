Smoque BBQ////Dining room's kind of small and like, 'blah'. I imagine you'd have hard luck going there for lunch rush. Food tops atmosphere and service, which is fine in a place like this -- but with a little more care to detail and service, it could be an astonishing place to eat BBQ. Right now it's just good.
