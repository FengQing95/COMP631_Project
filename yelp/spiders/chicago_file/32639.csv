Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Go to Bavette's have amazing food with a side of Jonny! This place is not a mistake. Everything from the decor to the service is impeccable. Tonight was my second meal there and I went in thinking...knowing it wouldn't be as good. I told myself it was just a fluke, maybe just a great night last time. But indeed I was not disappointed. The food was right and the service (Jonny) exceeded my expectations. This is a must. Go eat, drink, and be merry. This is place that deserves your dollar so order away!
