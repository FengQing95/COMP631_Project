Art Institute of Chicago////Absolutely loved the Art Institute of Chicago. I was able to visit the Van Gogh exhibit so that my trip here even better. It is so big, you could literally spend an entire day here. The employees are not to helpful so here's the deal...get the City Pass and you won't have to wait in line outside to get in..and it gets better...you also get to skip the line at special exhibits such as the Van Gogh exhibit. I went on a Saturday and it was busy but not enough that it affected my experience. Definitely a must see when visiting Chicago.
