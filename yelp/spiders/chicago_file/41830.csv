Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Good! Super busy and not a great flow or space to seat a 2 hr wait.. The food was good, but nothing super spectacular. The beef with the mashed potatoes was so delicious- I wish I had gotten just that, my meal would have been heaven. The sangria is good as well. We had the classic red and the white peach. I mixed them and loved it.
