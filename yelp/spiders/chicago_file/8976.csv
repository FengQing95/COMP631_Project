Art Institute of Chicago////I wound up in Cy Twombley's room looking out the window of one of Renzo Piano's gorgeous buildings at Frank Gehry's amphitheater.  That is the best room in the whole entire museum.  How did I go from Rauschenberg to Twombley with Piano?  You'd have had to visit the Menil in Houston, then it makes absolute sense.  Anyway, it's just a gorgeous room to spend time.  Clean lines made from natural and industrial materials, but not harsh.  Soft.  Modern and classical.  Beyond Gehry's amphitheater is Gehry's bridge.  If you ever, ever go to Chicago, I highly recommend going to these three places.  Piano's modern wing, then Gehry's two structures outside.  Right, I'll pull myself back into the museum.
