Art Institute of Chicago////The floor plan of the building is beyond confusing.  The only elevator that rises to the 3rd level is the one nearest the west entrance.  However, using the same elevator to go to the 2nd level make you walk through a hallway.  A more efficient way is to enjoy the collections on the 1st level first, then walk up the stairs on the east end to get to the 2nd level.  Furthermore, based on the unhelpful instructions of the staffs on floor, I went from 1st level to Lower level back to the 2nd level to find a working washroom.
