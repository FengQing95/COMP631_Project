Smoque BBQ////The sides were good, but weren't as wonderful as the meat, but nobody's perfect, right?  The beans were delicious.  I liked the BBQ sauce, though it was a bit too sweet for me.  (I generally prefer a bit more of a "zesty zing"  in my BBQ sauce that wasn't present here.). The coleslaw and fries were both okay, but I wasn't as impressed with then as the meat.  However, the young children definitely enjoyed the fries.  I liked the macaroni and cheese as a side, though the kids liked it less.
