Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This was simply the best steak I've ever had in my life. The service was impeccable, the craft cocktails were of high-quality and served exceptionally. The execution of the most simple dishes were above and beyond expectations. I very much enjoyed my visit here. This place has the ambience that finally matches the meal. Â Very romantic. It's Chicago circa 1940s. This is immediately one of my favorite places to have a special meal.
