Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////All I can say is yummmm....I loved this place.  The food was delicious and the flavored sangria was great! They have so many options and it's not too expensive.  This is the perfect first date place in my opinion.  The only thing I didn't like was that they don't bring everything at once. So you fill up on one thing before even trying the next.  They should also have bigger tables for all the plates!  Maybe I ordered too much. But definitely worth it! Loooove it!
