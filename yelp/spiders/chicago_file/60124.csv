Smoque BBQ////Staff, presentation, ambience. . .in that order. The prep guys all look pretty tough, kinda like that. Actually I am totally grateful they didn't put up retarded "authentic" roadhouse memorabilia or weathered barnwood. I admit if it were grimy and old and on the south side and you got lost trying to find it it would seem like more of an adventure. Just saying.
