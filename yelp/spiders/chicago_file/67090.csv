Little Goat Diner////Fantastic hip restaurant in Chicago. Couldn't get into Girl and the Goat so we opted for the more casual version. Loved it. Great vibe, service and food. Living in CA I love the laid back non uptight restaurant - this fits the bill. Fresh made breads, great selection of foods. I had a pulled pork sandwich - sauce was just right - not mustardy or tart - very South Georgia smooth. Bread was outstanding. Â Only complaint was they don't take reservations and it was about hour wait on a Thursday night.
