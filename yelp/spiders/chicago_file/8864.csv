Art Institute of Chicago////The new Modern Wing is worth a stop.  Modern art can be hit or miss for me.  I don't get some it.  But it's still worth checking out---just be careful.  That empty gin bottle is art, not trash.  Those stones, also art.  I may not see the artist's meaning, but I respect their expression.
