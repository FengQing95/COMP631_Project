The Purple Pig////The Purple Pig was one of the highly recommended spots to try by a friend. They definitely did not disappoint. The dishes are Mediterranean inspired small plates that are meant to be shared. Our waitress suggested we order 5-6 dishes for our group of 3, so we decided to order four since we were eating our way through Chicago.
