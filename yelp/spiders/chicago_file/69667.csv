Little Goat Diner////The one downside was my entree came out 15 + mins (not an exaggeration) before my friends.  The server was great the whole time and incredibly apologetic, and we had two managers stop by and apologize as well.  Both entrees when they did arrive were wonderful, Little goat has a knack for combining strange ingredients in unique (and delicious) new ways.  Since all the food when it came out was incredible, they gave us a round of drinks on them instead.
