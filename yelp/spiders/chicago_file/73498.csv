Little Goat Diner////I really wanted to LOVE this place, but I thought it was just ok. The pictures of the food look so amazing that my husband and I were so excited to try it out. I had the Spanish omelette, my husband had two eggs bacon and hash browns, and we ordered the Fat Elvis waffles. Everything was jut ok. The food was a little bit greasy, and the scrambled eggs were a little runny. The service was good, and our waitress was fast and attentive considering she was very busy. The Fat Elvis was the highlight for sure, but it was extremely sweet. I love sweet stuff and yet found them to be a little bit too sweet. My husband, unfortunately, had an eye lash in his eggs which was definitely not a good thing, but they were replaced for us quickly (no biggie). Maybe I had set my expectations to high. I imagined something different, but it's really greasy spoon breakfast and a higher price point.
