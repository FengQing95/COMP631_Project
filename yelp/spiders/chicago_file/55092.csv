Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Definitely an awesome-fun spot for brunch.  I'd say if you are looking for introduction to tapas and Spanish food, this is a great spot because you will see familiar dishes with some not so familiar.  It's easy to experiment with small plates since the cost is low.  Get a reservation as the place is very popular.
