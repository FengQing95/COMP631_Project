Art Institute of Chicago////Love this place!  Conveniently located near all sorts of color trains, teacher AND student disocunts ($7 otherwise $12, not expensive at all) and pretty big, reminds me of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) in NY.  The place has a nice combination of art, and is open late during the holidays.  I think this is a must see- especially since many artists attended the school.  Right now they have Jasper Johns -- and I'm soo into him, so I recommend it!
