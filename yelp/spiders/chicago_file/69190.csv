Little Goat Diner////I've been to Little Goat 3 times now, and it wasn't until last night that I decided that this is a proper 4 star place. I've seen good improvement in the nuts and bolts of running a new restaurant (servers are now more knowledgeable, kitchen seems to be working together more cohesively), and as a result, I've seen marked improvements in the food. Granted, there are some dishes that still need to be overhauled (Loco Moco, I'm looking at you), but some of the dishes are AMAZING.
