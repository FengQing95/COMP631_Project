The Purple Pig////The Whole Salt Roasted Tenderloin with Smoked Horseradish Crema & Piquillo Pepper Jam was delicious. A bite of the tenderloin melted in my mouth while the accompanying crema and jam lightened the entire dish with its contrasting yet satisfying flavors, sans their homemade crackers.
