Little Goat Diner////So we ordered 2 sides and 2 main ... Not realizing the mains can feed a super hungry person or realistically 2 people!! So be warned ... Come with an appetite or with a lot of mouths!  Yes tuna melt looked like a salad at first ... It's like 2 meals in one.  A full sized salad AND the sandwich.  I was impressed with the the sandwich as it was perfectly crunchy from being nicely toasted and the filling was excellent.  Lots of tuna, very creamy and healthy dose of lemon to cut through the mayo.  The cheese added another tasty component to it.  My goato goato salad was meal sized with plentiful amount of shrimp and a great variety of vegetables.  Definitely one of the better salads I've had in Chicago.
