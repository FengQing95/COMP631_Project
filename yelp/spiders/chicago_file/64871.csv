Smoque BBQ////Best BBQ in Chicago.  I'm not saying that just because it's walking distance from my house either.   Really great pulled pork and chopped or sliced brisket sandwiches as well as hot Texas links.  Side dishes included yummy Mac & cheese, baked beans, vinegar cole slaw and French fries.  Don't forget to leave room for warm peach cobbler.  Be prepared to wait on a Friday or Saturday evening.  Prices kind of on the high side but worth it.
