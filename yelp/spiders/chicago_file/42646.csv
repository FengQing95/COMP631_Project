Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is definitely a place to go with a group of your closest girl friends. It's a tapas place so share everything! Which I always do anyway! The wait was kind of a pain in the you know what, but that was our own fault for not making reservations. The food here was alright. Nothing wowed me. But I can't say I hated anything either. I definitely felt satiety after my meal, which is always a good sign, but I'm not in any hurry to go again.
