Smoque BBQ////Smoque is absolutely delicious. From their smokey and savory brisket, Â creamy and crusty mac & cheese to the crunchy coleslaw everything there is just great. I fell in love with everything there. There will be a wait to get your food and to sit down. It is a deli style operation. I would suggest you try a little bit of everything, they offer such a platter, but if you are a fan of brisket skip everything else and get that. It is juicy, smoky, tender and the bbq sauce that accompanies it is vinegary, sweet and spicy all at the same time. Delicious! Once you get your food and sit down to devour this amazing food you will thank me for my suggestions.
