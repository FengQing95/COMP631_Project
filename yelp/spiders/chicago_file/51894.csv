Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My fiance and I have been here only twice (once in 2012 and once in 2014) but it's one of our favorite places in town.  I've been to several other tapas places in Chicago, which you would think might be better since they were smaller and less corporate (CBBR is a Lettuce Entertain You venture) but this is not the case.  CBBR rules over all!
