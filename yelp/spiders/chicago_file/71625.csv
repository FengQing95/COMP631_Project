Little Goat Diner////They very kindly altered the reuben sandwich menu item for me, substituting turkey and removing the kimchi.  It was very good. The macaroni and cheese was not so good.  A large bowl of boiled pasta shells tossed in a tasteless cream sauce with no discernible cheese included...a complete failure. Friends raved about past visits where they all had breakfast choices. They also seem to have a diverse option of fun cocktails and a bakery, neither of which I tried. Overall I'm comfortable giving a 4 star rating but I hope they see this and decide to fix the mac and cheese problem.
