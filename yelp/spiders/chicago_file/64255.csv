Smoque BBQ////Also, I am majorly bummed that, quite a while a go, they made their peach cobbler, which had been a side you could order as one of your accompanying sides, into a stand-alone non-side. As much as I loved sides like the fries (but who isn't at least capable of great fries in Chicago?), I would often get peach cobblers as both my sides. Now, I never get the peach cobbler because I'm not going to pay extra for it, and get more food than I want or need just to do so.
