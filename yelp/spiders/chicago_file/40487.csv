Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I have heard such great things about Bavette's Chicago and was so excited to visit and try it!! The ambiance is so cool, very moody and reminds me of what the mobster days would've been like with the dim lighting and classy decor! Our server was very nice and knowledgeable, we ordered the bone marrow, 2 ordered because we love it and usually restaurants are very frugal with their servings. Not here, there was at least 6 servings on each plate! We had enough to even put on our steaks! Absolutely heavenly!!
