Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First off, the place is huge and even though we were relegated to the dreaded upper level, service was still good and they were more than accommodating with our many questions and various restrictions. Honey had the gluten free and I dropped the mushrooms from "The Lou" (despite the 'no substitutions' request) and all was good. We each ordered salads and I'm glad we did, seeing as they were both quite tasty (she had the Spinach, I had the House) and that the pizza took quite a while to get to us...but that's deep dish for you.
