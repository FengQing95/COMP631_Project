The Purple Pig////Also - vegetarians, no fear - we came here with our vegetarian friends and were afraid the menu would not support their diet but was actually pleasantly surprised at just how many (and good) vegetarian tapas are offered. In terms of apps, I highly recommend starting with some cheeses. The cracker, pickles and cherry relish that it's served with are amazing compliments. The beets and carrots were also good main choices. For our one meat dish, we ordered the braised pork shoulder, which literally fell apart.
