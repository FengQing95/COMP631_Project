The Purple Pig////FOOD: This was second dinner for me, so we ordered just a few items. Everything is tapas style, and some of the dishes are actually quite large, making it more affordable. We each ordered a glass of white wine which we enjoyed with our meal - their food is fairly rich so would recommend a refreshing beverage. We started off with three cheeses (the cremeux di citeaux was amazing), pigs ear (a classic - have ordered this every time and not regretted it. I can eat them like chips), and the 'nduja (we didn't expect the bread to be covered in melting cheese). They got one of the cheeses wrong and we unfortunately found a long hair in the pig face - so deducted some points for that.
