Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's everything is in Chicago pizza should be. We had the butter crust. We had 10 crest. We had a deep dish with fun ingredients. Pictures of beers cocktails is a fantastic experience always start off though with a salad or something cause a pizza takes 40 minutes but it's worth the wait.
