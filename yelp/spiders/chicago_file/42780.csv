Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Your probably wondering, 'why is he just giving Cafe 3 stars?  Well okay, I  will admit, it was very hard to do that.  Their food is absolutly excellent, however, their service is awful, maybe I am just very picky when it comes to service for the guess at a restaurant that charges $6.50 for a bottle of Stella, but that is just what I think.  But all jokes and lets be good here, the host are very sweet, but when you get the wait staff over to you, they just dont seem to want to be your friend and I believe that in order for the wait staff to go home with a nice bit of money from the night is to be friends with their guest, do what they say promptly, and always answer the guest questions without pausing for anything, you work their, you know the answer.
