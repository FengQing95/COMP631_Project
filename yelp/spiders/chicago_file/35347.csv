Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Am I the only one that's going to say it like it is? I like gilt bar and Maude's but Bavette's is a missed opportunity! The service is very prohibition and a little snobby-- that I can handle. It's nice inside and they have a couple good cocktails, again very prohibition. But it stops there.
