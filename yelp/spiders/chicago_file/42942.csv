Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great food. The service was slow though. The waiter was not very attentive. I forgot to order a dish that I had ordered. I had to chase him down to get our check ASAP, because we had a show to go to. THe margharitas were amazing. The food is consistent, especially the bacon wrapped dates.
