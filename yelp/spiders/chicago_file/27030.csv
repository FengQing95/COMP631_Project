Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////During my recent trip to Chicago, I tried their deep dish pizza and it was yummy. The lines were out the door. So I did the quick online order while waiting in line and then decided to walk to house of blues for a show. My pizza was ready as promised and I even got to enjoy the blues show and grab a few drinks before my pizza was ready. It was a win- win.
