Smoque BBQ////We had already planned to take our dinner home with us as we were still working. Anyway, my eyes feasted on the big platters their customers were eating. BBQ beef,beans,peach cobbler.... anything my eyes could absorb. Lets also make mention of the unique cole slaw recipe that is second to none. Changed my mind even when it comes to the usual cole slaw I think most of us are used to!
