Smoque BBQ////I love BBQ and I cook KCBS Competition BBQ I've been to a lot of the top places in this country. Franklin's in Austin, Memphis BBQ Co, Lockhart TX and eaten at the big three so when I say this I have the credentials to back it up. This is one of the top 5 places I've been to. I say this because most places do one or two things good but the other are not. Example the Brisket in TX is amazing but they do a bad job at pork ribs. Memphis does good pork but bad Brisket so on and so on. But here at Smoque they did everything well.
