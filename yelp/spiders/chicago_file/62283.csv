Smoque BBQ////First things first.  Do not get discouraged by the line that stretches out the door.  They do a very good job of moving everyone along quickly.  That said though, the seating in the restaurant is difficult to come by, so I would recommend ordering take-out if possible.  No wait, and the food is just as good!
