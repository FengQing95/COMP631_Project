The Purple Pig////The food is meant to be shared.  You cannot go wrong with the cheese plate.  We decided on three cheeses and then added the prosciutto di parma.  This was incredible.  All the cheeses were excellent and then the dips that came with them were really good (particularly the fig jam).  They do a great job describing the cheeses to help you make a selection, but imagine all them are excellent.  The prosciutto was really great also.
