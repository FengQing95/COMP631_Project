Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Dishes were overpriced and generally unmemorable.  The goat cheese in tomato sauce that everyone raves about?  Well, if you've ever had warm goat cheese on a pizza, it's exactly like that (except without the crust, and for quadruple the price per volume).  Pitchers of sangria were at least 60% ice by volume.  One star for the bread and olive oil, although really, give us enough for the whole table.  They finally got the memo on that after the third time we asked.
