Little Goat Diner////Love the Little Goat! The staff is so friendly and accommodating, and the ambiance is really relaxed and  comfortable. The corned beef hash was  delicious....crispy, thin hash browns and slivers of corned beef topped with eggs...ridiculously good. Their oatmeal is like no other oatmeal ever before! (I know that sounds odd...it's oatmeal, right?) It's creamy and sweet and comforting and a great way to start your day! Can't wait to go back!
