Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The supposedly warm/hot tapas dishes we ordered were generally quite cold when it came out. Seems like it was sitting there for a while before it was served to us. Â Also, I told my friend that grilled octopus tapas they have here is so soft but what we actually had today was hard to chew. Since I had a really great time last time, I was really disappointed. I felt sorry to my friends for recommending. Before today I always recommended this place when people asked me some good places to dine but I don't think I will anymore. Well, they might have a good experience like when I first came, but I'm afraid they'll have a bad experience like i had today so I don't want to take that risk.
