Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Told my friends the one thing I had to do during my first visit in Chicago was try a deep dish pizza. So happy we came here! Since we try to steer clear of pork products (I know, blasphemous!), we ordered the cheese the and the Lou. Both were so delicious!! The Lou was especially yummy; I think it was the tomato and the cheese.
