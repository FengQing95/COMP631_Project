Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Loved the Chicago classic! It was basically a slab of meat on the pizza so it is a little heavy. The crust was crispy and super yummy, though I wouldn't go out of my way for this. It's a little too heavy and if you are the kind of person who likes toppings on their pizza, this is probably not for you.
