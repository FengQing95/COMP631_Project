Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is, quite simply and without a doubt, the BEST STEAK I HAVE EVER EATEN.  Not the best steak in downtown Chicago, not the best in the area, the best I've had on the planet, period.  I can barely even really describe it to you because I was in such a blissful steak-induced haze, but I'll try.
