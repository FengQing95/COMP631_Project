Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Bottom line, I haven't found better tapas in Chicago. Tons of flavor in every dish, reasonable prices, and a really fantastic atmosphere. The sangria is a little pricey in my opinion, hence one less star, but everything else is superb. Â Great date, great for groups, great late night, they do it all!
