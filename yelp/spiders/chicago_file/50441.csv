Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went for brunch this morning and got the Citrus French toast and the big portion of the palatas bravas. they were amazing ! Wish there was a little more of the goat cheese butter and honey but I'd order this again and the potatoes too! The potatoes are the perfect amount of crispy and seasoned and whatever the sauce is that they put with it-mayonnaise based and a little spicy? I'm not sure but we almost ordered a third order because of how delicious it was. I've been for dinner too but that was a year ago and I can't even remember what I got but it was quite tasty that I came back willingly! They are good about splitting checks too.
