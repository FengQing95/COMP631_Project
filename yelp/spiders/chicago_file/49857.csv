Smoque BBQ////First time there. What wonderful BBQ! The brisket, pulled pork, St Louis ribs were all amazing! That brisket is to die for. The baked beans and mac and cheese were terriific sides. If you don't mind the wait, we waited about 50 minutes from the time we got in line to the time we got our food, it is well worth it!! The place is a little small and seating is tight. But the price is right and the food is off the charts. I'm a huge fan and can't wait to get back there.
