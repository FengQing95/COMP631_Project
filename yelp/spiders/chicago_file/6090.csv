The Purple Pig////We dropped by on a Monday night without reservation and we were seated right away. Staff is super nice and welcoming. It was our first time here and they gave us some recommendations. We picked 2 from the recommendation and 1 of our own. It is tapas style, after our first dish we thought we would be leaving hungry, but by the end of our meal we were satisfied, 3 dishes was the right amount of food for the two of us. Each dish was full of flavor with a unique taste. Definitely a must try. We will be back next time we visit Chicago.
