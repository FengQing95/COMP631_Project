Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Yessss! One of my favorite steak and seafood restaurants in the city!! I always come here for a special occasion and when out of towners are in. My favorites are the ribeye and bone marrow! And the chocolate cream pie is a must!! I'm actually not a big fan of chocolate desserts but it's not too sweet and has just the right amount of chocolate. Ugh, I would go back just for the dessert.
