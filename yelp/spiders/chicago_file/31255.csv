Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Deep dish is a Chicago stable everyone tells you to try. Especially here with the buttery crust. The wait is always long, but I love how you can order ahead before you're even seated! When you check in for a table, you can order whatever you'd like ahead of time inside right after. The deep dishes usually takes at least 40 minutes to make! So crazy, but so worth it. The sauce is made from scratch and you can tell how fresh it is. The cheese could be more stretchy and quantity of that is pretty low even though we ordered the cheese deep dish. The waiters here are ok. They're too busy to come by to check on you often or remember to bring you something you've asked for. We had a waitress forget to bring us a condiment. She came to bring the deep dish when we asked for the hot sauce and that was the last time we saw her near us.
