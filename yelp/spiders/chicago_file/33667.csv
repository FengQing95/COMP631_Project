Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I loved the atmosphere from the moment we walked in, for such a dimly lit space it sparkles.  For me it evokes the 20's lavish extravagance. The only disappointment was that there was no live music to bring up the energy.  We arrived 10 minutes prior to our reservation and found a seat at the bar, I was happy to note a bowl of recently peeled citrus fruits, always a sign of a great drink.  We waited approximately 20 minutes before my boyfriend complained about them "not honouring our reservation", which I thought was a bit ridiculous but appreciated anyway since the restaurant team found us a seat right away, one of the best seats in the house that are usually reserved for parties of 4-6.  I drank 2 fantastic martinis before ordering our food, then came the bread, omg the bread.  On it's own the bread is warm, fresh, crusty and delicious, but paired with salted buttermilk butter was out of this world.  First time I've ever had it and I'm trying to figure out how to make some for myself.  We weren't too hungry so skipped the appetizers and went right to our mains.  He ordered the pork chop and I ordered the duchess cut filet, accompanied by roasted tomatoes and sauteed mushrooms.  Both cuts of meat were cooked perfectly, however the pork came with a rub that my boyfriend hadn't noticed until after he'd eaten most of the chop, and once I'd pointed it out we agreed it was almost as good as the filet, which was probably the best steak either us have ever had.  Absolutely perfect, and was well paired with the mushrooms.  I didn't really care for the tomatoes, however, they didn't really add anything even though an acid was needed.
