Smoque BBQ////I will start by saying that they stuff was very friendly. I'm pretty unimpressed for the city. I'd give it a 1.5. The brisket had good flavor, but was literally about 1/3 fat. The cornbread was extremely dry and tasted like it was out of a box. The beans were so smokey that they tasted burnt. The Mac and cheese was dry and not very cheesy. I have had better BBQ at pretty much every BBQ joint I've eaten at outside of the city. I would have expected better food for the city prices!
