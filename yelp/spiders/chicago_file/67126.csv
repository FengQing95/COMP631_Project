Little Goat Diner////We shared the crab dip which was just "eh". All were expecting way more crab than cheese, which was the opposite. It was hard to even tell there was crab in it. That being said, we were hungry enough that we did eat all of its cheesiness and asked for more crackers to finish it off. One friend had the fried pickle sammich, which looked super unique and had a happy eater enjoying it and the other had the BBQ pork sammich which was good, but not memorable or incredibly unique. Having not eaten white carbs in who knows how long, said friend was perfectly content inhaling the soft roll that came on top. My fish tostada officially goes on the list of things I will most certainly think about often and want to eat again with an Incredible balance of flavors and textures...perfect.
