Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The za here is absolutely phenomenal! In fact, my friends and I still talk about how delicious it was months after we visited Chicago for the first time. I have never had a better slice of pizza before in my entire life. The ridiculously long line is most definitely worth the wait. I would wait in that line a thousand times over for another taste of Lou Malnati's! If you're visiting Chicago and looking for a true deep dish pizza experience, then Lou Malnati's is THE place to go!
