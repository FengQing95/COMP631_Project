Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chicago is one of my (and my husband's) favorite places to visit! Whenever we are here we ALWAYS get Lou Malnatis! There is good deep dish all over the city, but Lou's is our personal favorite. Last time we were here (about a week ago) we got the the Malnati Chicago Classic, and added mushrooms and spinach. It was just as amazing as always!!
