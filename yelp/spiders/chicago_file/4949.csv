The Purple Pig////For the next round of food we got the Octopus a la plancha, some of the most tender Octopus I've had ever! Next we had the deviled eggs - fantastic again. And we had also ordered the Chicken thigh kebabs which were some of the juiciest kebabs I've had in the US! Our order of the kebabs was delayed a bit so they gave us a complementary fried Manchego cheese which hit the spot as well.
