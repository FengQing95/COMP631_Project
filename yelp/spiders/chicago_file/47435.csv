Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had the greatest time this past Saturday night at Cafe Baba Reeba. We arrived at 8:00pm, though we had an 8:30pm reservation. We were able to find a table in the bar for our party of 3, so we stayed there to start our evening. Marilyn, our server, was absolutely incredible. Sharing a pitcher of sangria, we ordered nine plates, each as good as the next, and finished with two delicious desserts. Marilyn's suggestions were excellent and the food came out hot and timely. We plan on making this restaurant a must for all our Chicago visits! Â
