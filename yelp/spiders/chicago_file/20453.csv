Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Initially, it was bit overwhelming. We could barely get in through the door there were so many people. Here's what you have to do: push your way in. Most people there are just waiting for their table. Find the person who is holding a clipboard. They were probably be straight ahead from the door. Put your name down and then get in the cashier line on the right to preorder your pizza. They will time this with your spot in line so your pizza will be warm and come out shortly after you get a table. Then wait until they call your name. Don't go far!
