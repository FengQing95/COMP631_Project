Smoque BBQ////Finding such an odd location and the parking can be difficult, and we had to wait about 30 minutes just to order and find seats. The location is extremely small, and I would definitely recommend ordering to go in order to avoid the seating hassle. The sides were OK, nothing out of this world.
