Smoque BBQ////I've been a fan of Smoque ever since it opened.  I am unabashedly addicted to good brisket, so when I order from there, I typically get half to a whole pound.  What's wrong with having it for b'fast?  I always order over the phone and then pick up so as to avoid the line of 10-12 people that always shoot me a mean look when I just walk up, bust out the plastic and then walk out in the span of about two minutes.  I really like their bbq sauce, I think it has celery seed or something which gives it a distinctive tang.  The fries are solid, and the cobbler is right there.
