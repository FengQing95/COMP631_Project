Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had an appetizer sampler, a large pepperoni deep dish, and another large deep dish with spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes. I'm not a pepperoni person (or a mushroom person) but I loved these pies. The cheese is thick and gooey, the sauce is tasty, and the crust is flaky. I preferred the simple pepperoni over the specialty pizza, but both were quite good. Appetizers were just okay.
