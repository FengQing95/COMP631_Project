Little Goat Diner////To start, we were quoted a 45 minute wait that ended up being nearly two hours. The host didn't apologize or take the initiative to keep us updated. We found out by repeatedly going back and asking. I understand this place is popular. I understand a wait is to be expected. But if the quoted wait time is more than half an hour off, a free cookie or pastry or coffee would be the nice thing to do. If I hadn't been there with friends, I would've left for sure.
