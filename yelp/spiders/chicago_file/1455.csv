Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This place is absolutely amazing! Great chocolate chip waffles, amazing gluten free pancakes, fresh fruit and awesome omelets. Price is very reasonable for such large, delicious portions. Definitely a new favorite place. If you're traveling to Chicago make sure to visit!!
