Little Goat Diner////Recently moved to Chicago (from Atlanta) and I can say, hands down, the best food I've had in the city. I ordered the biscuits and gravy, because I was missing southern staples. Don't tell my grandma, but this was the best gravy I've had in my life. Plus it was so filling! All the sides are truly meal sized. I'd suggest splitting a side between 2-3 people. The cheeses covered hasbrowns we're enormous and had the perfect combination of crispy/crunchy and ooey gooey cheesiness. If you ever want real comfort food with the city style atmosphere make sure to drop in for a bite!
