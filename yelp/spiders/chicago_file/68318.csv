Little Goat Diner////Two friends from out of town joined me for a mini-reunion and he perfectly read the times we wanted to catch up and the times we really wanted his help understanding the menu, hearing his recommendations (which were all great!), getting a few more spoons for sharing, and many other ways he took care of us. In everything he did, he addressed all of our needs quickly while making us feel like the most important customers in the entire restaurant. The food, atmosphere, prices, and everything else were just what we heard. Sean's service was among the best I've ever received in Chicago.
