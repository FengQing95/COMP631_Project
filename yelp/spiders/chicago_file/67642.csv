Little Goat Diner////first time, came here on a 4th, great date.  we sat at the back bar, and he was hangry so we ordered the nachos, thinking they were gonna be a snack.  it was ginorm.  we also ordered alcohol and snagged some seats.  we were very happy and content there.  no need to order any more food.
