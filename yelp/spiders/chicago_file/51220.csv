Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////with sherry tomato sauce. I know we ordered more but this is what I remember the most. The tapas were a generous portion, hot and incredibly delicious. We had my darling little great nephew along with us - this joint is genius - they try and seat all the tables with children in an enclosed room so the other diners are not disturbed. But my nephew was an angel because he likes to eat and enjoyed the different foods placed in front of him. Great spot, excellent service, awesome food. Thankful for family.
