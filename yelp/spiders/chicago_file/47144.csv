Smoque BBQ////The atmosphere is very informal, rows of community tables and chairs.  The meal is served on baking trays topped with parchment paper.  The brisket is so tender, you don't need a knife.  The pulled pork is also excellent.  The mac & cheese is especially good and try the brisket chili if is available as a side.  The BBQ sauce is thin and tangy so it doesn't drown the flavor of the meat.   The food definitely makes up for the lack of atmosphere.
