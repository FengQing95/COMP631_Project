Little Goat Diner////I got the pork belly pancake (getting quite the buzz and rightfully so!) in addition to trying the broccoli and cheese puff. If you're from the Midwest, you surely know these. It tasted like those little puff pastry casserole bites your family used to make for special gatherings. I also tasted their version of an italian beef sandwich  **DROOL, the sweet potato tempura side and both I would definitely get again. Also tasted the tuna melt and garlic mashed potatoes. Both were good staples but nothing I was wowed by.  The icing on the cake of the entire visit was to see Stephanie working the line in the open air kitchen. So excited!
