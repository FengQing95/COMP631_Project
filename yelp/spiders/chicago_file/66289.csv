Little Goat Diner////The menu is quite large, and the one downside to that is that not everything is on the same level of greatness as others.  Having been there several times now, I find myself not wanting to try new things anymore for fear of being disappointed with it not being as delicious as my "go to" items which include the Bulls Eye French Toast,  Brenade and Belly, Pork Belly Pancake, and the Fried Chicken.  But with a menu this is expansive, there is definitely something for everyone.   Their bakery is really good too, and their rooftop seating is a cool place to kill time if there is a wait.
