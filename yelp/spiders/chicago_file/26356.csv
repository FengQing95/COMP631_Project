Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Both times I've been to Chicago I've stopped at Lou Malnati's.. Both times I was glad I did. This time, me and 5 friends shared an order of bruschetta and 2 medium deep dish pizzas..The Chicago Classic and the Lou. The bruschetta was so good and perfect for holding us over for 30ish minutes while we waited for our pizza. The pizza... OMG. So hearty. So cheesy. So amazing. I would recommend Lou's to anyone looking for some good deep dish!!
