The Purple Pig////I usually need a little extra convincing if a place is extra "touristy" especially if it's in the heart of downtown. But... I cannot find anything bad to say. Â They have thousands or reviews on Yelp, Google, and Trip Advisor and with this much clout, the data doesn't lie. I can only add to the chorus of people who are in love with this restaurant. It is mediterranean style and the dishes are meant to be shared, so order to your heart's content. Or, you can sit at the bar and enjoy a glass of wine with really good meat & cheese.
