Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went there on a date and we ordered 5 different tapas. We ordered the deviled eggs (which are in the bite size tapas section) and they were delicious! There were 3 of them so we each had one and a half. They suggest that you choose one from each of the 4 types of tapas on their menu (Vegetables/Cheese, Chicken & Pork, Seafood, and Beef & Lamb). We decided to take their advice and got the Goat Cheese Baked in Tomato Sauce, Shrimp with Garlic, Olive Oil, and Red Pepper Flakes, Meatballs with Sherry Tomato Sauce, and the Grilled Flank Steak.
