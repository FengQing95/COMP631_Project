Little Goat Diner////Where to even begin with Little Goat? During a week stay, we made a grand total of 5 visits, most with different pursuits in mind. I would recommend all of the dishes I tried--Tomato Apple soup (I would say the portion of the cup was smaller than expected), their macaroni was beyond decadent. Makes a great side dish to split between two people. The goat cheese included in the oatmeal was beyond genius, and the fruit bowl which includes pineapple, grapefruit, and grapes goes great when ordered together. Be sure to not skip out on the bakery, their Apple Pistachio bread is heavenly, and their coffee is even better. The bakery is accessible through the restaurant or they also have a separate door per access. The bakery also includes a bar, which was also a great place to grab a drink at, especially if you're waiting on reservations for the surrounding restaurants.
