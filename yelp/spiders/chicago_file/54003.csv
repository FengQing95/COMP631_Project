Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The restaurant was very busy when I arrived, which was a good sign. I came with a group of 8; we made a reservation beforehand. Some of our selections included the burrata, baked goat cheese, spicy potatoes, Rioja-braised short rib, chicken and ham croquetas, and the paella valenciana. My favorite were the spicy potatoes and the short rib, and I was not as impressed by the baked goat cheese and the paella. I generally prefer lighter food options, and all of the dishes that we ended up ordering were pretty dense and savory, so it was a bit overwhelming by the end, but that may have just been based on what we ordered. One of our party had a seafood allergy so we didn't get to try the seafood offerings on the menu. We also ordered the sangria; the white wine sangria was one of the best sangrias I've had, although people in the group who prefer red wine enjoyed the red wine sangria as well.
