Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Excellent steak, probably the best filet mignon I have ever had. We began the meal with oysters followed by the bone marrow starter. Highly recommend the bone marrow as it comes with a great house made sour dough bread. Between the dry aged rib eye and the filet mignon, thought the filet was superior. Would also recommend the charred broccoli side as it is the lightest accompaniment for the steak. The other sides are on the richer/saltier side.
