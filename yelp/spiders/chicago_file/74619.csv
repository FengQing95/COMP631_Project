Little Goat Diner////I would like to note that I have only been here for dinner and have never ordered breakfast or brunch here (wow im such a bad millennial lol) although their brunch menu also looks varied and yummy. Their bakery also looks adorable and sells sandwiches (good for on the go and throwing down less $$)
