Art Institute of Chicago////I'm not the smartest guy in the world nor I know a lot about artwork. BUT... visiting museums is always something I try to do in every city that I've visited. I first fell in love with MOMA in NYC when I was there a few years ago and I still can't get over how beautiful art can be. I started to appreciate things like this a little more as I started traveling.
