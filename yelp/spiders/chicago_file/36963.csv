Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As if that wasn't enough, the service was impeccable, the food was INCREDIBLE, and our entire evening was everything we could have hoped it could be. The servings are large (comparable places in NYC give portions at the same cost for about half the size) and everything is utterly delicious - we took home leftovers and they were still enjoyed a few days later.
