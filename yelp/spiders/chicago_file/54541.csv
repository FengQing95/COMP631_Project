Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Visited Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba while visiting Chicago. Amazing patatas bravas! Ordered seasonal sangria which was Mango Sangria and it turned out really nice. We kept repeating the same stuff. I wish they had one of their branches in Bay Area. The ambience is good for a birthday like celebration.
