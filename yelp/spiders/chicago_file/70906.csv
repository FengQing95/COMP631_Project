Little Goat Diner////How is this possible?! I just can't even. If you are broke, but like food too much for your wallet's own good, this is a dream. The recent highbrow-lowbrow trend is really doing it for me. Obviously this is diner food, and obviously it is all amazingly delicious. But everytime I've been, I've also loved the decor, the service, and the cocktail menu -- waiting for a table has always been more pleasant than it has any right to be.
