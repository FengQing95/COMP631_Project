Smoque BBQ////I am from Texas and have been looking for a place where I can find Texas BBQ in the city.  I went there for the first time this weekend and had a sliced brisket sandwhich, with baked beans and cornbread.  It was as amazing as BBQ from home... The beans have great flavor you must try them and the cornbread was perfect very moist and is made which corn kernels...
