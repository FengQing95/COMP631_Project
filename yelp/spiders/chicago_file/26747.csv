Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza is ok, but the service is just terrible! Absolutely the worst service I ever had in Chicago area. First we get seated at the patio, hostess tells us to wait for the waiter to order, and 10 min later the same hostess tells us that they don't have a waiter for patio and we have to sit inside. Inside we get a table staring under blowing AC. After that we asked 5 people to call for a waiter and we still waited for another 15 minutes for our waiter to take our order. And please mind that the place was half empty!!! Definitely check other places of this chain cuz you will die from starvation while waiting for a waiter to acknowledge your presence!
