Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They don't take reservations so sometimes can be a pain for large groups but i thought the pizza was going to be over rated but surprisingly the experience, pizza, apps and service met our expectations and were up to par! I'm not usually a huge fan of deep dish pizza but Lou Malnatis changed my mind :D glad i mustered up the courage to give this place a try. Â (for people who love thin crust pizza they also have a few of them so its easy to mix it up and order a few thin and crispy and deep dish to share for the table)
