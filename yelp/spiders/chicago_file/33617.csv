Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This was my first time there. You walk in and it is very dark but once your eyes get adjusted, it has a very cool, old-time feel with lots of booths and a large old-fashioned bar. We started with the baked goat cheese app and the wedge salad- both were incredible!!! I had the salmon for my entree which was very good. We also ordered the elote corn as a side- it looks a bit like Mac and cheese but boy it was delicious!!! I left the restaurant very full and happy!
