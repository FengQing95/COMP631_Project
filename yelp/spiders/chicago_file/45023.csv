Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Fast forward four years and it was a very different experience. It's always strange when you go with a big group of clients mostly because you want to spend time talking and not necessarily people-watching or being constantly bumped. We arrived shortly after 630p on a Thursday night. At first it wasn't busy. But then it got insanely busy.
