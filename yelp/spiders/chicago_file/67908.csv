Little Goat Diner////I could look past the weaker parts of the menu if the service was better. But our server was fairly slow, forgot my wife's tea (and then failed to bring cream with the tea), dropped the check before asking if we wanted dessert, and affected an obnoxious "old timey diner ambience" attitude, calling the girls "dolls" and laughing each time he put down a plate; I have a feeling it was just as unpleasant for him to act that part as it was for us to hear it.
