Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's is my fav local chain for deep dish. I have never had a bad pizza here. Both the deep dish and thin crust are equally great. Skip Girordano's and head here for your deep dish! The crust here is perfect. They also have an amazing salad that tastes too good to be healthy!
