Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What an incredible meal we had. John, our waiter, guided us through our meal and insured our palettes were satisfied. As an appetizer we had the crab cake. Large enough to share and the remoulade paired perfectly. The rib eye was so tender that you could have used a butter knife. Assorted sides rounded out the main. For desert you must try the lemon meringue pie. Scrumptious!
