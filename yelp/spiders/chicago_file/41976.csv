Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This food definitely took me back to my Barcelona days! These Tapas were phenomenal. Because I went with a large group (in my opinion, the best way to go when dinning at a Tapas restaurant), I was able to try a number of things, from seafood to beef to chicken to vegetables...the works! I think my favorite where the bacon wrapped dates, the short cut of beef and mashed potatoes, and the spinach and cheese stuffed mushrooms. They definitely know how to accommodate both meet eaters and vegetarians, as I was with a mix of both.
