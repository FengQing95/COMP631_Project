Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We went looking for good authentic deep-dish pizza and we're glad we found it at Lou Malnati's. We went there on a Saturday night and early (5:30) -- there was still a 45 minute wait then. But you can order your pizza ahead of time (it takes 35 minutes to cook) so by the time we sat down, our pizza was nearly ready. Don't miss the Malnati salad as an app though - very good choice. Â
