The Purple Pig////The Purple Pig sits toward the back of the lobby of 444 Michigan Avenue. We arrived and were greeted by two friendly individuals who informed us the wait for a table was about 90 minutes. Undaunted, we put our names in and went for a walk outside. It was a beautiful night and we had a little time on our hands. Returning a little over an hour later we sat in the lobby outside the front door of the restaurant waiting patiently for our name to be called. When it was our turn we were directed through the restaurant toward the rear of the dining room. The combination of wood and decorative tile in the bar area was charming. We studied the menu and decided on the Whipped Feta, Grilled Broccoli, Eggplant Caponata, Hamachi Collar, and Burrata Cannoli. For dessert we chose the Pink Guava with Formage Blanc and the Raspberry Tart. The whipped feta was excellent with the whipped feta teamed up with heirloom tomatoes, honey, and cumin served with pita crackers. Yum! Plenty for the four of us to share. The grilled broccoli was the favorite dish of the ones we ordered. The brocolli was grilled to a perfect consistency and combined with roasted garlic, bread crumbs, and an anchovy vinaigrette that was superb. We all loved this dish with its garlicky anchovy goodness. The eggplant caponata was marvelous with the grilled bread topped with goat cheese and then layered with the eggplant, chick pea, celery, tomato, and herb combination. A really nice rendition of this traditional Sicilian dish. The hamachi collar was a first for several of us. It was served with yellow tomato BBQ and romesco and sweet pepper salpicon. The meat was exceptionally tender and flavorful and accented nicely with the sauces. The burrata cannoli had a crisp pastry shell filled with the burrata and surrounded with apricots, olive caramel, and heirloom tomatoes. A delightful dish to finish our dinner with the light pastry shell cracking to reveal the delicious burrata inside. Our deserts to follow were equally special. The pink guava and formage blanc was a luscious guava sorbet surrounded by thrilling sweet accents. The raspberry tart was the raspberriest! A refreshingly satisfying end to a truly memorable dinner. This was a genius recommendation by the daughter. Next time we are in Chicago, the Purple Pig will be high on our list of places to visit so that we can try more of the tempting items on the menu.
