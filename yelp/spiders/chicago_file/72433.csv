Little Goat Diner////Cute little offshoot of Girl and the Goat. I had the Okonomiyaki which is a sort of savory pancake with bits of pork and veggies. It was delicious and came out pretty quickly. I went during the lunch hour on a Sunday. There were plenty of servers but I felt as though my service was sort of slow. The waitress kept walking past our table which was right next to the register. It was slightly irritating but did not take away from the overall experience. Plus it was moderately busy so I understood why they may have been overwhelmed. They have a pretty expansive breakfast menu and the environment seemed very kid friendly. They decor is definitely very old school diner feel without trying too hard.
