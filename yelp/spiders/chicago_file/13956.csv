Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Awful, just awful. Tourist trap. Give me a totinos frozen pizza before Lou malnatis. Even their meatball sub tastes awful. How do you mess up a meatball sub?! I don't know, ask these guys and they'll show you. Subway has a better meatball sub. If you want real Chicago pizza stay away from here.
