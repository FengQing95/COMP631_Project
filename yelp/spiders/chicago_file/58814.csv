Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////recommend trying it. With tapas, there is a great deal of selection but the most disappointing of them was the garlic shrimp. I am a HUGE garlic shrimp fan but this did not cut it at all. Again, tapas is small serving so got five pieces of garlic but it was almost watered down, like there was not a rich taste of olive oil and garlic. I don't know, it was different but not a good different. Please Â keep in mind, this is merely my opinion based off of my love for garlic, to others this may be delicious so try it for yourself. Ironically enough, only took a picture of the garlic because nothing else stood a chance for a picture haha. For dessert we had flan, pineapple sorbet and chocolate cake. Let me tell you, ALLL AMAZING. Can't go wrong with any of them! The waiter was nice too and the bus boys were on top of their game- there was not an empty dish in sight on their watch. So pleased with
