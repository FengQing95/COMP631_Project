Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place IS Chicago deep dish. Get the Malnati special with the sausage ring and lou's salad with a goose island beer. It is the full experience. I have always enjoyed the atmosphere of a busy pizzeria and the wait staff is friendly, knowledgeable and happy to have you there. Â Just remember: The pizza is filling but addictive. Pace yourself.
