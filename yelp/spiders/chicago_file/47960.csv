Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My husband and i love everything. We tried the samon with nuts and it was amazing. Chef Elio is amazing and made wonderful recommensations for us to try. We are very happy with everything. The deserts where even amazing the flan was nice and thick and the caramel banana was busting with flavor.
