Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Decent.  I went here to meet a friend.  Initially, I was impressed with the atmosphere, but then we got seated in the far back room where it had more of a sterile environment.  We ordered the Sangria, which I must say, I've had better, but if you've never had Sangria, I guess its an OK introductory.  The food was fine, nothing spectacular.  Being at a Tapas Bar I was really looking for some bold flavors, but found none.  I think this place is only popular for it's trendy atmosphere.  If you know what good Spanish food is like you might find yourself a little disappointed.  Anyway, I give it a "decent" rating, I know that there is better out there, especially in Chicago.
