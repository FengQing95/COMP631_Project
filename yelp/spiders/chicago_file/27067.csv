Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I got a Diet Coke and my buddies ordered a glass of cabernet. I tried a sip and it was good cabby.  We ordered a Malnati classic with the sausage and cheese.  We also ordered an appetizer, but it didn't come out until we were done with the pizza, so they took it back at no charge. We were so full after the 2 slices of 'za, I couldn't have another bite.
