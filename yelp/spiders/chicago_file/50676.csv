Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I did not plan to eat since we were having sangria in the middle of the afternoon, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had a brunch menu.  I had the city vegetable omelet, and it was perfect.  It was pack full of fresh veggies, wasn't greasy, and didn't have any cheese.  That was better than I make at home, which is hard to do since I get to control all of the ingredients at home.
