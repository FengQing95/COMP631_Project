Little Goat Diner////Watch out on the gluten free menu. Best to tell your server straight away--ordered the nachos because they were on the gluten free menu but it turns out that you have to get them without the cheese sauce for them to be gluten free (don't worry, there's so much melted cheese on them that you won't miss the sauce). Our server was able to catch it in time (props to him). Basically, just because it's listed on the gluten free menu doesn't mean it's automatically gluten free. Also there are a ton of asterisks for products containing soy sauce and other secondary sources of gluten, so while there are a range of options available, about 1/3 to 1/2 of the gluten free menu isn't really gluten free (it's more wheat free). That said I had a really good meal, felt like I had enough options that weren't starred, and most importantly, I didn't get sick. I'm a fan and it's a fun place to go.
