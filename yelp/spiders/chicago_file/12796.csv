Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If I were a pizza, I'd be a Lou Malnati's Classic -- meaty, cheesy, and goes well with beer.  I love the fact that they get the proportions just right, so the mouthful of warm, goopy tomato sauce is balanced by sausage and cheesy goodness.  Since this location is near the Mag Mile, be prepared for some serious wait times unless you go early or late.
