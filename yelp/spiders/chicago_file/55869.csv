Smoque BBQ////I recently moved to Irving Park for the summer from Spring, Texas and had to try the much hyped Smoque. It was crowded and noisy but what BBQ place isn't? The beans were terrific with good flavor, the slaw excellent and the Mac and cheese very good. The brisket was moist, tender and almost devoid of flavor. There didn't appear to be a rub on it, just black smoke without much taste. The meat grey. It almost seemed like someone cooked it in water and finished it in a smoker. My wife, who was reluctant to go with me, said on previous visits, the taste was about the same but the meat dry. Sorry but this wasn't close to the real thing.
