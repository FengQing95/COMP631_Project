Art Institute of Chicago////The 4 stars vs. 5 is for the wonky layout of the art institute. This museum is 2 separate buildings joined by a central staircase so going from SE building to NE building calls for walking up to the center crossing over then going all the way back. CUMBERSOME. Even when planned out.
