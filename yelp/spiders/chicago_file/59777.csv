Smoque BBQ////We ordered a couple platters and added a portion of a couple different meats to our order. The meats were so tender and moist. Everything was really good.  Love the peach cobbler.  Their cole slaw is an excellent side to go with the meats. I can't wait to go back. The staff is very friendly.
