Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////When we were finally seated, we had a hard time getting someone to take our order. Another party that had been seated around the time that we had were already starting to eat their tapas, and we still didn't have anyone come up to our table. I eventually had to let someone know that we were ready to take our order in order to get a waiter to our table.
