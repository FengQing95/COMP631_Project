Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Hosted my sister's bridal shower here on July 12 and it was fantastic!!  Alison was excellent to work with through the entire planning process, very professional, prompt and excellent communicator.  My sister has gluten and cow's dairy dietary restrictions, and Alison checked everything on the menu to make sure the dietary needs were met.  They even had gluten-free bread to go with some of the dishes.  Josh was our server at the event and was fabulous!  He made sure everything went smoothly, it was so stress free and perfectly timed.  All of the food was delicious and the only reason there were leftovers is because there was just so much!  I have always loved Cafe Ba-ba-reeba for a fun dinner out, and now it will be top of my list for any event I need to host.  Such a great day!
