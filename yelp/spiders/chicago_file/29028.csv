Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Classic Chicago deep dish pizza is to die for. It's the best pizza I've ever had in my life! :) We came about 9:20 pm.... parked right outside the restaurant...as soon as we walked in.. we got seated right away. Although we had to wait 40 minutes for the pizza.. it was worth it. If you're too hungry upon arrival, get yourself some appetizers.. we had calamari and it was amazing too
