Smoque BBQ////I have no complaints whatso-ever.  And I have to say, the people around me didn't seem to either.  There was a family of about 7 people, who ordered various items and literally made them disappear within minutes then decided to order a couple pounds of brisket and some ribs and various other items to go.
