Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I do love my Lou's... but this place is always, always packed. The service can be slow--- but if you try to order ahead of time with the hostess, it will definitely speed things up! I always get the Lou's Salad and the cheese deep dish pizza... both are delicious! Â Make sure you end it with the cookie pizza ;)
