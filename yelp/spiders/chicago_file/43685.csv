Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////lt's a good place to hang with friends. If you eat here you def should order their tapas! Me and my friends all like the sausage with potato, the octopus and the shrimps.  If you would order the octopus, get the grilled one instead of the fried rings(calamari).  ...  For the drink, I usually don't drink,,, but their mango sangria is very tasty.  When finishing the meal with desserts,  I love the caramel flan and the mango sorbet.
