Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Atmosphere was pretty good here, too. It's a pretty dark place, I personally enjoyed the lighting. Wasn't too bright, but wasn't too dark and I could see the menu okay. Music was at a reasonable volume, also. Only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was how close the booths were; I could overhear the table behind me which was kind of annoying. Wasn't a big deal at all, just something I noticed and it didn't negatively effect my meal in any way.
