Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The menu is far more diverse and unpredictable than a typical steakhouse and as much care goes into the non-steak entrees - this is not a venue where if you opt out of steak you are receiving an inferior meal. Everything we ordered was well executed and delicious. For starters I had a half dozen oyster that were beautifully presented on a large stainless steal platter illuminated by a candle in the center; they were served with both a mignonette and a cocktail sauce with freshly grated horseradish (you choose from four different oysters and can mix and match in groups of three). My wife's baked goat cheese with a tomato sauce and garlic bread was decadent and the wedge salad with a large, thick slab of maple glazed bacon was equally outstanding. For entrees we decided to do an order of fried chicken as well as the 24oz aged bone in dry aged rib-eye with bone marrow to share (with a loaded baked potato and elote for sides). The fried chicken was the best I have ever tasted; thick, perfectly crisp exterior and juicy, flavorful meat. The rib-eye was a monster in size; cooked a perfect medium rare it nearly melted in your mouth and possessed remarkable flavor. I strongly recommend this strategy of sharing a steak as well as a non-steak entree when dining as a couple.
