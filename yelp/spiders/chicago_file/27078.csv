Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place was at the top of our list while visiting Chicago and it definitely didn't disappoint! We came in around 12:30PM on Sunday and we put our name down and were seated after 5 minutes. Good thing we came when we did because people started piling in soon after us. There's tons of memorabilia around the restaurant which gives it an authentic feel.
