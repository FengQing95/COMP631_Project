Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Despite looking like so many generic restaurants in the first floor of a newly built or renovated luxury apartment building, this is still a lou malnati's and it is still excellent. Also, the person on the wall behind the register is either Lou Malnati who looks like Newman from Seinfeld or it's actually just Newman from Seinfeld. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
