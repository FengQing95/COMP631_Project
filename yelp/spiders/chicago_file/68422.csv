Little Goat Diner////I've been to LGD twice and the food's been just ok.  Maybe it is that my approach is less-is-more and I respect a restaurant or a home-cook that can make a delightful meal with just a few ingredients.  Here at LGD, it seems to me there are layers of flavors -- and I can respect that (for example, I love Indian food) -- however, the two dishes I have ordered have just been ok.  I would definitely give it another try (let's say if my wife really wants to go or if out of town guests really want to go) but i would not seek it out myself.
