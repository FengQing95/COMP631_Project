Art Institute of Chicago////As good as an art museum in the states can get. It's ranked maybe directly #2 after The Met NYC to me, a lesson obtained here: size doesn't matter, other things come into play. I always visit whenever I'm in town and have some time, I even tend to make time to take a spin in it, even if a fast partial spin. This museum is big, with many sections, wings, visiting exhibitions and global collaborations/affiliations. Nice building, well lit and well organized. One of the nicest museum shops I've been inside in the states regarding ideas of souvenirs available. From Dali to Renoir to Van Gogh to Monet and more they're here. Different sections on different floors. I liked the very beautiful Islamic art wing! I also one time spent most of my time just watching a beautiful documentary at the photography wing at the lower level "that time I also came the next day and directly headed downstairs and watched it again". Good location at the south border of Millennium park, accessible walking from the park either crossing the street or via a connecting cool small pedestrian bridge.
