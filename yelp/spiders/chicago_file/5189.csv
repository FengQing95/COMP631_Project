The Purple Pig////The Roasted Bone Marrow with Herb Salad and Sicilian Sea Salt was delicious without being too greasy. The large bone was served with several pieces of thick crunchy bread, some greens, and sea salt. A spoonful of that bone marrow with that bread, and I was in heaven! We were basically fighting over the last pieces of that bone marrow!
