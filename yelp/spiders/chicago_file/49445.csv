Smoque BBQ////I have to say thank you to my friend Eric for introducing us to this place. You really can't go wrong with anything here. The brisket is my favorite, so tender and juicy and with the sauce just pushes it over the top. Thanks to the owner Al too. He was so cool and gave our friend a free shirt cause he's moving to Baltimore. The sides are ssooo good too. I'm not a big fan of beans, mac n' cheese, fries, or cole slaw, but there I will have one of each thank you. The only downside might be that the line to get in can be long and the place is usually crowded, but isnt that a sign of a place with great food? And it's definitely worth the wait.
