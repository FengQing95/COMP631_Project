Smoque BBQ////the line can get long but it's a pretty quick turnaround for a smaller sized restaurant.  and even with the order at the counter and pick up your food style, the service is great!  i had a man (maybe the owner or manager?) come up to our table to make sure everything was ok and made sure we had the hot bbq sauce and jalapenos to eat with the brisket!  they help you with the seating so you don't have to hover around people as they eat just to get a table.
