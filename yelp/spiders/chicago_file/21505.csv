Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our first pizza stop in Chicago!!! Yep holy deliciousness!! (can you tell this was my first time to Chicago?) Make sure to order the deep dish FIRST because it takes about 30-45 min to cook- in the mean time, the bruschetta was sooo good and for sure of course amongst the top 5 I've had!!! Would highly recommend not only for the food but the service was phenomenal. Will definitely be coming back next trip to Chicago
