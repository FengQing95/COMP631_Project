Smoque BBQ////One more thing - my palette may not be refined, but barbeque isn't the most demanding of dishes.  As I see it, the difference comes in two basic angles: the smoke flavor of the meat and the taste of the sauce.  Smoque delivers a nice cedar flavored pork sandwich and a citrusy barbeque sauce.  There's a lot of hype here, but you'll probably walk away satisfied with your meal.
