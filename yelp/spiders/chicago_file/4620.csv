The Purple Pig////As you can see I have been here several times before where I enjoyed my prior lunches. My party of 4 decided to return here again for lunch. Because this place is noted as a tourist trap, I really don't mind being trapped here in this particular restaurant. We knew to arrive here early around 11:30am when they first open because there is always a line outside to enter this restaurant for lunch. We waited inside the adjacent office building. We were seated almost immediately again in the adjacent tented area.
