Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came to Chicago In October and went to Giordano's so on this trip i figured I'd try Lou Malnati's... worst decision ever! Can we say tasteless crust.. I had an individual cheese and my husband had the Chicago classic we were both so disappointed! They were both tasteless and looked like a Pizza Hut individual pizza. We went there cause there were so many great reviews. Pizza was bland and crust was tasteless. Definitely a one and done for me. Go to Giordano's, way better and drinks are cheaper.
