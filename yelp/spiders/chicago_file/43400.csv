Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been to this place quite a few times.  Once or twice with one other friend, and a few times with a group.  I have never been disappointed.  The food is delicious and the atmosphere is great.  What I love most about this place is the drinks.  Their sangria comes in the traditional format, but they also have some flavored versions of it.  You must try at least one other flavored sangria.  As for the tapas, everything is good, and I can't say I have ever had anything bad.  But obviously nothing is SUPER GOOD.
