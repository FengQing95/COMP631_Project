Smoque BBQ////Considering the crowds here, the food comes out reasonably fast. Since it is located "on my way home" from work, I only go to Smoque on a whim to see if they still have food. Smoque picked up a somewhat dubious distinction for literally running out of food because the place was so popular. I have passed by this place on a Wednesday night around 630PM last year and there was a little sign on the door saying that they closed early since they sold all their food. Amazing! I suppose nowadays they have a better feel of how much food they have, so hopefully they do not have to close early anymore.
