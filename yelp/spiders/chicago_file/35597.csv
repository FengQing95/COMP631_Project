Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So we try calling last night at 630 and are told nobody waiting. We live in the neighborhood so we arrive and are seated in the bar. Nice but not quite as nice as the nearby open tables. Nope- those are saved for "reservations". Okay, I get it. Create a sense of scarcity and people will value the experience even more.
