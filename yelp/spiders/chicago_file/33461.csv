Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This was my favorite restaurant on my recent trip to Chicago. I loved everything about it. The dimly lit, speakeasy like atmosphere was so cool. A throwback to older eras. The service was some of the best I've received- extremely friendly and attentive without being overbearing. And of course, the food was spectacular.
