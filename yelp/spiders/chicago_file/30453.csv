Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For the pizzas, we settled for the large Lou and a large sausage thin crust. Be warned that the deep-dish pizzas take about 30-45 minutes to prepare since they make everything fresh. Once our pizzas came, we all looked forward to digging in, and at the end, we weren't disappointed. The pizzas definitely filled us up and were delectable. We even had a few slices left over to take home.
