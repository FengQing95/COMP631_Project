Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went here on a Sunday evening as part of a group of eight (one of our party made reservations - not sure if you can only do this only for large groups but if you can make them,I would recommend this as it was crowded on a Sunday at 7:30). We enjoyed a large assortment of tapas and all were excellent (patatas Brava, squid, Brussel sprouts salad were just a few). The paella is excellent and a larger portion than the tapas. The sangria (four varieties) is refreshing although the alcohol content seemed low - not a bad thing. The desserts (we tried two- the chocolate cake and the marcona almond caramel bar) were the perfect size to end our meal on a sweet note. Only complaint is that the noise level is a bit high so it made it challenging to converse with our group.
