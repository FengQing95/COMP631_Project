Smoque BBQ////Can be challenging.  There's a lot behind the place that has restrictions on when it can be used for Smoque patrons, and it is real precarious.  There's metered street parking available, but if you search a bit, you'll find free street parking as well.  Other than Smoque, there's not much worthwhile in this area.
