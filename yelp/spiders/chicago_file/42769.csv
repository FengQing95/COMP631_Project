Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Anyways. From the get go, the rooms were way too packed. I was hardly able to squeeze by people to get into or out of my seat. The waiter didn't come to our table for over 20 minutes. The food was mediocre to unappetizing (I still can't understand how the scallops were so rubbery). And the bill still topped $100 for the two of us. Luckily.... that's how much our gift card was. Thank goodness... I would not have been too happy to pay that out of pocket.
