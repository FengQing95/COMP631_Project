Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////By far the best pizza I've ever had. Covered in toppings, thick flaky crust, flavorful sauce. It has everything you could ever want in a pizza. A slice or two goes a long way, three of us couldn't finish a large. Only downside is the wait is painfully long for dining and take-out. Its a busy place though and I'm sure it takes a while to cook the pizza through so I won't hold it against them. You can always grab a drink at the bar while your waiting too.
