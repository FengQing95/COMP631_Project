Little Goat Diner////The menu features pretty classic diner food -- all day breakfast, some sandwiches, and some entrees. I decided to go with the corned beef hash with the eggs over medium. It was really good! I did wish the pieces of corned beef were a bit smaller, but it's easy enough to cut up with a knife. The potatoes were good, but I also wish they were crispier. However, the dish was still really flavorful and not too salty or oily!
