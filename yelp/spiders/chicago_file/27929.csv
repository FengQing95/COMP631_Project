Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Loooooong wait, huge crowd, totes worth it! I love Lou's since the first time I had Chicago pizza I fell in love. It an actual pie. Two slices and you're out! Don't worry about how many people are standing outside waiting patiently, they have a good system you order your pizza while you wait for your table. All in all will go again in a heartbeat!!
