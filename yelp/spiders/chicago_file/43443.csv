Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Lastly, the atmosphere is a fun.  Well lit, lots of different rooms and enough energy to keep your senses dancing.  The bar seats are fun, but they fill up quickly since they are first come, first serve.  The only thing that must stop is the loud speaker calling of names for tables.  This gave it a very cheesy feel and really detracted from what was normally a hip vibe.
