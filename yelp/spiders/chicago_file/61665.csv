Smoque BBQ////Ya'll (no? ya'll doesn't work here? sorry, I'll never do that again) are missing out if you haven't tried Smoque. True to its name, the bbq'd meats definitely have that distinct smokey goodness. I tried a little bit (ok...a lotta bit) of everything, and I definitely was not disappointed. And it's not just the meats, it's the sides too! Definitely one of my favorite BBQ joints in the city. Just be prepped to wait for a table if you get there during peak dinner time. Ya'll.
