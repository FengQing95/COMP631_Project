Little Goat Diner////Decent. After reading all the great reviews and having it be a food experience by Stephanie Izzard, I was very excited to try this place. I went with 3 other friends around 10pm on Saturday. I was afraid we would have to wait but we were seated right away. The selection of food Â here was pretty interesting. We ordered some nachos (gigantic and definitely not for one person), chicken tenders, macaroni and cheese, the Korean burger, and parathas burrito. The Korean burger was probably the best of everything that we ordered. The only reason I had to give the Little Goat 3 instead of 4 stars was due to the service. The waitress came to our table a total of three times: take our order, fill up our water after waving her down, and receiving our checks also after waving her down. Despite the terrible service, I do plan on going back here to try some of their other selection.
