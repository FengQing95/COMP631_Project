Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So how good is Bavette's? It was so good that half way through my meal, I went onto Opentable to find another seating when I return to Chicago.  That's how good this place is.  From the atmosphere (dark and sexy... great for those who are on dates.  I mean everyone looks good in the dark!), amazing service (Benjamin is one of the best... period.  His mustache also deserves its own call out), and the incredible food (who knew Brussels sprouts could be better than a steak?).
