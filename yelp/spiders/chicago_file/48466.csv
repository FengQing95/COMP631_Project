Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great brunch with room for large groups if you get a reservation. We ordered small plates to share, and it was extremely affordable while we were able to get stuffed. Our favorite dishes were bacon Mac, short rib bocadillo, and citrus French toast. Have a fun Bloody Mary bar to top off your brunch. I am excited for next time to try the breakfast paella.
