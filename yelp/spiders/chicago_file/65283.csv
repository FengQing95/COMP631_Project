Smoque BBQ////Get the sliced brisket by the pound. It's a ton of meat and the value is great. Came here on a Sunday afternoon at 3:30pm and luckily there was no line. Grabbed some sliced brisket and a few sides. I had everything on their menu and everything is delicious. Make sure to get the peach cobbler!
