Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I cannot wait to return to Chicago and when we do, this will be the place we go on our first night. We have not stopped talking about the steak since we left that night. I honestly think that our friends are sick of hearing about our life-changing steak experience at Bavette's but I couldn't help sharing just one more time. If you're in the mood for steak and you're in Chicago you will NOT be disappointed!
