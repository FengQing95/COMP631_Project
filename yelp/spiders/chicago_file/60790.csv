Smoque BBQ////The parking situation was a little iffy... They do have a parking lot behind them (only during the off hours of another business, so after 5:30).  We found a spot, but the lot was nearly full.  There was a guy outside in an orange vest that they had hired to deal with helping people park in the right areas.  The street had some street parking but other places were zoned, and I overheard him telling someone else they had hired him because some crazy old woman was taking pictures of all the cars that parked in the wrong place.  It's nice of them to hire someone, I know most places would just not worry about it and let the customer worry about being towed.
