Little Goat Diner////Here is an example. I ordered the fried chicken French toast. It has a runny egg in the middle and delicious syrup on top. only problem is that instead of actually being fried chicken what is served his chicken fingers. Look at photos of the dish on yelp if you do not believe me. Kinda misses the whole point of the dish doesn't it?
