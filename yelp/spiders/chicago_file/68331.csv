Little Goat Diner////Omg. What the f Stephanie?  You freakin rock!!!  Went w my husband and 22 month old on the coldest day in Chicago. Along w the rest of the world. We waited 25 min ish in the bar area at little bread. I kept neurotically refreshing my "no wait" app to see how many people were in line in front of us. What a great new tool.
