Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first visit to Chicago and everyone I asked said I HAD to go to Lou's. I have no idea why so many people think this place is the best. I can't even give it a mediocre. I ordered a salad that was obviously from a bag and was ready for the compost bin. It was garbage. And the pizza...seriously, I Â have had better frozen pizzas. For all of the others who said there is better pizza in Chicago-I certainly hope so! In addition, the place was dirty and the service horrible.
