Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered two medium sized pizzas, the Malnati Chicago Classic and the Lou, and one individual cheese pizza. I really loved the Malnati Chicago Classic as the meat was soooo good. The Lou was just okay since it was vegetarian. The cheese pizza had some quality cheese on it.
