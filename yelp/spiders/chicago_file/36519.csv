Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Let me preface this by saying I was brought here by a friend who ADORES this place and thinks it is the BEST steakhouse in Chicago. I was very impressed by the decor and service. Â We had a minor issue, so we brought it up to our waitress. Within 1 minute, the manager was at our table, apologizing. The waitress and manager more than made up for our problem.
