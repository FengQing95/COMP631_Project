The Purple Pig////Easily the best and most enjoyable meal I've had in the city. Apparently the wait here is notorious for being, on average, 1-2 hrs long. No reservations taken. But on both attempts that I've visited, I've either been able to sit right away (for 2) on a Saturday night at 5pm, or like last night, was told it would be a 1.5hr wait and ended up being 15mins (for 3) at 7pm on a weekday.
