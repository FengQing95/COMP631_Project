Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My mom and I ate here for dinner after a recommendation from a family friend. We  were in the mood for sangria so this place was right what we were looking for. In the taxi after telling the driver we were headed to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, he tried suggesting another tapas bar that wouldn't be as noisy/crowded. Since my mom and I sometimes like people watching, we  didn't have a problem with Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba being a hot spot.
