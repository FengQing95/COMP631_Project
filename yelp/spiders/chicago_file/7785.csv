Art Institute of Chicago////Marc Chagall's stained glass piece, 'America Windows,' strikes me with awe every single time I view it.  I never tire of studying Picasso's 'Old Guitarist' (look closely enough, and you can see where Picasso painted over an earlier composition to change the placement of the man's head).  Edward Hopper's 'Nighthawks' is one of my favorites.
