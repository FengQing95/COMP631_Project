Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For entree i had the Stroganoff which was super tasty and surprisingly light.  I normally associate this dish with tons of heavy sour cream based sauce.  This was the opposite, with a more sparing yet super rich and delicious sauce which was sufficient to flavor the entire dish with overwhelming it.  I was skeptical, but so many reviews said it was great i had to try.  Spot on.
