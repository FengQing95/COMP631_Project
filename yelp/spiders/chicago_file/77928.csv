Little Goat Diner////I ordered the breakfast "burrito" with avocado and bean salad. It was not at all what I expected. Very soggy naan with an egg, tons of avocado, and a few beans sprinkled. It was very bland and had hardly any hot sauce. I don't normally complain about avocado because I love it! But... an avocado and bean salad should have more than 10 beans in my opinion. The ratio was just very off.
