Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is the thing though - the food made me very sick 10 minutes after we left. I can tell that the sausage on the deep dish pizza was not done. It was a little pinkish so I didn't get seconds of that. Now, this could be for one of two reasons, maybe both - them rushing all-you-can-eat product to feed 6 adults and 21 children or this is just how their food is. I don't know.
