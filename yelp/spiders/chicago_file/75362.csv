Little Goat Diner////I love places that put on a great breakfast / brunch. This place was AWESOME..!  Very busy on a Sunday morning... that's a good sign. Excellent coffee... special Goat Blend from Dark Matter coffee.  I had the Okonomiyaki, which was also AWESOME.  The whole staff was friendly & very invested in the operation. I'll be back for sure.
