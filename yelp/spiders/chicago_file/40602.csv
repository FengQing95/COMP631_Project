Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For cocktails we tried the Rosa, French 75, and an Espresso Martini. All DELICIOUS! For an appetizer, we enjoyed fresh East Coast Oysters. Moving to dinner, we indulged in a Porterhouse (not on the menu but a special for the evening), alongside Brussel Sprouts and Mashed Potatoes. And no perfect birthday dinner would be complete without dessert! So we went with the Carrot Cake (so good ).
