Little Goat Diner////Little Goat Diner has a great vibe right when you step in. The decor is fun and so is the menu. I've ordered the Reuben with kimchi before and it's a great combination. The crab dip is also delicious and a generous serving. The Choco Taco dessert they were offering for a while might be the favorite thing I've ordered. The sour cream ice cream in it is amazing. The prices are reasonable considering the quality of ingredients.
