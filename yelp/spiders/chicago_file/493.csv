Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The breakfast burrito was decent in size and came with chorizo, scrambled eggs, and poblano peppers with a heaping serving of hash on the side. The peppers added a good amount of spice to the burrito which I liked. Most other breakfast burritos I had had were pretty bland and required a lot of additional hot sauce to add some more flavor. The serving size was smaller than at most restaurants but I didn't mind because it still left me pleasantly full. The banana bread french toast was great. They bake their own banana bread and comes with a side of chopped banana slices. It wasn't excessively sweet and it didn't come garnished with other things like tons of fruit compote, powdered sugar, etc which I appreciated.
