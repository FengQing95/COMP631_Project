Little Goat Diner////It was just a - okay for me. I came to Little Goat for lunch. I came in and was greeted by a few hostess. I told one of them that I was there to meet a friend for lunch and that she's looking for a parking as we spoke. She told me that she can't seat me until the other party is here, which is fine BUT there were at least 6 open tables at that moment. I would understand if they were busy and I walked in without a reservation. I did not have a reservations but again, there were at least 6 open tables. Soon enough, the host who told me to wait went somewhere and another one came, she asked me if I have been helped and I told her that the other host told me to wait. This new host, gathered up two menus and told me that she's going to seat me anyways since they have a lot of open tables. Thank you very much.
