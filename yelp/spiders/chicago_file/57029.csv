Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been here numerous times. It can be difficult to get a table at peak hours and I don't find the long wait to be worth it. The food is good, and is generally always a pretty pleasant experience. Nothing that I've had I've regretting getting other than the sangria. Don't get that. It's a complete waste. Definitely branch out and try some dishes you haven't had before.
