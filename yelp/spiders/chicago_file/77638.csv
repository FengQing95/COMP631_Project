Little Goat Diner////So I decided to travel to Chicago just for food and this was the first place I went to, to kick off my food adventure. One of my friends told me about this and I trust his good opinion on food so I had to hit this place up. It was a walk from my hotel but it was worth it. Friendly server/bartender that was from Jersey also. In the pictures I attached is what I had and it was really good, I must say.
