Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The best pancakes I've ever had in my entire life. I had the strawberry pancakes and i was so full at the end. The cakes are huge and so filling!! They taste so fresh and the strawberry syrup that they put on it was just perfect. What a great way to start my morning off!! The coffee is great too. It doesn't have that burnt taste that most places give you. 5 STARS!!!
