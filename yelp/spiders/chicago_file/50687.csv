Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Amazing! I've been going to this place for 3 years now and it never disappoints. They have the best tapas in the city. The bacon wrapped dates, and house plate are always amazing. The desserts are awesome and well worth the $3. I always get the flan and my boyfriend always gets the flourless chocolate cake.
