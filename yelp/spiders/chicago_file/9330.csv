Art Institute of Chicago////This is one of those places where you can wander around all day and never be bored. When I find myself back in Chicago I try to spend some time here exploring their permanent collection (especially their Asian art collections!) as well as their rotating exhibitions. This really is my favorite art museum, but being from Chicago I'm probably biased.
