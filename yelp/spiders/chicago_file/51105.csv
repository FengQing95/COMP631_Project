Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////FOOD: Not usually the biggest fan of tapas because I leave hungry, but their portions are huge! For veggies, I liked the spinach & manchengo-stuffed mushrooms. For seafood, I liked the grilled octopus, citrus-cured salmon, and bay scallops empanada. If you really want to be stuffed, get the paella; they claim one order serves two, but the serving size is way bigger. I liked the seafood paella because the bay scallops are so soft and tender; however, my cousins liked the chicken.
