The Purple Pig////They did a great job. Went there for brunch without a reservation and was lucky enough to get a seat quickly. Loved the ambiance and the food was delicious. Highly recommend the truffle sausage and French omelette. Would definitely go back for dinner. They do have a revolving menu.
