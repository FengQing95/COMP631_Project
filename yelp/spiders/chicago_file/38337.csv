Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Fantastic food and incredible service! Started with the bone marrow. Salty, fatty and perfect with their sourdough toast and onion jam. The steak was great, and all three sides (mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese, Brussels sprouts) were some of the best we've had. We couldn't decide between the mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese, went with the Mac but our server surprised us with both! Almost didn't have room for dessert but glad we tried the chocolate cream pie. Cocktails were delicious and our server Barbara made the entire night special
