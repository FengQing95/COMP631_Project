Art Institute of Chicago////I was so excited to come here, but left disappointed. First of all, we had to check in all our items and with a cost as well. Most of the museums I've been to let us just turn our backpacks to the front of our bodies and if we did have to check anything in, it was free. I understand that they want to preserve all their art, but at least be friendly about it. Everyone was so rude.
