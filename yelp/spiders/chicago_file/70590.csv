Little Goat Diner////The Pork Belly Pancake and the Crispy Shrimp Cocktails were to die for!  The shrimp cocktails were paired perfectly with a tangy horseradish and cocktail sauce - ABSOLUTELY DELISH!  We also ordered the Mac and Cheese for our little one and he loved it.  It was cooked perfectly - not too hard or too soft.  The Crab Dip was OK - I wasn't too crazy for it and honestly wouldn't order that again.
