Little Goat Diner////I try the Rueben almost everywhere I go that has it, and theirs was maybe the best I've had. Everything else we had was top notch as well. For the quality, it was very reasonably priced as well. Surprisingly there was no wait when everything else nearby was on an hour or more, although they do have a lot of room for seating. Most definitely worth a stop for seriously good food.
