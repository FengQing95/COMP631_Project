Art Institute of Chicago////I've been to many museums around the world, the Art Institute stands hands and shoulders above most. The curator did a great job with layout and placement of the art so there is a natural flow, that keeps you intrigued and yearning for more. So many pieces I have been wanting to see all my life, seeing all the Picasso's and "A Sunday On La Grande Jatte" were as good as advertised.
