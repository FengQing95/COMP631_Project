Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is my go-to Chicago deep dish place when I have visitors.  After assuring my guests that everything will be phenomenal, I order the same thing every time: the Malanti Salad and the Lou.  The salad is one of the hidden gems on the menu, chock full of blue cheese, bacon, tomatoes, olives, pepperoncinis, etc all tossed in a flavorful vinaigrette.  While the vinaigrette may be a tad on the oily side, chomping down on some greens always makes me feel better about my incoming pizza.
