Smoque BBQ////A note about the line & wait time: We were a party of 3 and went at prime time on a Friday night.  The line was clear to the door and every single table was occupied.  We figured we were screwed and there was no way on earth we would end up getting a table - but we were wrong.  I don't know how they manage to do it, but somehow each and every group we saw was seated immediately upon ordering.  I'll chalk it up to BBQ magic.
