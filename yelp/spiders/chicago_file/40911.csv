Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We tried out tapas for brunch...what a wonderful spin on the tapas experience!!  There was the brunch menu and the regular lunch menu available which is a nice way to appeal to everyone.  When we arrived, there was oil and bread on the table...not necessary for brunch, but all "extras" are appreciated.  We took advantage of the patio area--which allowed a nice amount of space between customers and as it was not al fresco dining on the sidewalk like most restaurants--we were able to ENJOY the more secluded side patio area.  The tapas are about $4-6 each and we tried out three per person (though of course everyone shares!!).  We had the french toast with apples (unusual since the menu said 'mixed berries' but still tasty), waffles with caramelized bananas/cream, crepes (one with eggs/cheese/bacon and one with spinach/artichoke/eggs/cheese), scrambled eggs with chorizo (sliced versus the ground texture which was a little unusual though we were allowed to customize it by adding onions), and of course the mini-churros with dipping chocolate.  It was a nice combination of sweet and savory.  They came at a a nice pace to not feel rushed, overstuffed, or having cold items sitting there while you finished eating the previous dish.  Our dining companions enjoyed the bacon wrapped-dates, baked mac-n-cheese with bacon, the french toast as well, and quiche-like items with eggs, cheese, onion, and potato.  With this "family-style" dining everyone tried any items that seemed interesting and the "tapas" portions were enough to shape with my spouse.  It gave the feel of a brunch buffet while avoiding the typical pitfalls.  The brunch items are very rich, so don't let your eyes get bigger than your stomach!
