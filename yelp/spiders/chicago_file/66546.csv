Little Goat Diner////Been here a few times, had the sloppy joe - great, club sandwich - great. Upstairs event space is gorgeous. One visit I never got my drink but its not stopping me from coming back and I have never had a sub-par meal. Staff is friendly and mostly attentive, from the hostess to the servers and the valet.
