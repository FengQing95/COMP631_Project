Smoque BBQ////As for my own opinion, let me just say that beef brisket is one of my favorite foods.  I've cooked it at home (using a recipe that requires 2 days to prepare), I order it frequently at Irish pubs ("corned beef" is almost always a brisket cut) and Jewish delis, and I have had the "real BBQ" brisket in Texas and other parts of the South -- not to mention many joints in Chicagoland and elsewhere.  The brisket at Smoque was at least as good as any I've ever had!  So good -- and so much more enjoyable because of how hard it is find it prepared this perfectly!  I've had plenty of dried-out and/or tasteless and/or overly fatty brisket in my life -- trust me, this is the real stuff, done right.
