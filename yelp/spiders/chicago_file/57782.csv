Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Service is a bit slow but the waiters are always friendly and knowledgeable. I enjoy coming here for dates / 1 on 1 dinners as opposed to groups, as I find the food coming out randomly a bit hard to adjust to when in a bigger group. Unless you're truly sharing with all people at the table, I often feel uncomfortable eating when others don't have anything yet.
