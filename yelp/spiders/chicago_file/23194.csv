Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we arrived on a Tuesday night around 8, the wait was 30-35 minutes. The good news is that they input your cell number into this pad and Â text you when your table is ready plus it also tells you what position you are in line. We're from Miami and we wish the restaurants there were as organized. You also preorder the pizza you want when you walk in so that when you finally sit down the pizza is almost ready for you to enjoy.
