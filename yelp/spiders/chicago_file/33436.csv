Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Wow.  I mean WOW!!!!! The very definition of a Chicago steakhouse.  Lots of dark woods & dim lighting.  A mix of humanity ... couples on dates, married couples on date night, businessmen, groups.  Nice bar in the center of the restaurant - super friendly knowledgeable barmen; they made excellent recommendations for scotch and whiskey.  Was sad to leave the bar when they called our table.  The food & wine ...  exquisite!  Service was attentive.  Not inexpensive but worth every penny.  Reason enough to visit Chicago.  Boston has nice steakhouses, but wishing we had one of these.
