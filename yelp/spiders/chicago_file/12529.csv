Art Institute of Chicago////Even with viewing this museum online, it is nothing compared to the experience in person. There was so much more I got to see that I wasn't expecting. From paintings to photography, sculptures to digital video, there's so much art to digest and appreciate. If you are looking to fill up your trip itinerary or looking for something to do on the weekend, you need to make plans to come here. I hope I can come by again soon!
