Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////good standby for fun atmosphere, good for groups.  they take reservations unlike cafe iberico, the other great tapas place in the city.  awesome sangria in fun flavors - mango, blackberry, etc.  (but i must admit i like red the best) and worth trying the mini-dessert menu (genius!).  bacon wrapped dates, croquettes, stuffed mushrooms, goat cheese on bruschetta a must.
