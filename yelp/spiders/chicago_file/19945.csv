Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best chicago pizza in town.  Been coming to Chicago since 2008 from California and have tried them all deep dish pizza's and this by far is the best.  The classic with spicy sausage and corn bread cruch is heaven.  All the employees are so nice and friendly.  I was just there 2 weeks ago and I can't wait to go back.   It's always packed but lunch show up 11:30 to beat the rush or dinner 5pm or else wait but even then you'll thank me later because it's worth it.
