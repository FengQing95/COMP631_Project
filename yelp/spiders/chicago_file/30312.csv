Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Whenever my family went to eat at the restaurant itself, the workers there were so kind and easy to talk to. They are trustworthy, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, cheerful, clean, and reverent to customers. The workers there before the pandemic always had a warm smile to greet you and that just made you feel right at home.
