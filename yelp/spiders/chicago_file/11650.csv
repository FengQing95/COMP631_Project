Art Institute of Chicago////If you appreciate fine art, a visit to the Art Institute of Chicago will enhance any visit to the area. I make sure to schedule at least a half day to spend at the AIC every time I'm in town. The permanent collection is outstanding but what has struck me on several occasions is the quality of the special exhibits, which are an excellent demonstration of the curating staff's skills.
