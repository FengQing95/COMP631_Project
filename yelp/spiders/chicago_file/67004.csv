Little Goat Diner////Ordered off the vegan menu.   The server suggested the nachos.  I could have made these at home as all it was was chips, guac and smothered in field greens.   The smoked fries were cold.  My colleagues seemed to like their dishes, so perhaps I ordered the wrong thing?   To make matters worse, my dish took 5 minutes longer (?) than everyone else's?  Granted the restaurant was very busy.   It just is not that special.   Count me out on coming back!
