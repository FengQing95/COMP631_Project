Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Had a nice visit and experience here at Lou and I can say already that they are the best. Their store is the great deep dish here in Chicago. This location is so nice because of their attentive, pleasant, and knowledgeable employees. They all know how to properly perform their job and also to treat all of their customers so well. I remember, I ordered Pizza and I have to wait for about 40 minutes, it is for three to four persons, and it is 14 inches in diameter. That pizza is awesome, two slices were enough to satisfy and fulfill your cravings. Their pizza was so fresh and delicious, also really like the butter crust. Absolutely worth it. This has to be one of the best pizza I have ever had and also their place is so incredible. Highly recommend this Lou and try to stop by for you to grab some of their phenomenal food. Will definitely go back here again and will continue to order here at Lou. Thank you for being the greatest deep dish here in Chicago! And also thank you for such a wonderful service. Keep it up guys! Thumbs up!
