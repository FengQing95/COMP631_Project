Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was excited to try the butter crust that everyone has been raving about but I found the crust plain and doughy rather than flavorful and flaky like people had described. The cheese was not gooey and stretchy; instead it felt like I was gnawing through a block of cheese. I'm not a fan of marina so that's why we got the Lou but were disappointed with the lack of flavor - we might as well have gotten the original just for the flavor aspect. The combination platter was alright - you can't really go wrong with breaded and deep-fried foods dipped in ranch - but nothing spectacular.
