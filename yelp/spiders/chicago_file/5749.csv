The Purple Pig////- Octopus: was the most excited about this dish since it was what our friends came back twice for. The dish was delicious BUT it only came with THREE pieces of octopus and the rest were potatoes and green beans. We felt so ripped off, we ended up texting our group chat asking if their portions were just as small. She said there was no way it was only 3 pieces and ended up sending us a picture of her dish when she dined at purple pig. There was probably 5x the amount of what we got.
