Art Institute of Chicago////I was here on a field trip as a chaperon. Having been here on business many times it was nice to just soak up the views. The school attending was assigned a representative from the museum who guided our group to selected paintings that the children were studying. I was both happy and amazed at their knowledge of the artist and of the different styles of painting. Their different interpretations of the abstract art at hand was mind blowing. Our children's future looks bright.
