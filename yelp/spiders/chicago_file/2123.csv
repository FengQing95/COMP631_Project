The Purple Pig////Charcuterie board: Got the premium platter this time, where everything was house made. There were at least 15 types on the platter. No pates or terrines this time, but everything was good in their own way. Standouts: blood sausage, tongue, lardo, and some others I couldn't catch the name.
