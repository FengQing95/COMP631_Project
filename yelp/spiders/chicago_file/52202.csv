Smoque BBQ////can we say carnivore heaven??.. the brisket,,, the ribs... omg this made me loveeeeee non-babyback ribs... and then the pulled pork... the peach cobbler... OMGOMGOMGOGOMG, I can't even write a normal review about this, it's just delicious, plain delicious.... and so cheap for so much food.... I'm even a fan of their coleslaw (I never eat coleslaw, but I ate theirs... I hate mayo so I was so happy it was sans mayo)
