Smoque BBQ////My standard orders are usually brisket or St Louis ribs (sooo good!). The brisket is so tender that when you try to pick up a slice with your fork, it will fall apart if you don't get it into your mouth quickly enough. And friends that I have gone with also speak fondly of their pulled pork (personally I have never tried it), and when I feel like something else besides red meat, I go for their chicken. I know most people might think, "Chicken? Really? If I'm going to get BBQ, I'm getting red meat." Well I've been here enough to want to change it up from time to time, and their chicken is EXCELLENT. Easily some of the juiciest, most flavorful chicken I have even tasted.
