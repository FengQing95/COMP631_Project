Little Goat Diner////Two things on this menu are particularly yummy and I highly recommend - Pork Belly Pancake and Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing.  So I am not a sweet breakfast guy and I love heat and asian flavors.  Both of these really hit the spot.  The Kimchee thing is like a very eggy, crepey kind of pancake with kimchee and bacony goodness woven into it.  Go ahead, try it, you know you want it (even if it sounds a little weird, get over it).  The Pork Belly Pancake is really awesome and not even on the breakfast menu, but order it anyway (you gotta live a little dangerously).  Scallion pancake with a slab of yummy pork belly and a huge mound of cool, crunchy asian slaw.  It's warm and cool at the same time, with salty, spicy, crunchy goodness on top.  This thing is really inspired.
