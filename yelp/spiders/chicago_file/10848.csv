Art Institute of Chicago////I would recommend signing up for a membership here, as admission fees have increased, and if you plan on visiting several times in a year, membership is a bargain as opposed to paying the daily admission fee.  Membership also has its privileges, such as special invitations to interesting lectures, discounts at the museum store, and a member magazine highlighting the current and future exhibits.
