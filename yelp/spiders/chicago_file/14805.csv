Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was arriving from LA into O'Hare and found that they were dying the river green the day I got back.  I called up one of my buddies from college and we went to grab ourselves some Chicago-style deep dish pizza.  My friend recommended this place and it was a knock out of the park.
