Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our group of 5 came here for dinner and it was my first time here, I instantly fell in love. The setting was beautiful, it was romantic and the lights were dimmed. Love the variety of food and they were tapas style! Fun little dinner party place. We order red wine and a few of everything on the menu, the beef skewers and blue cheese were my favorite. I could've ate 5 more orders of it! yum! Can't wait to go back!
