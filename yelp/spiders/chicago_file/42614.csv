Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If I lived in the city, I would be here all the time, but since it's a 30 minute hike, we try to go as often as possible (a couple times a month). Cafe-Ba-Ba-Reeba is awesome. The tapas always come out just right although the timing is a Â little slow sometimes. We've at least liked everything we've tried, although there are, of course, things we LOVE on the menu.
