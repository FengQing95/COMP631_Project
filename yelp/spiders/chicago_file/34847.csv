Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I took my fianc√© here last night for his birthday. It was our first time and we had very high expectations. I was looking at the menu and reviews all day to make sure we got all the "must haves." I am not actually a steak person, so I usually go for fish options at a steakhouse. However ... I could eat this steak any day of the week. We started with the wedge salad which is creamy and dreamy. Tip - ask for them to chop it for you, makes it much easier to eat. Don't even get me started on that bacon ..... truly the best bacon I've ever had and I'm not sure what could top that. For our entree we got the dry aged bone in ribeye, the best steak I've ever had. We got the bone marrow to go with it but would recommend just eating it as is, it's THAT good. We also got 1/2 pound of the king crab, YUM, cracked and ready for you to pull out perfect, sweet, generous hunks of meat. Obviously had to get the truffle Mac n cheese WITH bacon, there's no other way and don't pass this up. The fries with the best garlic aioli in the world. Finally, Klaus surprised us with a piece of the chocolate pie for my finance's birthday. As he knew it was our first time, he wanted us to have the best dessert on the menu. My mouth is watering thinking of that pie.
