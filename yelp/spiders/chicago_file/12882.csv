Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So we finally land in Chicago, and what's the first thing we did? Check out the much raved about deep dish pizza, of course! Aside from being fatty's, we also made it a priority to check it out because we watched an Anthony Bourdain episode where he was in Chicago and described deep dish pizza as a pizza/pot pie... What??? Pizza pot pie? Sounds.. different! Since the place he went to was too far from where we were staying, we strolled over to Lou Malnati's pizzeria...
