Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Thus my feeling of annoyance regarding the service originates from a decpetion.  At first glance, you view the wood walls, the dim lighting, the aroma of the steaks, the quiet clatter of cutlery and china.  Your brain says, "Steakhouse."  However, the bubble bursts when a clone of the guy from the "Two Princes" makes a "crunchy" drink suggestion.  You get really angry when skinny-jeans Mary has an unsolicited wine recommendation, but you soldier onward.
