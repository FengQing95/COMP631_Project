Art Institute of Chicago////We were here for about 2 and a half hours and by that time we were a little museumed out as most people get, but were so so thankful we went the day we did because the next day was a free admission day and the lines were ALL THE WAY AROUND THE BLOCK and full of all kinds of kids, so I don't think our relaxing tour of the museum would have been as nice....so beware for those free days! you save money but you might lose some sanity! you always have to think about cost benefit heh
