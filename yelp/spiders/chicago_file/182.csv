Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I'd have given this 3 1/2 stars but I can't. This is a pretty good breakfast place. We didn't have to wait for a table around 7:30 am on a Sunday (the clocks had just changed, so it was more like 8:30 anyway...). I got the berry bliss pancakes and an omelette and my husband got the apple cinnamon pancakes and a skillet. Everything was decently good, but nothing totally wowed me. The fruit I got on the side was underripe and the omelette was too brown on the outside for my liking. The cinnamon apples on top of my husband's pancakes were not cooked, soft apples but were thick and hard to cut through. Still, the pancakes themselves were good and he said the skillet was good too. I'd say go, but don't expect miracles.
