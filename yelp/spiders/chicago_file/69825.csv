Little Goat Diner////If you're in from out of town or you've bought overpriced real estate within a block of there you'll love this place. If you enjoy good food, prepared well and a relaxing, well designed dining experience don't even go near this place. (maybe try Breakfast Club, nearby. Way better, cheaper, better service)
