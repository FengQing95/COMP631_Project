Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I ordered the classic ribeye Chicago cut. I can't speak highly enough of the quality of the meat, how perfectly it was cooked (proper medium rare seems to be harder to achieve than one would think in many fine establishments), how expertly it was seasoned... it was the best steak I can remember ever having.
