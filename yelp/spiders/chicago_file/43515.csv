Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If you have room for dessert, the sampler platter and the tres leches cake are both great, but the coconut flan absolutely blew me away. Â I've never been a fan of flan and wouldn't have tried it had my sister not gotten it, but now I will never go here again without ordering it.
