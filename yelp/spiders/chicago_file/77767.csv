Little Goat Diner////The bull eyes French toast and the smoked corned beef hash were delicious. So so good!! I think the corned beef hash was my favorite. By far the most flavorful corned beef hash I have ever had. The French toast is really good, the sweet syrup and strawberries taste really great with the crunchy chicken finger. It is not greasy, and very yummy.
