Little Goat Diner////The restaurant itself is setup like a diner with stool seating along a bar and several booths along with with a community seating table.  In the back there is a small bar within the bakery/coffee shop where you can get a drink while waiting for your table.  Neat little hipster setup with friendly and efficient staff in both areas of the restaurant.
