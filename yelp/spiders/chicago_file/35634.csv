Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One of a few recommendations made to me for my Chicago visit.  It was a Friday night with no reservations but was able to sneak into a spot at the bar.  I wasn't in the mood for a heavy meal so I had the Crab & Avocado Salad, the Bone Marrow with a glass of bourbon.  Everything was fantastic, the bartender was very friendly and attentive, the salad was great with plenty of Crab and Avocado.  The bone marrow and toast were piled high and excellent as well.  I regret not trying a steak there but am extremely satisfied with what I had.  Definitely on my list to go back to next time I'm in town
