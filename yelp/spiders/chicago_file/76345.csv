Little Goat Diner////This place is out of the box when it comes to taste. The ambience is very nice and the service is excellent but some of the food wasn't what we expected. The breakfast dishes we tried were traditional meals taken to a new level. I felt the dishes were a bit overdone with spice palates; I feel some dishes could have been taken down a notch.
