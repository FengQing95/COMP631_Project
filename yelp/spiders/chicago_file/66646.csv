Little Goat Diner////Hostess said 30-45mim. They had us sat in 15min.  That's a big win! The breakfast menu is unique and it's the kind of food I expect of a Girl and the Goat sister restaurant. The Dinner menu lacked that same creativity. I realize this is supposed to be a less formal dining experience and I realize it's a different restaurant, but if you're going to keep continuity in the name you have to deliver the same creativity in the menu.  I could eat breakfast there everyday, but I'll probably try something else later in the day. Try the bullseye french toast. It's my favorite menu item.
