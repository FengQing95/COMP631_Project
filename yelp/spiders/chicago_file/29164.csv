Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////But wait, there's more. As I had to unbutton my pants and had no shame gluttonizing my way through the pizza and wings, I had to finish it off with their dessert. And yet again, it was bomb. It's a pizookie Â basically, a chocolate chip cookie with a bunch of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. Idk what's different in this one vs bjs but it was amazingly good. Cookie was good, ice cream and whip cream. Geez, I can go back just for that or any of the three things I had separately.
