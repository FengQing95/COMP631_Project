Art Institute of Chicago////First off, as a student from NU, I got free entry! That automatically makes it amazing. Specifically on Van Gogh, we had to wait 50 mins to get in, which was a lot better than the 1.5 they were telling us. Honestly, I don't get the big deal over his paintings but the Art Institute put a lot of effort into building the exhibit. There were a lot of Van Gogh paintings and good explanations - I really enjoyed.
