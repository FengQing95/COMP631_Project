Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I deducted one star from this place because the freshly squeezed OJ (recommended by some people on yelp) was slightly warm and I expect it to be cold and refreshing. Also this place doesn't serve great coffee. Their flavored coffee is made with syrup instead of flavored coffee beans
