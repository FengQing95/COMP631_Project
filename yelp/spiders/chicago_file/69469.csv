Little Goat Diner////Well-what can I say: Stephanie Izard did it again. Fantastic!! The atmosphere is calming and welcoming, the food is SUPER flavorful and well seasoned (sexy plating), the staff is fun and friendly, prices are very reasonable, and the drinks are killer. Yes-it's busy and a long wait but the text/website showing your place in line makes it a smoother and the bar/bakery/coffee/souvenir area helps to kill time. I also love going to a place for lunch and leaving thinking, "man, I gotta come back and try more". Cheers! We WILL be back. Stephanie ROCKS! See for yourself.
