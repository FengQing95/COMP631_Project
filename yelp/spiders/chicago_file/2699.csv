The Purple Pig////We came to Chicago for 3 days for work. This place took 2 meals out of 3. It only missed us 3 times because the wait would have had us late to our next appointment. This is now my favorite place to eat in Chicago. (I'm a vegetarian btw.) Each dish was made with care. From the Burrata Cannoli, to Heirloom Tomato Fritters, to Salt-Roasted beets, to grilled Broccoli Â to a leek tart, the Purple Pig owes me nothing. I'll be back Chicago and when I'm in town...you already know.
