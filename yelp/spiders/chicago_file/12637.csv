Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////On a day trip with some friends, we found this place because they had a gluten-free, dairy-free deep dish pizza option, which was a necessity for one of my friends. The other 4 of us ordered a large deep dish pepperoni pizza, and it was so delicious that we all devoured our 2 slices in minutes. Mike, our server, was a blast, too. You could tell he loved talking shop with patrons, and he even gave us a free dessert. I highly recommend Lou's!
