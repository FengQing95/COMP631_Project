Art Institute of Chicago////I came here in the month of February when AIC was offering free admission for everyone. It was a little crowded because of this, but it was worth it. There are a lot of famous pieces here, and they're building a new modern wing (I can't wait!!!). It was definitely cool to see famous pieces like "American Gothic," Van Gogh pieces, Renoir, Singer, etc, etc.
