Little Goat Diner////The fat Elvis waffles. The fat Elvis waffles. Did I mention the fat Elvis waffles? Sundays usually have a long wait but if you know you're getting those waffles it's totally worth it. Put your name in, grab yourself a beverage and sit outside. The flower boxes are beautiful! Then dream of those waffles sitting in front of you until you receive that glorious text that your table is ready.
