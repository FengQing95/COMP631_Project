Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was Lettuce Entertain You-quality: inoffensive, surprisingly authentic-tasting in an obviously faux kind of way (Passionfruit sangria? Bitch, please.) and pretty freaking expensive. The people-watching is, obviously, transcendent, especially halfway into that second pitcher of sangria. But if I'm going to eat tapas in Chicago while surrounded by representatives of a much-maligned stereotype of young urban whiteys, I'm going to go to People in Wicker Park, where the much-maligned whiteys are MY PEOPLE and the sangria is stronger AND cheaper.
