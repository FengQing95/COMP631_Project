Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had the "Lou" pizza, with spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, and a trio of cheeses oozing all over the top.  We ordered the small and it was waaaaaaaaaay too much for the two of us.  I think you can have a party of 3 or possibly 4 (if you're only going to have one slice each) and get filled up.  These slices are 2 inches thick (at least)! When I plopped it down on my plate, the cheese was oozing out and the top was bubbly and I think I might have drooled a little bit.  It was the bizzy bizomb! The crust was different, maybe a bit of cornmeal mixed in?  I couldn't tell, I just know that it wasn't competing with all of the toppings, which was great.
