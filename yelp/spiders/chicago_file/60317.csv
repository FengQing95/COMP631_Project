Smoque BBQ////I had the St Louis half slab rib platter with mac and cheese and peach cobbler for my sides. It also came with coleslaw. The ribs were great - not as tender as baby back, but really unique and tasty seasoning. The mac and cheese had great flavor, but it was too runny. I would still probably deal and order. The coleslaw was tangy and delicious. Honestly, the highlight was the cobbler. OH MY GOD. The crust is thick, seasoned and crisp. The inside is warm, sweet, with firm peaches. I had quite the experience eating that dessert.
