Little Goat Diner////in summary: this place has been on my MUST EATS list for literally years (actually girl and goat was, but im too poor to eat there yet) and i am so happy i got to experience this on a beautiful friday morning in february with it being 50 degrees outside. everyone should definitely come here for brunch some time just to experience what the people over at goat are trying to create. this is a wonderful place with beautiful interiors and wonder people and cooks. highly highly recommend! definitely one of my best meals in chicago.
