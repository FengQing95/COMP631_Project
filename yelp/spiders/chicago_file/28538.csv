Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first time ever having Chicago's famous deep dish pizza and although it's a must-try for anyone in town, especially the famous Lou Malnati's, I don't think it's stunning given its price and wait time. This might be an unpopular opinion but Deep Dish Pizza wasn't really anything special in taste and fulfillment. It's just unique.
