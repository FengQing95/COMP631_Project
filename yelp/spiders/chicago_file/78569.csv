Little Goat Diner////My friends and I actually visited this place in late June and it was a great experience! I'm a bit of a picky eater but I've been trying to branch out more, and I can honestly say that we liked everything we tried. Not pictured but we got the crab dip which was incredible and our waiter brought us extra crackers without us even asking. He was quick, had good recommendations and didn't rush us, but also wasn't too chatty.
