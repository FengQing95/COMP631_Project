Smoque BBQ////There are many great things about Smoque BBQ, it's an unassuming place located in a small neighborhood in Chicago. The food was great, with great authentic Texas BBQ taste. The Mac and Cheese tasty and creamy, the coleslaw like it was made seconds ago and the beef brisket to die for! When I'm in Chicago again, I'm coming back!
