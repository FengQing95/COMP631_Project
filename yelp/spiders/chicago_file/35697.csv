Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My boyfriend and I basically had half the menu, and everything was perfect. The service was spectacular as well. I seriously have been non-stop talking about this place for over a week. If you are looking to splurge on a great steak dinner with all the fixins, give this place a try, you will not be disappointed.
