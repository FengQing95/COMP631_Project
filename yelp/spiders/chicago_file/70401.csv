Little Goat Diner////I ordered chili fries, crab dip, and a caesar salad. Their chili was good, crab dip was good, and the salad was the most unique caesar salad i've ever had. Most places just put romaine, parmesan, crouton, and dressing. Little Goat diner adds their own flair, including breaded anchovies, it's totally worth it.
