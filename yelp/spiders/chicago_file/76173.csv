Little Goat Diner////West Loop neighborhood is hipster central and every place here has a pretty cool vibe. Little Goat appears to be primarily a breakfast/brunch type of place, but we were here for lunch and day drinking and they can provide for that as well. We sat at the bar to avoid the wait and Peter took care of us. Had an All American burger with hashbrowns and my wife had the patty melt. Both were spectacular. The buns and bread on both were sublime, they are in fact baked on site, so guaranteed fresh. The drinks Peter whips up are tipsy concoctions you won't find elsewhere. Do you know what Malort liquor is? Me neither, but it makes a tasty beverage. So, if Au Cheval cock blocks your day drinking plans, just head down the block to this place and SMILE. Minus one star for the French Fries. Smoked flavor was overwhelming. Don't mess with simple.
