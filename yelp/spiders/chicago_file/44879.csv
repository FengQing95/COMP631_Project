Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Well we got up and waiting in the packed area surrounding the bar and next to the kitchen. It was so loud you couldn't even hear the announcer ask for the name waiting to be seated. It made me worried we wouldn't hear our name because they don't come and get you. Sure enough an hour later we ask and our table is finally ready.
