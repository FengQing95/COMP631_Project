Smoque BBQ////We arrived early, probably around 4:30 and the tables were already full with a line of people still waiting to order. I was worried we wouldn't be able to sit but as soon as we got in line an employee asked if we needed a table and reassured us one would be ready as soon as we had our food. Another concern I had was that I didn't pick up any of that sweet hickory smoke in the air that I would expect at a real BBQ joint.
