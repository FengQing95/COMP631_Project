Smoque BBQ////My fiance took me to Smoque the other evening so I could try the food he wants catered for our wedding.  We're still debating about Smoque catering our wedding, but I'm totally open to the rehersal dinner.  The BBQ was AMAZING!  He and I split a plate of the pulled pork with 2 sides and it filled both of us up no problem.
