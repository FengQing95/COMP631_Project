Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Fantastic! I got the classic, it was very good. Cooked the way I like it. It takes a while to cook, so don't go when you are in a hurry, but it's worth the wait. Service was good. I sat at the bar and the bartender walked me through the menu. But really the thing you gotta get is a deep dish pizza.
