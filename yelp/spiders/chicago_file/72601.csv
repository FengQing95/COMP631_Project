Little Goat Diner////What can I say besides amazing? I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience here. The service was incredible, the food was excellent and the experience was more than up to par. We had the crab dip; which I strongly recommend. I had the Sloppy Goat - YESSSSS - we also had BBQ Pork, Pork Belly Pancakes, The Fat Club, and The Chickpea salad! All were awesome. If you don't know, this restaurant is owned and the menu is created by a Iron Chef winner, so I recommend you go. I don't know why it took me so long.
