Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time trying deep dish pizza a couple of years ago. We were skeptical at first, but when we tried it, we were amazed!! This is some of the best pizza we've ever had. We get the Lou, and it is worth every single bite! The sauce, cheese and buttery crust are all perfect! Now, when we go to Chicago, we plan to have Lou Malnati's as our first meal, and this gives us a few days to have it again as our last meal. I've seen people walk in with their luggage straight from the airport. It is that good!
