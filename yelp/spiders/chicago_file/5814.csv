The Purple Pig////The purple pig, this place is definitely one of the best to go to whenever you want a chill day, maybe with some friends or even just by yourself. but for my own personal experience, i recommend going in here with your friends just to have and feel the entire hype of the place! The place itself is already a neat view and very pleasing to the eyes, the staff would greet you once you go in with bright smiles and for a person like me, it definitely brightens the mood even more if I'm the one to talk! They would guide you to your chosen seat with you circles and proceed to give you the menu, and discussing it. There are very professional to their works yet also very friendly, very casual and simple. And their menu is highlighted with such delicious and neat foods and drinks, foods like fingerling potatoes, their fresh and well cooked meat and many more, also some drinks to go with! I definitely recommend this place a lot, especially the vibe of it. For a next time hang out, this is surely our pick again. Keep up the great work!
