Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So it's my first time in Chicago and I had to check the box by eating some "Chicago deep dish" pizza. So based on reviews, I decided to go with this place. I knew the wait I was I for just based on the cooking time alone, but brought family members and they were getting restless!
