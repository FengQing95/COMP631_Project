Smoque BBQ////Incredible barbecue!  It is still BYOB though they do not have fancy glassware.  It is set up like a cafeteria, communal tables and all.  One of the owners is usually at the restaurant, shows a true commitment to hospitality.  Too many delicious items to list, although the meats can get a little salty.  Overall, a great experience for a remarkably reasonable price.
