Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Yum yum yum!!! Came here for my husband's graduation celebration. It was one of the best (and heaviest meals) I have had. We got the dry aged rib eye and shared the 22 ounce. It was really amazing! We got the mashed potatoes and mushrooms as sides. Loved the whole meal. The sourdough bread they give is also just lovely. We told them we were celebrating a graduation and they were kind enough to bring us some ice cream on the house Â All in all, wonderful service and a must have steak!!!
