Little Goat Diner////- Entree: half order of biscuits and gravy with a side of cheesy grits: whaaaat. Amazing. This is my fave thing to order, always for a little southern comfort. Little Goat delivered a slightly upgraded version of B&G with pork sausage & mushroom gravy atop a flaky, buttery biscuit.
