The Purple Pig////Pork blade steak - When they brought this dish out, we were surprised at how big it was. This is probably the best value item on the menu. It looked like a super juicy pork chop served with a caesar style arugula salad. The steak was as good as it gets, hands down my favorite dish of the night. It was super juicy and tender, and something about the flavor just reminded me of breakfast. It had a distinct pepper taste, and almost tasted like breakfast sausage in steak form. Highly recommend this.
