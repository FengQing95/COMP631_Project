Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////this was the worst tapas place i have ever been to in my life. the empanadas were greasy, expensive, and i'm pretty sure i tasted newspaper. the croquetas were the same deal, meat undercook, and the only thing good was desert because how can you mess up ice cream? if you want good tapas skip this place, head to cafe iberico. this place is so awful.
