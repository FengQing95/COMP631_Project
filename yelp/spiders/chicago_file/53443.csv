Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is deceptively huge and that means at times it can get very loud. That's the only bad thing I can really say about this place. Food, drinks, and service are all exceptional. Food for days but not too much that you leave over stuffed. The servers really know their stuff. The bar is also a nice place to hang out before dinner or to eat there if you wanna watch a game.
