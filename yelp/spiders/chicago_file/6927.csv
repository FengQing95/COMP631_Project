Art Institute of Chicago////This place is great, and I love all the art available to view, including the miniatures room. However, though the design of the building itself is mostly great, more bathrooms need to be scattered throughout, so I don't spend an hour without being able to find a bathroom amongst the numerous roomfuls of art.
