Art Institute of Chicago////You can easily spend a whole day looking at everything there is to see. My personal favorites were paintings by Monet, Van Gogh and Renoir. I also really enjoyed seeing some of the textile and Islamic art. Truly fascinating and beautiful designs. It was also a treat to see some of Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture being displayed for his designs are beautiful. If you like art and history, you will definitely enjoy a walk through this museum. I would say it is comparable to any museum that I have been to in Europe.
