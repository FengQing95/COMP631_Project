Little Goat Diner////We arrived at noon on Saturday and there was an hour wait so we elected to go to the bar in the back where they had a limited menu. Tempted by the Bloodys speckled atop the bar around us, we ordered one of them and were sure glad we did. It had amazing flavor and balance, and not from a plethora of garnishes, but rather from a chef-prepared mix that included 'masala,' according to our friendly bartender. To go with that, we ordered the shrimp sandwich, one of just a handful served at the bar, that included a crunchy 'masa' chip, some tender poached shrimp tasting of real shrimp, a green onion cream cheese schmear, avocado slices and a spicy mayonaise, lending to the whole concoction rather the feel and taste of a shrimp tempura roll. A macchiato of Stumptown coffee of Portland, Oregon fame, tied together our sampling. That's all the far we got so far on the Goat, but will be back for more with hopes of a similarly satisfying experience.
