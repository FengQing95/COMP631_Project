Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////These guys know how to do it! It's a pretty busy place and although it was my first visit, I'm assuming there is usually a wait. However, while you are waiting for your table they allow you to order your pizza and then they bring it out to you when you are seated.  Very convenient. The pizza did take about 40 minutes to make but it's deep dish and was well worth the wait!
