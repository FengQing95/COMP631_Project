The Purple Pig////I got there at about 5 and it was quickly filling up. When I walked in there were about 6 empty seats at the bar. I made a beeline and sat down, was greeted quickly by the bartender, cannot remember his name but he provided great service! He was very knowledgeable about drinks, recommendations, and ingredients.
