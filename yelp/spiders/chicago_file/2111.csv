Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////On to my second experience and the only reason that this place didn't get 5 stars.  I'm more of a savory person when it comes to breakfast so I had been eager to try the eggs benedict and I chose the florentine benedict which sounded good with the spinach and bacon bits.  It was very good, but I couldn't help but feel that I've definitely had better benedicts.  I wasn't really into the hollandaise sauce - they tout it as "homemade" but it wasn't really doing anything for me.
