Smoque BBQ////Been going here multiple times, this Smoque BBQ is so amazing! Their customer service was so great, their environment is so feel home, and their place has a good ambiance. You can smell the air when you go inside, it is smell of good delicious barbeque, and you will probably get your order immediately. Their barbeque is very tasty, it is so tender, flavorful, and meaty. The portions are right, sauce and dips are awesome, and beverages are cool. And also they have so many mouth-watering meals that you can try at their menu and great sides as well. Their place is so easy to find, they have parking lot so you can park while you are eating inside, and this place is the favorite spot of most people in the area. This is the best barbeque place here in Chicago, if you are also a barbeque lover this is definitely the best and perfect place for you. So I suggest to go here and stop by, much better if you go here earlier because the store is so crowded in late hours, but it is still up to you, everything here at Smoque BBQ is so worth the cost. And everything about this place is so impressive, from their customer service, employees, place, and especially their food. This store is not going to disappoint you. Hands down to them. Highly recommend this Smoque BBQ, you can always get a delicious meal here, and they are always quick and efficient. Will definitely go here again when I am nearby. Thank you guys! Keep up the good work! Kudos to all of you!
