Smoque BBQ////It's my very first time going to this place and I can honestly say it impressed me! Great service, friendly staff and I love that fact that you can either eat in or outside. We went on a Saturday afternoon and the wait wasn't long for our food. I tried the pulled pork sandwich and it was AMAZING!!! Everything that came with the meal was so delicious! My husband got the baby back ribs and he loved them! Everything had such an amazing flavor! We will be going back. My husband and I LOVED IT!
