Little Goat Diner////We shared the This Little Piggy Went to China and the Crispy Creole Chicken Sammie. This Little Piggy had a very interesting glaze, but the biscuit and sausage were delicious and all the flavors worked very well together. The Creole Sammie was also delicious, but is really just a glorified fried chicken burger. The chicken tasted fresh and the bread was toasted perfectly. The portions for both of our dishes was not big, but not small. You're sort of paying for the name and experience so it's pricey (about $13-20 for most main dishes) but it's not completely unreasonable. We also tried the Little Goat Latte which was good, but a bit too sweet and probably not something I'd order again for $5.
