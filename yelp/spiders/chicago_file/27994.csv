Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Lou itself had copious amounts of cheese, which was nice intermixed with some spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes. I do think I like the classic better because of the rich flavor. Note that the sausage seems to be one large flat piece of sausage (rather than smaller pieces). The butter crust, was indeed more buttery than most, but not as amazing as it sounds, unfortunately.
