Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For dessert, we got the gold-brick sundae - another highly recommended item, if you have room.  Two scoops of ice cream served with a magic shell chocolate sauce.  The ice cream was an awesome malted bourbon ice cream and the sauce solidifies in to a crisp chocolate shell almost immediately as it hits the ice cream.
