Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas and happy hour sangria! This is my go-to place! It can get really crowded because of how popular this place is, but the food is well worth the wait. I've come here for years and never been disappointed. This is also a place I take almost every friend or family member that visits Chicago. Sharing their tapas is a great time and I always order a pitcher of sangria!
