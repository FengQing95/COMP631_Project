The Purple Pig////Herbert did an awesome job with his recommendations on tapas selections and beer. Rating from 1-10, we ended the year 2016 with my favorite being the Lamb Ribs(10) and Roasted Bone Marrow(9) thus starting 2017 with some Pancetta-wrapped Guinea Hen(8) Beef Brisket(8) Smoked Scallops(7) and Crispy Pigs Ear(9). All the food came out at a steadfast pace giving us just enough time to finish each plate. Â
