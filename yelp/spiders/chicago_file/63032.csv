Smoque BBQ////Ok, here's a vegetarian review lol...the Mac-n-cheese is good, but order two servings if you want that to be your main course. It appeared that the fries were cooked separate from the meat, and they are really good. The cornbread is decent, and their peach cobbler is yummy. There ya go, veggie peeps!
