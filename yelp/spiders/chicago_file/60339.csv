Smoque BBQ////Thankfully the guest of honor (Hi, Nickolas!) was 45 minutes late so by the time we got to the front, they arrived.  If you are carrying out, no worries: you place your order and leave.  If you dine in, however, it's a bit complicated.  You basically wait for your seat and when you have a seat they then put in your order and food arrives in about 15 minutes time.  With a group of 10 in a place that seats 50 (max) and has a continual line of people, that is when it gets tricky.  But the workers were great and seated us as quickly as possible.
