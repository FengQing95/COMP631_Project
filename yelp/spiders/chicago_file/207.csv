Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Went here today around 12:30. We only had a 3-4 minute wait, which was rather surprising, as there is always a crowd outside waiting on the weekends.  I got the two eggs, over med, fruit cup instead of hashbrowns and the wildberry pancakes rather than toast to eat and a soy latte. The food was wonderful, the pancakes were outstanding.  Can't wait to go back!
