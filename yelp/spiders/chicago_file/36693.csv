Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Started with an old fashioned which was excellent.  We all enjoyed the tomato bacon salad.  The salmon was terrific--perfectly cooked, meaty and fresh.  My husband loved his filet--said it was one of the best he ever had.  We also had the Chicago cut rib-eye--which was huge and delicious. The corn elote was great (but it is quite creamy and rich).  Pomme frites were good--not the best ever but good.
