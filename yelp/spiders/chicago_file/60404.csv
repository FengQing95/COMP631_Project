Smoque BBQ////- brisket - This was fairly good - a solid B.  The flavor was pretty good on the brisket, but it had what I've found to be a common problem with brisket - dryness.  The brisket was a bit on the dry side.  It was also served with the sauce already on which in nearly all circumstance I don't like but here it didn't really matter since it helped combat the dryness.
