Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was looking through the menu to find a classic Chicago's deep dish, and the restaurant's menu suggested that the Malnati's Chicago Classic is made with a sausage that is the specialty of the restaurant and also with their famous Buttercrust.  So we decided to order a small sized Malnati's Chicago Classic, which is 9'' and serves two, and also to get an order of wings as appetiser.  My sister had, at this point, already decided she also wants the Chocolate Chip Pizza for dessert.  She has a sweet tooth just like I do.
