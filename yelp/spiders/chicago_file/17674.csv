Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lived up to my expectations - fresh tomato sauce, delicious mozzarella. We had the classic sausage and the pepperoni. Both made me very happy. The servings were large and I took the leftovers home. They taste great cold too! Also a fun, relaxed place to go with friends. Staff were friendly.
