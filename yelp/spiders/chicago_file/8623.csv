Art Institute of Chicago////If you make it all the way here, DO NOT miss going into the two gardens on either end of the original Art Institute building. Â There is a north and a south garden. The South Garden is far superiour (in my opinion). The south garden was designed by famed Landscape Architect Dan Kiley (he also designed the less successful garden in front of the Calatrava addition to the Milwaukee Art Museum). This garden sings. It's absolutely magnificient.
