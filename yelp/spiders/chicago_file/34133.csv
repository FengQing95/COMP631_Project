Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I really wanted to give this place a five but I expected perfection and I did not get it. But this is def a place to try for a nice dinner. I loved the rose martinis had two of those and was feeling great. Service was also attentive and polite. The food I ordered chicago ribey, elote corn, and short rib stronganoff. Â Meat was cooked perfectly, elote corn was delish but didnt fit in with my meal and the stronganoff was simple and needed either more sauce or seasoning. Was too full for dessert. Honestly I love gilt bar so much I just thought this would be better but it wasn't. Gilt bar still takes top spot right now.
