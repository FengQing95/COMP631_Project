Art Institute of Chicago////I'd have to agree with good 'ole Robert. I love to look at art. I love to walk from painting to painting and imagine I have some clue of what the artist was trying to do. I sometimes read the captions next to the pictures when I'm completely clueless. I don't remember to understand what era or 'ism it is I just like to look and I like the Art Institute for that.
