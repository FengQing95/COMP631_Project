Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For the main course, two of us ordered the bone-in filet and one ordered the regular filet.  It is worth getting the bone-in, but all the steaks were just super.  They were really solid cuts of meat cooked perfectly.  When I was finished I was sucking on the bone like I was a dog it was that good.
