Little Goat Diner////The decor is modern diner. The staff is incredibly welcoming. As mentioned, the portions are impressive. And the food. Oh the food is mouth-watering. The menu is filled to the brim with cool takes on diner classics - goat burger, mac 'n cheese, scallion pancakes, tempura mashed taters, hot crab dip and about a billion other items.
