Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Once we put in our orders, the food came out surprisingly fast and well timed. We got our peach sangria first and though it didn't taste too boozy, it offered a solid sugary supplement to the free bread. The short ribs came out right away and WOW was it tender. It came out in one slab of meat and melted to the cut of my BUTTER KNIFE. That's when you know... The dish was pretty amazing and probably my favorite of the night.
