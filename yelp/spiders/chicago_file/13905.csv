Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm not a deep dish pizza person and this was the first time trying real deep dish in Chi Town. Bruschetta was really good. I liked how it was buttery and toasted but not too hard that it would cut your mouth up. Chicken wings were really good as well. For the pizza, I tried a small, half Lou's and half Chicago Classic. I preferred the classic over Lou's. I liked how it wasn't too salty.  The Lou's had too much veggies which made the crust more doughy and killed some of the crunch.  One reason I usually opt for thin crust over deep dish is because the cheese and toppings usually make it too salty on deep dish and also the crust comes out too doughy. I usually also go for pepperoni over sausage, but in this case I had to try it the way it was to see what it was all about. I wasn't disappointed. Very good crust.  Haven't tried the other joints yet, but I will on return visits to the Windy City.
