Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am sure you can search Chicago up and down for the very best, primo deep dish eatery.  There may be one or three out there.  But for me, Lou Malnati's hit the mark with each item they delivered to my table.  I'm glad I included Malnati's on my trip to Chicago!  Prices were reasonable, menu options ALL look appealing, and the staff treated me, as a single diner, very well.  Cheers!
