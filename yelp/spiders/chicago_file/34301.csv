Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We finally got around to ordering entrees. We decided on the Classic Ribeye-Chicago Cut, Bavette's Spicy Fried Chicken, Side of Bacon and Pommes Frites.  Everything was on point, and what was even better...it was delivered to our table by Brandon & Ricky!  These were my servers back in 2012! I was stunned! So Frighin Hilarious!!!  We threw a couple high-fives in there! Yay...way to impress! Back to the food....The steak was cooked perfectly, and though I thought the chicken would be on the bone...I was pleasantly surprised it was not! Didn't have to be all lady like and fight with a bone. Yay for me! The bacon...I mean...the bacon!! Thick cut and just the right amount of black pepper to keep your mouth and belly wanting more! But, I stopped myself...because I had to save myself for the one and only Chocolate Cream Pie! Brandon stated it's now referred to as the 'panty-dropper'!  Haha!! I mean..for reals...this dessert is quite the pleaser! Just surrender to it, and I promise you...you will not be disappointed. You will be dreaming about it and crave its sweet creamy goodness. Poor Johnny Vegas was sad he didn't get a chance to deliver this to our table :( On our way out, the bartender wished us a 'good night' :)
