Little Goat Diner////Taco Salad: I know what you are thinking, who orders a taco salad but my co-diner was "trying" to be healthy.  Now, I make taco salads all the time. Am I an expert? NO. Do I make a better taco salad than Little Goat? Hell yes.  This was a mosh of warm, wilted lettuce topped with a ridiculous amount of chili. It was sick as in TERRIBLE.
