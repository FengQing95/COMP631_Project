Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I thought the Malnati Chicago Classic (sausage, cheese, crushed tomato, butter crust) was very good. It had a natural tomato flavor, with a nice helping of cheese along an interesting "butter crust". The sausage brought very little to the equation, lacking flavor but adding texture. The crust is much different (and not comparable to other types of pizza). This type of crust has a crumbly effect it, almost cornmealy, which holds everything together well.
