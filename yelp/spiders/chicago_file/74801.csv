Little Goat Diner////The atmosphere here was fantastic with food and drink to match. I had the Jerk Chicken Sandwich and a Sazerac, both of which were absolutely wonderful. Everything here is alacarte, so the bill adds up quickly. However, given I'm from Minneapolis where seemingly everything is cheaper, the prices seemed fair for the quality of the food.
