Art Institute of Chicago////It also has an incredible art collection that is very eclectic - from the very famous large collection of impressionists to the armor to the AWESOME Frank Lloyd Wright furniture to the Chagall Glass windows and Georgia O'Keefe's there is more to see here than any single day could allow. I personally have always been fascinated by their Egyptian art and the ancient coin collections.
