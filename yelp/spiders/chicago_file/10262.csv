Art Institute of Chicago////This place falls under the "must see" sites of Chicago.   Although it has been a few years since my last visit the AI is such a special place for me to get lost in!  We were on a mission to see the paper weight collection which was closed for remodeling our last visit.   We just LOVE the new display.  See you soon.
