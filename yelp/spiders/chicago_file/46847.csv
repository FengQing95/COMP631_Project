Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here for my sister's rehearsal dinner, and wow, what a great Chicago place to bring out-of-towners!  The bottomless Sangria was A-mazing; I had never had white sangria, but theirs was superb.  The food was very good too.  As with many tapas places, the small dishes were quite carb (bread/potato) heavy with lots of garlic, but we all enjoyed them.
