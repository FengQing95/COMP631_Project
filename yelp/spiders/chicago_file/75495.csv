Little Goat Diner////We arrived around 9:00 AM this Sunday morning and were seated immediately in a booth. I could see Stephanie in the kitchen from where I sat; however, some folks chose to sit along the bar where they had an even better view of the kitchen. Even though there was a good bustle of patrons there (and lots of small children), the noise level was happy but not at all distracting.
