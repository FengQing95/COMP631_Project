Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My daughter told me how i had to try this place as it was the hot spot in Chicago dining..........................its was ok.  I ate in the basement dining room (actually best place to be, ask for basement reservations, much less noisy)   Fried chicken was out of this world good.  Steaks very good.  Steaks are pricey, pricier than most upscale steak houses.
