Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I guess tapas just isn't my thing. This place sure didn't help as a "first time tapas place" for me. The portions they give are just an insult. I don't understand why pancakes are even on the menu when all you get is three quarter sized pancakes. That's not an exaggeration. And the waffle was literally half the size of an eggo waffle and cost $5. Three stars because waiter was nice. Zero stars for the joke sized servings.
