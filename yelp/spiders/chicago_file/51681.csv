Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here while still underage unfortunately so didn't get to try out their sangria BUT still had a terrific time. Met my family there, and the servers were very patient with us taking our time to catch up before looking at the menus. The food was absolutely delicious and very well proportioned for us!! Even though they have a two serving minimum of their paella, it was very worth getting the extra food and having some leftovers for the next day. Definitely need to come back here sometime soon!
