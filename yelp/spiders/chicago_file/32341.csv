Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We picked Lou Malnati's to be delivered to me and fiancé at Shirley Ryan for quite a sad occasion, a close family friend died from a series of brain strokes.  In her memory we ordered from here on her funeral day as this is her favorite pizza place and probably any restaurant as her favorite food was pizza.  We ordered something unique that we may try from other places too, an Italian beef deep dish tomato and cheese pizza.  It was delicious and could easily feed both of us.  Very well balanced with the amount of tomato sauce, cheese, crust, and toppings.  We also had a combo platter of appetizers that included fried mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini sticks, fried mushrooms, and our favorite that beats Culver's, fried cheese cubes (or cheese curds as they are commonly called).  Sorry that I forgot to take pictures as this was an emotional time.
