Smoque BBQ////- fries - The bag of fries the most impressive thing I ate there.  Who would expect it, right?  But seriously, they were excellent - hot, fresh, crispy on the outside/soft in the middle, well seasoned.  I wish everyone could do fries like this.  Maybe they were just really spot on that day with them though.  Who knows.  Dare I say - maybe the best I've had in '09?
