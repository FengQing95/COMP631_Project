Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm from CA and last month I traveled to Chicago on Business.  Lou Malnati's was the first place I went to straight from the airport.  It was my first time trying real Chicago Deep Dish pizza.  It was nothing I had imagined but better than I expected.  Considering i'm not from Chicago, I always thought of Deep Dish Pizza as a pizza with a really thick crust and tons of bread.  This was not the case at all.  To my surprise, Lou Malnati's had the perfect amount of crust (not thick at all) and the massive amount of cheese and meat was impressive.  Full of flavor.  I wish we had a Lou Malnati's in the LA area.  Now i'm just hoping my manager sends me to Chicago again.  Delicious!
