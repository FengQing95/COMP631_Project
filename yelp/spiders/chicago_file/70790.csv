Little Goat Diner////Worth making a reservation for lunch but the wait didn't look horrible. Started with the shrimp cocktail which was pretty good. Our entrees were just okay, one had the huge burger with three proteins and onion rings (Goat Almighty) It was just a big burger. I had the Los Drowned and the meat was very tender but was very similar to a normal Italian beef sandwich. Nothing amazing but happy I tried it out.
