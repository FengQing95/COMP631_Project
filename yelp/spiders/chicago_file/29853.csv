Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Got the Lou's because I figured trying the original is the way to go. I didn't expect the tomatoes to be sliced as the usual spot I go when in town was diced. The spinach and mushroom did not have much of a taste to them and the butter crust was not very buttery or flaky. Perhaps I set my expectations to high because it was recommended by a few local folk but it just didn't quite do it for me.
