Little Goat Diner////I have not found a cinnamon roll better than a Cinnabon (as much as I hate to admit this chain had the best cinnamon buns I ever had), until I came to Little Goat Diner and had their Ooey Gooey Cinnabun!  Hard to find one that is as soft and chewy and oh so gooey with the right kind of cream cheese icing but they nailed it!  We were lucky enough to snag an early RSVP and one of the 50 cinnamon rolls they make daily on the weekends (only 25 made daily on the week days). Definitely best eaten at the diner as it's served hot n' fresh!  The lusciously overflowing icing is just what it needs to elevate this to top notch without being overly sweet. Do yourself a favor and get in early!
