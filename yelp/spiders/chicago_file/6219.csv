The Purple Pig////We are new to Chicago and had heard of this place from our realtor.  We came in for lunch and it was packed. We were lucky to find two seats at the bar. The food is delicious and very nicely plated. Portions are a good size. My favorite was the beets.  The beets came with a pistachio cream that was delicious!. The atmosphere is very lively... busy. Space is limited and just very tight! Not a place to go with large groups. Not a romantic date night type of place either. Expect to sit very close to others...
