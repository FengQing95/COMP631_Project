Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Trying a deep dish pizza is a must in Chicago and I don't regret my decision of coming here! Came here on a Sunday night and it was busy! Surprisingly, the wait for a table wasn't long. Only the wait for the pizza was long, but they suggest you to pre-order the pizza before being seated!
