Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So I can't tell whether we're on more of a Sodikoff kick or a DMK kick - I guess DMK edges out the Sodikoff group - with trips to DMK, County, and MK in the last month or two, but a trip to Au Cheval or the new spot opening up in the Dillman's' space would even up the score.  I   I would like to go back to Bavette's and try some of the higher-end prime cuts, and definitely go back for the elote.
