Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The other dishes, chicken and ham croquette and seafood paella, were also very likable. We ordered two servings of the paella. The rice didn't seem to be 100% cooked. A few pieces of rice here and there were a bit difficult, but they were very generous with the shrimp and scallop.
