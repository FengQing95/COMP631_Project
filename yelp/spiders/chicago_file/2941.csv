The Purple Pig////Food was overall very good. They do not take reservations. We got lucky and went on a Saturday night 830pm, and while they told us about 45 min wait, we got a table within 20 mins!!! They take ur number and will text u when ur table is ready. It's rather crowded, a little on the noisy side and they have tall uncomfortable seats. So it's not meant for u to have a nice long romantic dinner. They kinda just want you in and out. Service was not that great. Our waiter wasn't very friendly. The kitchen guys who brought out our dishes were more pleasant than our waiter. And it took a REALLY long time for him to bring out my drink (a soda) both the first time and for my refill. Here are some dishes we tried.
