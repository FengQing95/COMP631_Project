Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Being that its in the River North area where all the clubs are, on a Saturday night it was packed. An hour fifteen wait, no problem, grab a beer and order at the server desk. There is a small quieter upstairs dining room away from all the hustle and bustle. Good for families who actually like to talk to each other. The pizza here compared to the South Loop location lacked a little something. Its still good Lou's but it wasnt as well built and didnt hold itself together like I know Lou does. "The Lou" wasnt bad, although I advise you to finish it at the restaurant rather than the next day.. Malnati's is best when fresh. One of our buddies was allergic to mushrooms, ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce.. guess what was in the meat sauce? C'mon Mr. Malnati, let them have their pasta at least! Other than all that, still a Chicago cornerstone.
