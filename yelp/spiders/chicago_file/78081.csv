Little Goat Diner////First up, I ordered the sesame milk latte. I have to say, this tasted horrible. The first sip, I grimaced and it had a weird salty flavor. However, my meal got better when I saw they had omonoyaki on the menu which is a unique Japanese food that consists of a poached egg, cabbage flour and vegetables and meat. I have never seen this dish outside of Japan.
