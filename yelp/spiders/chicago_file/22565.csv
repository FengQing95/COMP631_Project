Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Stopped for an early dinner. Luckily we were seated right away as they were not busy yet. First impression...the table was set but it was filthy. Strike one. Â It took over 5 minutes for a server to come to our table. Strike two. We told her the table was dirty and instead of apologizing and saying let me clean it she pointed and said "sit there". We had requested a booth and she pointed to a table. We ended up getting a booth. The move gave us a new server, Christian. HOME RUN! We were his first customers on his first night at Lou's. Great server. Very attentive. Super friendly. The pizza was everything we had anticipated and more! So after a slow start we finished on a high note. Make sure you get the "Butter-crust" deep dish and ask for Christian. Would have given 5 stars but there's nothing worse than sitting downstairs dirty table.
