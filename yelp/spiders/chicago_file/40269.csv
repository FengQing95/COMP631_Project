Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It was the best bread and butter with seasonings that we've ever had. Besides the food which was amazing, they brought out a chocolate mousse pie with homemade whipped cream for my friend's birthday that was to die for! If you're in Chicago you must come here; you will not be disappointed!!
