Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great pizza. Ordered a regular tomato and cheese. Great sauce and lots of cheese. Most deep dish places in Chicago tend to get busy and this was one of them. Expect a 30min-1hr wait depending on the size of your party. Can't really find a legit deep dish spot on the east coast and this lived up to the hype. Never got to try Giordano's, but Malnatti's is def better than UNO.
