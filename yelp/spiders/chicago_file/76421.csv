Little Goat Diner////On a side note, as I sat there waiting for my food, Â I watched the 2 busy bartenders work - making cocktails, mimosas, clearing dishes, delivering food, taking payments, using the POS, and it occurred to me that during the entire 45 minutes, I never saw either one of them wash their hands.
