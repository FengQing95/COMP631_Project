Art Institute of Chicago////What people _sometimes_ don't get in the reviews here is that this is as good as it gets. I've never been to a better art museum that surveys the whole history of visual art. So, because I haven't exactly been everywhere (nope to Louvre, L'Hermitage) I'd guess this is one of world's half-dozen or so greatest art museums. For me definitely better and more comprehensive than any place in Tokyo or Washington DC. It's at the same dizzying heights as El Prado in Madrid. It's _that_ good.
