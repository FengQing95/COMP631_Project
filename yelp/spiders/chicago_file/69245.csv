Little Goat Diner////Great place! I made reservations and was sat right away when we arrived. The menu has a wide and interesting variety of foods to choose from, and are reasonably priced. I ordered the Parathas Burrito - so good! I also appreciated that someone sent our table a plate of fries at no charge so that was a nice touch. I was also impressed with the beer selection. We didn't end up ordering dessert but next time I definitely will - the desserts I saw other people order looked delicious! Will definitely be going back here!
