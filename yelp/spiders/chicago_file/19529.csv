Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Once your casserole arrives, your server will chop up your initial pieces, and then its game time. The crust is crispy, flaky, and oh so buttery. The sauce is rich with flavor, and will knock your socks off. The large chunks of italian sausage will not leave you wanting. And to top it off, slices of crispy pepperoni complete the absolutely amazing casserole.
