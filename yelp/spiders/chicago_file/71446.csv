Little Goat Diner////Still, it is all executed well and you will get some very tasty food.  I had the katsu pork sandwich, and I would say it was on par with among the best Hoosier pork tenderloins I have had (and I'm quite an aficionado).  The addition of cabbage and vinegar and hoisin sauce really brightened it up too.  The onion rings and fries were well executed, too.   The "fat elvis" cake was spectacular.  Not too sweet, but the banana, peanut butter, and smokiness of the bacon were all balanced out.
