The Purple Pig////As for the most important part, the food, I always get the grilled octopus and beets.  The grilled octopus is cooked perfectly with a tangy pesto type sauce.  It's accompanied with roasted potatoes and green beans.  It's awesome.  The beets are accompanied with a whipped cheese and pistachios butter.  The pistachio butter is so good, I wish it came with more.  We got the half duck and broccoli as well this time.  Both spectacular.  The broccoli is hard to describe, but highly recommended.  It has a nice roast, but is soft due to a sauce.  It says the sauce contains anchovies but I didn't taste that.  The duck is huge.  It's super tender and has a really nice crust.  The yogurt it's served with tastes good, and whole thing is better on the brioche it's served on.
