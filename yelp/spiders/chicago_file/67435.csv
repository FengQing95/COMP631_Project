Little Goat Diner////The fanciest and best diner I have ever had the pleasure of dining in. My friend and I went here for dinner and got some pretty strong cocktails in the back while waiting for our table. We ordered the goat chili cheese fries as an appetizer and I almost died of happiness. It wasn't a lump of greasy flavorless chili--it was arguably one of the best chilis I have had. The goat gave the whole thing a new flavor. I was told to order a goat kimchi burger next time, but that night I had the kimchi pork chop and my friend ordered the kalbi. Amazing! Not sure why we thought it would be a good idea but instead of a regular side, we just decided to order shrimp cocktail, which was served as a lettuce wrap. Very cute and very tasty. It wouldn't have been a diner without some blueberry pie for dessert, which is worth the trek to the West Loop just on its own.
