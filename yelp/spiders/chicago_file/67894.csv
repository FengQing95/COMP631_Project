Little Goat Diner////Very much a diner vibe going on in here from the soda counter to the booth seating. The menu has breakfast 24-hrs a day. Overall this place was a fun vibe, but the food left more to be desired. The pulled pork sandwich is massive and even our waitress proclaimed, I've never finished it (Pro Tip: Mention this to your guests when they are ordering appetizers and side dishes...no one likes to take home a bunch of food). Secondly, when she was boxing up our food, her index and thumb fingers touched the sandwich (sounds small, but in the food industry, this is a big no-no...why do you think all serves get tested for TB?). I had the goat burger which was tasty along with the fried pickles and onion rings. Overall, the diner vibe carries over to the food and you get a lot of grease when ordering. This is a breakfast spot for locals and no more.
