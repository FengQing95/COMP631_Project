Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is my favorite tapas place. We come here every year for our work holiday party and are never disappointed. I've been to other tapas restaurants that seem to favor quantity over quality of food. I consider the food here to be gourmet tapas that is a cut above many of the other places I've tried.
