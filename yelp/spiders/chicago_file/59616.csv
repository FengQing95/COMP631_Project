Smoque BBQ////The dining room is pretty small and the line is long, but most people don't linger too long after eating and the host staff is awesome about arranging tables for a big party.  Even though you order before being seated, the host staff coordinates with the kitchen so that your food isn't done before a seat has been found for you.  Both times I've come, we've had a big party of around 8 people and getting seated hasn't been a horrible experience.
