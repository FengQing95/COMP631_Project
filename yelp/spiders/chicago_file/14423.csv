Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////...So being a Cal alumn I grew up on Zachary's. But I had never had a true Chicago style deep dish pizza to compare it to... so I felt rather biased in saying that Zachary's pizza was the best thing EVER... So I resolved that the next time I was in Chicago, I would go and get true Chicago style deep dish pizza... and I would settle that question once and for all...
