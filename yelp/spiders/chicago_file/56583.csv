Smoque BBQ////We ordered a salad with smoked chicken, mac n cheese and the brisket platter with fries, coleslaw and mac n cheese. It was a lot of food that wasn't all finished! With drinks it was $26. I wished there were more chicken options (there was 1 plus salad w/ chicken) or fish. But there were a lot of sides that didn't have meats to choose from and the coleslaw, fries and mac n cheese that I tried were good.
