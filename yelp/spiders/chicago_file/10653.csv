Art Institute of Chicago////I'm definitely not smart enough to understand modern art, however if you are it's likely that you'll enjoy this museum. We did however enjoy the tiny houses and tiny rooms exhibit where people have belt model replicas of rooms from just about every time period. The only thing I would like to see added here is somebody doing a replica of a Neanderthal home. Well it's simple, I feel like it would be a perfect addition to this impressive display!
