Smoque BBQ////On the way back from spending the morning at the Shedd Aquarium, my husband had suggested we stop here for lunch. I had just bookmarked this place on Yelp after seeing them featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives Friday night, so I was excited to try the food. It did not disappoint. And keep in mind, this review is coming from someone who normally avoids BBQ since I'm not the biggest fan of it.
