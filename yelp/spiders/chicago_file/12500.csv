Art Institute of Chicago////This was our first major museum since the lifting of Covid 19 restrictions. We decided to got straight to the main pieces of the museum, one of which was featured in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. I even played Dream Academy's cover of the Smiths Please, Please, Please Let me Get What I Want when I saw it. My wife wanted to see Hopper's Nighthawks.  And less than fifty feet away is the other American treasure: American Gothic. We wrapped it up with the American and Impressionists and headed through the Roman/Greek section to the modern wing.
