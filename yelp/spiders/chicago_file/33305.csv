Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our food was incredibly subpar. Whereas last time we had some of the best steaks we've put in our mouths, these seemed to purchased out of the sale case at the local supermarket on sale. My duchess cut filet cooked to medium was charred in the outside and my husbands bone in rib eye was not marbled with fat but had chunks of it throughout. For a place that has Boeuf in the title, you would expect the meat to be very Â notable. My glass of wine had so much sentiment in it that the last four sips tasted like someone had mixed beach sand with the Cabernet. The waiter never asked us how our meals were or offered to get us another round of drinks. After this experience dessert was not even on the radar but we did order coffee. Our waiter managed to drop off the check without a word before the coffee was even delivered. I'm pretty sure he would have liked to kick us out if possible. Unfortunately we were not even at our table for 80 minutes. Talk about a quick turnaround. I would recommend outback ahead of bavettes. While the old fashioners were yummy everything else was negative. For a restaurant that one must get a reservation over four weeks out the experience was horrible.
