Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I enjoyed an amazing anniversary meal there this evening. I called several times to make a reservation and couldn't get in, but we went anyhow and we're lucky enough to find 2 open seats at the bar. Angie took amazing care of us and made our evening so special. The food was spectacular and the service and attention second to none. Thank you, Angie for a beautiful experience. We will be back every time we return to Chicago.
