Smoque BBQ////We walked up to a line out the door on a nice warm day and waited what seemed like 30 minutes. It was the nicest day that week in the spring so as you can imagine people were out and about on the street mulling around. No amateur mistakes were made as we grabbed a six-pack of brews from Hangovers Sports Bar and Liquor Store just a couple blocks north.
