Smoque BBQ////The brisket is AWESOME.  The Pulled Pork is AWESOME (still need to try the ribs).  You can't go wrong.  It's not as fatty as other BBQ's, meaning you can eat a ton and not feel to sick the next day.  The sauce is good in a mellow way - i like it, but i would love if they had a spicer option.
