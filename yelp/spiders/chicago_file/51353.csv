Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////5. Rioja braised short rib: Okay this was probably one of my favorite things. The meat was sooooo tender and just ugh tres magnifique! The sauce was good, the mashed potatoes were very buttery (maybe a little too buttery?) but meat and potatoes is just such a classic dish. It's hard to go wrong with something like that.
