Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The wings and mozzarella sticks were pretty good. They were a good start. We got a deep dish pizza with Pepperoni with the butter crust. It was good. I ate it for like 2 days. It was good. The slices were a nice size. We got to eat in and they social distance well if you are worried about that. But its a good spot especially if you are not from Chicago. Must give it a try. Drinks were ok but don't expect to them to be overly strong.
