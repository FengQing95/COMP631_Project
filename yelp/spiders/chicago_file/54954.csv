Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here with a friend at 7:30, on a Tuesday. The restaurant seemed busy and would require 30 mins wait for table. We chose to sat at the bar. It was quite noisy but that did not bother us, as a tapas place should be like that. Decor was ok, food was ok, we had the passion fruit sangria which was good. I think the food lack authenticity and the light was not helping to showcase the food.
