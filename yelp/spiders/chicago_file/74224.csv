Little Goat Diner////We ordered the apple strussel pancakes, tempura potatoes & my favorite, the bulls-eye French toast. When you read the description for the French toast, you will think, "this does not sound appetizing." oh boy! You are so wrong. The BBQ maple syrup that is poured onto the fried chicken & brioche bread & eggs makes this dish a winner!
