Little Goat Diner////Yes yes yes yum yum yum!  I've walked by Little Goat so many times and finally got to experience it!  I was surprised by how authentically diner-ish it was.  Like, most hip places will say they're a "cafe" or a "diner" or an "eatery," but those terms become become so vague that you can't be sure.  Little Goat, on the other hand, has leather-bound booths, root beer floats, and surprisingly juicy chicken fingers.
