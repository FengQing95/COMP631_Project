Little Goat Diner////I ordered the Pork Belly Pancake and one of the cocktails which had vodka and watermelon in it. The "pancake" in the dish is actually a savory Chinese crepe with scallions. I thought the crepe paired well with the huge chunk of pork belly on top, and the Bok Choy slaw-like salad on top worked well to cut through the heaviness of this dish. However, the pork belly was REALLY FATTY (but good) and the House Hoisin was a bit too salty. I also thought the cocktail had a really minimal amount of alcohol in it, I also tried a few of the drinks my friends ordered and could not tell if there was alcohol in them at all. This doesn't seem like a great place to order drinks, or maybe we should have ordered non-cocktails.
