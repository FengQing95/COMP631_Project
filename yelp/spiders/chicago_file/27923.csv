Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Let me start by saying I LOVED the pizza. The pizza was not what we had a problem with on our visit to Lou Malnati's. We came here celebrating my birthday and many yelpers expressed their excitement about a special treat on their birthday. We pre-ordered our pizza and waited another 20 minutes before being able to be seated inside (upstairs, which seemed to be ONLY for customers who had pre-ordered).
