Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Great location right across the street from the park in the middle of Chicago. Pretty expansive menu. I got the French toast and really enjoyed it. Their fresh squeezed orange was really good too. Potentially long waits but you can get in line through the Yelp app which meant we didn't have to wait at all when we got to the restaurant. Def check this place out.
