Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Upon entry, you will be promptly greeted by the host and invited to check in your coats. As you step into the foyer there's a vintage red velvet couch, dimly lit ambiance, exposed brick walls, and an elaborately decorated extensive bar with some of the most personable and professional bartenders I've met in all of River North! I'd highly recommend trying a signature pickle-back (I know it sounds odd Â but if you like pickles, this is quite a zing!).
