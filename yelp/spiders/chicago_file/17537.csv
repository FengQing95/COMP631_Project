Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////On my first trip to Chicago, it was go deep dish or go home. After some research, I decided to walk the scenic mile to Lou Malnati's and get a deep dish to-go. Though I plan to try other spots when/if I come back to Chicago, I can't imagine it getting any better than this. Outside of thin crust in New York, this is one of the best pizzas I've ever had the delight of eating. Leftovers for lunch tomorrow? Just couldn't do it.
