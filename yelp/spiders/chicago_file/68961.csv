Little Goat Diner////We were so full halfway through our meals. We looked at each other, and knew we couldn't take leftovers with us to our next destination. So with a smile we found our spare legs and joined the clean plate club with glee. I would recommend Little Goat to anyone. Not only does it feed your belly, it feeds the soul.
