Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I think I have to say this is the best restaurant I've ever been to. I usually compare my steak restaurants by their filet. This was hands-down one of the best but what would put it over the edge was the butter and b√©arnaise sauce. Sides are awesome, had the corn and baked potato. Anything with bacon is worth getting. We had the wedge salad and the bacon was literally the best I've ever had. Wife loved the chocolate Creme pie dessert. Romantic ambience and exceptional service. This is a great place to celebrate special occasions.
