Smoque BBQ////This restaurant has been on my list for quite a while! I also heard about it on the tv show and told a friend about it. They really recommended this place and I went along with my sister. Something I would suggest from the beginning would be to order ahead of time and then just eat outside. The wait was quite a bit to order and then go get out food. It's a decent sized place. But there is alwayyysss a line. From the moment we got there to the time we left there was still a line out the door. I ended up getting the St. Louis half rack with corn bread and Mac and cheese as sides, which were anazinngggggg. You could really taste the smokiness of the ribs. I also had the peach cobbler which is a MUST try! My sister ended up getting the sliced brisket which was incredibly tender and juicy. If I were to do it again I'd get the brisket!
