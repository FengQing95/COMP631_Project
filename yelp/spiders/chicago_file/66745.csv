Little Goat Diner////Meh. First of all LG obviously doesn't know what a blue plate special is because contrary to its definition, the meal was the most expensive item on our bill. The décor and vibe are great, but they could use some sound proofing.  It's super hard to have a decent conversation without having to yell a little. Service was also good, quick and friendly.
