Little Goat Diner////Quite the wait for this place, which was a little unexpected since its not as high profile as its sister Girl and the Goat.  Regardless, had a specialty coffee at the cafe while we waited to be seated.  After being called, we were seated in a cute booth across from the kitchen.  Tried the fish tostada which was good, but nothing too special, and the this little piggy went to china, which was flavorful, but way too heavy in my opinion.  Ordered a side too, which (un?)fortunately never came since we were super full anyway. Overall, good ambience, decent food, but not super worth the wait.
