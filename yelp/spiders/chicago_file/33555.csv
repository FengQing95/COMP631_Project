Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Here for work and this was THE best meal we've had in Chicago hands down. Had other "best steak in Chicago" dinners and they didn't compare to this place. Great atmosphere, perfectly cooked steaks (bone in filet and bone in aged ribeye - both with bone marrow) and even better service. We had Eric as our server...he's the best, friendly professional just perfect...highly recommend. Ask for Eric and enjoy the exceptional food. Save room for the freaking sundae. Thrilled to have made it here. Will be back!
