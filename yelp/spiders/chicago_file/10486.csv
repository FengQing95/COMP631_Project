Art Institute of Chicago////The artwork is AMAZING and it was a wonderful experience.  There is a lot to see and it takes hours.  There are a lot of stairs but they also have elevators.  The place is roomy and good for everyone.  Kids should be kept in strollers or their hands held because many things are within reaching distance to little ones.
