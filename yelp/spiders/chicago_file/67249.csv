Little Goat Diner////Little Goat, as the name would suggest, is Izard's more casual restaurant.  The restaurant has a diner theme to it and serves many diner classics with a serious Stephanie Izard twist.  I thought that the food at Little Goat was the perfect example of how simple, comfort food, when done right, can totally constitute a great dining experience.  Also, while a more casual restaurant, Little Goat takes service seriously.  My waiter was both knowledgeable about menu items and was friendly, funny, and made us feel welcome.  On my first trip here, I went the dinner route (Fried Chicken, Pork Belly Pancake, Goat Chili), but I can't wait to come back for dinner.
