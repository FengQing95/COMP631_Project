Art Institute of Chicago////I was immediately impressed when I first stepped foot into the new Modern Wing of the Art Institute. It is just beautiful and was wonderful to see such amazing works of art in a space that was meant just for them. It almost felt like a housewarming party for Jackson Pollock, Miro, Klee, Matisse, Picasso, Jasper Johns, and so many more. I loved how the natural light streams into the exhibits and how Millennium Park is a backdrop in the halls that are facing the park. Beautiful.
