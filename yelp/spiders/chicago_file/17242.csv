Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Very busy, we got there at 4 and the place was packed, and we waited 30 minutes. This is a good sign though! I like Lou Malnati's more and more each time I try their pizza. If you wanna go the classic Chicago route, go with Lou's classic.. (The one with sausage, extra cheese, etc) its sooo good! Their house salads are great, especially since you wait about 40 minutes for your pizza to come out.. its nice to have. Thin crust is very good as well.
