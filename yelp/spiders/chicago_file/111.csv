Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wildberry is one of my go to lunch spots in the loop. My favorite menu items are the pepper jack turkey panini and pretty much any omelet I have tried. (Which I think is all including their excellent rotating specials.) Be prepared to wait during peak times. This place can be a zoo. Service is good and the food arrives pretty quickly. One of the great things about this spot is that is attracts both locals and tourists alike. Portions are generous so come hungry.
