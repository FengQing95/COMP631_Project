Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The service at Lou's was pretty standard. Our server was kind and attentive. She made the suggestion of ordering an appetizer as those come out quickly while the pizzas take longer as they're made when you order them. Our appetizer came out quickly, and our pizzas followed around when we were about done eating it.
