Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I would have given 5 stars but I was extremely disappointed with our server Deni. She seemed completely disinterested and as if she did not want to be there. Thankfully the food was amazing so that tempered my feelings. I recommend the wildberry pancakes, they were amazing, as well as the skillets. If you have to wait an hour to get in, trust me, it's worth it.
