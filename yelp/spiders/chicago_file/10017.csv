Art Institute of Chicago////Conclusion: Rated as the second biggest museum in America, It's now first in my heart as the best museum I've visited so far.  It was busy, but didn't feel crowded.   There's a cafe on the second floor, but food is pricey and doesn't seem to be in optimal proportions.  They do serve beer and wine, however.  Overall, a must visit in your lifetime.
