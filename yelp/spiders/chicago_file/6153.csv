The Purple Pig////2nd time here and once again another great experience, I arrived in midday and it was already packed but still got sat fairly quickly, our order was took almost instantly and the food arrived in courses all in appropriate times, this is a upbeat fast pace restaurant, noise levels are moderate in my opinion, great wine and dine.
