Smoque BBQ////We felt Smoque was way over-rated.  Four of us went there on a warm summer night, the line went far down the block.   We waited over an hour to get in, then placed our order at the counter.  It was hard to push through the crowd to fill our drink glasses at the machine placed way in a corner.  We then found seats at a small table that needed wiping.  We were so close to the tables next to us that you had to be careful with your elbows.   To get to tables past us, people had to push by, bumping into us.   The food was fine but not anything special.   If we had walked right in and been seated comfortably we would have thought it was ok, but not exciting.  After the rave reviews, long line, uncomfortable seating and noise level, the food had to be way above average to be worth it.
