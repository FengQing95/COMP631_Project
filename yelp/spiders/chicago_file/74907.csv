Little Goat Diner////I went with my family and we tried a variety of the dishes - all really good. This is a great kid friendly restaurant and I was really surprised as to how much they go out of their way for the little ones. From providing coloring menus to the wait staff engaging with them. I live in the neighborhood and have been back multiple times - always bringing people either in or out of town that have never been there before. Despite all the upscale restaurants in the area, it's nice to have a no non-sense option for food.
