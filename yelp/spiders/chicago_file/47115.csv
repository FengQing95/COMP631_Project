Smoque BBQ////Finally tried Smoque because of the all the hype. I got here early so while it was crowded, the line wasn't astronomical yet. While the seating arrangement was a little too cozy for my taste, they are very nice and have an efficient process of getting you seated when eating in. Didn't want to spend more than $10 so I went with the pulled pork sandwich. The pork literally melts in your mouth. The coleslaw is obviously homemade and very tasty, so I slapped some on the sandwich. As far as the meat itself, these guys know their stuff. As far as the sauce, it 's vinegar based and thin, not really my style. Don't get me wrong it was good, but it didn't exactly have my taste buds dancing. Ever since tasting Sandy's sauce at Hog Wild, nothing compares. The fresh cut fries are good, salty, and plentiful. My main beef with this place is that if you want to have anything rib -like, it'll hit you up for close to $20. Considering the fact this seems to have become a staple of Chicago BBQ, in my opinion the menu should be a little more extensive. Would love to see pork tenderloin or rib tips on the menu as I'm sure they would be excellent. Can't give them four or five stars yet because I wasn't wowed, but I will definitely update when I try the ribs.
