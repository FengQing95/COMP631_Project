Little Goat Diner////FOOD: The prices are slightly above average and there is a good amount of food, but the restaurant runs more on reputation than taste. I ordered the Loco Moco with a goat burger, which was supposed to come with a side of jasmine veggie rice. What came instead was an oily dish of random vegetables with some rice throw in. There was a lot of texture, but it was hard to taste flavor through the heavy oil layer, and I stopped before I even finished a quarter because it made me feel icky. As someone who loves burgers and loves rice, I really expected to love this dish.
