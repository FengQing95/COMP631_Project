Art Institute of Chicago////On a weekend getaway to Chicago, my wife and I went to the Art Institute of Chicago. Their collection of paintings, sculptures, textiles, etc. Â is massive and you could easily spend an entire day there. We were there about 2.5 hours and got to see almost everything we'd hoped to see. Because the Art Institute is so large and spread out (3 floors), they have many employees and volunteers scattered throughout to help guide you to specific exhibits, which was invaluable. They also have a special exhibit that highlights a particular artist, which was Edouard Manet when we went. Admission to this exhibit cost an extra $7 per ticket. They also have a cafe on the third floor.
