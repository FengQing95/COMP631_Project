Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered 6 tapas including: Spanish Cheese, olives, spicy potatoes and the chicken and ham croquetas. I have to say all the dishes were FANTASTIC!!!! They were also brought out very promptly, but not all at once which was appreciated since we were only sitting at the bar. My favorite I think were the spicy potatoes, but you really can't go wrong with anything you order. So by 9:15 we had drinks, were fed and paid...15 min before our proposed seating time!
