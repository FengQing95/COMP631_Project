Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Excellent service, waiter very good explaining menu,   glasses refilled before they are empty,  try the bacon rapped dates.., melt in your mouth.  Tonight we had the bison special.... Very tender... Unbelievable sauce. The sangria is flavored with real fruit.  Make a stop here..... I will again
