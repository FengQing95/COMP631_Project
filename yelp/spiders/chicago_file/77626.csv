Little Goat Diner////Big fan of GatG, but just a little fan of Little Goat. After several past visits, the last one sealed the deal that the wait and service just wasn't worth the experience. My first visit was an evening one, a few months after their opening. My dining partner and I were underwhelmed with the food vs the hype.
