Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was amazing! It was my first time in Chicago and first time trying deep dish pizza! We asked the locals and they all suggested Lou Malnati's Pizzeria over any other pizza place and god were they right! They are extremely efficient with handling the long wait times that they get almost everyday. We went on a Monday night and the wait was about 20 mins. They encourage you to order your pizza while you are waiting as it takes almost 45mins to bake. Kudos to the team they make sure not to waste your time!
