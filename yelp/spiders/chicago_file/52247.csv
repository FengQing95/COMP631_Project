Smoque BBQ////The brisket is very tender. More so than I am used to but it is meaty and delicious and I think my favorite item on the menu. Their baby back ribs took me a second try to really like them. The main issue is that their ribs are blackened more than I've seen before and come dry with a vinager based BBQ sauce on the side. Their ribs are not the sweet, sticky, saucy, ribs I have come to expect when I order baby backs. But give them a second go at another visit or eat your left overs the next day and I bet they will grow on you. I did not try a side I didn't like. The fries were fresh cut and great. The macaroni and cheese was brilliant with a nice creaminess in the middle and a crunchiness on top. The coleslaw was a tasty vinager based one that really helped cut down all the meaty, creamy, and starchy flavors I was eating. For dessert I had the peach cobbler which was great and I don't even like peach cobbler. Food here is good and of the BBQ places I've tried in Chicago: Twin Anchors, Cooper's, Ruby's, this is hands down my favorite.
