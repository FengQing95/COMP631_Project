Smoque BBQ////Really enjoyed the ribs. The long wait was kind of interesting in the people watching Department. If your looking for a relaxing meal this probably is not the place. ..... But of coarse we are talking about cave man Ribs mentality here, right? The ribs were amazing, the sauce was way to vinegar for me. If I could only combine these ribs with Fat Willy's Sauce I would be in Rib heaven. So check it out but be prepared for a line and cafeteria style ordering and a bunch of happy cave people.
