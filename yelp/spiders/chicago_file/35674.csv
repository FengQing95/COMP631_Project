Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////More than a year after my first review, and the place is still a stunner. My go-to item. the bone-in, dry-aged ribeye (medium rare) is still the best steak I can get anywhere. I absolutely love it. But I've been there twice just for the fried chicken and that is a winner, too, let me tell you! Everything they do is awesome: the fries, the corn, the broccoli, all the salads. I leave full and very satisfied, and continually impressed with the quality of the food and the high level of service.
