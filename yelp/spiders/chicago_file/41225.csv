Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I really like this restaurant.  I have been there twice and had an excellent experience both times.  Service was great and the food was great.  I love their seafood paella and didn't order anything that I didn't like.  The waitress brought us out a dessert tray for my birthday and the little selection of tiny desserts was fantastic.  I will definitely be back.
