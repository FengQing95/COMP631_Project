Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We arrived to Chicago for the first time, and wanted to try its famous deep dish pizza. We checked Yelp and chose the restaurant Â with the highest ranking, which was Lou Malnati's. The place is pretty packed, we had to wait for 10 minutes, we made a preorder though. Anyways, we were waiting our pizza for 40 mins, although it is said 30 mins to make it. It couldn't be a problem if the pizza wouldn't be such a disappointment. It's really hard to call it "deep dish" pizza, because it was pretty thin. And it was warm, not hot, so we ate the second slices cold. The waiter was nice. Beer was good too.
