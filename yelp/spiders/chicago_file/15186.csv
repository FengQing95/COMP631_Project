Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a Chicago native now living in California, I was really looking forward to some great deep dish pizza when visiting Chi Town recently. Lou Malnati's was underwhelming. Pizza was just OK. Great crust, cooked just right, but really pretty bland. The sausage seemed to have no real flavor, which is not what I expect in Chicago. Since there's no real "sauce" on a deep dish pizza, the other ingredients need to carry the day when it comes to flavor. Even on a pizza loaded up with bell peppers, onion, mushrooms, and sausage, I could only say, "meh".
