Little Goat Diner////The décor is that of an upscale diner with a visible kitchen, wood floors, and comfortable booths.  It seats a good number of people, probably close to two hundred or more.  If you go fairly early on a weekday you'll probably get seated fairly quickly, however on the weekends you'll be hard pushed to get table.
