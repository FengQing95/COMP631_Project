Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First, always call for a reservation...always! We Funksters called on a Monday afternoon around 4p and our choice was before 6 or after 8:30. Whatsup wit Dat?!? So we walked in at 5:50p to an EMPTY joint. Keep in mind the place is deceptively hugh. Escorted to a back-room table nicely tucked out of the way. Nothing around us but empty tables. When we departed, the establishment was wall-to-bar human people!
