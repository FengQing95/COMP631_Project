Little Goat Diner////I love sandwiches so I went with the beef sandwich, with a little trepidation. I saw that kimchi was in it and while I love sandwiches and I love kimchi never the two should meet. Until now! The kimchi was a great addition to the sandwich and it was perfect type for it. Cabbage kimchi, not overly ripe (I think it would have been terrible if they used slightly sour kimchi,) the right balance between to soft/chewy and crisp/hard. The little sandwich made me rethink of my arbitrary barrier between Korean food and everything else. My sis was nowhere near as hungry as me and she ended up ordering the crumpets and chorizo, which was a soft, savory/slightly sweet, and then she turned around and just ordered rolls and butter.
