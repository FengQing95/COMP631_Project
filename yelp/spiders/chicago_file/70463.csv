Little Goat Diner////I was a little hesitant coming here, being a "diner" and all. I was so wrong. You can get breakfast, lunch, dinner all day. When I was looking over the menu there are so many options with such different variety it was impossible for me to choose. I asked the waiter to choose for me... (this was two separate trips)
