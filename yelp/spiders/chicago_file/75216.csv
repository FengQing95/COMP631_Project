Little Goat Diner////This is one of my very favorite places to eat in Chicago. I'm a big fan of all things from Stephanie Izard including her restaurants, events and following her on Top Chef. All the dishes her are winners in my mind from the pancakes to crumpets, to the corn beef has (my favorite) with homemade bread and hot coffee. I've hd other meals here but since they serve breakfast all day here I try to take advantage.
