Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Started with wings and a Caesar salad.  THE-BEST-CAESAR-EVER.  Didn't expect to find it here but so it goes!  They make their own dressing and it was magical.  Did have tomatoes in it which is odd for the dish.  Ok by me but my wife had to pick them out.  Wings- boneless, crispy, and delicious without a dipping sauce (but enhanced by ranch!).
