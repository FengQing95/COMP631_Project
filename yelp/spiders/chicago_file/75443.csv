Little Goat Diner////After LOVING Girl and the Goat I was excited to try Little Goat, however I was kind of disappointed with the limited menu and quality of the food. Despite having a reservation we still had to wait a while to be seated and the service was nowhere near as exceptional as what I have experienced at Girl and the Goat.
