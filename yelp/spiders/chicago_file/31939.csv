Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Busy is one thing, but here they check you in so they can txt you and then you are required to go order your pizza(s) (only) at this other hostess station-- which had 3 people taking orders, presumably to speed along your dining experience. Â When they buzz you, they tape a print out to your menu so your server knows about your pizza order and then takes the rest of your order.... I guess 5 stars for efficiency and table-flipping but it didn't make the experience terribly enjoyable or memorable-- unless perhaps waiting for your deep dish is something you'd prefer not to do? Next time, I'm definitely trying some place farther down the list of deep dish pizza places!
