Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started our meal with 6 oysters, 3 east coast and 3 west coast.  The oysters were fresh and were just great!  For our actual meals, i had the 16oz ribeye medium well and my friend had the flat iron steak.  We ordered some mashed potatoes and thick cut bacon to share.  The ribeye was cooked closer to medium then medium well but I have no complaints on this.  The steak was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing.  I can see why people on here say it seems more rare the way they cook it versus what is asked but it makes sense.  The steak would loose the juiciness and perfection if it was cooked any other way.  By the time dessert rolled around, we were too full to keep going but did have leftovers for the following day.
