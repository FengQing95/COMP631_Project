Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My friends and I were very hungry so we tried a lot of food. We were pleased with all of the chosen tapas except for the pork belly. We expected to get crunchy pork belly, but all the fat (we like that on pork belly) was removed and it was rather soft. It might not have been the description on the menu for that specific item, so I don't fault them for it. Our expectation was just different. The sangrias we ordered were divine. We loved the atmosphere and the good service too.
