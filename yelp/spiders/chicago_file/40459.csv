Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I can honestly say that this was one of the best restaurants we have been to.  The decor was cool jazz and the service was beyond fantastic.  But the star was the food.  From the Marrowbone and salad (lyonnaise) to the bone in Rib-eye to the most delicious mashed potatoes EVER, everything was perfect.  Even the chocolate pie was great.
