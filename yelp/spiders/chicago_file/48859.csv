Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The sangria here is tasty, although not very strong. The food is almost always solid, if not downright delicious. True, a lot of it is very simple stuff that you could make at home if you had any kind of culinary skill at all, but, then again, who the hell would want to clean up after having a tapas party? Not me.
