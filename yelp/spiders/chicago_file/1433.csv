Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Be prepared for a wait but, it is well worth it! Everything that we had was perfectly prepared and flavorful. The service was great despite how busy the place was. This was the breakfast spot that we tried while visiting Chicago. The menu is huge! If I lived in Chicago we would have to graze through the many breakfast and lunch items that they offer.
