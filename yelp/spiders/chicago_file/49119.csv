Smoque BBQ////Finally got a chance to try this place. I ordered the half-baby back ribs, the pulled pork and a sampling of the sliced brisket. Thought the ribs were ok. I don't like my ribs charred nearly black at the top, so it wasn't for me. The two sauces were excellent though. Loved the thinner, more vinegary-one, though the thicker one was excellent, too. Pulled pork - FUHMAZING. Loved that. Still tasted great the following day as leftovers. Threw it on some toast and wah-lah! Breakfast, so good!
