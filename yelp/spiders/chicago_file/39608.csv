Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////USDA Prime Dry Aged 42 days New York steak, ticks all the right boxes.   You'd be surprised at how many pricey steaks aren't Dry Aged....or USDA Prime.     ~25 days aged is about average for a good steakhouse...once you get into the 40+ days you are in for something special.
