Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's gets 5 out of 5 stars all around. From the ambiance, to the service, to the amazing food, I was not disappointed in any aspect! My boyfriend and I made a reservation for my birthday a few months in advance, knowing how popular Bavette's is and now I understand why. The ambiance felt like a classy old time speak easy with dim lighting, leather couches and booths, and jazz music playing in the background. We got a drink at the bar while we waited to get seated, the drink menu mostly sticks to the classics, but they do them well! Even on a Wednesday night the bar was crowded and not a single table was open. However, we didn't have to wait long to get seated and once we did the service was great. We wanted to enjoy the experience and our waiter didn't rush us to order so he could turn the table. We took our time with our drink and ordered the crab cake for an appetizer. The crab cake was amazing, it had plenty of crab meat and was seasoned perfectly. It was a single crab cake, but the perfect amount for an appetizer for two especially knowing we were ordering steak for our entrée. They also provided a very generous portion of fresh sour dough bread and warm butter to tide us over until the main course. We ordered a bottle of wine and two different cuts of steak for our entrée. I got the petite duchess cut filet and he got the Chicago cut classic rib eye. They were cooked perfectly medium rare, my filet had a nice charred crust on it and was incredibly tender. My boyfriends rib eye was flavorful and basically melted in your mouth, probably the best steaks we have ever had! The menu is pricey, especially the steak, but for good reason. Definitely would recommend going at least once for a fancy dinner out!
