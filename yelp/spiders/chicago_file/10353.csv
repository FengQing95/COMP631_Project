Art Institute of Chicago////My favorite thing about the Art Institute is that it is accessible to everyone because they offer free days. Their 2011 FREE WEEKDAYS are going on now through February 4. Thursdays are still free through May 26, but will be ending after that. Starting June 1, 2011, the museum will be free all day on the first and second Wednesdays of every month. So if you're reading this review, visiting from out of town or looking for something different to do and wondering if it's worth a few hours of your time to explore this museum, I say absolutely.
