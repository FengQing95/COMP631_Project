Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was extremely delicious.  My parents and I couldn't get enough and we almost ordered another plate.  I love how the escargot was the perfect vehicle for the aioli with the nice contrasting crostini.  I kinda wish this was on the pintxos menu.  It was a fabulous flavor explosion in my mouth
