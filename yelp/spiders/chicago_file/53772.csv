Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered the salmon, bacon-wrapped dates, chicken and ham croquetas, Jam√≥n, chicken empanada, and the short rib. Everything was pretty average, all lacking flavor and spice. In no way would I say what we ordered was bad- the dates, short rib, and chicken empanada were above mediocre and enjoyable to eat. We also ordered the confit pork shoulder paella which was definitely worth the money. We followed the server's advice and fried an egg the next morning to put over the left over paella which was a great mid morning snack.
