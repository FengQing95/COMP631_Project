Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I love the pizza.  My girlfriend took me here for the first time when we were in Chicago.   It was also my first time having Chicago-style deep dish.  The pizza that claims to be Chicago-style deep dish in California simply doesn't compare to Lou's.  After having it, its my absolute favorite pizza.  Many of the pizza places I have had here in California were heavy and very greasy.  The pizza at Lou's, at least to me, was not heavy and greasy.
