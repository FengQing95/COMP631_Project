Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There's a full bar area where you can wait for your name to be called, and when I say "full" bar, I don't mean it's a fully stocked bar (which it is, go ahead, get your signature drink, no worries), I mean it's usually packed and standing room only - I've never seen this place empty.
