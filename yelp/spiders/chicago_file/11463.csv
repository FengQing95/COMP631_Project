Art Institute of Chicago////The galleries stretch across two buildings connected by pedestrian bridges hovering over train tracks. In addition to the paintings and sculpture on display, there's even a salvaged portion of the old Chicago Stock Exchange on display here. It's all compact enough for a brief visit if you only want to skim the highlights, but there's more than enough to see here to last a whole day. Well worth a visit if you're an art lover.
