Little Goat Diner////The waiting area is often filled to max capacity, but luckily my Sis put our name in by the time I arrive. She's standing outside and points up at the clouds, asking if I see the island, the puppy dog, a tulip. I see, but don't tell her, mosquitoes, plastic bottles, a ventilator, puffy white missiles that slowly glide to the city's skyline. She'd just finished a tough workout and asked to meet her here. This is the perfect place for a carb replenish.
