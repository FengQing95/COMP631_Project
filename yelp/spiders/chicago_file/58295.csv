Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here to meet friends. Great service. The tapas are mid-range to pricey. I was very ok about the food, nothing was bad but I didn't find a dish I really liked. Quite heavy (everything sauced with aioli) . Maybe we just didn't order the right thing? We got the chicken paella and 4 tapas dishes, total was maybe $140-160 (friend paid, friends had a drink each). It's a cute place, but it wasn't for me, especially for the price.
