Smoque BBQ////The reason I have to ding Smoque is that our ribs were undercooked. We got both baby back and spare ribs, and both needed more time in the smoker. It was a Sunday evening and it was very busy, so I suspect they were pulling the ribs off early in order to feed the crowd. Nonetheless, I was disheartened because I had heard so many rave reviews.
