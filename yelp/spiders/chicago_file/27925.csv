Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our waiter was terrible. When my boyfriend had asked about the birthday special, he straight up said NO with a stern, unfriendly face. WOW. Since he didn't take our order, as we had pre-ordered, he asked what we wanted to drink, we just wanted ice water. He took 15-20 minutes to bring us two cups of water. By that time, our pizza was almost ready and another waiter brought us our pizza and utensils because somehow we had been waiting and did not even receive the proper utensils. The other waiter served our pizzas and left. The pizza was good, the crust was buttery and crunchy with nice layers of cheese, sauce, toppings. One of the freshest I've ever had.
