Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Regarding the food, it's been three weeks since we ate here and I've found no reason to go back. I didn't leave the restaurant swooning over the food and time hasn't created that for me. The men enjoyed their bone in ribeye's but they weren't any better than what they've gotten at any other steakhouse or purchased from a great butcher and prepared at home. My bone in pork chop was much the same...it was delicious, but not standout. Someone else ordered some sandwich which looked tasty. To be honest I don't even remember her comment on it, if there was one.
