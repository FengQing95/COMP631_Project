Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We absolutely loved this place! The food was absurdly delicious, the vibe was very cool, Sunday night had the perfect crowd for a murmur to remind you that the restaurant was full, but you could still easily have a conversation, and the decor was very French/speakeasy cool without being trendy and lame. We started with the wedge salad, (which was humongous and delicious), followed by the traditional filets au poivre (absolutely to die for, especially since we'd been married the day before and basically abstaining from meals offering more than 500 calories for the past 2 months), the creamed spinach (absurd), and fries (can't lose with that aioli). Service was impeccable, and so was the wine. Highly recommended!
