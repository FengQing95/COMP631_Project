Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You expect to wait a long time at a deep dish pizza spot, but I'm not sure that this was worth it. The price was good, but the pizza we got was pretty disappointing. Crust was almost break your teeth hard, and the layers weren't really there. In one bite, you would have just sausage and crust, another cheese and sauce, and every other permutation. I'm not sure if they were in a rush or just lazy, but seeing all of the videos of malnatis preparing it looked like a perfect layering of the pizza. This was clearly not that.
