The Purple Pig////Stopped in here for breakfast one day at the beginning of my walk-about.  I had the fancy-grits, also known as polenta, and I was very happy with the result.  They came topped with poached eggs and other assorted items, and it looked like a work of art when it came out to my table.  Loved it.  Service was quick when I walked in.  I was directed to the register to place my order and given a number to be taken back to my table.  It didn't take long for the food to arrive, but I worked on my coffee while I waited.  Nice atmosphere, and I would recommend the Pig to anyone looking for a bite to eat with lots of options.
