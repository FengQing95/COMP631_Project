Smoque BBQ////The typically long lines attest to the excellence of the food that awaits inside.  The beef brisket can be ordered as a sandwich or a meal, either way it's fabulous.  The side dishes are a must have:  mac and cheese and for dessert the peach cobbler.  I just wish the portions were larger because they're so incredibly delicious.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  The BBQ sauces are excellent and perfect consistency, not too thin or too thick.   Parking can be a pain, but once you find a spot, you're in for a treat.
