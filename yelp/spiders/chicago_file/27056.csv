Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The service is also really great; our server cut the pizza up like a true professional, and served each slice to each of our plates quickly and cleanly. I mean, I guess that sounds kind of high maintenance, but I've had bad experiences cutting and serving deep dish pizza before, so I appreciated his help!
