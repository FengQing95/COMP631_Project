Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Best food we had in Chicago! We went in pretty irritated because we had a reservation and there was still over a twenty minute wait despite being on time, but the food and the service more than made up for it. The Paella Valenciana which has confit pork shoulder, crispy pork belly, chorizo ibérico & chicharrónes was unbelievable! Pricey, but worth it for a special night out! Peach sangria was great, and I could eat the brussels sprout salad with candied marcona almonds and manchego cheese for the rest of my life and die happy. Beef Tenderloin & Blue Cheese served with housemade chips was also really good.
