Smoque BBQ////This is where the Smoque is the creme de la creme!. Again, BBQ ribs are the best I had outside of St Louis. The suprising star for this place is actually thier brisket and the common and lowly Mac and Cheese. I had the best Brisket here, nice and tendor, melt in your mouth.I was not a fan of Mac and Cheese until I came to this place. Bake beans - a BBQ staple is tasty and well done.
