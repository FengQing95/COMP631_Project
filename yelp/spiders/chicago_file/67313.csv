Little Goat Diner////As recommended, we had This Little Piggy Went to China, the Bull's Eye French Toast, and a side of hash browns. I really liked Little Piggy - unique flavors that blended well together. I was very underwhelmed with the French Toast. It was kinda boring and the crispy chicken that came with it wasn't very good. The hash browns were just ok... on the menu it says the hash browns are, "shredded on the griddle with cheese." I love hash browns and with cheese, even better! However, since they didn't specify what type of cheese, I assumed it would be regular cheddar cheese or something. But what I tasted was goat cheese... and I am NOT a fan of that. I started thinking, ok the place is called Little Goat, so is all the cheese on their menu assumed to be goat cheese? I don't know. All I'm saying is that it would have been nice to know that the cheese going into my hash browns was goat cheese. If I had known, I would have asked for it WITHOUT that. I know I could have easily asked for a replacement, but I'm not for wasting food. Ah well. I'd still come back though since the service was great and I really want to try those Dark Chocolate Chip Crunch Pancakes!
