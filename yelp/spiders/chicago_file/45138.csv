Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Spain is arguably my favorite country to visit in the world, and some of my fondest memories are of long summer evenings spent tapas-bar-hopping, sipping on vino tinto and noshing on pinxtos of the most incredible flavors, colors, and textures. Spain also has the Mediterranean Sea and its incredibly fresh seafood to draw on...we in Chicago are not quite so fortunate. All of this is a long way of saying that I'm usually satisfied at best with American renditions of tapas. While its impossible to recreate the history, culture, and (dare I say) magic of tapas in Basque country, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba does a more than passable translation right in the heart of Lincoln Park.
