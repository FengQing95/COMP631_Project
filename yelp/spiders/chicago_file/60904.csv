Smoque BBQ////This very well could be my number one choice for BBQ in the city.  Went there for the first time this weekend after reading a review in the Redeye.  The slow cooked chopped brisket sandwich was one of the best I have ever had.  Almost as good was the pulled pork!  The BBQ is the perfect balance of sweet and spicy.   The cole slaw with red onions was excellent.  The baked mac n cheese met every expectation.  The fries were perfect.  My brother in law had the St. Louis Ribs and said "If I lived above Twin Anchors and [Smoque] was 10 blocks away, I would make the walk without a doubt".  I really can't tell you how much I liked this place and how excited I am to return!
