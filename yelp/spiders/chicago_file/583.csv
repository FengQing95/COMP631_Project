Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Five of us went there for brunch yesterday. Three ordered egg dishes, one pancakes, one a burger. The three of us that had egg dishes became sick  later, that evening  with diarrhea and/or nausea. Called the manager today, but he dismissed it: he had eggs, he said and was fine. Unresponsive management and potential food poisoning. Find another place to eat.
