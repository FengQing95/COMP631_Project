Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Awesome Spanish tapa place with casual and vibrant ambience, delicious food, and great service! Loved the spicy potato, octopus, scallops, and house marinated olives. Seafood pallera was excellent too but I was too full to finish! The chocolate cake dessert was very good too. Our server was very attentive. Valet parking added additional points! Loved this place and will come again for my next Chicago trip.
