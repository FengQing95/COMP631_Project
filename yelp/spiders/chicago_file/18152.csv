Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is our first experience for Chicago's deep dish pizza. We ordered the classic Chicago pizza, the crust is great but there's a lot of sauce and it's a bit watery. The malnati salad is delicious. There was a long wait but we placed our order as soon as we arrived because the pizza takes about 30-40 minutes to be ready. The staff members are extremely nice.
