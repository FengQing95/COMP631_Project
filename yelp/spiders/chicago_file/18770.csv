Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's isn't bad, but if you recommend it to people who are used to eating pizza in New York, they're not going to go crazy over it. Â If I had to rank the 5 deep dish pizza places I've tried in Chicago, I'd rate Pizzeria Uno/Due and Giordanos at the top, Lou Malnati's on the 2nd tier, and Gino's East at a way distant, never order from again bottom tier.
