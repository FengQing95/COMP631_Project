Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The environment is great. I prefer to sit outdoor as long as it's not too humid/hot. You get to eat delicious food, drink a nice sangria, all while sitting in a light breeze under small twinkling lights! The service is fantastic. Everybody is just so nice. Once I planned on taking my bf to here for dinner but his flight got delayed... I called in to cancel my reservation and to inquire about the time of last sitting. They told me as long as we get there before midnight they can sit us! We made there around 11:30pm and there were still a lot of people enjoying the air in the patio. it was such a good night and i thank them for that.
