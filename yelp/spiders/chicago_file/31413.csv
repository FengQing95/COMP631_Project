Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The trio of dips and pizza chips was the absolute best decision ever. Get this, you won't regret it! (Actually, your stomach might regret it when you need to unbutton those pants) But seriously, this appetizer is what I'd give Lou Malnati's a 5 stars for! The crispy pizza chip were like a soft pita chip that held all the dips very well. They were all topped with its own herbs, spices, and chopped tomatoes too. But the real winners here are these dips: roasted garlic, artichoke, and giardiniera-topped hummus. Wow, each of them were so delicious and flavored with my favorite being the artichoke dip for sure. I was honestly satisfied just having this dip and chips already.
