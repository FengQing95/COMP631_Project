Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was blown away with how on top of their carryout game they are! Our food was fresh out of the oven and we didn't even have to leave our car! We ordered online and paid, so we only had to pick up. We were greeted as soon as we parked, the gentleman called in to let the inside know we were there and our pizza was right out! In these crazy times, it was really nice to be able to enjoy a fresh, hot, deep dish!
