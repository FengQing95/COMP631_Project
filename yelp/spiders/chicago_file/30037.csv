Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My 3-star rating comes not because Lou Malnati's is a bad restaurant, or that they don't have great service, but because Chicago deep dish pizza, in general, is underwhelming. Lou Malnati's, Pequod's, Uno Pizzaria, Gordianos, and other high profile deep dish pizza places are all very similar - I might get shit on for this, but the truth is that they've stayed competitive and been competitive for so many decades because they're just that - competitive and similar. Deep dish pizza in general seems to be the problem - its not particularly special at all given the potential of deep dish pizza. You want more flavor. You want more toasty carbs. Maybe it's because it's such a tourist attraction already and demand is already so high so the need for better taste isn't necessary, but it was lackluster compared to what could have been.
