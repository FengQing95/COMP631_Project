Art Institute of Chicago////I really enjoyed myself at the museum.  I went for a couple of hours.  I thought I was going to see the Obama paintings but got my weeks messed up.  One of the overseers of the rooms told me I would love the Bisa Butler exhibit and she wasn't lying.  I thoroughly enjoyed her exhibit and the overall museum.  I will be back it's very peaceful and thought provoking to be in there.
