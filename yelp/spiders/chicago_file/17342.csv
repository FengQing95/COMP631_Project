Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I got this 3-dip appetizer to kick things off. I wish I had 20 pounds of this stuff!!!!  The pizza chips it came with were amazing!!!!  The dips were pretty dang good too. The spin-arti dip was good, the garlic was just OK, and the Hummus dip was KILLER!!!  I crushed all of that ish!!!
