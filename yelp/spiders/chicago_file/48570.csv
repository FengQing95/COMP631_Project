Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was able to get a great table and the private party coordinators (Alison and Michelle) had me choose various cold tapas, hot tapas, and desserts and made them into a cute pre-fixed menu! This eliminated the pressure of any decision making for such a large group. The food came out quickly and one right after the other...just as we were finishing up with one tapa, the next was being served. It helped that we had a stellar waiter. Everyone LOVED the food, and the sangria was yummy as ever.
