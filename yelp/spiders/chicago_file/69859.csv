Little Goat Diner////This review is solely for the bakery bar. My fianc√© and I wanted to try out a great dessert spot. We loved the atmosphere. Definitely a hipster spot. We loved everything about it. An old fashion soda pop diner meets modern times. The drinks were great and had a fabulous selection. The dessert was fantastic. Music was great. It was extremely crowded however the bar tenders were fabulous keeping everyone with full glasses and happy! Service was spectacular and all bar tenders were very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back continually. Great spot in our neighborhood.
