Little Goat Diner////The Bullseye French Toast is a must eat! It is the perfect blend of sweet and savory- the french toast is ooey gooey and eggy (YUM) and the fried chicken was perfectly cooked! Little Piggy Went to China had a really good cheddar biscuit but the the chili sauce was too overpowering- i ended up picking it off my food.
