The Purple Pig////I would give the food Â 6 stars without another thought. However, I don't understand why The Purple Pig does not take reservations. The restaurant is (deservedly) extremely popular and you can look forward to more than an hour's wait any time of day. This makes it hard to plan for meal here, you almost have to hope you get to eat here.
