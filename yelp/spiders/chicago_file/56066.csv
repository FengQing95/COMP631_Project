Smoque BBQ////We ordered the St. Louis ribs with 2 sides and the Half-Half Sandwich. Perhaps it was when we went (late afternoon), but the brisket (chopped only) was dry and the ribs was not as tender. The sides (fries, BBQ beans and Mac and Cheese) was good, but I can't distinguish between gourmet Mac and Cheese and Kraft's.
