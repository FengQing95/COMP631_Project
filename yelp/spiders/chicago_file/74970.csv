Little Goat Diner////I'll probably come back if I can get into a private event on the roof. Unfortunately, the chicken pot pie was almost as expensive as the burger and it was only the size of one of the buns. On top of that, or waitress never asked how the food was and only stopped by to fill our waters. Obviously, that's all you really need, but I had a better conversation with the guy who brought out my leaning tower of goat meat.
