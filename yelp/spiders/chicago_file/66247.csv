Little Goat Diner////The place does resemble a traditional diner, but  cleaner, more comfortable,  larger and with better music.  My waiter and the other people who checked up on my water and coffee were attentive and polite. I had the hash and a biscuit.  The hash was from scratch, not at all greasy or salty, it had plenty of meat, and the portion was just right (I'm a 185# guy).  I asked for hot sauce for the eggs and was brought two types of house-made hot sauces, both of which were excellent.  The biscuit was excellent: warm, flaky, light and buttery.  The only thing I would change is to make the bread sides part of the breakfasts.  Pretty much any traditional diner would just include it, and I think most everyone wants some kind of toast or biscuit with their breakfast.  Prices were higher than most breakfast places, but reasonable for a trendy joint.  I walked right in and got a table, but keep in mind it was on Monday at 1015 am.
