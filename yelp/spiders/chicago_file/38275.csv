Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Side note, very much appreciated how Bavette's added a tomato and some arugula with my 6oz steak as dressing to the plate. I was a little anxious about how my small steak would be presented and it was really refreshing to see some different colors on my steak presentation. I can't count how many times I've gotten tiny steaks on gigantic empty plates!
