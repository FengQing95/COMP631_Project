Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Had a small cheese deep dish pizza. It's the first deep dish I've ever had and I think it might not be for me. I didn't like the crust. It was too soft in the center and the edge was too hard to eat. It was not buttery, flaky and crispy like others described at all. Also, I think there was too little tomato sauce. 3 stars because the cheese taste good. Overall, I didn't like the ratio of crust, cheese and tomato sauce.
