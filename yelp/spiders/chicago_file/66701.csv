Little Goat Diner////If I could give this place 4.5 stars, I would. I love this place, especially the Stumptown coffee. Visited a couple of times. The first time I ate breakfast and shared a sandwich, and the second I sat at the bar and had a white chocolate rosemary scone and a bloody mary. They make the best bloody marys I have ever had. The sandwich was delicious, and the bread perfectly toasted. After eating here, I went home and fell into a food coma.
