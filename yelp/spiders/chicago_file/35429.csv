Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We're not sure exactly what happened between then and now. Bavette's has always been a very busy and well-booked restaurant so we thought that they would be prepared. Perhaps our first experience was so late that we had proper service attention, but this time the restaurant was obviously incredibly understaffed.
