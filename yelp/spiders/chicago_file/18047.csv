Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza was really good and so was the service. Came in and was quickly seated in the back and was advised on the wait time on the food. The hype lived up to the food everything was top notch. Got the regular pizza added garlic and light on the sauce . Not a huge sauce person. Would highly recommend this place if visiting from out of town.
