Little Goat Diner////This is a definite go-again for me. I had a very good patty melt - tender, juicy ground beef cooked perfectly medium to order and covered with melted cheese. I ordered the Kennebec home fries on the side. They were good but I actually wanted more potatoes and fewer bacon crumbs. Some of the potato pieces were too tiny to see. The service was excellent, the space bright and noisy. It's promoted as a diner, but it's a fairly slick, hipster place. The food is very good and that's what counts.
