Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm not generally a thick-crust person, but this is Chicago so had to try it out.  I can definitely see why people rave about this place, a completely different experience and well worth it.  The wait was crazy (45min on a Tuesday evening), but they let you pre-order along the way, so that helps
