Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here about two weeks ago. Loved everything about the place. The ambiance stands out in particular, and the al fresco dining was inviting and pleasant for the summer. The sangrias are a must order, and even considering Ba-Ba-Reeba as a tapas restaurant everything we ordered was of a medium plate size and very reasonably priced. We had the wood roasted peppers, eggplant and tomato jarra, the sweet potato bravas with pomegranate alioli, the goat cheese in tomato sauce, the fried green peppers, the short ribs, and a few other things. I would recommend any of these.
