Little Goat Diner////I've tried so many things on the menu that I've loved here. From the Sloppy Goat to the Bull's Eye French Toast to the This Little Piggy Went to China, all the dishes shy away from regular old diner food to give you something that you most likely have never tried before. And if you're looking closely at the menu, you'll probably notice a milkshake that has pork in it. Yes, it's delicious.
