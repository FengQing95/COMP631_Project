Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My family ordered minestrone and mozzarella sticks which they gobbled up pretty fast. We also had Â the deep dish; I had the classic and they selected their own toppings (black olives, peppers..and some other thing). The individual size was the perfect size for me and I was satisfied without feeling like I was too full to walk.
