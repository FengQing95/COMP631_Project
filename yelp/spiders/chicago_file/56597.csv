Smoque BBQ////This place may be the best BBQ in the city.  I've tried most nearly everything on their menu and my 2 favorites are their sliced beef brisket and pulled pork.  Both are very tender and flavorful.  What really makes this place though is their side dishes.  You can pick from BBQ beans, Mac N Cheese, Peach Cobbler, French Fries and now Beef Brisket Chili.  The fries are awesome, and you get a ton of them.  The Mac N Cheese and Brisket Chili are really good as well.  When ordering a platter you get a choice of two, and I usually go with the fries and cobbler so I get something sweet to finish off the meal with.
