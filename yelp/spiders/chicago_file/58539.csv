Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here last Saturday for my sister's 30th birthday. This was my first time here and I gotta say the food here was excellent. The service was really good and our sever was very friendly. My favorite dish was the seafood paella and the bacon wrapped dates, which was far beyond amazing. I definitely will be coming back here again!
