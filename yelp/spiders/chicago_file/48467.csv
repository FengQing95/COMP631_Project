Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place was recommended by a friend and we enjoyed our meal and the experience very much.  The style is Spanish Tapas, and the choices are seemingly endless.  With so many options, we were thankful for a server and a manager who made awesome recommendations.  We started with an appetizer sampler, the highlights being the variety and freshness.  Next up goat cheese in tomato sauce with insanely good croutonish slices of bread.  The cheese was smooth and the sauce was flavorful and hot.  A great blend of textures and elements.  We finished our main meal with the Rioja-Braised Short Rib.  It is served over Manchego mashed potatoes with baby root vegetables & rioja wine glaze.  Some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had in that dish, and the short rib was tender and juicy.  We finished with a small dessert, the macona almond caramel bar.  2-3 bites of bliss.
