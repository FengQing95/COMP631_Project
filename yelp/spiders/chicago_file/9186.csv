Art Institute of Chicago////I entered through the modern wing, and I was given access to the new "The City Lost and Found: New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, 1960-1980" exhibit only. The exhibit included artifacts from historical moments in these three cities, including the Democratic National Convention and development of the South Loop in Chicago. I wasn't very impressed with this exhibit. There was a heavy reliance on black and white photographs, rather than paintings and sculptures. The photographs depicted ordinary life and more times than not, changes in the skyline of these cities. I'm not an art critic, but these were photographs I wouldn't think were "art." Â
