Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////ok flash back to '04...i move to the city permanently, after a 3 1/2 year run at MSU. since '04 i have hit up ba-ba quite a few times and always have a great dining experience there. i have been to many a birthday dinner (b/c usually you spend between $25-45 depending on the number of people, if it's all girls or girls and guys (more guys means more meat dishes)) and girls dinners as well.
