Art Institute of Chicago////The new Modern wing showcases the museum's collection of 20th and 21st century art and is just beautiful.  The current Picasso exhibit is also quite amazing.  I went to the member's only lecture a few Sunday's ago and was pleased to see so many people in attendance to learn more about this wonderful exhibit.
