Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas. Kind of expensive tapas. THAT would be okay since the food was fairly good. We ended up trying most things on the menu. (Thank you corporate write-off!). Next time though...I'm bringing my magnifying glass to see the portion of my share. We were a party of 4 adults and a baby who were sat next to like a party of 12. Loud, drunken, rude, party of 12...so it was difficult for the server to hear us. That resulted in a couple of missed orders with our server. Thankfully, the server was nice enough...though sincerely...the party of 12 got all of the servers attentiveness. Please visit...when you don't wish to speak to one another...and are not that hungry...unless you have lots of money and time.
