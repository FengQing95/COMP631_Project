Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Attracted by the ridiculously cheap prices displayed on the menu outside, my friend and I wandered in thinking this was a nice up-scale cafe in which we could both order a plate and be satisfied. Unfortunately we failed to realize how tiny the portions were because the main focus were the tapas. There's nothing wrong with that, and the small dishes we ordered (spicy potatoes and brussels sprouts salad? or something of that nature) were absolutely delicious. The tapas themselves take a long time to bake and prepare because they make them fresh, but overall really great atmosphere and lovely service.
