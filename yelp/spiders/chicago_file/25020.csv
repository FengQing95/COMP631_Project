Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A friend of mine from Chicago once shipped me frozen pizzas from here after discovering that I'd never been to Chicago. The frozen cheese pizzas blew my mind so I was pretty eager to try the "real" version. They recommended the chicago classic, which I got (switched out the sausage for poultry though). It takes 45 minutes to come out of the oven (oy) so I opted to get a soup too.
