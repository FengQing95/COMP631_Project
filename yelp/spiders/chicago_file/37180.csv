Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For food, we started with their garlic shrimp appetizer, which came in a generous portion of 6 gorgeous, plump shrimp in a decadent sauce. By the time we had worked though that, our entrees had arrived. Between the two of us, we split the lamb chops and a 10oz fillet, and their brussel sprouts, which (given our choice in appetizer and bread) was a perfect amount for two to share - just enough to save room for dessert; the chocolate ice cream, while simple, was a great way to wrap up our meal. I made the reservation to try this place after hearing about it from a coworker and, may I say, it was completely worth the wait - I am very much looking forward to coming back
