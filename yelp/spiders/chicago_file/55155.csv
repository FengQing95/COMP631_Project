Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is officially my favorite place to go to in Chicago! I had heard so much hype about it and it reaches all expectations and more! Make sure you make a reservation in advance as it books up!! You are served some fresh bread and oil while reading the menu and its a hit already. We then started off with a half pitcher of Sangria which was plenty for two people and delicious!!!  They have fun flavors including blue rasberry, peach, and passion fruit. We tried the passion fruit and highly recommend it.  Next we put in our order for paella as it takes about 40 minutes to cook. the seafood paella is soooo worth the wait and price of 17 per person. It is just full of flavors and the squit was impeccable!! The rest of the menu is separated into bites, and then different types of tapas. You have a vegetarian, chicken/pork, beef, and seafood section to choose from. We ordered the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce and beef wagyu crostini. OMGI dont even know where to begin with each of those. Everything was soo sooo soo good! We wanted to order more but it was already plenty of food for two people. We then decided to try the date stuffed with goat cheese and crostini small bites. I wish there were full plates of both of these as they were the best bites of food I have tried in a long time. Absolutely love the place!!
