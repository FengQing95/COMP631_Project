The Purple Pig////I had my doubts because the portion sizes looked small in photos / not that yummy but boy I was wrong! The pork shoulder is probably the most perfect and beautifully cooked piece of meat I have ever consumed. Still dreaming about it days later. The food was served piping hot which I loveeee.
