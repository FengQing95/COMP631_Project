Little Goat Diner////Mmmmm. We tried to go to Au Chevel, but there was a 45 minute wait at 11pm on a Wednesday!! So we went here instead, and I'm so glad we did! I've been wanting to try it anyway. The menu almost has too many items on it for my little indecisive brain. I wanted like 20 things. Luckily, my 4 friends and I love to share, so we each got something, plus some mac and cheese and smoked fries for the table. I actually thing the smoked fries were one of the best things we got! The cheese sauce that it came with was yummy.
