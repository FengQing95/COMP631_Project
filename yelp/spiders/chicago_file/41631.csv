Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Sub bar tapas.  Have rearranged the portion size since I was first there around 5 years ago.  Atmosphere is ok, and the paella is good.  I would recommend the seafood one.  The way to enjoy this place is to go with a large party and get a private room.  Going with a large party is a nice experience  because it gives everyone the opportunity to try different things and split the large paella dishes.
