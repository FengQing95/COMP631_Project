Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The sampler was a large platter of fried stuff... zucchini, mushroom, mozzarella cheese sticks, and cheddar cheese balls. The flavor was good, but it was just way too fried. Served with marinara and ranch, I found myself picking of even more of the fried coating than I usually do. I wish I would have ordered a bruschetta or garlic bread app instead. Maybe next time.
