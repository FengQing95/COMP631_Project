Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am updating my review of Lou Malnati's Pizzeria because the manager personally reached out to me to ask about my experience.  The manager was very apologetic and let me know my experience was atypical of what the restaurant sets out to achieve.  He asked if there was anything he could do to help.  He offered me a refund but I told him I was willing to try it again since the reason I chose it was based off recommendations and feedback.  Also, they obviously care about their customers.  He offered to pay for my second pizza and asked me to try the deep dish.  I was supposed to go back Friday night since I was still in town but was unable due to an unscheduled business dinner. I was very impressed with how they handled my experience and what they offered to make it right.  I go to Chicago at least once a quarter and will retry the pizza.
