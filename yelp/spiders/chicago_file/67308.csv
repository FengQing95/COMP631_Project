Little Goat Diner////The food here was a huge disappointment. Corned beef hash tasted like old grease, it was not even edible. Also got the little piggy went to china and the sauce ruined it. Altogether terrible. I don't understand why the reviews for this place are so good. Maybe we ordered the wrong items. I think it's probably just too hyped. Service was great but I would never come back. Blecch.
