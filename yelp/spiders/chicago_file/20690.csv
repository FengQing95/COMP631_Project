Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had a great time here!! Even though there was minor mix up with the gift certificate we won, they took care of us. Before they were even aware of the "issue" they treated us awesomely!! The food was great. True deep dish (may not as deep as you would think for Chicago but to us, it was Â better because we could actually enjoy two whole pieces of pizzas each without feeling like we ate a big ball of dough). The pizza was flavorful, service was wonderful,and the Blue Moon pitcher (on special) was great!!! The decor and atmosphere is cool too!! I am exited to recommend this place to future visitors to Chicago!!!!!!
