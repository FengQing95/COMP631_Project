Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had the small Chicago classic pizza with mushrooms added. We had the loose chicken pasta, which is like a fettuccine Alfredo but better. And we also had the calamari. All of that was good. The difference between this and Giordano's was that this dish had less sauce and more cheese. Depending on the type of deep dish you like either one is good. And if I had to choose between the two I would choose this place.
