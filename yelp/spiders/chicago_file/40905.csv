Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been here 3 times in the last year and a half and it just gets better every time. The best part of course is the food, every single dish I've had there is absolutely to die for. From the bacon wrapped dates to the beef dishes to the seafood dishes to the desserts, I have not had a tapas plate I didn't enjoy. The sangria and craft cocktails are diverse and delicious. The service is impeccable, and they know how to handle large parties. To me, the atmosphere they create is what I would hope to find in an exotic Spanish city, full of life, laughter, and great food. I feel the price is very reasonable when you consider the quality of the food, service, and atmosphere you experience there. And on top of all of this, they have $1 and $3 tapas dishes and 1/2 priced craft cocktails for Monday happy hour. Not to mention their special events, including wine and beer tastings, live performances, and live music. My favorite restaurant in Chicago, bar none. I can't wait to try their brunch!
