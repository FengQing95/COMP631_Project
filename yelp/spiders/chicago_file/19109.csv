Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My colleagues had been in Chicago a few weeks back for a trade show that had lasted 3-4 days. Apparently, they had dined at LM's more than just a few times during the course of their trip (this was the location they had visited) - this already says a lot about this place! LM's left such an impression on my boss, that he wanted to order some for the office!
