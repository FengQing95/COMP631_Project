Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The items listed in red are the popular items.  My favorite was the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, and it's served on freshly toasted, crusty garlic bread, where you can spread the baked tomato sauce & rich goat cheese.  It's a lovely combination, unexpected to me at first, but surprisingly good.  I like cheese, I like bread, and I love a good tomato sauce so this tapas was my absolute favorite!  Everytime I come back here I'd order it again, and again...
