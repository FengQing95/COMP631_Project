Smoque BBQ////The price is right and the food is amazing.  We had Smoque cater a party last Summer and it was delicious.  Not a bite was left behind.  I LOOOOVE this place.  Don't let the long lines on the week-ends scare you away.  They move quickly and are very organized inside to move people in and out.
