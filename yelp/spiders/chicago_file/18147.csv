Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This time, I did not add additional cheese.  I also took the pizza out of the pan and placed it on a cookie sheet.  After 15 minutes the crust started to brown excessively, so I placed one of those pie protectors on the crust.  Cooked it for an additional 30 minutes, and took it out of the oven.
