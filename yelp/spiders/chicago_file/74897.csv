Little Goat Diner////Every meal I've ever had here is AMAZING. Most recently I had the corn beef hash. It's one of the more traditional items on the menu but it was packed with great flavor and was a pretty hefty portion. The service here is outstanding but the wait can be long-even with a reservation we waited about 15 minutes past our reserved time- Â so it may not be the best for big groups.
