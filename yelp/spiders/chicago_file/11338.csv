Art Institute of Chicago////As with many of the other world's famous museums, the Art Institute building is a piece of art in itself. The high ceilings and the openness creates a welcoming feeling to all who come to visit. You'll have art and artifacts here that will be pleasing to all sorts of art lovers from your more modern works to your old timey odd self portraits. I appreciate most of the art out there so I had a lot of fun experiencing what the museum had to offer.
