Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Okay... first this place gets BUSY... like really, really, really busy. With that being said, make sure you make reservations. We made ours through open table and it was a breeze. I think you can also make them through the restaurant website. There isn't a private parking lot, but there is limited parking on street (which we got) and there is Valet for $13.
