Art Institute of Chicago////In the winter you can sit indoors just beside the courtyard in a Frank Lloyd Wright inspired fine dining room. The food there is exquisite and the setting is very intelligent romantic. (I am just waiting for the day when a guy takes me there on a date, I'll just melt. Smart, cool and sophisticated? ooo)
