Art Institute of Chicago////Since I read it gets super crowded, we went right as they opened on a Sunday morning. We entered in the Modern Wing (by the pedestrian bridge that brings you into the third floor) and there was no line. Buy your tickets early! We were able to walk right in. It also was never really too crowded (just by a few of the famous paintings) the entire time we were there because the place is so big so we never felt crammed in.
