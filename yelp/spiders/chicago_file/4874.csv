The Purple Pig////This is definitely a hot spot and expect a long wait. I came in at 7pm, got sat around 8:10. Yes, over an hour and I was contemplating whether I should ditch this place or be patient. Glad I waited because I absolutely thought the food was amazing. Like something out of a Top Chef kitchen! Their plates were much smaller, something you see only boujee people eating. Yup, I was proud of it! Haha. The plating was gorgeous and the food was interestingly different and yummy.
