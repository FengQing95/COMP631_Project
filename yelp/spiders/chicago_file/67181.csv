Little Goat Diner////A serious staple and favorite of mine in the city. Both adventurous AND picky eaters alike will be happy here. I have yet to order something I don' t like (the shakes are good, the reuben is good, the fries are good, the drinks are good....), and the staff always seems friendly even when it's PACKED. In fact, one time when we evidently were waiting too long for our food (which, honestly, we didn't even notice), we got comped a few apps. How lovely.
