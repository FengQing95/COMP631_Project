Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ordered the vegan pizza thin crust. It was hot with plenty of tomatoes, mushrooms and peppers and an over abundance of cheeses. I seasoned it with a lot of red crushed pepper and would not recommend for a vegan option. I threw away most of the pizza because it was drowning in cheese.
