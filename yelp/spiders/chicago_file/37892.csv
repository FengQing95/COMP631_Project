Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Best steak In Chicago! Don't get me wrong other places have very good steaks but this is the BEST of them all! They way they crust the steak is unreal! Steaks have a nice full juicy flavor that can't help but water the mouth. Â Sides could be better, but the steak makes up for all that! Service is good, could be a little brighter inside but not the end of the world! Hard to get reservations at appropriate dinner times, plan on eating late lol!
