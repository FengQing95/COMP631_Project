Bavette's Bar & Boeuf//// For my main meal I had the filet mignon - petite duchess cut (SO GOOD), and the table ordered the following sides to split: pommes frites, elote style corn, brussels sprouts, and the truffle mac & cheese. I've never eaten Brussel sprouts prior to this night, but I know I will forever eat them as long as they are charred with dijon and parmesan. They may not be "healthy" by that point in time, but man were they delicious.
