Little Goat Diner////Part of my job involves entertaining clients for breakfast and/or lunch.  Due to lack of neighborhood options during the week I have been to breakfast at Little Goat about 10 times and a few times for lunch.   Normally my colleagues and I find the food to be generally ok to good (never great).  There is nothing close to healthy on the menu either so everything should taste great due to the amount of fat put into everything.
