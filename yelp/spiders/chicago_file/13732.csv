Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The second and last of the famous Chicago deep dish pizzas I tried...three hours after the first.  I'm pretty sure that there is Italian in some part of my Chinese ancestry because I looooove pizza.  Whoever first created the buttered crust at Lou Malnati's Pizzeria should be anointed to sainthood.  Just sprinkle some melted butter onto his forehead and have his divine symbol be a round piece of buttered dough.  However, I believe that Giordano's ingredients were more worthy of my praise.  The cheese, tomato, and pepperoni stuffing just didn't tickle my fancy.  Also, the slow service at Lou's baffled me.  It was about 5pm and I sat at my table for 20 minutes before a server even approached me.
