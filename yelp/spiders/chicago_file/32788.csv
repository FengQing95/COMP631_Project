Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Had been wanting to try this place for a while and finally made it there last night.  The food really was very good, but was expecting a bit more given all the hype.  We started off with the goat cheese appetizer, which was really tasty and was a good size to share between the 4 of us.  For the main course, my dad and my husband had the ribeye and did really enjoy it.  My mom had the filet and though I tried it and really enjoyed it, she said that it wasn't her favorite.  My beef stroganoff was also very good and the fresh noodles were particularly tasty.  We also shared the corn and a baked potato as sides--the corn did live up to they hype and the potato, well, it was a potato, but the thick bacon pieces on top set it apart.  The weird thing was that though we ordered these sides for sharing, they didn't bring any side plates or serving utensils (guess we could have flagged down a server and asked), but it just seemed odd.  Guess I was supposed to put a big scoop of corn (with the fork I had been eating off of) in the middle of my beef stroganoff noodles?  The real standout of the meal was the dessert....we had the chocolate cream pie and boy, was it delicious.  Not sure what they put in that crust but am pretty sure it is addictive.  Overall, we had an enjoyable dinner but just didn't think it was the best meal of our lives.
