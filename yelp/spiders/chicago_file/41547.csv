Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////On my first visit, went for one of their Bodega Ba Ba Reeba wine tastings. It was such a lovely evening for such a resonable price. We were able to try at least 25 different selections from all over Spain and actually enjoyed speaking with the sommeliars. They were friendly, insightful and inviting. Â During the evening, waiters were passing around tapas to all the guests, which I found to be a nice treat between each tasting. Morever, the lively music and jovial crowd made for an overall memorable experience.
