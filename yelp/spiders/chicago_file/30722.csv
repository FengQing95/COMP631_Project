Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////While visiting Chicago, I was told I should not leave without trying the deep dish pizza. A few of my friends highly recommended Lou Malnati's and so I ended up ordering delivery to my hotel on a Sunday evening. The online ordering was easy to navigate and the food was delivered right around the time that was estimated.
