The Purple Pig////Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg $9 - This is a dish I read everyone raving about and was determined to try. I was not a fan though! I found it to be salty and I didn't think the ingredients married quite well with each other. I do love a well cooked egg though and it was well done! It was okay but it's not something I would get again.
