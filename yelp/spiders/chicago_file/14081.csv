Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best pizza on the planet.  Always get the buttercrust and it's always best in the restaurant out of the pan so it's crispier.  There are many locations now, though usually consistency is not usually an issue.  If you take it to go and eat it out of the box, just know it is even better out of the pan (or out of your oven - order it uncut and crisp it back up for 10 minutes).
