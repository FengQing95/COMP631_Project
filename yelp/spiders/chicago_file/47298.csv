Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here with my mom, grandma, and sisters this past Sunday for Mother's Day.  We had a reservation at 12:30, and good thing because it was pretty busy.  We were sat right away and pleasantly surprised to be offered a table on their patio which definitely made our experience 10x better.  For our group of five the bill was $90 (including a 1/2 pitcher of GREAT mango sangria!), ..much lower than expected!
