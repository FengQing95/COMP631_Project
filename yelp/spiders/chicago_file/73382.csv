Little Goat Diner////Me and my dinner date sat side-by-side at the bar, which actually made it easier to hear and carry-on a conversation each other than it might have been yelling across a booth or table. Â The atmosphere is trendy, bustling and deafening at times...the waitress was nearly talking into my ear to tell me the beers similar to my liking.
