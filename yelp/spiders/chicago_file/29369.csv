Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Definitely different than other style of deep dish pizza. I like it's freshly made to order but not sure if I would come back and wait for 40min. We got a half and half with both the meat and the Lou classic version. So cheesy that I feel like I'm eating a fondue, flavor is great but not my style.
