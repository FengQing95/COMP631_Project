Smoque BBQ////Simply delicious!  The sliced brisket is so tender utensils are useless.  My own mother said it was worth the trip to Chicago just for Smoque, and I haven't seen her in 3 months.   Everything was so good!  Mac n Cheese, fries, peach cobbler and cornbread.  There were three of us, so we all sampled from one another.  I seriously can't wait to go back!
