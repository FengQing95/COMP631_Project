Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is by far my favorite restaurant in Chicago. We have ordered the 42 day dry aged bone in ribeye twice. At 22 oz. it is enough steak to split between two people. We've also had, for sides, the butternut squash, buttery mashed potatoes, truffle mac & cheese, elote style corn, and brussels sprouts. I can't say I have a favorite side as they have all been great. We also had the salmon tartare to start and it was delicious. The waiters here have been top notch each visit. We recommend to everyone who visits Chicago.
