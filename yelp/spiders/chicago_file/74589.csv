Little Goat Diner////They accommodated our group of seven at a large table. We started with several apps: hot crab dip (comes with ritz crackers), crispy shrimp cocktail (think shrimp lettuce wrap) and goat chili cheese fries. Oh my, those fries. They smoke their fries for three hours (say what!). French fries will never be the same again.
