The Purple Pig////First time in Chicago and wanted some local favorites.  We had ribeye cap (black garlic, wild rice, eggplant, braised pine nuts, pomegranate) and red snapper (purple jam, mushrooms, and spanish apple) both were delicious. The serving size was small but it was filling.  Our only complaint was that my husband's snapper came out after I had finished my ribeye. My waiter told me not to wait for my husband's entree since my dish tasted better hot.
