Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Wait was long but called ahead got on wait list.  Arrived only waited few minutes but overall wait from time calling was 65 minutes.  Went with boneless wings and thin crust cheese.  Wings were cold hard not great at all. Pizza was  meh. Nothing special.  Service was outstanding though Kevin was on point!
