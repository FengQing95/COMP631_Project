Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our waiter took FOREVER to get us our order and took FOREVER to notice that our water glasses were empty. In fact, we had to talk loudly about needing more water and stared at him before he got it for us. The pizza came after another lady who came in LATER than us received her pizza. Maybe it was because it was an individual pizza, or MAYBE it was because our waiter was off doing whatever else he had to do.
