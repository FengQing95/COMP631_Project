Smoque BBQ////Visited with an out of town friend (from Chicago) who was lusting over their BBQ specifically and we were really surprised by their outdoor seating/COVID precautions. They have an outdoor kiosk where you order, then tables outside under a tent, and food and utensils are brought out to you, to minimize any moving around. I like the half chicken -- it's a big portion, despite what the other reviews say, and the sauces are great. Mac and cheese is also stellar. Don't listen to the people who are annoyed about having to be respectful of others DURING A PANDEMIC -- the outdoor seating and service was great. Highly recommend!
