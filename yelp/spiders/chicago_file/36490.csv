Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bottom line: Good place to eat, not mind-blowing by any means.  As long as  a $300 dinner for two isn't considered expensive to you then you'll enjoy this place for a casual dinner, or a romantic evening.  If you're looking for a place for a special occasion where $300 is on the high end of what you'd spend at a restaurant I'd recommend looking elsewhere.  Although, after only one visit,  I'd like to come back and try their seafood towers and hopefully get bread this time before I put a stamp on this one.
