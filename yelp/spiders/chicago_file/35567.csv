Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Before I go on to the truly fantastic food, I will echo the others and note how exceptionally bad the service is. Like, laughable. I couldn't tell if our server was stoned, or if he actually just didn't give a sh*t whether we enjoyed our meal. Isn't the job market really sucky right now? Can't they hire better people?
