Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had a girls night out this past Saturday and I really love this place, the atmosphere is awesome and not to mention their Sangria.  We had reservations at 6pm; however, our table wasn't available until about twenty minutes later.  We really didn't mind because we sat by the bar to enjoy a few drinks.  After we were seated our server was very apologetic about the delay and offered us free dessert!  - Their croquetas are do die for and we ordered the sea food paella which was also very good.  I will definitely be coming back to this place.
