Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had fairly high expectations for this place since I do love tapas. However, it did not fare up to my expectations. That said, it was by no means bad - it was just okay. We ordered the tapas sampler of some sort and it was decent. The other tapas dishes were mediocre and some unmemorable.
