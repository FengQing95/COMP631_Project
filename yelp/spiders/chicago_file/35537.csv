Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My friend and I came in on a weeknight without a reservation hoping to find bar seating, which we were very lucky to get. We got a lounge table just off the bar. We waited for 15-20 minutes and no one came to greet us. I eventually flagged down the manager (I think) and he took our order and basically continued to serve us the rest of the night as our real waiter was AWOL. The food was so disappointing I wanted to cry! For the amount of time it took to get it and how expensive it was, it was so not worth the hassle. I could have gotten better food at a chain restaurant. The steak frite was dry, tough and so flavorless it tasted like liver, it was so disgusting I could barely eat it even though I was starving. The lamb shank was also disturbingly flavorless and bland, I didn't know you could mess up lamb shank that badly. The fries were literally the best thing I ate that night. Sadly, I will not be coming back here again and I urge you to save your money and not believe all the hype.
