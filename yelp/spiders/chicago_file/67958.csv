Little Goat Diner////My dining companion had the shrimp, grits mixtre and said it was superb.  I had the sourdough pancakes and they were just spectacular - far exceeding my expectations.  I also got a scrambled egg and hash browns on the side just to see how they were and I was very pleased with both of them.  Their hash browns are unique and tasty.
