Little Goat Diner////The mister went with the parathas burrito and I ordered the corned beef hash with egg & a side of grits. The burrito was like a breakfast burrito but had more veggies and fresh ingredients than what you could expect from McDonalds or any fast food joint. The arugula on top really won me over. Mine was divine too. I'm a big fan of corned beef and hash and although their interpretation wasn't really anything new, it was lucious and melt in your mouth delicious. The grits were the best I've found outside of the South. They were very cheesy which made them even better.
