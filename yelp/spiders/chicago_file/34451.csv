Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I love a good, well made drink and my drink of choice is a Sidecar.  I came for dinner and had a fabulous time at the bar/lounge downstairs.  The setting is very intimate and cute with leather couches and lots of booths.  The bar is staffed by mixologists, well skilled at making great drinks.
