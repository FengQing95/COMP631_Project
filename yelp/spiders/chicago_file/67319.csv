Little Goat Diner////I would not recommend this place. The service was awful and the food was bad. The bus buys were the hardest working people in the place, while the wait staff stood around at the hostess table and talked the whole time. Our waitress barely came by to check in on us.  When our drinks were empty we put them at the end of the booth, and it still took the waitress who was 5 feet away talking to the other staff  20 minutes to provide refills.
