Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our waiter was arrogant and rude.  He was critical of our food choices and ignored the table.  Another individual actually served the food which unfortunately did not come out all together.  There were 3 entrees served and not a single comment about where the 4th entree was or when it would arrive.
