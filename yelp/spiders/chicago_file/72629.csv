Little Goat Diner////Their shrimp and "grumpy" goat grits is a must order. I do love me some grits, and that dish is solid every time. And the pork belly pancake which is a scallion pancake served with yes, PORK BELLY, with some hoisin and bok choy and some ginger dressing, this thing was a perfect late night breakfast like snack for me. Perfect. Not the largest portion in the world, would be my only "pork" with it (get it? not beef? ha ha)
