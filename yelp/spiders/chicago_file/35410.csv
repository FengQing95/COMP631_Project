Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My 2015 New Year's resolution is to try a new, different eatery every weekend. Boy did I start off on the right foot! Went here 01/02 for my boyfriend's birthday and we were not the least bit dissapointed. We opted away from the steaks because we had a long night ahead of us and didn't want to feel too full. He ordered the burger and I the prime beef sandwich. Both were perfect! The best burger in a loooong time!. And the tenderness of the prime rib was to die for!
