Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Once bitten into, the pizza layers looks like one of those sedimentary rock formation diagrams where each layer is completely separate from each other.  What you have is a sausage layer that comes off from the cheese layer that could be easily peeled off the crust layer.  No integration at all!  Maybe I was over hyping the place in my mind, but I was a bit disappointed with the pizza here.
