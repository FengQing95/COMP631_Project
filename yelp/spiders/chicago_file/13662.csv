Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'll tell you point blank, Malnati's is not my favorite chicago style deep dish pizza joint. That having been said, their sauce is pretty stellar! My only complaint would be that for "deep dish pizza," it 1.) isn't very deep and 2.) is not particularly dense. It is authentic, but authentic chicago deep dish pizza is apparently not my favorite deep dish pizza. Do go, you'll enjoy it. A lot of the restaurants are situated in converted houses. Service is quick, you don't wait a million years for your pie, and you can buy small frozen pizzas on your way out.
