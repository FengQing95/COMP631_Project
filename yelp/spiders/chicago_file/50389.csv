Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Super busy Friday, but was able to sit in the bar area. The service was great and the food was excellent. The bartender made excellent sangria. The only complaint is the bread was very cold. I assume because we were in the bar area, but it would have been nice to have warm bread. That's all....
