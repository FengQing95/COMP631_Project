Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here a few months ago after a friend's work event. The tapas were delicious and the sangria was great. I don't know about the prices as my friend's boss picked up the tab, but he seemed ok with it. we were a little sauced and jib-jabby, so we were slow to leave the staff didn't kick us out at closing .
