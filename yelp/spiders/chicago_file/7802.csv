Art Institute of Chicago////The stately entrance, guarded by proud and imposing stone lions, is your first glimpse of the glories that await you inside this astonishing monument to art.  Take your time and peruse the various collections. My favorite part of the institute is the impressive collection of impressionists and post impressionists.  And while the newly added modern wing may not be everyone's cup of tea, it is still worth checking out, even if only to serve as a comparison to some of the earlier works on display.  And, of course, don't forget to stop and see some of the more famous works that call Chicago home, including, but certainly not limited to, Grant Wood's "American Gothic", Edward Hopper's "Nighthawks", and Georges Seurat's "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte".
