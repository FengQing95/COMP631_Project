Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place always has a long line stretching all the way outside their front door so I just get take out. I love their "The Lou" pizza, never get sick of it. It's a must-eat for all my out-of -town visitors. Many people like their sausage deep-dish, tried it once, just too much meat for my taste.
