Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The skillets seemed to be a popular dish among other customers so I decided to give them a try. I ordered the "butcher block" skillet and it was amazing and full of flavor. The skillets come with pancakes but you can substitute French toast or crepes for a small up charge. Although the wait was pretty long, the shopping on nearby State Street made it go by pretty fast. Â The App and text message wait list keep you up to date on your place in line. Once seated, the service is fast. With that being said, it was well worth the wait. Great place and a must try!
