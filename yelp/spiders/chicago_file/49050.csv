Smoque BBQ////Ok I do know how this place gets such great reviews.  I've been in the food business my whole life and this place skimps on quality all the way.  One thing I learned after 30 years in the food business, if you put food in a nice package and market correctly people will convince themselves that a pile of crap tastes like sugar, I'm not saying Smoque is a pile of crap it's just decent mediocre food that obviously fooled a lot of people.  The BBQ sauce and seasonings are above average but it needs to be in order to cover up the taste of the meats they use.
