Little Goat Diner////After this mishap, the rest of the experience went very well.  The ambiance is unique, urban-hip restaurant blend of a  mom and pop diner offering unique twists on classic diner meals with Mexican, Asian, etc. flares.    After reading many great reviews exclaiming wonderful nachos, that I wanted to try them out myself.   They were definitely not traditional nachos, but they were tasty.   Very little meat (maybe 2 oz) on the dish I was served and it was hidden at the bottom of the plate.  I can not say I will order them again, but I definitely want to come back to try some of the other dishes on the  menu and those I say other customers ordered.
