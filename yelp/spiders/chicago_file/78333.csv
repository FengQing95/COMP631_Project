Little Goat Diner////Salty is the best way to describe the food here. We had the This Little Piggy Went to China, Okonmiyaki, Pork Belly Fries, and Pork Belly Pancake. The Little Piggy Went to China was the saltiest of the group. The Pork Belly fries were good. The Pork Belly Pancake (scallion pancake with a slab of pork belly and coleslaw on top) was good and less salty although it wasn't the best scallion pancake that I've ever had.
