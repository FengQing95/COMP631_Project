Art Institute of Chicago////The European 18th and 19th century art section was overwhelming. Famous artists from Manet, Monet, Renoir, and Pisaro's arts are found here. Van Gogh's "The Bedroom" is the centerpiece of one of the rooms and George Seurat's "Sunday at the Park" was probably the most photographed piece by what I saw this afternoon. You know this painting, it's the one where Cameron Frye just spaces out and just gets lost in the painting in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
