Smoque BBQ////I thought Smoque was decent and I think it is a welcome addition to the North side for BBQ. Keep in mind that this is just my opinion. I would never bash a restaurant because I think that we all have different taste buds. I had a place in North Chicago/Waukegan area called Big Ed's and let me tell you that I loved Big Ed's better than Smoque but I am sure that there are people who would go to Big Ed's and say that it was just ok and they like Smoque better.
