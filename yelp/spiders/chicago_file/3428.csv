The Purple Pig////The interior would be very quaint and welcoming if it was quiet, but you're immediately hit with a wave of life and energy. It's the sort of place you find when traveling where you think, "Aha--I've found the heart of the city." I recommend that you grab a glass of wine while you wait (or hunt for a counter seat) and soak it in.
