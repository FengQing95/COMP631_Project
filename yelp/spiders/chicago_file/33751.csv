Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Enjoyed our dinner.  One of the corporate managers was there that night and greeted us.  Was my BF's birthday and it was very nice that they made mention of it.  Food was great as was service until two large groups near us sucked some of the life out of the room but management can't be blamed for that.
