Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Onto the food. The waiter seemed lacking in confidence about the menu and what to recommend. But he poured way too much wine into the glass. Tsk tsk.... That's a no no especially with the type of glasses that were used. I had to tell him to stop at a certain point. Swirling is not for show aesthetics or being snobbish. It's to help identify the different aromas of the wine and also a way of aerating it to open it up. Anyways that's always a pet peeve of mine. More waiters must be educated on wine etiquette.
