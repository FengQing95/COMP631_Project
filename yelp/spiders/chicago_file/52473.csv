Smoque BBQ////For starters, the first time I saw Smoque, it was on the Hungry Hound. Not long after, I saw the Guy Fieri appearance on "Diners" and decided to check it out. Now I understand a thing or two about BBQ. I heard about the journey the owner's took that eventually ended up as Smoque. The when I saw that they served beef brisket, my first thought was these guys have a death wish. I can tell you first hand (as many others could as well) is that brisket is VERY difficult to do properly. There isn't much margin for error, especially when working with a Packer's cut brisket (both flat and point cuts together). I've seen so many people and places try to do it and fail terribly (under/over spiced, poor blend of seasonings & overcooked being most common).
