Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I got the  Champagne Smash to drink, and it was perfectly light and refreshing. To eat, we started off with the Bone Marrow since we always get it at Au Cheval, and it was incredible.  The sweetness of the jam complements the saltiness of bone marrow perfectly. For my meal, I ordered the petite duchess cut filet and it was cooked to perfection.
