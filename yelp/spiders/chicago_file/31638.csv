Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had a great late lunch today at Lou Malnati's! The staff was friendly and welcoming. We felt totally safe being there and everything was socially distanced. The food was so good! We got the wings appetizer and the Malnati salad to start with. Both were really good with excellent flavors. We then had the Malnati's original deep dish pizza which was really good as well! Definitely recommend this spot! I just wish their Michigan Ave location had been open.
