Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Met up at Lou's with a few friends for pizza Sunday night and overall we enjoyed our experience! For our group of 5, we were initially told 45 minutes for the wait but were actually seated in just a few minutes which was a pleasant surprise. Even if you do have a long wait, you can place your order so your pizza can begin to cook. (They take at least 30 minutes) We enjoyed a large deep dish with sausage and mushroom which was delicious. For dessert we shared a warm chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. The only complaint we had was that the service was a bit slow. We had a hard time finding our waitress for napkins, drinks, knives, etc. She was, however, very nice to our group so perhaps her absence was due to the restaurant being short handed.
