Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There sure is a lot of choice when it comes to deep dish pizza in Chicago.  Do yourself a favor and go to Lou Malnati's!  The original pie with sausage is awesome; the crust is not too overwhelming, cheese, and tomato sauce are all spot on.  One word of advice - come hungry!
