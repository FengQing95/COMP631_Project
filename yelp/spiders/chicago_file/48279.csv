Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service is always quick and the food is always hot. The only downside is the seating. It's a bit crowded at times, but you can still sit and enjoy your food. However, I would enjoy eating if there wasn't so many tables & chairs seated next to each other. It sometimes gets difficult to manuever through when you're heading to the restroom or leaving.
