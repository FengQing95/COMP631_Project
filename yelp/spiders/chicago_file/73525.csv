Little Goat Diner////Been coming here for quite some time now, but I wanted to write a review on the exceptional service I received today! Came here for brunch and sat outside in the beautiful weather. We were seated immediately by such a kind hostess. Our waitress was very upbeat and nice and was on top of everything. The food was delicious as per usual. At the end of our meal, my sister scraped away at a part of her burrito. Nestled in it was a huge moth. We figured it fell from the trees above and scraped it out of her food. Immediately the bus boy tending to the tables outside noticed everything and came over to ask if everything was okay with her food. He quickly apologized and took the plate with the bug away. The manager also came out and apologized and offered to remake the burrito, on them. We told him we understood we were sitting outside so it was no worries. He offered to give my sister another iced coffee on the house. Right before we left, he gave us a cookie for my niece and nephew as well. The service is exceptional! We weren't going to say anything, but it was so nice to have them swoop into action and take responsibility even though the bug probably fell in from the trees. The entire team here works well together, and every employee knows how to go above and beyond for the customer! Give that bus boy a raise; he was on top of every single detail the entirety of our time here.
