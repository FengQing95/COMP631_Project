Little Goat Diner////For those of you who've dined here, you know that the above list is more than a lot of food to go around prior to actually getting to the meal. Yes, I was more than stuffed and aching in delight by the time I got around to my Sammiches, so they came home with me. I did a plate share with one of my co-workers. We shared the Reuben with smoked corned beef and the Los Drowned with braised beef. Wow wow wow! I'm glad I had a couple bites of each before I packed 'em up to-go. The Reuben was salty/smokey in flavor and piled high with ingredients and the Los Drowned with a side of au jus was loaded with this pieces of beef. I remember looking across the table at another coworker, and she had the look of pain on her face as she looked down at her chicken with waffle meal (wonderful pain that is). We were just SO STUFFED!
