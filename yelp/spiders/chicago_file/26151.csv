Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered The Lou - since vegetarian. Based on the description of spinach, mushroom and mozzarella, I expected this to be more like a creamy alfredo or blanca pizza. It wasn't at all what I expected. The buttercrust I thought would be airy and light.. it was crisp and crunchy. There wasn't very much sauce on the pizza (good because it wasn't soggy by the time I got back to the office, bad because I didn't taste too much pizza sauce). The cheese was mostly cheddar. I didn't taste any garlic.. Honestly this pizza reminded me of when I was in grade school and use to take english muffins with canned tomato sauce and cheddar cheese and pop them in the toaster oven for a bit... tasted about like that... It was okay.. but I definitely don't think it is 5 star pizza. And I really don't think my personalized size pizza was justified for the $10 price tag on it. It was just so-so.
