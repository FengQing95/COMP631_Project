Smoque BBQ////a word on the service: it was really busy and since you order, get a number and wait for it to get called to go up to the counter to get your food, it had the potential to get really crazy and disorganized. But the few fellas that were helping guide traffic not only did a good job, but they were really friendly and genuinely wanted to make ur dining experience better. one of the guys got a bottle opener for our beers and opened the bottles himself... even though we would have done it ourselves.
