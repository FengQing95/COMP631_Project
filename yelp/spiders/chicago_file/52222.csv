Smoque BBQ////This is easily the best BBQ that I've ever had.  The St. Louis style ribs here will spoil any enjoyment that you ever would have eating ribs elsewhere.  The cole slaw, peach cobbler, and baked bean sides were all perfect.  The mac and cheese side could be improved upon, it ends up having too many of the crumbs from the top on it for my liking.  I'm going to start bringing out of towners here to show off how amazing our BBQ is.
