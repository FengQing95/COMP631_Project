The Purple Pig////3) I inquired about a few menu items then ordered the recommended seasonal octopus and the butternut squash soup along with a lovely glass of Italian Barbera which was absolutely wonderful but had a meager sized pour. The soup was very tasty and had some crunch to it from an actual toasted butternut garnish making it unique. I asked for salt and pepper but it never came. The portion size was enough to get the tastebuds teased but not enough to call a meal. When the soup was cleared, the octopus was served. I was asked by an entirely different bartender if I wanted another glass of wine and when I commented that my first pour wasn't even a full glass, he chuckled and walked away! Wow... is it common to insult the patrons here?
