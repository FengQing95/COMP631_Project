Smoque BBQ////I've been to Dinosaur BBQ, waited in the insanely stupid line at Green Street, Nick's Pit Stop is decent, Pork Shoppe is forgettable and while I'm a big fan of Smoke Daddy (rib tips..mmmmmmm), I would say the best place for BBQ in Chicago is Smoque. Sure it has its share of lines and no one really LOVES communal seating but when you get food from Smoque, no matter what item on the menu you order, you know its going to be perfect and delicious every time. I've tried their ribs and sandwiches and I would urge you to order the 1/2 and 1/2 (that's pulled 1/2 pork and 1/2 brisket sandwich). They also make some of the best mac n cheese for a BBQ place. If you have family coming in from out of town or you're looking to stop in Chicago on a trip and have a BBQ urge than definitely hit up Smoque.
