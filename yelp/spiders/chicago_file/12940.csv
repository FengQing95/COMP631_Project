Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I went to this place because it is mentioned in a Chinese travel guide book, which is translated from a Japanese guide book. I've never had New York Style Pizza before so the crust is kinda too hard for me. But over all I like it very much. The juiciness by the topings and the the tenderness by the crust are harmonized by the cheese, which created a kind of unique taste. The service is very professional and kind, which is a huge plus. Strongly recommended.
