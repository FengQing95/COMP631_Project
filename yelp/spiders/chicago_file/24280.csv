Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The manager seemed like he knew that there was a ticket time issue, but didn't know we still hadn't gotten our food. He tried to make it right (the only way he knew how) by offering us a drink at the bar. What we wanted was our almost 2 hours of life back so we could enjoy it somewhere else. We understand that issues happen, but as a manager you don't have your staff rectify situations, you handle them yourself.
