Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The not so good-now I will say, we arrived on a Saturday around 5:30, so there was a wait, we were told 35 mins- not terrible-especially considering the nice weather, it's a weekend in downtown Chicago and the NFL draft was in town. So being our first visit it gave a chance to look over the menu, and because deep dish takes quite a while to bake, they tell you to preorder your pizza with the cashier so it'll be ready close to when your seated. We did end up actually waiting about 45 mins- and with how packed it was we waited outside- not terrible as the weather was great-but we constantly felt in the way of pedestrians and other patrons waiting. Now when we got our call saying they had a table ready we had to go back inside and wait behind people who were waiting to get on the list- it's was very unorganized to say the least. Seating was very tight quarters and the noise level is astronomical, I couldn't even hear our server. Service was chaotic, took a long time to get refills and napkins. She was very nice though, and I don't hold her completely responsible, as it was super busy. Parking- the proximity of where we parked to the restaurant was not at all bad-it was the cost. $18.00 for 2 hours! Parking in downtown Chicago is a pain and crazy expensive, however this is not the restaurants fault.
