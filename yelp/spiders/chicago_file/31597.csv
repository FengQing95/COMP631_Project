Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When I lived in Chicago, Lou Malnati's was one of my go-tos for deep dish pizza. I didn't order it often but a few times a year I went all in and got a cheesy pie to indulge in. So, when my husband and I were in town this past weekend and we decided to do dinner in our hotel room I suggested Lou's. A great call!
