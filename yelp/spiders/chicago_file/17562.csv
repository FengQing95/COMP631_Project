Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My only complaints were 1. I hit my head pretty hard on a brick overhang, although this wasn't really the restaurants problem- just my own clumsiness and 2. The A/C and heat were changing back and forth. This is in the middle of February when its freezing out and I want to be warm. I ended up putting on and taking off my coat about a dozen times in the hour and a half at the restaurant as i was getting too hot then too cold then whole time. Â
