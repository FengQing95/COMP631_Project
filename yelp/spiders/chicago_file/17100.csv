Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I waited 45 mins for them to prepare my pie. I've never had deep dish pizza before so it definitely took me by surprise (ie I was not expecting the cheese to be layered first).  Definitely was an amazing first experience.  I love cheese and there can never be too much.  The sauce was very fresh and more rustic than your typical pizza marinara sauce.  The sausage was top-notch.  All in all, great pizza.  Would I go again? Yes.  5-stars? Not quite there.
