Art Institute of Chicago////This was one of my few touristy spots the last time I was in Chicago.  We went on Thursday, when Illinois residents got in for free from 5-.  I bought my full price ticket , which was only $23, and coat checked our coats ($3),  while my boyfriend waited in line.   He told me I could of probably snagged a free ticket since all they did was ask for a zip code.  Oh well, my money when to a great institute.
