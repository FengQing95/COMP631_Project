Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wow! Yes, wow! We ate here on May 26, 2014. This restaurant, across from Millennium Park, is THE breakfast spot in Chicago. You can wait up to an hour to get a table -- just build that into your plans -- but the wait is well worth it. This has the most extensive breakfast menu (they also serve lunch) I've ever seen. It is renowned for its pancakes, loaded with berries of your choice. The egg-based breakfasts are excellent, and the portions are generous. The crepes were fantastic. The service was HIGHLY attentive -- better that some fancy dinner establishments. Our waiter was Jesus D., and he ROCKED! All the staff hustle, but you never feel rushed. We WILL be back. Highly recommended. Enjoy!
