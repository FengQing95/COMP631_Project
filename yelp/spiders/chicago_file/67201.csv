Little Goat Diner////The pork belly sandwich is excellent! Very generous portions, very filling, and very very tasty. Goat chili cheese fries is very good too, though you'll probably want to use a fork for those, as they can get pretty messy. Fish tostados is so-so. Make sure you come here on a weeknight, and hopefully before 6pm, otherwise the wait can get pretty long, since they don't take reservations. I'm definitely coming back at some point!
