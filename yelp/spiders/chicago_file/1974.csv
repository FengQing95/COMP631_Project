Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I had the Denver skillet with Multi-grain fig and walnut pancakes on the side.  It was delicious.  Clearly they use top ingredients.  The hasbrowns tasted like actual potato.  The ham was yummy.  The portions are way too big.  My side of pancakes came with two pancakes.  The skillet was enough for a family of four.
