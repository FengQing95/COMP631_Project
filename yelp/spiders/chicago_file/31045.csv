Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Last time I wrote my Lou's review, I was number 3,499! Over 5,800 reviews now. It's 3 o'clock and there's a 45 minute wait. There's no one better than Lou's. Â I was able to snag a seat at the bar after 15 minutes. I was smart enough to order my pizza as soon as I came in! Same bartender - David- he is golden- Sunny chi-Town day & my Cubbies are winning too!
