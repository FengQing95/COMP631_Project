The Purple Pig////First time being here at Purple Pig and it was quite the impression, they have a wonderful atmosphere, their place is so huge, clean, nice and bright. From outside to inside is so nice, well-decorated, organized, and it has aesthetic vibes. Their customer service was so amazing, they have so great and caring staff, they will greet you once you enter their restaurant, and even guide and escort you to the vacant spot. Everything there was so perfect. You have to try their pork belly, it is so soft, and it can literally melt in your mouth. Plus, they are creative regarding to how they plate and serve the food, all the food they have on the menu is extremely delicious. I would eat again at this restaurant whenever I go back and visit Chicago. Will definitely continue to explore their menu. Thank you Purple Pig for such an amazing experience. You are the best!
