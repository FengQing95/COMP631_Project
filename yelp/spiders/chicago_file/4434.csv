The Purple Pig////This was the one that brought me to tears.  Diced beets were plated with a miraculously airy goat cheese and a very unique, VERY good smear fashioned from pistachios.  Imagine the greatest, smoothest peanut butter ever made, now add in a touch of honey for sweetener and you'll get an idea of what this was like. MARVELOUS.
