Little Goat Diner////Service was super friendly as I have to come to expect from these restaurants. We ordered the Goat Chili Cheese Fries to start. They were sooo good- in fact I ate way too many of them before my main meal. I then ordered the Grilled Cheese and my hubs had the Okonomiyaki we think (more on that later).
