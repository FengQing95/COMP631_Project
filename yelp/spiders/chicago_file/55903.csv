Smoque BBQ////A small place that gets very busy, so best to go off hours or you will be in a line out the door.  A great variety of ribs, baby back, St. Louis, of course brisket too.  This food is smoked well and their dry rub is the best I've eaten.  Meat is moist, tender and not over cooked with a perfect balance of spice.  I try other places because Smoque is far from me and I'm always disappointed (most of the time) and wishing I had done the drive to Smoque.  Once you try it, you will be back.
