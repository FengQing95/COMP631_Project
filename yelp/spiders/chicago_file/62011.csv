Smoque BBQ////7. Some people have complained about parking, and it's true that at peak times you may have to search on one of the residential blocks to park, but honestly, all of Lincoln Park, Lakeview and many other neighborhoods in Chicago have FAR worse parking situations. I can only assume those complaining about parking here are coming from the suburbs (Smoque is right off the I-90/94 Irving Park exit and a lot of suburbanites stop by on the way to Cubs games). If you actually live in the city, you'll probably think the parking is easy, not to mention completely free--not a parking meter in sight.
