Smoque BBQ////Food:I ordered the chopped brisket sandwich with sides of the slaw and beans, plus an order of the cornbread. My husband ordered the sliced brisket platter with slaw and French fries. Everything was fine, but after hearing so many great things about it we both kind of shrugged like "thats it? this is what everyone has been talking about". I live within walking distance to this place and haven't bothered going back :(
