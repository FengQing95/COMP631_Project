Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Hands down my new favorite spot in Chicago. I live in the area and could not wait to try this place out. The overall ambiance and atmosphere is really comfortable and warm. Â The first time here I sat and ate at the bar with a couple of buddies. The best part of our experience was not even the outstanding food/drinks- it was our bartender Zach. What a pleasure- he whipped up some wildly good drinks and essentially hand picked our meals based on our conversation. Top notch drinks, great food and unmatched service. I have been back several times and will continue to dine here regularly.
