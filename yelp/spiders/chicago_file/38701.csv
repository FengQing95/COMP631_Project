Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We came here on Labor Day weekend Sunday. The atmosphere is very old fashioned and reminiscent of a classic 1930's era steakhouse. The decor is very eclectic, the lighting is very dim and provides a very intimate and romantic setting for your meal. There is no dress code that I am aware of and the lighting is so dim that it's hard to tell what anyone is wearing. Jeans seem to be acceptable as long as a more formal or business casual shirt is worn. I think I would have felt a little self conscious in a t-shirt or similar. It's laid back but I wouldn't go overboard.
