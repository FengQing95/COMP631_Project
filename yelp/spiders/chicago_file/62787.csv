Smoque BBQ////The Cole slaw too was actually really good, and if I didn't get it with the platter I would have ordered it on the side; It wasn't mayo-based but vinegar based so it tasted a little lighter than some other slaws, and added some freshness that provided a good balance with the smokey meats. As far as their sauces go, they provide two, a vinegar based Carolina sauce and a thicker Memphis Sauce. The sauces are good...but in all honestly didn't seem to distinguish themselves all too much from other bbq sauces I've had.
