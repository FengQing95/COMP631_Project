Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is a Chicago institution and I can see why. We were quoted an hour wait when we arrived at 7:30 p.m. on a Thursday, but they took my cell number and texted me a link to check where we stood in line. Everything was very organized, including the waiter telling us exactly how long it would take to get our wine, salad and pizza. And the spinach salad and Malnati Classic pizza were both delicious. I'll go here every time I'm in Chicago. They have food and customer service down to a science.
