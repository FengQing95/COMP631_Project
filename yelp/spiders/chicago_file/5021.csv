The Purple Pig////We ordered hummus, grilled broccoli, deviled egg, roasted cauliflower, seafood Saganaki and braised pork shoulder. They were all good but we preferred the veggies dishes which were all quite unique over the seafood and the pork. The seafood Saganaki was similar to bouillabaisse or cioppino in a tomato based sauce with Saganaki cheese cubes, not too special. The braised pork was a little dry.
