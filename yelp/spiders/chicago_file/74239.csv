Little Goat Diner////That dish was the Bull's Eye French Toast. Delicious onion brioche bread with a baked egg in the middle, topped with barbecue maple syrup, strawberries...and the best part: fried chicken! It was a lot of savory and sweet in one plate which is ultimately my ideal plate. Also, I'm not usually a big French toast person but this dish won me over.
