The Purple Pig////What a fantastic last dinner during our latest trip to Chicago! From the artistic plating to big bold flavors, all with special attention to vegetarian inclusion, you nailed it Purple Pig. The three of us vegetarians at the table ordered 5 dishes to share and found that to be the perfect volume (could have potentially added a 6th if ravenous). The whipped feta was a perfect balance of salty creaminess with accents of diced cucumber and juicy tomatoes. The whipped chickpea and focaccia smear was a standout--the focaccia more brioche style, acting as a perfect vehicle for the rich purée with pops of well-paired rosemary. The burrata (sans prosciutto) is a show-stopper with the crispy wheel floating above pillowy burrata elevated by sweet roasted butternut and peppery arugula. The salt-roasted beets are a must order, with this preparation exquisitely highlighting the deep beet flavor, enriched by the goat cheese and pistachio accents. And closing out the meal, the agnolotti. Perfectly cooked al dente packets bursting with creamy ricotta and tangy balsamic, with a nice brown butter glaze. Will be dreaming about this meal for some time!  Can't wait for our next visit.
