Little Goat Diner////I've been planning for this day several weeks in advance. We were looking for a brunch place and had other plans for dinner (hence no reservation at the Girl and the Goat). We found the Little Goat Diner on open table and based on the reviews of yelpers and friends, we decided to give this place a try. You walk in and say. Ok, it's a diner. waffles, pancakes, some sandwiches sure. Standard fare. But really, this diner is anything but standard. If you're coming the day of without a reservation forget it. Every person I told that we were going to this diner were raging about it. They talked about their amazing experiences so we were definitely excited to give it a try.
