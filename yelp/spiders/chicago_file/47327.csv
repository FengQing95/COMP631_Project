Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If I were only reviewing the food, however, I'd give the restaurant 4 stars. We ordered the Baked goat cheese (#32), Bacon wrapped dates (#67), and Paella Valenciana. I usually order these three dishes at every tapas place I visit, and Cafe-Ba-Ba-Reeba measured up to the others. Though everything was pretty good, I definitely prefer the bacon-wrapped dates at Tapas Barcelona or Avec.
