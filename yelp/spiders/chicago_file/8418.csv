Art Institute of Chicago////American Gothic is good for sure.  Ah American Gothic.  An old farmer and his spinster daughter. How wonderful!  Living off the land and sad.  Apparently, Grant Wood won the bronze prize and $300 in a contest at the Art Institute for this painting.  When the painting became more famous, Iowans protested because they felt mocked. They considered it a caricature and a disrespectful of their lifestyle.  Ha! Suck it Iowans.  People still think you're losers.
