The Purple Pig////The service was not amazing. After being seated and we ordered and I had to make a couple adjustments due to some allergies I have. One of the meals came out wrong and the waiter gave me an awful attitude after I nicely mentioned I needed a new without nuts which made me feel bad about having ordered it at all. The chicken thigh kebabs were incredible!!! That was my favorite part and the smashed potatoes that came with it were delicious. We ordered the beets which were a bit too sweet and the broccoli was VERYYY oily. I don't think anything was amazing about this place. I don't think I would come back based on the overall experience.
