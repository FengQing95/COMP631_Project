Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas for brunch is a great breakaway from the traditional, and it's a very fun and group-friendly choice! I've only been for brunch and the wait isn't bad. On a Saturday, it meant around 45 minutes, and that's plenty of time to get a head start on their sangrias on tap. Brunch comes with its own tapas menu, though you can order from the standard menu. Prices are reasonable for the tapas size and quantity. Flavors are fantastic and varied. There were only a few items I wouldn't get again, like the baby shrimps and grits.
