Little Goat Diner////It pains me to update this review negatively but Little Goat has definitely gone downhill. I really used to love this place but my last visit in particular was very disappointing. Firstly, service was lousy. When your waitress apologizes to you numerous times for not doing a good job, you know there's a problem. Secondly, it was way too loud. It's a restaurant, not a club! I want to have a conversation over a meal, not dance on the table. Thirdly, food wasn't great. We tried a bunch of new things this time and didn't love any of them. The chili in particular was so spicy it was inedible.
