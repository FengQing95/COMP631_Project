Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Honestly, I had to take a look at the menu online just to remember what I tried here, and it was just two nights ago. The only thing I do remember off the top of my head was that I ordered a hot tomato soup, which was a special and came with little slices of toasted bread with cheese on them. I liked the bread, but the soup basically tasted like the Trader Joe's soup I buy, but it was slightly thicker. I like Trader Joe's soup and all, but I can make it in my microwave at home.
