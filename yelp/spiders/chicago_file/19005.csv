Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We showed up at 11:45 am on a Thursday and luckily found seating. But, it does get very packed and very loud.  The TVs are tuned to ESPN and a standard mix of modem and contemporary pop is blaring from the speakers.  As for ambience--very casual w framed sports jerseys decorating the walls.
