Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First deep dish pizza we tried in Chicago as recommended by many of my Chicago friends here in Vegas.  You can take the brown line to get here.  Wait was about an hour or so, but they will take your order prior to getting a table since the pizzas take about 30-40 minutes to cook anyway.  We split a large 16in i think it was, just the classic cheese, sausage, sauce. Also split the house salad w/ the creamy lemon garlic dressing which I could have easily drank through a straw! It was THAT good!  Had one slice of pizza, floated to heaven, and by the time I took my last bite, I was stuffed.  It's fabulous! Wait staff was friendly and helpful in ordering as well.
