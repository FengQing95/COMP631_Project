Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////By far one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Â Delicious food, Great friendly staff who allow their guests to experience a meal without being to pushy for the next tapas round order. We love coming here and Cafe B truly has a special place in our hearts, in fact we got engaged here!
