Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ah, valet the truck...........and take the walk up the ramp into heaven!  I love Cafe Ba Ba Reeba!  Came here again last night........had 8pm reservations and the bar area was packed!  Finally they called my name on the speaker..........and off to our table we went.  First thing to start off the festivities was some Passion Fruit Sangria.  A nice big pitcher!   Very good.  Mopped up some oil with bread and ordered several tap pas.  Spicy Meatballs, Spicy Potatoes....salad......shrimp, steak......they just kept bringing them out!
