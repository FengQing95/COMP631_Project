Art Institute of Chicago////If you come from Europe, and have seen a few museums (e.g. Louvre, British, Musee d'Orsay for impressionists, etc.) you will probably be disappointed at this museum (given the hype on this museum in all tourist attraction guides). They have some very nice pieces of art, but definitely much smaller collections. This said, if you have not been to any of the above-mentioned museums (or the Met in New York), it is definitely a must see and very worth it.
