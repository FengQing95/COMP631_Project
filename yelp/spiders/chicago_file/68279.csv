Little Goat Diner////It took our server 10 minutes to even acknowledge and greet our table of 3, only thing that kept us there was the nice weather seeing that we were sitting on the patio. Half an hour later and were still waiting for our DRAFT beer! Lol I'm a server myself and there's absolutely no excuse for either or. The food was great but didn't make up for the lack of service. Â I'm definitely not interested in going back, the service was horrible!!
