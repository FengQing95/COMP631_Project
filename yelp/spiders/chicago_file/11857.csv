Art Institute of Chicago////Easily one of the best art museums I've been to in my lifetime. If you're an art history buff or have even taken some art history classes in the past, you will definitely appreciate this one. The highlight of the museum for me was for sure their stacked Impressionism collection featuring plenty of pieces from van Gogh, Renoir, Monet, Cezanne, Seurat, and many other well known artists of the era. The modern wing was pretty cool to see and had some pieces from Picasso and Warhol as well. I've taken my family here when they visited Chicago and they were just as impressed with the extensive collection.
