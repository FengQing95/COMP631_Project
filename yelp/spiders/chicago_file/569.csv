Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Stop the presses, this is it!  If you are looking for the perfect breakfast in Chicago, where  serving sizes are a plus, and prices are slim. Heck, I think I gained 5 pounds just reading the menu. Nevertheless, I pulled back my fork and dove into the best omelette I have eaten in a long while, the Fresca. My girlfriend enjoyed the Berry Bliss Pancakes, while we didn't finish everything it wasn't because we didn't try. The food is INCREDIBLE, trust me you will not want to have breakfast anywhere else after one dining experience.
