Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Many of my friends had such high praise for Bavette's so I was really looking forward to eating here. The first thing I noticed about the restaurant was that it was extremely dark inside. I'm all for mood lighting, but it was so dark that reading the menu was a bit of a struggle as I used the tiny tabletop candle to guide me in my search. I ordered the Baked Crab Cake ($21!!!) and Spiced Fried Chicken (on my friend's recommendation). I am a huge fan of crab cake so I definitely had to order that here. The crab cake was excellent--it was stuffed with real crab and had a nice, chunky texture with each bite. Each order only came with one crab cake unfortunately. As much as I love crab cake, even I couldn't really justify the price tag...The fried chicken was extremely crispy, but it was also a tad too salty for my taste. The entire dish was extremely heavy so be warned that this may not be the dish to order if you are looking to eat something more delicate. For dessert, my friends and I split an order of the Chocolate Cream Pie. The pie was so incredibly rich that it was just...too much.
