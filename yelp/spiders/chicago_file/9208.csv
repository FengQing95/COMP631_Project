Art Institute of Chicago////The Impressionist gallery is truly amazing as you see many of the famous art work.  I didn't get to make to the different floors of the main exhibit (American art etc) so that was disappointing since there's a few famous art works there as well, but there is just too much to see.  I wasn't that big of a fan of the Asian exhibit or the modern exhibits but the modern art wing is a beautiful space.  It is spacious, with plenty of day lighting during the day so it's bright.  I probably sat on a bench at the modern wing for about 15 minutes just to relax.
