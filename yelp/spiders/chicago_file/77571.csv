Little Goat Diner////Food - Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and if it's your favorite it can be ordered all day!  We started with the nachos - but we had no idea what we were getting into.  We received a huge platter of homemade chips topped with pulled pork, beans, cheese, avocado, and plenty of other healthy toppings.  If you order this, make sure you have at least 4 people in your family to share.  But I was here for breakfast, so of course I order the Bullseye French Toast.  This French toast dish comes topped with fried chicken, egg, and of course BBQ Maple Syrup.  Sweet/Salty/Soft/Crunchy/Yes/Delicious.  And since we're eating at a diner, of course we order the Betterfinger sundae.  All you need to know is it comes with chocolate covered cheez-its.  Bottom line, not only did Little Goat's food surprise me, but the menu & dishes were whimsical and delicious.  2 Stars.
