Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is, hands down, the best pizza I've had in my life! I've never really had legitimate Chicago deep dish, so when we decided to head there for St. Paddy's Day, I made this a requirement! After being referred there by more than a few friends, we decided to give Lou Malnati's a shot!
