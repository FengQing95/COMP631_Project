Smoque BBQ////When we got our food (it took about 15 minutes) the portions were gigantic! (An amazingly large portion for the price) and living up to the restaurants reputation the BBQ is great! I got the brisket that was perfectly smoked, the sauce added the right amount of flavor, and the sides (especially the mac and cheese) were equally tasty. I consider myself somewhat of a cole slaw expert and the slaw at Smoque was some of the best I have had in a while, it was vinegar based, tangy and really flavorful (if you order the platter it is included so you can get two additional sides!).
