Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN CHICAGO. Recently moved to LA and had to write a review since I miss Babareeba so much. The melon jamon dish that they serve in the summer is the best thing I've ever had. However, you can't go wrong here it will all be delicious! Make a reservation if you plan on eating in peak hours or you'll be waiting a while (it's worth it though :))
