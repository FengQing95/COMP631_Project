Little Goat Diner////I'm really wishing there was a 3.5 star rating. I am a huge brunch fan, but this was nothing out of the ordinary. The best thing here was the french fries because they were smoked. We are huge fans of girl and the goat, so we decided to wait an hour at 3pm for a table... we thought by coming at an odd time we wouldn't have to wait as long... but we did. So I got a bloddy and an Irish coffee at the bar while we were waiting... the Irish coffee was actually delicious. The food was slightly disapointing, neither my fiance nor I liked what we got (except for the fries, which don't come with the food, you gotta order them sep). So honestly, Hub 51 had better brunch... and not even to talk about yolk or nookies, where for about $12/person you leave full of delicous food that won't dissapoint your pallet.
