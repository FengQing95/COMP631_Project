Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I loved the food and the waiter was very pleasant. We were there on a Saturday night so it was very busy. We had made a reservation for 4 people (1 backed out) and when we arrived we informed the hostess it was only going to be 3 and she responded "well make up your mind is it 3 or 4 ?" This was very rude of her that is why I didn't rate 5 stars she really needs an attitude adjustment.
