Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba Ba Reeba is an iconic restaurant that is heavily recommended for people looking for a taste of Chicago tapas. I'll preface this review by saying that I'm not the biggest fan of tapas (paying lots of money for small portions) because I'm a hungry girl and I particularly don't like it in large groups because it gets a bit hectic, but that won't taint the review of the restaurant itself.
