Art Institute of Chicago////I don't know much about this art thing people speak of but I enjoyed my time here. Saw a couple things that are well known to even someone like me in person, which is a treat for an art noob. American Gothic and Nighthawk are my faves. Also saw the work shown in Family Guy. The one where they kept zooming into the little girl's face. Yes, that's how I reference the important work I saw here. Told you I was a noob.
