Little Goat Diner////Ehhhh. I used to love Little Goat, but it's become so over-hyped. A 45 minute wait for lunch? Nuts. Especially when there are so many other great options nearby. It's so loud in here, service is horribly patchy, and it's really just become a tourist trap. I miss how chill this place used to be!
