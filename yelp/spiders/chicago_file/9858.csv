Art Institute of Chicago////If you enjoy Arts + Culture you'll probably need two days to truly enjoy the museum. However, one full day (from open to close) will leave you artfully satisfied. If you get hungry the Museum café on the lower level is quite lovely. I wanted to dine at Terzo Piano but it was closed for a private event. That's how I ended up having a late lunch at the café by the fountain.
