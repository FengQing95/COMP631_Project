Little Goat Diner////Combining diner classics with top chef flair, this diner is one of my favorite places to go for breakfast or dinner! The French toast and fried chicken is amazing, and don't miss the goat chili burger which you should share with someone you love. Go, but make a reservation if you want a seat on the weekend.
