The Purple Pig////Service started strong and then fell off a cliff when an entitled, oversized "VIP" table sat next to us. Suddenly our server was nowhere to be found, our glasses sat empty, and staff kept trying to clear the plates we were still working on. As more people joined the already-full table, they hovered inches away from us and glared at us. We distinctly felt that we were being pressured to leave and give up the table--despite the fact that we had a reservation, had been there for less than an hour, and were still trying to order more things (if and when the server checked in again). The manager spent considerable time and attention to going over wines with this group, seeming not to notice or care what was happening at any other tables on a busy Saturday night. Special treatment is lovely but shouldn't come at the expense of all the other customers.
