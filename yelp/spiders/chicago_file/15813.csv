Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I like this pizza place! The wait time for the pizza was 45 min. I had the Chicago famous and the shop's special and both were amazing! Had my first Chicago style deep dish pizza here and it was an awesome experience. Our waiter helped cut our pizza too, which was a bonus :)
