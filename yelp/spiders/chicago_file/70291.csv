Little Goat Diner////At this point, without about 15 minutes left until my husband and I needed to leave for the airport (our friends were able to stay), I asked to speak with a manager.  I explained what had been going on and how frustrated we were, and that we had very little time left before we had to leave to catch our flight.  The manager was incredibly nice, apologized, and literally brought us our food within 5 minutes (and it was gorgeous and DELICIOUS . . . the egg parathas . . . you must get them).  I was incredibly impressed by her professionalism and attitude, and I think it's a sign of a high quality restaurant when they have management that "gets it."
