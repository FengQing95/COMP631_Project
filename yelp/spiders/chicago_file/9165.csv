Art Institute of Chicago////When I moved to the Chicago area years ago, one of the gifts I got was a membership to the Art Institute. Since then, I have maintained this membership on my own, because this is such a wonderful establishment and it is wonderful to have the opportunity just to drop by whenever I feel like it, whether I just happen to be in the area or make a conscious decision to spend a few hours here.
