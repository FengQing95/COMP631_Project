Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friend and I shared a medium pizza on a lovely (shocking!) Saturday morning ; however, her being asian and I being manorexic, we barely put a dent in it despite our best efforts. For toppings, we chose pepperoni, spicy mix (ghiardani maybe?) and spinach. WOW.  It came out after I had already washed down two delicious bloody marys and was ready to devour.
