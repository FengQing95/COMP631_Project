Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I haven't been to this tapas place in years and decided to stop by last week for dinner and the food was just as delicious as I previously remember.  I would definitely make reservations because this place is always packed.  I love the burrata, Brussel sprout salad, Spanish olives, the spicy patatoes with aioli (this is a fairly large dish), baked goat cheese, and paella.  Everything is tasty and every dish has a little something different to it.  The desserts are just as amazing as the food and I recommend the small chocolate dessert.  The service here is always pleasant and its become a staple for us.  Definitely recommend trying out!!!
