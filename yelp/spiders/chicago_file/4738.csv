The Purple Pig////Wow. What an amazing culinary experience. My boyfriend surprised me with reservations for our anniversary. Service was a 10 out of 10. Everyone from the hostess to the bussers to our waiter were so warm and welcoming. We had the salt roasted beets which were so flavorful and the goat cheese tasted so fresh. I also recommend the octopus which was cooked perfectly, not too chewy with the right amount of acidity. And of course you have to have pork. The braised pork shoulder is so tender, you don't need a knife. Can't wait to go back to try out more dishes.
