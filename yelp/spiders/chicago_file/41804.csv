Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place has really good tapas but the wait can be quite long on weekends.  Now, I am more inclined to go there for their bar tapas (everything on the menu for $3!!!).  The bar menu is only available 4-6 M-Sun and 10-12am F-Sat.  The grilled calamari and bacon-wrapped dates are absolutely amazing and I never go there without ordering these two items.  They have white and red sangrias which are good but not great.
