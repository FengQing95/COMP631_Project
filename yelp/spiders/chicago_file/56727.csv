Smoque BBQ////Finally, Smoque has the last word on good service.  Would that I could get every restaurant in town to have such thoughtful, efficient and pleasant people manning the front.  Those folks at the counter are exceptionally sweet, and I swear that I'm bringing them beers next time I visit.  For the service alone I would go back.
