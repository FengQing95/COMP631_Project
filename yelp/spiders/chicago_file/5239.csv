The Purple Pig////Our wait time to be seated was less than a couple minutes, and our server arrived promptly at our table for our drink order. During our meal, we were then greeted by another server, Corie, who engaged with our table very well and even offered some great recommendations. She was very friendly, always had a smile on her face, and made the entire experience that much better.
