Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I friggin love this place. I'm a true fan of all things Spanish, so naturally tapas and sangria are right up my alley. Everytime I visit, whoever I'm with, we always get the bacon-wrapped dates, the spicy shrimp and garlic, and patatas bravas, which totally takes me right to Spain.  I've never had a tapa I didn't like.  The original red sangria is my fave.  The passion fruit, mango and other special ones are more watered down and have less flavor in my opinion.  Service is usually pretty decent.  It's never been super awesome, but it's respectable and that's all I can ask for.
