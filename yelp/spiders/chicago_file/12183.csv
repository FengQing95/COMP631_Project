Art Institute of Chicago////This. Was. Such. A. Joy. I can't even articulate the amount of amazement I was in going through all the galleries in this enormous museum. To give some insight, I've taken quite a few art history courses during my college years and it was indescribable to see the artwork that I've studied for a decade...right in front of my eyes. There was some work that I was anticipating to see such as the classic Sunday Afternoon by Seurat, but some that I had no idea were here at the Art Institute like the American Gothic and "This is Not a Pipe" by Magritte.
