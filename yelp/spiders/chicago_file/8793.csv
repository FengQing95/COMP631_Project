Art Institute of Chicago////My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this place. We tried to visit all the sections in the short amount of time we had, and the art still blew us away. Pick up a brochure/visitor's guide so you can plan out what art you will enjoy. It's a huge place so avoid getting yourself lost. I recommend visiting their gift/merch shop to buy any of your loved ones souvenirs too.
