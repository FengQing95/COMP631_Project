Little Goat Diner////Yes, there is a lot of hype around Stephanie Izard's restaurants. With Little Goat, it is definitely warranted. I love the food here, especially their fresh bakery bread they make in-house. The avocado toast is the best I've had. The food can tend to be on the heavy side, but you can find lighter options too. The fish tostadas and the salads are all really good, so much flavor. I love the casual vibe here and they're open all day. Great for breakfast or lunch meetings. Service is always friendly and efficient.
