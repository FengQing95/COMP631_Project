Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a nice place to go with 1-2 other people. Their variety of sangrias are tasty and most of the food is good (and reasonably priced). I will say, however, that I think the paella is overpriced. Some of my fav items are the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, short rib, and calamari. The desserts are perfect sized (get the chocolate cake!)
