Little Goat Diner////.  Strawberry Ice cream with peanut butter syrup with dark choloclate coverd Cheez-its (which apparently was the theme of Top Chef Stephanie Izard's, the owner, wedding cake) with whipped cream.  I'll be the first to say this sounds weird but it's plays with your tastebuds in such an intereting way and grows on you the more you eat it.  When you  imangine peanut butter and strawberry jam ice cream with a crunchy dark chocolate pretzel this dessert begins to make a lot of sense.
