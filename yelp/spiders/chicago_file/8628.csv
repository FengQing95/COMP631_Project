Art Institute of Chicago////Art history fanatics and normal art enthusiasts alike will spend hours here at the Art Institute. My husband and I spent about 3 hours and we were only on the first floor. The Greek and Byzantine collection is stunning, especially since most of the pieces are in amazing condition. Take a look at the tesserae pieces, they are wonderful! I also enjoyed having the Ipads next to some of the works. The Ipads added a nice interactive feel to the piece which helped me learn even more about the pieces of art on display.
