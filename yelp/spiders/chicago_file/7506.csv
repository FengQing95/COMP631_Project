Art Institute of Chicago////I lived in Chicago for three years.  From the day I first exited the Art Institute of Chicago until today (six years later), AIC is one of my absolute favorite places in the world.  Just blocks from the shores of Lake Michigan, the Art Institute has a vast collection of some of the greatest visual art in the western world and some smaller eclectic pieces from various eastern cultures.
