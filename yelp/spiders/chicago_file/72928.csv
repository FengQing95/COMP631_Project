Little Goat Diner////I haven't been to Chef Stephanie Izard's other establishments, but this is good place to go with friends if you're looking for good food, good atmosphere on Randolph street. Little Goat is a bit of an amplified diner with an interesting menu list, but the menu descriptions does not possess an upscale feel. Hm... Kimchee & Asian Style pancakes? Or Sloppy Goat? A couple of the menu items uses Asian-inspired ingredients, but don't feel intimated. Everything on the menu sounds intriguing and inviting.
