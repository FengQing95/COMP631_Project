Little Goat Diner////We were not having the three-hour Au Cheval date. Do you know what place was amazing and seated us right away? Little Goat. This was my first time coming here, and I had high expectations having previously dined at Stephanie Izard's Girl and the Goat. We were seated at the bar and we ordered brussels sprouts as an appetizer while we perused the gigantic menu of equally delicious-looking options. Perhaps there was a misunderstanding or the brussels sprouts were actually a side because they ended up coming at the same time as the rest of the food.
