Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For our entrees we had the steak frites (nicely prepared and very nice presentation), the classic ribeye (not dry aged, but still a wonderful 16 oz. steak), and the 42-day dry aged 22 oz. ribeye (shared by two of us, and a wonderful tasting sensation). We also shared sides of corn (very nice, but barely for four), mashed potatoes (easily the best of the sides), wild mushrooms (nice, but unremarkable), and creamed spinach (weighing in at second best of the sides). Other highlights were the very slightly sour dough bread (thick crust). The wine list was very nice and won't require your first born son to afford.
