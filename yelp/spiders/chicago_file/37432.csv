Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've been here a few times now, and every single time it has been absolutely fantastic. There is literally nothing to complain about with this place, the service is amazing, the food is amazing, the ambiance is amazing, just god damn this place rocks. Are you looking for a top 3, maybe top 2 steak in Chicago? Hit up Bavette's, and even if you don't want steak, their food selection is phenomenal and overall all great quality!
