Art Institute of Chicago////I'm not an art buff.  So, I cannot discuss the importance of any particular movement, shadow, or color, but I can share how the experience of each visit moves me.  Each time I go to AIC, I'm reminded of how important the visual arts are to our understanding of culture- a culture that has justified war, perpetuated poverty, and spread disease/pestilence.  But, walking through each wing of AIC, I'm reminded that it's also a culture that appreciates the aesthetics, interprets beauty in various forms, and imitates life through understanding the subtleties of human emotions.
