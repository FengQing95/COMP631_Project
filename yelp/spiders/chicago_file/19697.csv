Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The 4 of us ordered a large and split half and half between the Lou and Chicago Classic.  The pizza came out piping hot and oozing with cheese and sauce.  I personally liked the Lou more than the Classic, because it is veggie based.  he classic sausage was too thick and tasted funky to me, too porky flavored.
