The Purple Pig////All said though, with tip, we paid about $50. Which I think is a pretty great price for a meal for two people in Downtown Chicago. I assume this place gets insaaanely busy during peak times. If you are willing to wait, it is certainly worth it! Or....go mid-afternoon if you can swing it.
