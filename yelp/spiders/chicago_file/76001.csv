Little Goat Diner////The hash brown was amazing, they have a Japanese style dish which is okonomiyaki, this was great. Also they have Chinese style dish which I forgot the name, was fantastic. They serve brunch until night. The neighborhood was awesome and also the atmosphere. Little loud to talk but def it s a good place to hang out.
