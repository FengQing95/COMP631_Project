Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My wife and I were in town on our baseball bus tour and wanted to have some authentic Chicago pizza, so taking some advice from the Harry Caray servers, we chose Lou Malnati's. My wife ordered the thin crust.and I the deep dish and the pizzas were heavenly! Each order I'd prepared fresh so it was a 35 minute wait but it was worth it! Delicious Chicago pizza!
