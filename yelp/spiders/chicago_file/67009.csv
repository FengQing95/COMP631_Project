Little Goat Diner////So with the expectation that it was going to be a diner with diner food, we were kinda bummed... until we ordered. We went for lunch and ordered the Fish Tostadas, All American Burger and the Tonkatsu with a side of smoked fries and brussel sprouts. Fish Tostadas were amazing. The fish was fried and was topped with a slaw that cut through the fat. The Tonkatsu was also really good. The breading was great with Asian bbq sauce. The burger was ok. It wasn't the best burger I've ever had. It probably didn't even come close, but the brussel sprouts and smoked fries made up for it! The fries had a more pronounced smokey taste than I thought they would and it was strangely addicting. They were thin and crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside. There wasn't one soggy fry. The brussel sprouts were saut√©ed in the same sauce they use over at G&tG topped with fried onions. So delicious!
