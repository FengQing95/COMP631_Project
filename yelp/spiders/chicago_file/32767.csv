Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////THE FOOD POISONING: We left to go meet 8 of our friends at Mastro's. I didn't drink or eat a thing there. They asked our opinion as none of them had been, we both gave it a thumbs down. But then came the icing on the cake--me vomitting and other things all morning from my meal at Bavette's. DON'T GO!
