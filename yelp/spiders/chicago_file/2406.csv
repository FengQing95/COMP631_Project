The Purple Pig////Purple Pig has been consistently great since it opened. Very good food with modern and inventive menu. Everything is fresh and delicious. Located off Michigan Ave. the current location is very small & cozy. We waited an hour for a table for two. Don't think you'll be able to get a seat at the bar either. The bar was packed too. I recommend the Kale and fried pig ears, the pork shoulder steak and the octopus.
