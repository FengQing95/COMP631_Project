Little Goat Diner////When we first got there, there was only one couple in front of us, but others started filing in quickly and soon it was crowded.  15 or so minutes or later, the hostess stopped by to apologize and let us know she'd forgotten about us but that we'd have the next table which was being cleaned off.  We were seated about 5 minutes later, so no biggie.
