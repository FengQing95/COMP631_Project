Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm ready to go back to Bavette's and I don't like repeating restaurants very often. The atmosphere was old Chicago steakhouse with comfy leather furniture and dim lights. The steak and frites were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The drink menu was eclectic with a good mix of 'ole timey recipes. From start (iceberg lettuce wedge with two thick slabs of bacon) to finish, everything was impeccable.
