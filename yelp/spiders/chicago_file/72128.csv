Little Goat Diner////This is my new favorite restaurant in the Fulton Market District! We had reservations and were seated within 5 minutes of arrival. Before being seated I enjoyed the cute custom little goat photo booth! The waitress was friendly and offered some great recommendations and we decided to order the jerk chicken sandwich, machos nachos, and the Mac n cheese. I highly suggest trying the machos nachos! The chips were crispy and the cheese on it is addicting. Great upscale diner and the prices aren't bad! Perfect for a casual date.
