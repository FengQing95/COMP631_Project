The Purple Pig////We are from Kentucky and are pretty particular about our bourbon drinks, but Tasha made a perfect Old Fashioned. We ordered the marrow as a starter, which was delicious. Â My husband had the pork belly and I ordered the orichetti (spelling?) with sausage. Both were wonderful, but the pork belly was the winner. Tasha was busy with drink orders and other bar customers, but we never felt neglected. She did a great job!
