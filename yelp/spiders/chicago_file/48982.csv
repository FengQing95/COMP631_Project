Smoque BBQ////With almost 2,000 reviews, it all seems redundant, but I had to comment. Barry & Co. did a stand-up job preparing me a special order of chicken and ribs (which I ate in house) without any seasoning or sauce because I have food allergies to some of the ingredients. Even without spicey saucy glory, the ribs were super tasty and smokey, chicken juicy and equally smokey. Extra adverbs = extra delish. They went out of their way for me, and we were incredibly grateful! Thanks again, guys!
