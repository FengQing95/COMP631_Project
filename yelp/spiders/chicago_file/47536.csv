Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Dessert: We got the mixed platter that came with six small desserts. Each one had enough so that each of us got at least one bite, then another for whoever liked it the most. I especially liked the creme brulee & passion fruit sorbet. We also ordered the bananas with caramel sauce & pistachios. It was also delicious and a much bigger portion.
