Smoque BBQ////Sheesh. This place has gotten to the point where you can't get their food anymore. The smoked stuff is ready or it isn't, right? They smoke it for 14 hours, or whatever, so they are not making it to order, so to speak. Nevertheless, two Saturdays in a row we tried to place a take-out order. The first was at 6:30 and they were not accepting orders anymore. The second was at 5:00 and they said it would be one hour forty minutes for PICK UP!
