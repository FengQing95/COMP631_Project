Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I am glad I did. Made a reservation a week in advanced and I am so glad I did. All the locals from Chicago I met said I made the right choice by coming here. I arrived a early before my reservation. The theme of the restaurant just adds to the atmosphere. I had a few cocktails before I sad down.
