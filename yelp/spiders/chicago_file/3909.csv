The Purple Pig////Amazed that we were seated quickly (although Sunday at 8:30pm) and the hostess and service was super responsive and upbeat. Great wine and beverages menu, always thrilled by how comprehensive it was (had a blackberry hard cider, my partner had a nice syrah). Small plate was great, an eggplant zaponata: simple and delicious.
