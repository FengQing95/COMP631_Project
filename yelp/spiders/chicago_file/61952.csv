Smoque BBQ////Brisket amazing, baby back ribs good, atmosphere chaotic and not family friendly. The line and process of ordering and seating along with the space makes you not want to return occupancy is only 45 and they are a very popular place! I'd recommend going here but not during lunch or dinner hours otherwise you'll be standing for a hour before you even over order and then another 30 minutes before you can sit down. Great butterscotch root beer. Being born and raised in the heart of BBQ land I'd say this is a good place to go in the northern Midwest.
