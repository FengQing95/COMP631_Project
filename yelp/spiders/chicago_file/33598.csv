Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I recommend everything we had - Wedge Salad, Fresh Bread, Roasted Chicken (possibly the most flavorful roast chicken I've ever had), Shortrib Stroganoff, Steak Frites, Baked Sweet Potato, Elote Style Corn (SO GOOD). I only wish we had room for the adorable ice cream dishes we saw floating around at other tables.
