Smoque BBQ////Not my favorite bbq in the city, not even close! I love bbq and I should have none better by the name alone. I've tried it a few times and everytime I'm not thrilled, to me it tasted like I was eating cigarettes. Way to smoky for my palette, unfortunately. The cornbread was pretty good, but that's not enough to get me back in.
