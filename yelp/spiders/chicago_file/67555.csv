Little Goat Diner////I'm sure their food is great, however, twice I've shown up to eat within their posted hours, and twice I've been turned away, the last time being nearly an hour before the time I was told over the phone that the kitchen would close.  I understand wanting to close up, but don't post hours you don't intend to keep...  I guess my business wasn't good enough for them...
