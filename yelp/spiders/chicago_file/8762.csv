Art Institute of Chicago////Apparently, there's a mini-paperweight collection in the basement floor...I walked past it on the way to the bathroom.  I imagine it's like looking at snowglobes, which I love.  I wish I had had time to explore that.  The buildings that make up this museum are all really cool.
