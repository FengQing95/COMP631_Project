Smoque BBQ////If you order the food as a combo, it comes with two sides.  The order comes with a side of coleslaw already so make sure you pick two different sides.  We had the baked beans, french fries, mac and cheese, peach cobbler and the corn bread.  My favorite was the coleslaw.  It was made with a vinaigrette dressing and was super delicious!  My other two favorite sides were the french fries and the peach cobbler.  The mac and cheese was good too but too creamy for me.  I was surprised that this BBQ place did not have mashed potatoes. Maybe a suggestion for the future? I love me some mashed potatoes!
