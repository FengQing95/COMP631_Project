Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My first time ever trying deep dish pizza and of course I had to save it for when I was in Chicago. The wait here is ridiculous, which is always a good thing because you know the food will normally be delicious. The best part is that you place your order when you put your name down and then they take your phone number to tell you when your table is ready.
