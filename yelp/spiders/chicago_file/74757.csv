Little Goat Diner////As for the actual coffee, I was brought here by my cousin who loves Stumptown Coffee. To his knowledge, this is only one of two shops in the Chicago area that serves Stumptown. I got a macchiato and it was very good. My cousin got the drink of a day, which was named after a famous person, and that was also very good.
