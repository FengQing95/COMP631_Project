Smoque BBQ////I really don't like it because it wasn't that great! It has not the favor of the smoke bar- be-que Â I was looking for. In order for pork to really be tender it should be slow cooked. I know of a person who really can smoke pork . Then he later add barbecue sauce of his making himself. So I can not eat food with no taste! I love barbecue with taste. You know it is good without the sauce.
