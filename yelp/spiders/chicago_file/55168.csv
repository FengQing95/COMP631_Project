Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A great tapas place, excellent sangria, and cool beer choices! Go early or later, not in between, you'll have a heck of a wait! The bar is an option too. Lots of tvs to keep up with sports. The patatas bravas is a good (not great) choice. The pinxtos are a great small bite option for those dieting or too hungry to wait 30 minutes for paella.
