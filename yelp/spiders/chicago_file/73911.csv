Little Goat Diner////So I make my way to Little Goat, which is a haul for me coming from the suburbs, but it fits both my main criteria of being far away from my apparently insect-ridden apartment and it's spider-free, to my knowledge. It's not home, but it feels like home. Better than home at this point, actually.
