Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////"Woohoo! As good as it gets!" Hands down the best pizza in the city of Chicago. I'm really picky about how pizza sauce taste and Lou's sauce is mouth-watering with the crisp crust, yummy cheese and their sausage is out of this world. Whenever I'm in Chicago, I always try to make time to order Lou's pizza when I'm with the family...
