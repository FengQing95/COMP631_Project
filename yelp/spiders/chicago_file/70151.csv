Little Goat Diner////Food: good sizes and good portions.  If I weren't flying out of Chicago the next day, I would have done left overs for sure.  I ordered the Sloppy Goat and definitely something I'd go back for.  Sloppy for sure, so I went after it with a fork but it was delicious non the less.  It came out hot in about 10 minutes or less, including the bun.
