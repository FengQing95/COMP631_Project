Smoque BBQ////The only complaint I had was that some of the patrons would just sit there yapping away with their friends long after they've finished eating and their plates taken away.  Come on people!  Have some courtesy for your fellow hungry diners, and get your full-asses out of the restaurant so that other people can sit down.  It is ok to stand outside and talk.  It won't kill you...  Oh, I wish they'd convert the back parking lot into an outdoor patio. That would rock!!!
