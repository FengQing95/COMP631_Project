Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I LOVE this place!! I got the berry pancakes, buttermilk pancakes with berries and powdered sugar. Simple, but amazing!! My friends got the berry bliss pancakes, the same thing as I got but with sweet fruity sauces drizzled over them!! They couldn't stop saying how good they were. Our waiter was so kind and fun, he made the experience even better!! There were a LOT of people there, but the staff was great and we were seated and with our food in an impressive amount of time. If you're I'm Chicago, definitely go to Wildberry!!
