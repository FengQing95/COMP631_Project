Art Institute of Chicago////Amazing! I've always been crazy about those tiny rooms with all the little furniture. Love it! Anyways, we checked out the Passport to Africa and Benin exhibit. It was great. You learn plenty and they have several artifacts. There are several exhibits that I'm still trying to check out but there is never enough time cuz the place is so huge. STILL LOVE YA ART INSTITUTE. Check out their site for more info.
