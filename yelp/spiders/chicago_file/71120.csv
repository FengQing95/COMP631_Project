Little Goat Diner////The third time, my man and I had reservations at The Publican (we showed up for our reservation at The Publican, and were going to be crammed in the middle of a communal table, literally the middle between two very loud groups, on date night.  No thanks).  So we left and walked around the corner to Little Goat.  A nice booth to ourselves.  We had cocktails and a nice leisurely dinner where we could hear each other and connect over delicious courses.  We were definitely sad to miss The Publican, but had an amazing dinner, and great date at Little Goat.  We now return to Little Goat.  Always delicious.  A lot to choose from.  Everything is delicious.  Great coffee.  Fresh, local, seasonal foods.  Funky combinations.  Good cocktails.  Service is on point.  We have space to breathe here while still feeling in the heart of things.
