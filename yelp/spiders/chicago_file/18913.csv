Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For over 40 years I've had Lou Malnati's on my birthday, every year.  I've had it delivered to me when I lived in New York (New York style pizza?  Vomit...).  We have family members from all over the country that want one, and only one thing when they come to Chicago.  Lou's.
