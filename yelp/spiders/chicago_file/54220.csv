Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I will say before I begin my review to ensure you get a banquet room for a group, even on a weekday this place was busy and VERY loud. We were sitting in the second room and I had to yell for the person next to me to hear me. However, the service and food were very good quality. My favorite item was the bacon wrapped dates.
