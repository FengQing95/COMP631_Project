Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best deep dish in the city! Make sure to make a reservation though, because this place is always filled with tourists. Definitely order the deep dish here & don't forget to get the buttery crust! After having this for the first time this summer, I definitely think this is a once a month type of meal. It's a very satisfying meal, but it also is a heavy one!
