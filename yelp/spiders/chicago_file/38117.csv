Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My girlfriend and I came here for dinner before headed back to la. We each got a steak and some side. Always ask for our steak medium rare plus. Her steak was good. It mine was more of a medium well. It was still kinda juicy but too dark to see. I could just feel the dryness of a overcooked steak.
