Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came to this location because I was visiting my friend from Germany who was in town to run the Chicago Marathon. I told him he had to try Chicago deep dish, so we choose Lou Malnati's. Now I am usually a Giordano's fan, but wanted to explore Lou's. I will say there was a long wait given that it was the Chicago marathon weekend which is to be expected, so we ordered and paid for our pizza right away so it would be ready by the time we were seated. We went to the bar next door and had drinks before we were ready to be seated. We were called and we went, my issue is we waited another 40 minutes to get our pizza, it seems that even if you order your pizza early, it is not ready on time.
