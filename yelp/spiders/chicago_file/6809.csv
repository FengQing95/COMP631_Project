Art Institute of Chicago////I should have bought a yearly pass because there is no way you can cover everything is this place. We walked over from Millenium park on the sky bridge. If this building were true to it's modern form it would have had the circular escalators like the one's at Caesar's Palace. That said I haven't been here in a couple of years and I really have no excuse for that. The sculptures, furniture, fixtures, jewelry. I raced through most of the building but it did none the pieces justice. I will be going back very soon to explore more of this wonderful museum. Side bar. If you happen upon the book Lost Chicago by David Lowe. On page 37 you will see that Potter Palmers castle on the lake had a 75 foot long room that was slathered with what was soon to be the nucleus of Â the Art Institute's rare french impressionist collection. I was wow'ed by all the painting's that have been popularized on tv and movies that are in this vast building. I had no idea? This is a must see when coming to the city.
