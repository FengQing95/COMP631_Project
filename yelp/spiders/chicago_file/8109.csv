Art Institute of Chicago////Wooh! OK, I'm done now. The Art Institute is such a great museum, and I highly recommend going if you're from out of town or a Chicagoan like me. There's so much to see, there's no way you can see it all in one day, but you can certainly try. I try to make it out about twice a year depending on what exhibits are showing, and it's always a great time.
