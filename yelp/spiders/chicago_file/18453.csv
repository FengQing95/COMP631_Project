Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Brought my boyfriend along for his first trip to Chicago and of course he wanted to try the famous Chicago deep dish pizza. We were between Pequod's or Lou Malnati's, but Pequods had a two hour wait just for a table AND you had to wait an extra 90 minutes for the pizza to cook. We were starving, so that was a no go. Lou Malnati's was our next best bet. We arrived at 7pm on a Sunday and they text you whenever your table is ready. You can also check on your number in line so you can walk around while waiting for your table. It is very crowded inside, so I recommend walking around even though it was freezing cold outside and nothing was really open. Another advantage is being able to order your pizza beforehand. Since it does take 90 minutes to cook, you don't have to wait for your table to order and for your pizza to cook! We waited about 30 mins for a table for four. Not too shabby. We ordered the Malnati salad and the combination platter for an appetizer. Holy malnati, the salad was soo good. My mom could not stop talking about the dressing. They need to release that dressing recipe because it tasted like crack. The combination platter has a bunch of fried stuff, like fried zucchini and mushrooms. Pretty good, but anything fried is good. Our pizza took about 25ish more minutes to come out, and they slice and plate it in front of you. We ordered the classic and added pepperoni and mushrooms (it comes with sausage). My favorite part was the crust, it wasn't soggy despite all of the sauce and cheese on there. I got full off of one slice. Everyone thought it was good, but Chicago pizza just isn't my style. I prefer thin pizza, but deep dish is still good too. Service was pretty good for being so busy and crowded. There was a spill under the table from the people that were previously sat at our table and they quickly mopped it up for us.
