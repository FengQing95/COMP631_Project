Art Institute of Chicago////Such an amazing museum, just a truly wonderful and diverse collection of art from around the world. The museum is almost overwhelmingly large, and even with a map hard to figure out how to see everything. If you really took in every piece and read about them,you'd be here for days and walk miles upon miles! It is expensive but worth it for the world class experience.
