Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our food was fine. Between the 3 of us, we ordered a lot of food and we ate it all: seafood, steaks, cheeses, etc. I will say that I didn't feel the dishes were very Spanish inspired, but I would say few plates on the menu met that criteria. The sangria was weak. Our waitress told us that the black raspberry sangria was the most popular. Ok, so I ordered one. All I could taste was the black raspberry liquor. I don't think there was alcohol in it. I did not order another drink. The drink menu in itself was pretty weak.
