Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am in Chicago for work and so far have only had pizza at Pizanos since it's the closest to my hotel, but tonight I decided to give Lou's a try and it did not disappoint.  I got the Malnati Classic and it was awesome, fresh ingredients and sausage in EVERY bite!!  If I am being honest though the infamous butter crust disappointed, I actually like Pizanos crust better, but overall Lou's is better.
