Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've been to the other location and tried the steak frites, asparagus, mushrooms, mashed potatoes, lemon meringue pie, and chocolate pie. The recipes are the same as here. Everything is good but the chocolate pie is heavier than expected and the mushrooms are a bit heavy on the onion topping. The garlic aoli is amazing and we loved the lemon pie.
