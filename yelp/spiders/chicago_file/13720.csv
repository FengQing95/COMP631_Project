Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Simply put some of the best pizza I have ever had in my entire life. Im thrilled because the last pizza I had which had an equally buttery and rich crust was at this tiny place in French Polynesia (Le Bounty if you can make it), and I have been terrified that the only way to recapture that taste was a 13 hour plane ride. Well, thank god for Lou's. And while it's sport theme and faux wood decor comes nowhere close to replicating the charm of an outdoor bistro on a tropical island, the pizza at least is just as good.
