Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There was about a 20 minute wait, but it didn't feel that long. It was crowded in the front, but once some of the to go orders were processed it cleared out. We also could put our pizza order in before we were seated to get it started right away. We had the small deep dish pepperoni in the heart shaped pan.
