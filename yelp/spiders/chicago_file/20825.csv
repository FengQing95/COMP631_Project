Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Between Pizzeria Uno, Gino's East, and Lou Malnati's, this is my favorite. Get the classic with tomato sauce, extra cheese and sausage. Ordering system for those dining-in is a bit different than other pizzerias, since these deep dish pizzas take so long to bake. You order your pizza at a counter and are then seated. If you order take-out, it takes about 45 minutes. My pizza was ready right on time.
