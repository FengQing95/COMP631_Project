Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Issue #3: our salad and bread came within 15 minutes of ordering. Then about 40-50 minutes went by with no main course. They even brought out another salad "on the house" which we were very confused since we already had eaten our salad. The staff was very apologetic and comped our drinks. Then the main courses finally arrived and were delicious.
