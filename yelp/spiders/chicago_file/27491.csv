Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Enjoyed the best deep dish pizza!! The Lou is the best. While they said there was 45 minutes wait, but they are creative, they let us order the pizza ahead of the time and brought the food much more quickly once on the table. The large pizza says it feeds four, but accompanied with large salad, it would feed our party of 6 (4 adults and 4 kids) easily. Great experience and not too expensive either.
