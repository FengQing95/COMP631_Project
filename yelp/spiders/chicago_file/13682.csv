Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The best deep dish pizza, ever. I know everyone has their preference but after trying several different places in Chicago, Lou's is the official winner. The pizza is perfection. From crust to the sausage, everything is exceptional. Salads are also very good. Much better than a little salad you would expect at most pizza places. The one we had reminded me of the maggianos house salad with prosciutto and Gorgonzola. The perfect accompaniment to pizza.
