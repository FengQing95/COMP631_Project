Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband stated to her that the Southside tasted like it was missing one of the key ingredients - mint. Although I cannot confirm or deny if it did or not, it honestly tasted like a Gin Gimlet with frothy egg white. This is a cocktail I drink frequently, especially at their sister restaurant next door - Gilt Bar (same recipe). Her response seemingly with attitude, "Oh, I must certainly did!" It was hard not to laugh at how rude she was. She then walks away, comes back with two mint leaves, smacks them loudly between her hands and places them on top of my drink. The female bartender then states, "Hopefully, that will provide more herbaceousness for you."
