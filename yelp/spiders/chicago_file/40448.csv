Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My wife and I have continued to visit Bavette's for our wedding anniversary every NYE. In December 2020, we ordered takeout due to the pandemic, and in 2021 we dined in. Each time our steaks were perfectly cooked, the creamed spinach was excellent as usual, and the pommes frites were amazing. The service is also exceptional and we feel very welcome each time we visit.
