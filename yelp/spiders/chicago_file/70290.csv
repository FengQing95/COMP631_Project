Little Goat Diner////My husband I came here for brunch on Sunday morning with three other friends en route to the airport.  A friend of mine had been raving about this place forever, and we were super excited to give it a try.  Even though we came with suitcases (that the restaurant kindly let us store behind the hostess table) and told the hostesses to let us know if being seated within the time range they had quoted us wasn't possible, the hosts were incredibly unhelpful in managing our expectations about the wait time, and in general, did not seem to care.  We were finally seated about an hour and 15 minutes after our arrival time, but then were not visited by our server for almost 10 more minutes.  This was totally unacceptable.  And how much effort would it have been for our host to mention to our server that we were in a rush? (especially because they were the ones who had given us the incorrect time estimate).
