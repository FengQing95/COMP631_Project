Art Institute of Chicago////Proof that there are great art museums in the States. This is one of my favorites and trip after trip I still love going and could stay all day. The highlights for me are the Impressionist collection, the Georgia O'Keeffe collection (do not miss her clouds in the stair well) and Chagall's stained glass windows. They have been moved to a new wing since my first visits when I was a kid (and since Ferris Bueller's visit). And, of course, take some time to visit Seurat's "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte". Their collection also includes some of the other best known American pieces including "Nighthawks" and "American Gothic".
