Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute was beautiful and im so happy that I hada Â chance to experience it. My favorite would have to be the African History as well as Indian. This museum is huge. We spent a good two hours here and still didnt experience it all. The musuem offered a combo deal on admission for here and skydeck so we did that. We got lucky and there wasnt too long of a line when entering (maybe like 3 people in front of us) On the way out, the line was out the door.
