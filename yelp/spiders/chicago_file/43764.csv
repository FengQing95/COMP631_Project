Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////When my mom came to visit a few weeks ago, this was the fist place I took her too.  My boyfriend, mom, and I had reservations for 8pm on Friday.  After waiting for 25 minutes past our reservation, I was becoming nervous that they weren't going to love the restaurant as much as I do.  The service quickly dashed these fears as we were seated and comped our first round of drinks.  The manager personally delivered the drinks with an apology which made up for the extra wait.  Plus, the sangria is awesome.  I had the salmon that came with cucumber, crema, and toast which quickly became my favorite thing on the menu.   I also had the pintxos platter (yes, I was stuffed)  and the goat cheese croqueta and tuna pintxos were awesome.  We were all stuffed ... and then our waitress brought us a free dessert tray as an additional apology for the wait.  Awesome.
