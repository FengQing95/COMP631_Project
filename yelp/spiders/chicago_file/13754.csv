Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////5. Servers MUST do at least a visual check (make direct eye contact, if not verbal contact) within 3 minutes of our entrees being served.  This is the 3 most important minutes of the entire meal!  If my food is over/undercooked, not as I requested, if I need more salad dressing, or want another glass of wine WITH my meal, etc. - NOW is the time for those requests to be handled ASAP.  MOST restaurants in Chicago fail at this basic point of service
