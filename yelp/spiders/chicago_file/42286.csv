Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The wait staff was aware it was my friend's birthday based on conversations etc, and without even asking brought her a complimentary dessert with a candle. (I was really impressed with that, just shows how attentive the wait staff is!!!) She got a taste test of a few different things and they were all tasty. I would not ordinarily order flan but from here I would HIGHLY recommend it. It was rich and had a distinct caramel taste which I love!!!
