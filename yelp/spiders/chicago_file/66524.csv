Little Goat Diner////This is my first review but it was worth it. We loved it here! Great food and service! Â Food came fast too for Friday night! We had the tempura mashed potatoes, the bulls eye French toast, and the Los drowned sandwich! All were excellent. Even the Mexican cake we brought home was amazing! Great quality food! They were also kid friendly! Recommend to everyone!
