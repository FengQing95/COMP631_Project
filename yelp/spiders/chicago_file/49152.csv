Smoque BBQ////As a recent transplant from Texas, BBQ is second nature, and there's plenty of places to find some good ol' Southern BBQ.  However, when I set out to find a good BBQ joint in the Chicago it was more of a challenge.  Most of the recommendations lead me to Smoque BBQ but expect to wait in a long line, I was told, because it's a popular place.  I grab some friends one Saturday afternoon and headed there. The line wasn't as long as expected and the smell was very inviting. After several minutes of being in line, we placed our order, and then were sat down in their main dining (or outside patio).  They call your number to come get your order when it's ready.  We were not disappointed at all. The staff was friendly, the environment cheerful, and the menu reasonable. Of course...the BBQ would compete very well against some Texas BBQ joints.  You can order off the menu to dine-in or do yours to-go. The patio is very enjoyable and within walking distance there's a childern's playground if you're looking to entertain or tire out the little ones after lunch.
