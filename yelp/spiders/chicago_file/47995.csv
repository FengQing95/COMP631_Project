Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our second round was: asparagus with manchego cheese, the mushroom, onion and arugula flatbread, and spicy roasted potatoes. The asparagus was perfectly cooked and had a great grilled flavor to it, especially on the tips. The flatbread was very tasty, but I felt it was missing something. Maybe a tiny sprinkling of lemon juice or a vinegar reduction. The spicy potatoes were just roasted potatoes with some kind of spicy mayo which wasn't spicy. I was disappointed with that one. When you say "spicy", I WANT SPICY.
