Smoque BBQ////We had the baby back ribs, chopped brisket and pulled pork as our main dishes and the mac n cheese, peach cobbler, cole slaw and cornbread as our sides.  Everything was cooked in cute little silver cups and served on a mini cookie sheet which was very cute.  The cornbread was pretty good, but everything else was just average.
