Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////All in all, I had a wonderful time here. I don't think I've completely traded teams (sorry, but thin crust will always have a special place in my heart), but if you're like me and new to deep dish, I challenge you to try Lou Malnati's and not develop a newfound appreciation.
