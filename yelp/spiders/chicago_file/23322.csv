Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I finally got to experience Chicago Deep Dish Pizza! My co-worked and I got a tip by our boss, who is from Chicago, that this was the place to go. Literally 1 hour off the plane and we were here at this location. Traffic is pretty terrible to get into the city, but once you are here you are in.
