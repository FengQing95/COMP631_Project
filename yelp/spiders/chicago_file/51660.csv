Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went for brunch on a chilly Sunday morning. The food turned out pretty well and we all ordered a few breakfast items and the cute little breakfast pinxots. They were all delicious except for the chicken and waffle item. It was more like a chicken sausage corn dog. Not my favorite.
