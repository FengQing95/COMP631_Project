Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is viewed as one of the best pizza places in Chicago and certainly has the wait times to back it up. We went on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch and had a 45 min-hour wait. We decided to get drinks elsewhere to kill time. You can pre-order your pizzas, which helps with table time. We ordered the calamari appetizer, Malnati salad, Malnati pizza and pepperoni pizza. The calamari was crispy and tasty and gas a flavorful dipping sauce. The Malnati salad was full of great ingredients, packed a punch of flavor and was dressing heavy (which I like). The pizzas were also good and way different from east coast pizza style. The Malnati pizza was good, but I wasn't a fan of the thick cut sausage. The pepperoni pizza, which I got with extra sauce, was great! The cheese was a little heavy on both pizzas, but I am told that is the Chicago way. I think the food is decent and that coming here is a must for a tourist, but there is too much hype.
