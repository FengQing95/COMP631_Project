Smoque BBQ////However, eating there is more difficult than giving a spoken word beat poetry performance to a room full of weak bladdered, deaf elders.  Oh my god!  If seating takes the navigational skills of a Navy Seal Commander, don't you think it is time to do something about it?  Expand, move, offer take out only?  It was absolutely insane and this was at 2:30 on a Sunday! I can't even imagine what a lunch hour or a Saturday during dinner would be like.  Yikes.
