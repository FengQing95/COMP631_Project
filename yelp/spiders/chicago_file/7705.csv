Art Institute of Chicago////Because it was Valentine's Day, I had a rose in a paper bag with me.  The staff members said that I couldn't bring it in nor would they keep it under the front desk.  It wouldn't hurt to keep it under the desk for a while, right?  Another downside is that the artworks haven't been changed for as far as I remember.  It is cool that it's got Millet, Cezanne, Monet, etc, but it doesn't have some more prestigious artworks.  It would be nice if they could bring some more Picasso, Dali, Van Gogh, etc.
