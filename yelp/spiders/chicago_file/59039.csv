Smoque BBQ////Nothing much to say that hasn't been said by others. A few years ago, I would have reviewed Smoque as the bomb because good bar-b-que was still hard to find on the north/northwest side. These days, it holds up to its competitors (Rub's in my neighborhood). Brisket is the best choice and ribs come in a close second. Hand-cut fries and baked beans are delicious, but other sides are pretty average. Be prepared to wait in line almost any evening, but the staff works hard to keep everybody moving. Probably not the place if you're looking to linger over dinner.
