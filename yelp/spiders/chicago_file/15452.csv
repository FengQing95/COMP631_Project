Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great service, helped us out of towners decide which quintessential Chicago pizza to order and had it ready for us when we picked it up. Pizza was delicious, though heavy. Not the type of pizza I could eat every other weekend but was definitely a must try when visiting Chicago.
