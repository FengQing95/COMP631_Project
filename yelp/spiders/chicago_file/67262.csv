Little Goat Diner////I sat and looked the menu right away. Everything looked delicious. Our server came by and greeted me. The same host who seated me approached me and asked me if I need her to lower the blind since the sun was directly shining on to my face. I said, yes please and she did just that, which I thought was very very nice of her. My friend came and we started ordering. I ordered the mocca with soy milk, Los Drowned and a side of mac and cheese, which my friend ordered the sloppy Â goat and a side of fries. Soon enough, all our orders came except her sloopy goat. So, we asked the food runner to check on it. Later on, maybe about 5 minutes or so... Our server came to check in on us and we told her that we're missing the sloppy goat. She apologized and she told us that she heard the side of fries only and quickly put in her order. Minutes later, her food arrived and we ate in peace. I honestly didin't like my Los Drowned. There were not much flavors to me. I was expecting a little spice because of the spicy mayo being one of the ingredients and I did not taste that at all. I had two bites and asked for it to be wrap to go. My friend said, her sloopy goat was okay and ate more than half of it. I didin't try hers, so, I can't really say anything about it. However, the fries and the mac and cheese was heavenly. I thought they were really really good.
