Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tougher part of the deal is finding parking sometimes. So if you make reservations and are like me and only use valet in case of emergency , give yourself an extra 10 minutes to find a park and walk a few blocks. Unless, of course, you habitually valet--or are on a 1st date already trying too hard to impress ("Find a park?? No dear, I only valet--now pass the Grey Poupon.").
