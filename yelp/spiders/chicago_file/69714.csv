Little Goat Diner////Went to the bakery the day before, cookies and bread were great. After Â breakfast got cookies again, and they were stale and flavorless, same cookies. Who would have figured. I intend on trying again for lunch sometime, hoping they will redeem themselves, if not that will be it. BTW will someone tell me what a "sexy diner" is? :-)
