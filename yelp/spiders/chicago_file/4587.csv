The Purple Pig////We then got in and wow, the food is worth the hype. Our party of 8 sat down and served the plates family style. I tried the risotto, the chicken thigh skewers, and the grilled broccoli (mind blowing, by the way). I originally was the only one who wanted the broccoli but after they tried it, we ordered a second plate of it! The rest of the table enjoyed some fish and pork plates, and everyone loved it.
