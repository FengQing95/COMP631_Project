Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The bread and butter are to die for. The bread manages to be thick and warm and chewy and delicious all at once, and the butter is the most spreadable I've ever had at a restaurant. Delicious. I ordered the burger, and it was a great burger- the kitchen originally messed up my order so I ended up getting my food after everyone else had finished eating, but at least it was on the house, and very tasty. Everyone else at the table loved what they ordered.
