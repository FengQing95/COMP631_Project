Smoque BBQ////Smoque is one of our favorite restaurants, which is why we decided to have them cater our wedding.  I contacted them and dealt mainly with Peggy.  I have to say that Peggy was very responsive when I had a question, or when I had an issue.  Smoque came out to our venue a few weeks before the wedding to check everything out....they took photos and measured to ensure everything went smoothly.
