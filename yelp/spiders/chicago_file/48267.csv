Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is definitely still NUMERO UNO when it comes to tapas. Was here with the lovely girlfriend a couple of weeks back and made some delicious purchases off of both the regular and gluten-free menus. Our server was kind of enough to let us know that some items may not be entirely gluten-free as some of the ingredients do touch surfaces in which gluten is used for cooking. Aside from that, our service was phenomenal. Our water glasses were never left unfilled and the attentiveness of our server was unmatched.
