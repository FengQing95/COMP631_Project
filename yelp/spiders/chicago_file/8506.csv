Art Institute of Chicago////Beautiful museum. We were only able to cover about a third of the museum in a few hours. There are lots of staff who can help guide you. You can pay for a guided tour via earphones. Tickets were $25 with free re entry. I loved the impressionists and modern art collections. Also got a kick out of the folk art. The building itself is beautiful. A real work of art.
