Smoque BBQ////My husband and I went to Smoque after we had seen a special on the Food Network for the best BBQ and man was it good! I dont know if it's like this every night or because it was a Friday, but the line went from the counter to outside the door. It was almost wrapped around the building. Basically you have to order your food first and then the host seats you. The food is so delicious that the tables turn around fairly quickly. It's a really small place, so it's not even a guarantee you can sit and eat. We were lucky and were able to get seated quickly. The St. Louis ribs are amazing. Very smokey and tender. And living in the South....we know our BBQ. Â We tried a taste of the sliced brisket b/c everyone said it was to die for. It was like butter! I rather have the ribs, but the brisket was definitely good. The mac and cheese was SOOOO yummy, but they only give you a tiny little cup. We also had the beans, which were strange for us but most seem to like them. The french fries were very good and the coleslaw, which is vinegar based, was alright. I prefer more of a mayo based coleslaw. Basically you're not there for the sides, you're there for the meat and the meat rocks! Here's a tip for parking: After 5:30 there's a little parking lot with a wooden fence around it connected to the restaurant that you can park at. Nobody was parking there b/c the sign in huge letters says no parking, but there is an exception after 5:30 in small letters. Otherwise if you dont park there you have to try and find street parking and it wont be close. It's worth going after 5:30, so you can park right next door!
