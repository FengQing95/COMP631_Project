Art Institute of Chicago////As we exited the museum, my son realized that we did not visit the lower level which featured 68 Thorne miniature rooms. They allowed us to reenter the museum with our tickets. I am so glad that we didn't miss this exhibit. It happened to be all of our favorite. The miniature rooms are a sight to see.
