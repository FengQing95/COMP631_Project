Little Goat Diner////Corned beef hash was utterly amazing - such fresh and moist corned beef with not-overly-crispy hashbrowns topped with perfect cooked eggs. I was indecisive about what to order but I am oh so happy I went with this in the end (although you really can't go wrong). This is the corned beef hash of my dreams.
