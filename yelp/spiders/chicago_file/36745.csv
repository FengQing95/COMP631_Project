Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I went to Bavette's last year for my birthday and loved it so much I had to come back this year. Don't get me wrong, Bavette's serves a great steak, but I think the real charm here is the ambiance, which is somewhere between speakeasy and your grandmother's living room. It's comfy and chic at the same time. One thing that truly speaks to the atmosphere they are going for here is the BYOB policy. They apparently have BYOB every night (my boyfriend and I brought a bottle on a Monday), but instead of a tradition corkage fee they have something a little different - you must give one glass of your wine to another table, either of your choosing or the waiter's choosing. It's fun, and you can bring your favorite wine without the cost usually associated with buying a bottle at the restaurant.
