Smoque BBQ////The BBQ here is just awesome. I've never tried the ribs because the brisket and pulled pork are just SO good. In fact, everything they have is good... Mac n Cheese, Peach Cobbler, beans, fries, even the side of coleslaw that you get with your meal is good. Its coleslaw with a clear dressing, not mayo based and its really refreshing and yummy. The sauce is really good too! YUM!
