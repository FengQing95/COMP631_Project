Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////One thing you need to know, it takes 35-40 minutes to cook your pizza, so if you are impatient or in a rush, this place isn't going to work for you. After indulging in our deep dish pizza, we understood why it takes so long to prepare. It surely worth the wait! By far, its the best pizza I've ever tried. I would fly to Chicago just to eat here again.
