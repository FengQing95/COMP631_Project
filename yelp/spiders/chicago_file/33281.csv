Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Ok, how do I eat here...every day? The food is absolutely fantastic. I enjoyed the crab and avocado for an appetizer which was zesty from the lemons and creamy from the avocado, all around yummy in my tummy. For entrees we had the Prime Bone in Rib Eye, medium rare (only way to eat good quality meats) which just melted in my mouth and I still have drooling dreams about it. Service was wonderful and the atmosphere is just what I was looking for! You must go, right now and try it!
