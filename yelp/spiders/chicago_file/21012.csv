Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Both SO and I have never tried deep dish pizza, and unfortunately weren't super impressed. Since this is our first time trying, and it was okay. It definitely wasn't bad, but it wasn't great-- the cheese was chewy and it felt like everything was just completely thrown on top of each other. Might have to try it again!
