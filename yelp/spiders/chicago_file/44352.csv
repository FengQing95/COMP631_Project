Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////But that was months ago. I have became a regular at Ba-Ba-Reeba ever since. This is pretty much my hang out place and it was the place that I went for my third date.I mean, it's a no brainer. They have a ton of selection to choose from and excellent sangria. I particularly love their grilled skirt steak, grilled calamari and paella.
