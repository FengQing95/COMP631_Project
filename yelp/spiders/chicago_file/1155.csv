Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////After reading reviews, I knew this was a place I would visit on my recent trip to Chicago. Once we woke up, we entered our spot into the No Wait app. The wait was extensive (we woke up late), but we got ready for the day and were able to explore Millennium Park for awhile as well. Once there were about 10-20 groups ahead of us, we headed (now starving) to the restaurant. Check in was rather chaotic, but they have a semi-efficient system in place. Once seated, we had the best waiter! He was hilarious and his recommendations were on point. I ordered Eggs Benedict and a side of Signature Berry Bliss pancakes to split. The pancakes were phenomenal, but note that the eggs Benedict comes with a HUNK of ham. I suppose I should have known better, but it was as thick as an Easter ham. They will even put coffee in a to go cup when you are finished - wonderful meal and wonderful service!
