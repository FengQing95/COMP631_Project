Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've been waiting to try Chicago deep dish pizza and this definitely didn't disappoint. Best pizza I've ever had and I don't even like deep dish. Their butter crust deep dish was so delicious I couldn't get enough. If you're ever in Chicago this is def a place to have for deep dish Chicago pizza!
