The Purple Pig////I had high expectations for this one, ambience in a hotel/office building lobby is less than desired, the place was packed but the shoes for me was mediocre. We got a variety of everything, the dock was less than desirable trying to pick it apart, everything else was just average and taste and not pleasing on the eye.
