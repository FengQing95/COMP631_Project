Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am giving this place three stars. If I crave Lou's again, I will most likely not go back to this location. The seating is just too cramped for my liking. I mean just look at the address of this place. You know it is going to be packed almost any night of the week. i would rather pick another location and enjoy my pizza in a more relaxed atmosphere.
