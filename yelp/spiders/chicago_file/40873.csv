Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our favorite tapas restaurant ever.  While living in Chicago we ate there literally more than once a week and we miss it so much.  We also tried 1492 and it is definitely good, but this place is still our #1.  The sangria, the wine list, the servers, atmosphere, and of course the food were all wonderful.  The only thing I can complain about is that the cooking class we went to there was actually a demonstration,  not an interactive class.
