Smoque BBQ////You'll have to wait in line probably, it's counter service. But it's very delicious. We split St. Louis ribs, pull pork, mac&cheese, fries, baked beans, cornbread, and the peach cobbler. I think the ribs, mac & cheese, baked beans, sweet tea, peach cobbler and pulled pork sandwich are the winners from this menu.
