The Purple Pig////I think it's safe to say that you can't really go wrong with any restaurant that has the word "pig" in it... Â The Salty Pig in Boston, Pig 'N Whistle in LA, The Pig in DC, the Wooly Pig in SF. Chicago's Purple Pig is the quintessential new American, foodie-centered, trendy-casual, hyped up, hour-long-wait restaurant serving unique and fun creations ranging from crisp Brussels sprouts to pig ears to cured meat and cheese boards. With the motto "Cheese, swine, and wine" and a branded gate entrance alongside the river, it's difficult not to be captivated by the restaurant's charm.
