Little Goat Diner////The second visit was for breakfast. Arrived early (7:30a) to be told they were not open because they were having mechanical issues. They directed us to the bakery (just east of the restaurant space) and gave me a coupon for a free coffee. We waited for about 15 minutes and were sat. Considering everyone was sat at one time, the service staff and kitchen handled it amazingly well. Our server, Erik, offered his opinion on his favorites and promptly gave my dining companion the gluten-free menu when she said she had an intolerance. I ordered the kimchi-bacon-egg-pancake-tasty thing and it was really delicious!
