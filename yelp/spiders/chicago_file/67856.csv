Little Goat Diner////Love this place, and don't get in often enough! The atmosphere is perfectly bizarre - it somehow creates a space appropriate for every occasion, from lunch with toddlers, to a Saturday night first date. The bar in the back is small but cozy, and the small, two person booths in the far wall of the restaurant offer a quieter, more private dining experience, as opposed to the long group tables.
