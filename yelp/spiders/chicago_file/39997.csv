Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I got an email about their Burger & a Beer special.  Neither of us felt like cooking, so we ordered two specials and picked them up about 6pm on a random Tuesday night.  We took our feast to Montgomery Park, spread out a socially-distanced picnic blanket and had at it!  The burgers were delicious - a perfect medium rare .... everything you want in a big, succulent, indulgent steakhouse burger.  The fries were perfectly crisp and salty.  A fantastic way to experience Bavettes for the first time.
