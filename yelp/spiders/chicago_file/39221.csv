Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My boyfriend and I came here for our 7 year anniversary because my friend HIGHLY recommended it and said it was her favorite restaurant. Bavette's did NOT disappoint. We made reservations a month early and 930pm was the only time available. After coming here I completely understand why. We ordered the dry aged rib eye, filet mignon, truffle mac & cheese, mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts and smoked salmon caesar salad. Our waiter mistakenly brought us button mushrooms instead of brussel sprouts but he fixed it right away and let us keep the mushrooms. Everything was amazing, the rib eye was the best steak I have ever had. Salmon Ceasar salad was unlike any other salad I've ever had - I still crave it to this day. The atmosphere is nice. I wish it wasn't so dim but other than that, I definitely highly recommend Bavette's for dinner. Can't wait to go back!
