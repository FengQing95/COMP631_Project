Little Goat Diner////This dish was incredible, inventive, and left us wanting more! After much discussion, we agree that this was the most unusual and best thing we ordered. This breakfast burrito was made of an indian flatbread and filled with mashed potatoes, sunny side eggs, an avocado-bean salad, chili pepper sauce, and then topped with frisee and kidney bean salad that was tossed in a vinaigrette. It will be difficult for us to return to Little Goat without ordering this dish!
