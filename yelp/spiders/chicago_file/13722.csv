Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The place would get 5 stars, but the service really really sucked and the decor is lame. We had to ask over and over for menus; get ourselves drinks at the bar; ask over and over for water; hunt down our waitress. It was annoying. But not enough to significantly denigrate a sublime culinary outing.
