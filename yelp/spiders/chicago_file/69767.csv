Little Goat Diner////As for drink,  it's really not that outstanding.  Americano was nothing better than other places around, and same thing with macchiato.  I also tried little goat latte.  My rxn after the first sip was "Oh My Goat!"  Yeah, it is that goaty.  I know there should be people who would love about the unique flavor, but I wasn't sold.
