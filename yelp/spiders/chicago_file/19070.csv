Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've always wanted to enjoy a real Chicago style deep-dish pizza.  And Lou's seemed like the perfect spot to do just that.  We wandered by late on a Sunday night.  The lobby was packed.  And the wait for a table was 30 minutes.  The good news is, order your pizza now, so it's almost ready by the time you get to a table.  Thanks Tiffany for the very important bit of info.
