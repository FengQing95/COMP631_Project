Art Institute of Chicago////A couple of tips if you have never been here before:  Make sure you wear comfortable shoes, as the museum is truly massive, and you could easily spend an entire day wandering through its halls.  Also, please note that there are no back packs or over sized bags allowed.  You will have to check them.  Additionally, there is no food or drink allowed in the various galleries.  Feel free to take photos, but before you do, make sure that your flash is turned off.
