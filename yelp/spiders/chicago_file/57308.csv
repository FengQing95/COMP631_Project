Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is a whole lot of fun to eat, drink and hang out with a large group. This is the type of place where the more people you have the merrier. The tapas are ideal for sharing and the menu has a little bit of everything. We came with a large group and was able to sample a bunch of dishes, all of which tasted great. I don't think there was a single dish that I didn't enjoy.
