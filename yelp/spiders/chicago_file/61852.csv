Smoque BBQ////Smoque was really a solid 3. Had I not heard about the hype, I would say "it's ok, if I was in the neighborhood, maybe I would drop by if I was craving BBQ"--which is likely never, since it's not in a good neighborhood.  Having known about the hype, I would say it's severely overrated.  A few Chicagoans have called this the best BBQ place in town.  I'm a bit confused.  I've had far better fast-food BBQ in Washington D.C. and other places.  Maybe Chicago just doesn't know BBQ?  I don't know, I'm not native to this town.  I actually prefer Carson's over Smoque, though I'm enthralled by neither (Carson's has better appetizers, like their cornbread is legions better).
