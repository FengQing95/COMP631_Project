Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Chicago classic deep dish was to die for. It had the perfect ratio of ultra gooey cheese to meat ratio. And I love that the sausage wasn't little pieces strewn randomly about...it was a 1/4" sausage patty enveloping the entire pie. That's LOVE. And all of this is housed within a thick (but not too thick) butter crust. I could eat this for days on end probably...ugh, so good. The thin crust pizza was kind of joke though...didn't expect too much from it, but also didn't expect what seemed to be a cheese cracker, lol.
