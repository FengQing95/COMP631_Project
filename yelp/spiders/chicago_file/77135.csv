Little Goat Diner////Came back here for the 3rd time for a quick birthday dinner. We decided to try out their new savory asian pancakes. First, the scallion pancake was just ok, nothing too exciting. It's very similar to the pork belly pancake they had back then, but just without the pork belly. It was just sour veggies on top of a pancake. I think they could've done better with this menu.
