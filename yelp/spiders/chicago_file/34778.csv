Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Someone recommended this place to us, and we're glad to have checked it out! While it said dressy for dress code, we were fine with our shorts and tshirts as we were unable to change beforehand, and they didn't seem to mind. Reservations were full when I looked online, but we arrived right at 5 and was able to get a table right away. We opted for the bar which fills up very quickly. We had an old fashioned and vodka martini which were delicious. We also had the oysters and melted goat cheese which were incredible. The service was top notch, and the ambience is dark, sexy, and inviting. I'd definitely return here!
