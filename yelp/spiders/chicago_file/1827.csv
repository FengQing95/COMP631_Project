Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I don't understand all the glowing reviews for this place! The breakfast here is really only a step above IHOP or Denny's. The intelligentsia individual drip coffee was rather bland. I expect some flavor with this style of coffee! The fresca omelet was unfortunately unmemorable (what was in it again?) and tasteless. The buttermilk pancakes that accompanied the omelet were chewy and didn't even hint at fluffiness! The fruit in the fruit salad was unripe.
