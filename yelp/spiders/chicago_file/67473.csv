Little Goat Diner////After realizing my fate at Au Cheval next door and realizing that their 4 hour wait time was not going to fit into my life plans on a Friday evening, we found ourselves window shopping @ Little Goat in Chicago.  We decided to give it a shot and put our name in, they have a text system that promptly alerted me about 20 minutes later (for a party of 5, two kids).  There was a spot at the bar while we waited, enjoyed a beer and good conversation with my family.  Upon seating and reviewing the menu, I opted for the classic American burger since I already had burgers on my mind.  It was great, the cook on the burger was a perfect text book medium rare and I crushed it in about 3 minutes.  The waitress was both friendly, attentive and great with the kids, which is always a huge bonus.  My brother in law got the ravioli which he was not impressed with, something about the consistency of the sauce turned him off - but he's kind of a picky eater.  All in all, a great dining experience with a very unique menu.
