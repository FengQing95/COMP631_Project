Smoque BBQ////Got there right as it opened and there was already a line starting to go out the door.  Really small dining room but WELL worth the wait and the lack of elbow room.  I've had Smoque BBQ catered for someone's birthday and it was also just as good as eating in.  One of the best BBQ experiences I've ever had.
