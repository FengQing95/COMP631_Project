Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Really great deep dish pizza.  Went there with my wife who is from Chicago and knows all the pizza places.  I am from New York so we both know our pizza's.  We ordered a deep dish (a must) with all the toppings and were not disapointed.  Waited about 35 minutes after for our pizza to arrive (everything is fresh and prepared to order) and the wait was worth it the pizza was great.  Crust is perfect, right amount of toppings and boy do they have the flavors right. When we got back to Alabama we ordered one, that arrived by UPS in a few days.  Was packed in fry ice and arrived in great shape.  The pizza was good but not great. It was also very expensive as one might guess.  Would not order it shipped again
