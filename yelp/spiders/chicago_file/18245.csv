Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting Chicago for a quick weekend break. Haven't had deep dish before so was excited to experience the real deal. We went on Friday night quite late. About 8pm. But the place was buzzing. Had to wait about 30 minutes which was OK, we got some beers and waited patiently to be seated. I ordered a small pepperoni deep dish. Ion being seated we had to wait about another 20 mins or so but finally it arrived. And it was definitely worth the wait. Beautiful. I didn't finish the crust but devoured the pie. The service was just OK . The waitress said she would close out our tab down at the bar for us but she didn't. So we went home forgetting out card. No big deal all in all.
