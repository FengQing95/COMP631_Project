The Purple Pig////They don't mess around. Food came fast and waiters were on top of it. Luckily we were in the first wave and got seated immediately. I highly recommend the octopus! It was probably the best I've ever had as far as how perfectly cooked it was. The other item I would get is the pate which is unique, more on the slightly sweet side and the milk braised pork shoulder which was a little faint in flavor but savory.
