Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The real treat was when our server, Joel, came to great us at the table.  He kindly greeted us with a happy anniversary and began to take us through the drink list.  He was personable, professional, and patient as we began to ask some questions about the drink menu.  As a former service professional for 15 years I know all the subtle tricks of the trade and Joel was a master of keeping his eye on his section while also staying present with my wife and I.  All questions were answered in full detail with Joel giving his honest opinions on his preferences which is a welcome relief from "everything is great".
