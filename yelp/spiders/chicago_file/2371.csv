The Purple Pig////The foods I ordered were crispy pig ears, JLT, and stuffed squids. Generally, i felt they were creative but the taste is not that special. They are not enough for a meal but good accompaniments for drinks because they are saltier than proper level of salty for the meal. Crispy pig ears were like salty snacks, JLT was like a tapas with pig fats, and the stuffed squids was filled with grounded meat and vegetables. The price is not that expensive but it is little high if I take the amount of foods and ingredients into account.
