Smoque BBQ////Anyway, the ribs were flavorful, juicy and fell off the bone. They give you extra sauce and it was probably the best BBQ sauce I've ever had. I wanted to stick a straw into it and drink it. The cornbread was so warm, the crust was perfect and the bread was moist. It and the mac and cheese, so cheesy, so yummy, both came in these little aluminum containers that were the perfect size. Anymore and it would've been overkill. The slaw was vinegar-based, not mayo-based, so it was interesting and different, but in a great way. For 5 people, it was only about $70.
