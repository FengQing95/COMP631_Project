Little Goat Diner////I'm a fan of this place.  Decor is super cool - modern diner and the menu is super eclectic.  I ended up going off the waiter's favorite - kimchee & bacon & eggs & pancakes, y'know the asian style breakfast tasty thing as it states on their menu.  I'm not sure if he recommended it since I was asian but whatever.  It was basically a deconstructed korean pancake for those of you that know what I'm talking about.  I should've known and ordered what my gut was telling me to try.  But their menu is sooo different and interesting I love it for that.  I can't wait to try other things the next time.
