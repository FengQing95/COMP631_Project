Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This seems to be THE first date place in Chicago. Excellent people watching. Keep that in mind next time you're debating sitting at the bar. It's a fun restaurant, and always filled with groups, couples, etc. I've been a few times for drinks and a bit of food, (mostly drinks) and there is always, always a ridiculous wait. It's generally just me and a friend or two, so we like to stick to the bar. If you can snag a seat, the service is fast, and for whatever reason, you can hear your companions much better at the bar. The food is great, a typical tapas menu, but nice sized and good quality. The sangria, is dangerous. I've had some wicked hangovers after splitting a pitcher (or two) of the red sangria with friends. I recommend it for a lively atmosphere, just dont expect to get seated immediately. Won't happen.
