Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////OMG bone marrow! Ok, let me back track. For our one dinner night out in Chi-town, we wanted a really good dinner and this place seemed to be solidly well liked. We couldn't get a reservation until 9:45pm when we booked at around 5pm after a long day at Shedd. However it worked out with our appetite getting hungrier a bit later. We arrived around nine and they had a table already available too.
