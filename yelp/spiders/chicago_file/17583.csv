Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a disciple of Malnati's Pizza for many, many years we dragged our two friends from AL/FL in to this location to join us for the definitive Chicago style pizza.  Our server was alerted to their nubi-ism (sp?) and he went out of his way to make sure he answered questions and served up a great extra cheese, sausage and butter crust gem with a terrific chicken caesar and cheddar cubes.  The setting here is fun, location super convenient and as has been the case for over 30 years for us, it is the BEST DARN CHICAGO STYLE PIZZA IN THE WORLD PERIOD.
