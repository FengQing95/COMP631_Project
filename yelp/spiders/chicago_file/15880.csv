Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They had pre-made frozen pies and believe me, I spent a good 20 minutes debating how well one might hold up in the minibar at my hotel & then in my suitcase traveling home to Cali! Â If I have the pleasure of going back to Chicago, I'm very likely to recommend them & stop in again!
