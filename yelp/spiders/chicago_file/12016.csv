Art Institute of Chicago////On my way out after a fulfilling visit, I visited the gift shop. Saw a lot of art work featured in there that I hadn't seen while wandering around. TURNS OUT that I missed over half the museum. This place is HUGE and has something for everyone. So many iconic pieces to check off your list as well as new things to discover.
