Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was disappointed with this place. I expected more based on the reviews. It was my first time there but the people I was with were there before and they liked it. Well something must have changed because the food was bland. The shrimp were on the small side , like the ones you can get at Jewel on sale. The beef was missing something - oh yeah flavor. And the horseradish sauce , was just a sauce that maybe shared shelf space with a horseradish , because there was no tang in the sauce itself.
