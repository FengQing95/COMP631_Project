The Purple Pig////For starters, I had to wait about two hours for a table on a Saturday night at 8pm. My friend and I were finally seated around 10:30pm (a bit late to have dinner in my opinion) but I thought this place would be worth it. Unfortunately, even at 10:30pm the place was still packed so I was seated in a large communal table with a few other parties. Space wise, the entire restaurant is very cramped and I barely felt like I had any personal space.
