Little Goat Diner////Snootiness aside, the food is good. I opted for the Goat Patty Melt. The bread was very crunchy, just the way I like it. The goat was a bit overcooked but the sauteed onions and cheese sauce made up for that. Of course, this is yet another restaurant where sides aren't included, an unnecessary ploy to make people spend more just to leave satiated.
