Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love this place! Never dissapoints! I try to come here atleast once a year, which still isn't enough! This place has lots of seating, even a patio, where I have seen Flamenco dancers perform before. I have done the pinxtos before where you get an assortment of 6 tapas. I also love the beef tenderloin and blue cheese, roasted eggplant with goat cheese (YUM!), patatas bravas and of course the paella!
