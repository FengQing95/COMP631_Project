Art Institute of Chicago////Oh this place is magnificent! I could spend a whole day here. I came here while on vacation in Chicago, primarily for the exhibition of "Impressionism, Fashion and Modernity." Loved the exhibit, it was truly breathtaking and my overall experience at the institute. The miniature room exhibit is also fantastic. Next time I'm in Chicago I'm definitely coming back to see more!
