Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////In all we ordered the braised short ribs with mash, shrimp, roasted chicken empanadas, artichoke spread, garlic potato salad and calamari. There was not one dish presented that didn't go back as an empty plate. For desert we had the tres leches cake and that was delightful too.
