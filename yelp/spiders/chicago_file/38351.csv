Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As for the food...for starters we got the salmon tartare and beef tongue. They also bring out a sourdough bread with butter which was very good...one of the best bread courses I've had in awhile. We had to ask 3 times for a second serving. It finally came out during our entree course. That's not acceptable for an upscale steakhouse.
