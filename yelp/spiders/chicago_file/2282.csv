The Purple Pig////The Purple Pig is located on the Magnificent Mile, slightly tucked in from the street. They serve tapas that were mainly delicious. My favorite was a broccoli dish. My critiques are that the turkey leg was a bit salty and the octopus wasn't seasoned enough for the thicker chunks. The restaurant has a shared table concept and can get quite noisy and crowded inside. You will normally have to wait for seating. I would probably return if I have friends visiting the city.
