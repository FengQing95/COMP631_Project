Little Goat Diner////Been there a few times back in 2013, during that time that I was building a former (Bar Mas).....Resently went up there for lunch and ordered a Burger, oh boy that was one yummmy burger. Hip place, kind of on the cute side...like the open kitchen concept....with sitting in front of it. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone, actually been to Goat and a Girl, and Little Goat was my favorite from the two... :)
