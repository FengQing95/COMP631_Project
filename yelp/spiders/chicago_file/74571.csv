Little Goat Diner////If we were talking about ourselves in terms of Little Goat or G&G, I'd definitely be more of a Little Goat kind of a girl. You're more likely to find me in a diner or hole in the wall than in a fancy schmancy restaurant of any sort. Not only can I admit that, I am definitely okay with it. I guess that's why I LOVED Little Goat so much. It's a fresh take on a diner. It's different and new but it's not pretentious.
