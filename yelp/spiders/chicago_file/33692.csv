Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Another thing this place is good at is ambiance - the same dark and glimmering deal as Gilt Bar. That dim lighting which makes it difficult to recognize anyone you might know/acceptable to completely ignore them, accompanied by a noise level which somehow drowns out any individual sound and creates a delightfully warm whirrrrrrring. I haven't found anywhere that strikes this strange balance quite like a Brendan Sodikoff establishment.
