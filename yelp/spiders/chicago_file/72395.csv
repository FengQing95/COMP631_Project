Little Goat Diner////Came for breakfast and left very full and content. I had the shrimp and grits and don't think I've ever finished an entree faster. The grits were as cheesy as advertised and the sauce was delicious. It didn't feel heavy or too rich and was one of the best bowls of shrimp and grits I've ever had. My husband had the everything is everything crumpets which was equally delicious. The dish was an imaginative play on bagels and lox and succeeded with each of its components. A win all around!
