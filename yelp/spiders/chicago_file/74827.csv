Little Goat Diner////I LOVED the corned beef hash. It was amazing! Their hash browns are tiny round strings that are cooked perfectly crisp with onions in them. The corned beef was sliced perfectly, given out liberally and the perfect amount of salt to compliment the salt less hash browns without adding any. I ordered the eggs poached. It was heavenly. I had the pork and toffee milk shake and that was awesome!
