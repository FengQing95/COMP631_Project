Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a great tapas experience!  I went with my wife right after Christmas and we are already making return plans.  Make a reservation as it does seem quite popular.  The service and seating was friendly and the bar has some good wine and drinks while you wait.  Server made good recommendations upon our request and we were pleasantly surprised with the taste of everything we ordered.   The goat cheese in tomato sauce may have been my favorite but the potato aioli was also a top fav.  If you do not prefer sharing get paiya... Dp?  Prices are actually really good for a Chicago restaurant.  Good atmosphere and great for a date night!
