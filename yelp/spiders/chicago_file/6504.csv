The Purple Pig////For dessert, most of my crew went for an affogatto. But that's not my style. I tried their bread pudding with Tres leches ice cream. Man did it deliver! The ice cream was creamy and not overly sweet. But the bread pudding was just about the most moist I've ever had and was perfectly sweet and delicious! I wish I could have more right now!
