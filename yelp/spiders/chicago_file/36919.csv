Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So, I loved the drink, I was comfy and smiley, the food was very good, so why only 3 stars you ask?  (If you didn't ask you should still keep reading)  The service was not great.  It was not overtly bad, but we left fairly cranky about a few things considering the amount of the bill.  First, one of the martini glasses was chipped, normally not a big deal but this was "I'll cut you!" chipped.  The server apologized and got a new glass.  Not a huge deal.  Then there was the severely undercooked steak.  The server did notice it was not cooked as ordered and apologized but at least half of it couldn't be eaten as it was.  Again, on it's own not a *huge* deal, but a restaurant on this level should get this right, that's why we're here.  We asked for a dessert menu and would've ordered something but it took the server about 15 minutes to come back and ask if we wanted anything.  At that point we just wanted to leave.
