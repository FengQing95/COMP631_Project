Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Oysters were perfect and a great surprise on the menu. The Goat Cheese dip was phenomenal! My Aged Rib Eye was possible the greatest piece of meat I've ever devoured. No lie this was the highlight of my entire trip to Chicago. This steak was just perfect. Wife got the Filet and that was to die for.
