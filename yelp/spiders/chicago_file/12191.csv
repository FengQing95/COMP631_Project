Art Institute of Chicago////I've been to many of the world's best art museums from the Louvre and Musée D'Orsay (still my all time favorite) in Paris to the Uffizi in Florence, the Metropolitan and MoMA in NYC, several in San Francisco, the Warhol, the Picasso, even  Amsterdam (fabulous Van Gogh museum), the National in Taipei and so many more. You would think that with that much cultural stimulation I'd be a lot more refined. But I digress.
