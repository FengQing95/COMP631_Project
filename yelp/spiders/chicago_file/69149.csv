Little Goat Diner////took an uber to au cheval based on thrillist's recommendation. we arrived for lunch and it was a 1 hour wait so we decided to pick a place on the same block instead. blindly, we walked into little goat which was not nearly as busy as au. we were drawn to the hip, yet simple decor immediately. the menu was large- serving breakfast and dinner all day. we opted for cheeseburgers, the all american. they were large and in charge. melt in your mouth beef, a soft sesame seed bun and added thick cut bacon. why were more people not here?! guys- you don't need thrillist to recommend this. just go in and give it a shot!
