Little Goat Diner////The Los Drowned was amazeballs- melt in your mouth beef brisket. It was so much food that we couldn't finish, but what I do remember was their grilled cheese was literally, the best I've ever had. Oooey and gooey and grilled to perfection. With like two kinds of cheese, I can't wait to have that again...
