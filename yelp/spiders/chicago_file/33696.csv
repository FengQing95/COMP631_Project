Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Excellent. Went here on a Friday evening after some drinks with a group of 6. The atmosphere was very laid back, drinks were great, and with food this delicious, family style was the way to go. We tried everything recommended and everything that came to the table was cooked to perfection.
