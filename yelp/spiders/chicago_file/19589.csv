Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is the only location I've been to.  We've been here to eat in and buy frozen pizzas to take home many times.  Lou Malnati's is my FAVORITE deep dish in the world.  There are other good deep dish places, but this is my favorite.  I love their thin crust but there's a couple others I like a little more.  My only complaint is that their frozen pizzas are too small.  It would be nice if they sold a large size like Gino's East does.  Their crust is excellent, cheese is of great quality as are the meats.  Sauce is tangy and chunky, just overall really good.  If you have just one chance to eat Chicago pizza give them a try.
