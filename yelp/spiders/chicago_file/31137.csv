Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were in a time crunch to make our 7PM jazz performance. Our choice was wait 55 minutes for a table or get a take out pizza in 40 minutes. We got the small Malnati Chicago Classic $16.25 to go. Waited at the bar and scarfed our pizza as we walked the 4 blocks to the jazz venue. I'll just say that this was an awesome pizza and it changed my opinion about Chicago pizza. Crust, meat, cheese, tomatoes... it all worked well together. I still like thin crust pizza better but if you are in Chicago, you must eat here. Check it out.
