The Purple Pig////So I frequent Chicago for work. This time around I decided to stay by the river at the Sheraton. I got to the hotel and do what I typically do when I travel. Got on yelp. I look at the restaurants near me and saw 5 thousand reviews! I was stuck on getting my typical Chicago deep dish but I couldn't pass up 5K reviews? So I went. Oh. My. Gosh.
