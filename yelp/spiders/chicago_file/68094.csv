Little Goat Diner////Like many Chicago restaurants, there is a massive dearth of vegetarian dishes.  For breakfasty foods, that seems ridiculous.  I got a kimchee breakfasty dish thing, which was really pretty boring, considering the ingredients.  It also took a really long time.  My partner got the tofu griddle, which was omg bland.
