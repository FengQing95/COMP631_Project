Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So for the pizza..since this is our first ever chicago pizza, we cannot really compare it to anything else. Well..up in San Francisco Bay Area in Petaluma, there is Old Chicago Pizza Co that has chicago Style. We LOVED that pizza..it was made in same style with sauce on top, but the thick  crust had cheese tucked in it and the cheese was oozy and stringy...yum!  So for Lou's...the toppings were quite..hmm..solid? The cheese was not gooey at all. It wasn't bad..just not what I am used to. It was tasty enough..but was surprised the ingredients were more "compressed".
