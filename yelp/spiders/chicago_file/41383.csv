Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First timer here with a few third and fourth timers. It has to say something about this place if my friends are and family keep returning. The food is very good and service compliments the food. Couldn't say much about the servings, but you could consider them appetizer size. I recommend to try the paella, its Spanish rich with meat and some veggies or seafood and veggies. Check out the menu on their site and I definitely recommend making a reservation(they get busy on weekends).
