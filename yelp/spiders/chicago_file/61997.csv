Smoque BBQ////They also have pretty tasty sides. I'll start with their 'slaw. If you order a plate or sandwich, the 'slaw comes with it. Personally I think creamy 'slaws are disgusting, and until I went to Smoque I thought "creamy" was the only type of 'slaw out there. Smoque's 'slaw is vinegar based and is pretty damn amazing. Whenever I go, I get a large container to go, to have as a side with my lunches. Their beans, mac n'cheese and fries are all must tries as well. I'm not a fan off their cornbread, but I know some that are; and from what I hear their peach cobbler is pretty damn tasty as well. I've never had it, because by the time "dessert" enters my mind, I am stuffed!
