Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went on a Wednesday afternoon. Â Ordered soup di giorno and the Chicago classic personal pizza. Man the crust was crispy yet not dry and the mozzarella was perfect. The Italian sausage, tomato sauce and mozzarella all came together nicely. I really like how the mozzarella was stuck to the crust.
