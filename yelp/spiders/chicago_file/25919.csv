Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The guide on a boat tour said this place was his favorite. My companions wanted to try Chicago pizza. So, we headed over. We were given a 25 minute wait, which was to be expected. They tell you to order your pizza ahead of time. My co-diners ordered. I didn't want pizza and was told to order when we sat down.
