Little Goat Diner////After trying The Girl and the Goat, we had to try Little Goat.  They had been rated in the top 5 for nachos and did not disappoint.  The cheese, pork, and other toppings were amazing. First time I've ever had nachos where we did not have enough chips because the topping portions were huge. We also tasted the sloppey joe, shrimp and grits, and This Little Piggy Went to China.  Wow.  Such fresh flavors coming thru on everything. Definitely worth waiting for. After topping it all off with a milkshake, couldn't have asked for a better meal at such a bargain price.  My only recommendation would be to turn up the heat. While realizing the wait staff is probably hot from running around, it was very cold.
