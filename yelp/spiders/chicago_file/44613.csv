Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The timing was right, we didnt wait too long and everything didnt bombard us all at once.  The portions did their job for a party of two. And we got a nice variety (including dessert).  I wish I could eat in tapas style at every meal (so I wouldn't stuff my face like I tend to do!!!)
