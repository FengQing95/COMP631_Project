Smoque BBQ////And... that's where I feel Smoque falls short. Where are their sauce choices?! One of my favorite aspects of barbeque is trying all of the different sauce options, from smoky to spicy to vinegar-based. Smoque's spicy sauce was yummy, but it didn't really entertain my fire-loving tastebuds. I just like variety... is that so wrong? But I'll get over it.
