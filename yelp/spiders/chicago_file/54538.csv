Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food is excellent and the portions are decent sized so that 2-4 per person and you're set. Some of the dishes don't really lend themselves to being shared easily. I wish they would indicate that on the menu somewhere unless they enjoy watching people struggle to split a poached egg as it explodes.
