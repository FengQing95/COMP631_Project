Little Goat Diner////Went a few months ago but just posting the review now. Their goat chili is the best ever. Got the kimchi burger and wife got the breakfast spaghetti. Both were just ok and I think there were just too many flavors competing with each other in the dishes. Their bloody mary is one of the best in the city.
