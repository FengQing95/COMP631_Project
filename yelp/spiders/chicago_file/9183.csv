Art Institute of Chicago////This is where that giant post-impressionist painting "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte" by Seurat is, made of small, complementary-colored dots, which I remember learning in my elementary school art program. Â As hyped as it is, it IS super amazing in person.
