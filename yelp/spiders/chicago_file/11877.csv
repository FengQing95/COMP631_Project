Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago is one of the best museums around! I could probably spend all day here, there is just that much to see. However, my kids can only tolerate walking around for a couple hours so I had to only see the things that were interesting to them today. We checked out the Thorne miniature room exhibit which was spectacular! It is a wonderful collection of miniature room settings from all different parts of the world. There is so much detail in each and every one.
