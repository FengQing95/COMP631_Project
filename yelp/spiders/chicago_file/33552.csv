Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Once you open the door, you feel like if a time machine transported you into a romantic, yet classy 1940s french restaurant, big beautiful chandeliers and dim lights. We were seated in a cozy booth with leather chairs. Even though people were dressed nicely the ambiance was casual and relaxing. Our waiter was really nice and was paying attention to every detail on the table. My hubby and I shared their aged ribeye (22 ounces), what a SUPERB sear it had my God!, so juicy and flavorful, it was the best piece of steak we have ever had!. We asked for three sides (they are charged separately), french fries (fancy name: pomme frites) that come with a garlic aioli that it was to die for, cole slaw (a little bit sweet and creamy with a champagne vinaigrette) and the last one was Elote style corn (it had an orange color because of the chile (mild spicy) also a little bit creamy with some lemon and parmesan cheese on it. We loved everything.
