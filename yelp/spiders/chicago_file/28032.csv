Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Original Lou pizza was fairly tasty with italian sausage and extra cheese. It was a busy afternoon on a wednesday, and were told that if we preorder our pizza, it would come out earlier. We preordered our personal pizzas and then were sat down 10 minutes thereafter. The pizza didn't come out until 45 minutes later. The pizza and service was pleasant however the pizza just took longer than what was told to us.
