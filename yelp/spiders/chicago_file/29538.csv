Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've been here twice so far, both times during the week. Both times there was a 30-40 minute wait so be prepared. Don't leave because of the wait though because they allow you to order your deep dish when you check in. It takes 45-60 minutes to cook, so the wait is almost irrelevant. Would you rather sit down and wait an hour for your pizza or walk around outside and get called in and have a pizza served almost immediately?
