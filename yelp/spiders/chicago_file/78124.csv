Little Goat Diner////Highly recommend this place for first timers in Chicago! My cousin took me here and according to her we took dark chocolate chip pancakes, loved them so much the crunch and the perfect softness and lightness of the pancakes. So good Â Other than the pancakes we also tried out the what about kebab, so we had a savoury dish with out pancakes. Also amazing the pita bread so soft, the tahini for dipping the kebabs was a great amount and the quinoa salad with it was so delicious. The dish came together as so lovely, recommend both dishes and for drinks we had hot chocolate and green tea! Love this dinner, will come back in the future !
