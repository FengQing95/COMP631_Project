Smoque BBQ////This was some of the best BBQ I've had.  I'm not expert, but it's second only to Pecan Lodge in Dallas.  I got a half a rack of St. Louis ribs with coleslaw, brisket chili, and fries.  The ribs had a great char, but the Memphis barbecue sauce on top made it incredible.  The coleslaw was fine, but obviously not why I was there.  The brisket chili was pretty good, definitely a Texas style chili.  It had good flavor and a little spice.  The fries were solid, nice and crispy but not greasy.  I'd recommend going with the baked beans (I had a spoonful of my friend's).  I also had the peach cobbler and it was great.  I would recommend it if somehow you have room for it after everything else.
