Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I elected to give this another shot on Valentine's Day of all days. Our reservation was in the charming basement that resembled a speakeasy with a whiskey list to match. My girlfriend cannot have gluten in her meals so I asked for cut vegetables with the appetizers. The chef advised our waiter that this was not possible. Don't Â expect anyone to go above and beyond for your dietary needs regardless of the price you are willing to pay.
