Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When it comes to deep dish pizza you can do better. When it comes to pizza in general you can do way better. When it comes to...ok you get it. This place does the job if you're in Lincoln square area and can't leave and want deep dish. I have no major complaints about cleanliness, staff or environment (they bumped it up from 0 to 2 stars) but the food is just meh.
