Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For a first timer in Chicago, hearing so many people rave about this place.. I'm not gonna lie. I was very disappointed. It may be the location, but thinking the one that has the most review should be the best out of what, 13 locations.. We ordered the Chicago Classic, we are guessing that they probably just used a half baked one and popped it in the oven or whatever.. Pizza was cold, cheese was not gooey just hard, crust was stale.. I couldn't even finish one slice. Jason, our server, didn't really like his service.. I ordered a Coke and two water. My coke was never brought out.. Just the way he cut our pizza, I really didn't like it.. He didn't even check up on, Â us, not even once.. Just a horrible experience. I thought I can end my vacation on a good note with really good deep dish pizza. Sorry Lou Malnati's, you're not authentic Chicago pizza and just hyped.
