Art Institute of Chicago////What can I say that hasn't been said already?  The building is beautiful - the grounds and setting are stunning - the staff and docents are friendly - and the artwork is world renowned.  Of course, there are the famous pieces, like Seurat's "Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte" and Chagall's "America Window", that stunning stained glass piece.  But, the museum offered some fun guides that spiced up our experience.  We followed the "Rock 'n Roll Lifestyle" tour as we meandered through the museum - seeking out the highlighted artworks for their no-holds-barred lust for life.  A great way to interest a museum companion that may not have your attention span for hours spent soaking in the art.  It also kept us going a little longer, as we followed our hunt to the last painting.  If I lived in Chicago, I'd be a member and know every piece in their collection.
