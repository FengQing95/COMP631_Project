Little Goat Diner////Now I've had a full pound burger patty at other restaurants before but I think collectively all the meats in this thing outweighs it. The base was a goat burger patty with cheese on it. Ok, good start. Then throw on some braised beef. Then pile on a huge mound of pulled pork. And then just top it off with some jumbo onion rings. Just ridiculous. I can't even really pinpoint each ingredient individually. It was dark, I was drunk, and there was just a pile of meat in front of me. All I know is every bite of that sandwich was tender, juicy and delicious.
