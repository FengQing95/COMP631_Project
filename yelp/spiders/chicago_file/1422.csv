Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Such a lovely brunch restaurant! came during the holiday season during a packed hour and waited about half an hour. The portions here are very large, so be ready to come hungry and leave very very happy and full!!! I had the berry bliss french toast and it was very delicious. The drinks are a bit overpriced in my opinion but they are brewed from intelligentsia, so I guess they are worth it. Overall I loved it and would come again if I were to visit Chicago again.
