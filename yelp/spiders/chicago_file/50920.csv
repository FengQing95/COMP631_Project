Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our food arrives with a decent amount of time in between each one except for the spicy potatoes which are my favorite! We were almost done with the last 2 dishes when it finally did arrive and that was the last dish we were working on. I like to have switch between dishes when I eat here so that was a bummer. After a couple potatoes, i actually got tired of it.
