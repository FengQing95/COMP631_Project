Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a born and raised Chicagoan, lou's has been a staple deep dish spot. I usually have the takeout version, but this was my first time trying out this specific location. The whole experience was a little frustrating as I had called ahead to put my group's name down on the waitlist and showed up only to not have my name taken down. So our wait time was extended to about an hour. We took the restaurant's advice by ordering our pizza before being seated, but even then, we waited 45 min for our pizzas to come out. We ordered two smalls- the classic and the lou. This was the perfect portion for four of us to share and be full. The deep dish pizza from lou's is a chicago must, but this specific location may not be..
