The Purple Pig////My party of two ordered the smashed potatoes, octopus a la plancha and the Turkey leg confit. Please note the plates are meant to be shared and OMG it was more than enough food. Let's just say each plate just got better as they came. It was as if my friend and I were making music with our yums and oh's and ah's and wow's of how delicious everything was. Â Minimal talking was had as we were too busy stuffing our faces with such deliciousness!
