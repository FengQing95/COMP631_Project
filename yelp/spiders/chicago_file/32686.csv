Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////AMAZING! This was our second visit. We arrived a bit early but were seated right away, which was a pleasant surprise. Our server Brandon was the perfect amount of attentive. Started with the baked goat cheese - yum - and the crab stuffed avocado salad. Â It's probably the best salad I've ever had. The sour dough bread was delicious. I had to ask that it be taken away so I'd stop eating it - I needed some room for steak! I had the Chicago cut, and my husband had the dry aged bone-in ribeye, which were both tasty and cooked perfectly. Naturally, I only ate half of mine, but the leftovers made for some nice steak sandwiches for lunch the next day! We had a side of elote style corn, which we loved. Also ordered the truffle Mac and cheese but ended up asking them not to bring it out because we were so full. They obliged with no problem and didn't charge us for it. Classic eyes are bigger than your stomach, there! We didn't get dessert because we were stuffed, but the table next to us had the chocolate pie, and it looked so good! We'll certainly be back!
