Little Goat Diner////Seems like this is one of the go-to brunch places in Chicago, so as a tourist this weekend, you already know I had to go! We came on a Saturday for lunch and thank goodness we made a reservation -- people were coming in and leaving after hearing that the wait would be "45 to an hour."
