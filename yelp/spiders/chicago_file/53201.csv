Smoque BBQ////A little while back I was researching BBQ joints in the city when I came across Smoque.  It had a ton of great reviews and had been featured on Guy Fieri's "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives".  (You can see the segment here.)  It looked pretty darn good so I thought I should probably give it a go.
