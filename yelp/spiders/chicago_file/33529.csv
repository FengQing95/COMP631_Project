Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What was especially disappointing tonight was the service. Our server, while friendly, struggled to describe menu items we asked him about. Even worse was when we attempted to ask about wine. He was not knowledgeable at all and when you're paying top dollar for food and ready to buy a nice bottle of wine, you want to feel like your server has a clue about the wines on the list. Not so. We awkwardly had to ask for him to get someone else who might know the list better to come over because all this guy could tell us about 3 different wines from 3 different regions was that they were all "great" and had "dark fruit." Uhhhhh, thanks. I knew more about wine than this guy; my dad, who is a negotiant, knew more about wine than this guy. Train your servers, Bavette's. The manager who came over was marginally more knowledgeable, but still seemed not confident. Personally, I think if you have $600 bottles of wine on your list, you should have a som on the floor who knows their shit. Seems like a no-brainer.
