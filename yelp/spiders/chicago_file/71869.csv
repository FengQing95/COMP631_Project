Little Goat Diner////Hands down best pancakes ever! The sourdough pancakes were terrific and fluffy. House-made sausage was also great. As extra torture to my diet we order the pork belly home fries. I could not eat it all. Coffee was a little bitter but paired well with our meal. Service was somewhat slow to start but food came out timely and hot. My friend was not a fan of their corned beef and hash but it looked good.
