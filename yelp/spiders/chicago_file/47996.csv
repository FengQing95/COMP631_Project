Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Third round was dessert: caramel almond bar with a butter crust, and the butterscotch pot de creme. Heaven in my mouth. I had to take a few bites despite the fact that I am allergic to dairy, and it was worth the digestive counterattack. That butterscotch pot de creme was topped with a thin layer of a salted caramel sauce which complemented it perfectly. The best way to eat the caramel almond bar was to take a bit and chew it slowly while it melted in your mouth. Then all the flavors really popped out before you swallowed it. Also, the two dessert plates were free because we checked in here on yelp! Totally worth it.
