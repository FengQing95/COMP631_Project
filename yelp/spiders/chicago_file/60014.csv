Smoque BBQ////I didn't know what to expect of Smoque. My friend had seen them featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives : Guy Fieri : Food Network. My friend said Guy has not steered her wrong yet and he didn't! It was the so damn good I ordered food to go. The place was packed and yes we had to stand in a long line and endure communal seating (which I cant stand) but it was ALL WORTH IT!!! The brisket was so tender it just fell apart, the Mac and Cheese was so sinful, BBQ Beans were delightful, and the cole slaw...OMG i hate cole slaw but I would go here just to have the cole slaw. Peach Cobbler that would make you slap yo momma it was so good!
