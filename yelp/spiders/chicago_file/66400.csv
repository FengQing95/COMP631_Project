Little Goat Diner////I love this place.  They have my favorite salad in Chicago - the kale and chickpea salad.  It's so much more than what it sounds like from the description.  The "chickpeas" are actually in the form of round chickpea fritters that come with their own tsaziki sauce in addition to the dressing.  So good.  I also love the banana chocolate mini-pie they make.  Yum!
