Little Goat Diner////We arrived at 7PM on a Wednesday and miraculously did not have to wait for a table. We were immediately taken by the charming ambiance and interior design of the restaurant. After extensive deliberation, we ordered the goat chili cheese fries, okonomiyaki, and pork belly pancake. The food was delicious and the Asian food elements satisfied my Asian food cravings in the best diner-style way. The dishes were all very well rounded and blended the different savory, sweet, sour flavors together beautifully.
