Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The deep dish pizza I had was undercooked.  The dough was a tad raw for my taste.  What was cooked was delicious.  For the wait, I'd skip it all together. Their waiting list is a horrible mess.  They claimed to have called me several times.  I was inside and listened carefully.
