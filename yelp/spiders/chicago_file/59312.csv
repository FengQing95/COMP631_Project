Smoque BBQ////The brisket gets five stars and is worth waiting a half hour in line for.  The sides are kind of overpriced for the portion size, but decent.  The place is small so there is not enough room for everyone to eat in, but if there's enough people working then a person will survey the line and try to make sure everyone gets a place to sit by the time they get their food.
