Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I ordered a mozzarella cheese omelette with hash-browns and a side of pancakes. My omelette was very good, the eggs were very fluffy and airy, not your regular fold over omelette. Hash-browns were normal. And the pancakes were very good. I had to get them on the side to try them! The man next to me had the pancakes with fresh berries on top and it looked outstanding.
