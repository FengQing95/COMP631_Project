The Purple Pig////During our trip to Chicago, my husband and I wanted to dine at a restaurant that offered a unique dining experience.  Well, we couldn't happier than our experience at the purple pig.  Their tapas style menu allows room to select and enjoy a good sampling of what they have to offer.  The dishes were absolutely delicious.  Visually stunning and not a single thing we ate was disappointing.  Service was excellent but my only qualm is the seating arrangement in the outside patio area.  The large table and placement of the chairs made me and other guests uncomfortable.  I think there should be a more well thought out seating.  Other than that, it was a lovely evening.
