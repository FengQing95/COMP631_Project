The Purple Pig////The food here was really amazing and is deserving of a 5 star rating. The antipasti we ordered, Broccoli with Roasted Garlic, Toasted Breadcrumbs, and Anchovy Vinaigrette, was the best broccoli I've ever had in my life. We also had the Fava Bean Smear, Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Picked Cherry Peppers, and Fried Egg (amazing, esp when the yolk broke), and the lamb with couscous and pomegranate (flavors were too intense but good nonetheless). After trying the food here, I questioned why Purple Pig only had 4 stars.
