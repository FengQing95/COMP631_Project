Little Goat Diner////Great spot to go for a more week night dinner date. We both really enjoyed our cocktails and our sandwiches were delicious too. We didn't go for any of the more out there menu items and our waitress did a great job pointing us in right direction. Probably won't come back, but it was fun to try!
