Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Had a Lettuce Entertain You gift card. Decided to use it by coming here for happy hour. Ordered a pitcher of sangria and a few tapas dishes. The sangria tasted watered down. Honestly we make better sangria at home. The tapas dishes were generic and mediocre. While they weren't bad, nothing really stood out. Most items were very greasy and over salted. Service was decent. Food came out super fast. Don't get why so many people come here. Personally, I would not come back here again.
