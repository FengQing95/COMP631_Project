Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Because it seemed like one of the most authentic pies, I tried The Malnati Chicago Classic. With a menu description of "Made with Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust. It's authentic Chicago!" I felt like that was exactly what I was looking for.
