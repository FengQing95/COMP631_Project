Smoque BBQ////I visited Smoque after seeing a good review in the Reader, and really liked the barbecue. We had a little bit of everything - St Louis style ribs, briskly, pulled pork , mac & cheese, and BBQ beans. The ribs, brisket and sides were great. Pulled pork, not so much. St louis ribs were meaty, not fatty but not too dry. The BBQ beans were really good, too. A vinegary sauce with just enough spice. The line to order snakes into the middle of the room, and seating is basically family- style. I'll definitely be back.
