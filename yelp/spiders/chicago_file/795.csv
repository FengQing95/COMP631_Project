Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Awesome food, but the wait is treacherous (we waited an hour and a half to be seated). Huge heaping portions - skillets are to die for. Service is fairly decent, except when they're busy they're in a hurry to get you out of there (they tried taking our plates twice while we were still eating - literally 'eating'). Fair prices, so if you have an appetite, time to kill and don't mind being cattle herded before you've put your fork down, this is a sure bet!
