Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This tourist attraction is mostly for tourist most Chicagoans pass on a slice of pizza that's so filling they don't need to eat for a full day. Trust me, if people in Chicago regularly ate Lou Malnatis Chicago style pizza there wouldn't be anyone here. Jam packed with carbs, fat, sugar that you can't taste and calories this delicious treat is not designed for regular consumption.
