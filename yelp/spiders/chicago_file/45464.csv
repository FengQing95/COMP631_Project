Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Best Tapas restaurant you can ever possibly go to. The workers are super friendly and are great at recommendations of foods. The portions are great for a couple or a big party. The environment is extremely calm and friendly. I enjoy it. Sangrias are amazing and so is the food. You'll keep going back. Believe it.
