Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I like and don't like the fact that the food comes out at different times. I like it because then the tables around you don't judge you for how much food you get, and you can work on things slowly and savor your food. I don't like it because of how awkward it is when one person has food and another doesn't. You can't really have them wait otherwise the food will get cold (or you can do what I did and just eat half of your boyfriend's order).
