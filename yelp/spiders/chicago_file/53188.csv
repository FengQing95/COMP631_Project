Smoque BBQ////Best BBQ I've had in Chicago. Had the sliced beef brisket and a link of the Texas sausage. As great as the brisket was, the sausage was perhaps even better. I also tried a taste of the St. Louis ribs from a friend's plate, and it was phenomenal, with a great rub and sauce, and the meat slid right off the bone. The BBQ beans were an excellent side choice, as was the mac & cheese. The cole slaw was not to my liking, as I prefer a creamier base; theirs is in a vinegar base. Lines were long, but were worth the wait. Would highly recommend this place, just expect a long wait during peak times.
