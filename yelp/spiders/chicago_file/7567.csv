Art Institute of Chicago////This is my favorite museum in the world, period. Granted, I haven't gone to any museums outside of America. I don't know too much about art but take any layman, anyone, even someone who says they hate art and show them A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. If they aren't impressed, show them Sky Above Clouds IV.
