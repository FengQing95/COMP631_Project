Smoque BBQ////Now I'm a southern boy and know what good BBQ is. And this place is my favorite in the Chicagoland. I found this place several years ago and love it every time I go. Even if there is a long line, I wait. Cause I know what pot of gold I'm receiving at the end of this rainbow and its brisket with a taste of ribs.
