Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started with a wedge, our server informed us that most salads and sides are portioned to share and that was definitely the case. The salad could have served 4 people. It was fresh and well presented, but in the only disappointment of the evening, the dressing had no flavor and made the salad a little boring.
