Art Institute of Chicago////I love lazy days walking around this museum. I get lost everytime. It's so big. Even when crowds are huge, in front of the famous art pieces, it always clears. I even got enganged in front of my favorite Monet painting! The only downside is that sometimes the temporary exhibits are lame.
