Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is my go-to place for tapas in Chicago. Reservations are highly recommended considering how delicious this place is. I honestly crave the goat cheese toast points and their jalapeno shrimp. They have great sangria and paella as well. I have gone here for anything from a family dinner to a date and it's been a good spot for any event. They have a pretty big bar where you can wait for your table and have apps and drinks.
