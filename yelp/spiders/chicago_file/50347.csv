Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ba Ba Reeba is a great restaurant for a group because you can try more varieties of tapas that way! Make a reservation, because there will be a wait. There is a bar inside that is first come first served in case you do have to wait for a table. Some of my favorite menu items include the tortilla, bacon wrapped dates, brussel sprout salad, garlic shrimp (tip: order this then dip your bread in the sauce), patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms... the list could go on. They bring out the food as it is ready, so you might feel overwhelmed with all of the delicious looking plates on your table if you're a slower eater. I usually order a few tapas at a time to pace the meal. They have a gluten free menu and our server was very accommodating in finding dairy and garlic-free options to meet the dietary restrictions of my group. The food takes me back to fond memories of my travels in Spain. If this restaurant isn't on your Chicago Bucket List, add it today!
