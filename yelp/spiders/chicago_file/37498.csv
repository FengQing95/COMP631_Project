Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////All in all, in my personal opinion, this place is pretty memorable for me. I've been lucky to try some really great restaurants around Chicago over the past year or so, and this is one of the few that stand out to me. I highly recommend trying, and I mean trying, to get a reservation here. It'll be worth it.
