Art Institute of Chicago////We get to one painting and I ask my friends ok what do you see.  They said , mountains, landscape, and really boring stuff- I say ok now look at this again , you are missing the point, don't look at it as a landscape it is really impressionistic - it is satire, it is art, look again so now do you see the naked man laying down- he is the whole painting.  And then They just all burst out in recognition.  Anyone in sight distance took off their phones and were just looking and trying to see why I was such a good docent and then they finally got it too after talking to my friends.  Case in pint- it is art to be looked at and connected with not just viewed and forgotten.
