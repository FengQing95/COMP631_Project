Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I like ba-ba-reeba, but it's noisy, overpriced, and crowded.  If you can get past all that, then you'll be just fine.  Love the beef tenderloin with bleu cheese and of course, the famous bacon wrapped dates.  Typical tapas here, like jamon serrano, patatas bravas, etc.  There are some nice things like scallops with raisins and curried chicken salad that are fun to try as well.
