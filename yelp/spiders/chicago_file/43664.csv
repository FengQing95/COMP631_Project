Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////#28 Grilled Asparagus, fried egg, romescu sauce $7 = I am guessing the asparagus was tossed on the grill dry and grilled to dryness & woody.  The egg was just done, very loose (which it's supposed to be so you can mix it up) but again it seemed covered in bland olive oil. The sauce had a reddish/orange color and no flavor.
