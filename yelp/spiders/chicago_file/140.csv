Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Best breakfast I had while staying in Chicago. Actually, probably one of the best breakfast's I've ever had in my life. I ordered the Butcher Block Skillet which came with a side of two pancakes (I got the S'Mores pancakes). The skillet had hash brown, scrambled eggs, bacon, ham, cheese, and sausage. It was out of this world. The pancakes were also delicious and helped put me in a food coma. My girlfriend had their Berry Crepes. I'm not the biggest berry fan but this was something special. Another plus was that the prices were very affordable and you get plenty of food. If your by Millennium Park definitely give Wildberry Cafe a try. It won't disappoint.
