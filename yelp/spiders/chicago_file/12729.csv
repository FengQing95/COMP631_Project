Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////anyway, this pizza tasted like those scones covered in a can of tomato sauce.  the chunks of sausage added some much needed cholesterol and zing.  i must give some credit to the delivery as everything i wanted was there and packaged very efficiently.  they even brought ice cream in it's own separate plastic UFO container for the peach cobbler.
