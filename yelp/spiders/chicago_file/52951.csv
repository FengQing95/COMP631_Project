Smoque BBQ////This place is decent. I ordered brisket with fries and mac n cheese (for my daughter who didn't like the mac n cheese.) Â I also got a side of brisket chili which was a little too salty to me. The flavors are better than your average BBQ joint, but not compelling. The slaw was a little disappointing and the brisket not as flavorful as I had hoped. I prefer Whole Foods' brisket to this one. The service was stellar. There is a somewhat of a wait staff sitting around to answer your questions and do nice things for you. It is clean. I would go back again, but not make a special trip.
