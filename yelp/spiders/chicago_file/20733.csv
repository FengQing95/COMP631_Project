Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////100% the best pizza in Chicago.  Hands down.  I've tried it all and Lou's has the most consistently delicious pizza in the city!  Our favorite combo (if you can handle the heat) is pepperoni & giardiniera peppers!  Their bruchetta and house salads are a great add-on as well!  Enjoy!!
