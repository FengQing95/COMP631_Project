Little Goat Diner////Little goat latte. What they serve is a little on a heavy side with the spice mix but still amazing. On a cold day, creamy goat milk, sweet cream topping and the fragrance of spice take you to another place. Get a goat latte or the little goat latte. Stumptown beans they use are top notch, so any coffee drink should be on par with the Allis or La Colombe. But if you like your black, the latter is my first choice in the immediate area.
