Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Although I am not a huge fan of deep dish in the first place, I liked Lou Malnatis way more than Giordano's. The mozzarella sticks and deep dish veggie pizza were delicious. They had a good selection of craft beer. Just beware it is always VERY crowded with a long wait which can be slightly overwhelming.
