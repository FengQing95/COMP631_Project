Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As for pizza, we ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic and one with anchovies and tomatoes.  Both were delicious.  I don't think you can go wrong with ordering any of the pizzas.  The crust is awesome, the cheese is piled thick, and it just tastes wonderful.  I'm literally drooling as I type.
