Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Was really disappointed with the deep dish pizza here. Not sure if it was overhyped or not, but after trying one it certainly did not live up to the hype. The crust was tasty but thats it. The meat and sauce were all tasteless. We took 2 bites each and threw away the remaining. Maybe it was just an outlier but we were certaintly disappointed coming to Chicago wanting to try their signature pizza.
