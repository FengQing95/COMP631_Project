Smoque BBQ////I've visited this place just once....here's my take.   Pleasant enough place, efficiently run.  Gets crowded but they help you find a seat after you order at the counter.   It seems to be the in place to get BBQ, but I don't see why.   The food is good, but not great; nothing remarkable.  I've had better brisket and ribs at other places around Chicago and in many other cities in the South.  (See the reviews for Tin Top BBQ in Alabama.)
