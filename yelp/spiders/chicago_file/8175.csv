Art Institute of Chicago////I recently went on another Thursday, and OMG THEY ARE FREE ALL THROUGH FEB! Â And the modern art is excellent--I particularly enjoyed the architectural exhibition (so awesome to see what the Tribune Tower could have looked like...woah, red monster!) and plan to head back again.
