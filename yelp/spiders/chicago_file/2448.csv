The Purple Pig////We ordered the roasted bone marrow, octopus, and the tom & Jerry steak. Everyone was so delicious and had so much flavor in them! The steak's portion was huge. 3 people can basically share that plate. I really enjoyed each plate! Service was also good. Everything about this experience was awesome!
