Little Goat Diner////First impressions - your senses are completely overwhelmed when you walk in. This diner is beautiful, and everything smells amazing. The Goat Patty Melt was on point (cheesy + secret sauce + bread and butter pickles). The smoked fries were 5/5 amazing and like nothing I have ever had before. The fried pickles and onion rings were so well seasoned and basically tempura fried - super light and crispy - and came with an awesome ranch and a curry mustard for dipping which was delish.
