Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I really appreciated how quickly all the dishes were served. The menu does give very good suggestions where those in red are their popular dishes and I can see why. My table ordered 2 shrimps because they were that good! The octopus was perfect as well! The paella was the biggest thing we ordered that day! It was a bit crunchy but oh so filling!
