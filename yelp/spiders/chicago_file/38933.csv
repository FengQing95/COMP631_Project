Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Chocolate cream pie / whiskey ice cream - The pie was surprisingly light and the chocolate crust on it was money. Maybe it's because we ate and drink so much, but I think a scoop of plain vanilla ice cream would've been more refreshing after we went beast mode on all that food. Can't really pass up even more whiskey for dessert though.
