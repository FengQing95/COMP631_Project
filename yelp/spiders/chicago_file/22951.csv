Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Solid deep dish. The crust is tender and crunchy, and the sauce is flavorful. There is too much cheese for my liking, so I just don't eat all of it. I think it's a decent place to take visitors to try out deep dish. I've taken friends visiting on 2 separate occasions, and the pizza was enjoyed both times.
