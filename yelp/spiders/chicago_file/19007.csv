Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So much crust and cheese. Not knowing how big the pizzas are, we ordered two of them, one all meat and one all veggie. It was an interesting experience eating a pizza where the crust and cheese are an inch thick each. The all meat one was definitely more overwhelming than the all veggie one. Overall, not a huge fan of Chicago deep dish. Definitely prefer NYC-style pizza where the crust, sauce, and cheese aren't made in a 1:1:1 ratio.
