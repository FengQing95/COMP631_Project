Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chicago is known for their deep dish pizzas, so when I visited, my expectations were pretttty high. Unfortunately, the first place we went to, (which was one of the top places a lot of people recommend), was a bit disappointing to me. But that is besides the point here. Lou Malnati's was the last place we tried, and it turned out to be pretttty good! The crust was perfectly crunchy and ohhh the cheese! Very yummy. The waiter was very kind, which is always a plus. They also have frozen pizzas that you can purchase.
