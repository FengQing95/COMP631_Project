Art Institute of Chicago////The museum itself is huge. In the 3 1/2 hours I spent there I probably only saw about 1/3 of the museum. Unless you literally want to spend 2 whole days here, you need a game plan. There are lots of people around to help guide you as to where things are, and how to get places, etc. Definitely grab a map as soon as you show up! They even have info on the back about all the "must see" items if you only have a limited amount of time there.
