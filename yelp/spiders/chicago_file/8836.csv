Art Institute of Chicago////For anyone visiting Chicago for the first time, I'd put the Art Institute in your top 10 list of things to see.  For anyone from Chicagoland that hasn't been there in a while, I'd suggest you go and fall in love with it again.  Then go enjoy Millenium Park to cap off a perfect day.
