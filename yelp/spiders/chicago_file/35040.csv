Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service was a big problem.  I have dined at Maudes and Au Cheval several times each, and service has always been helpful and attentive.  My friend was told at the bar that she could sit at one of the sofas and a server would come for drink orders.  No one arrived in 15 minutes.  We were seated at the first booth (super chilly there, I might add, as the staff kept propping the door open).  Our server seemed to want to be somewhere else and had plenty of sarcastic remarks. I think he felt he was funny. Super disappointed.  He did not follow up regularly to check on us and took FOREVER taking our dessert order and bringing the check.  The whole meal was over 2 hours!
