Little Goat Diner////I got the pork belly pancake and shared a side of hash browns with my friend. The pork belly was cooked very well and I really liked the bok choy salad and dressing that came with it. I was a little disappointed with the scallion pancake part of it though since it wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping and would usually expect for a scallion pancake. The hashbrowns were very well made with just the right about of crispy and potatoey goodness.
