Little Goat Diner////The menu alone will make you salivate. It's like browsing a fun, gorgeous museum ... and then you get to eat what you see! I highly recommend the Everything is Everything Crumpets -- the crumpets are transporting -- though next time I get them I will ask for the fried egg to be served warm and separately rather than chopped up with the "salad" ingredients. Can also recommend the Parathas Burrito, the Brussels sprouts side (!!), and my friends have raved about their dishes also, including specials. I am not quite as enamored of the cinnamon roll as others are, but the icing is stellar, with a little touch of magic (diagnosis: cream cheese) in it. The place is both cozy and lively with big, sunny South- and West windows. Really good teas and good service. We're working our way around the menu. It will take a while.
