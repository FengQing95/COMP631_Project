Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The verdict is in.  Had the butter thin crust red meat with mushrooms.  I would say it was delicious.  I had 3 slices and all three tastes differently.  The longer the pizza sat the better it tasted.  I would recommend that when your pizza comes let it sit for another 15 minutes and then eat.  I would eat here again.  For me Diorganos is better
