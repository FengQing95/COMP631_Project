Little Goat Diner////This place is absolutely amazing. I dined in with two other friends early Saturday afternoon and it was packed about a 40 minute wait; however, it was well worth it. Very nice updated diner feel, great waitstaff and a vast array of variety on the menu. I tried the Grape Sac Sac (Korean grape drink with actual grape pieces inside), sourdough pancakes...let's pause for this one. I was reluctant to order these but our waitress said otherwise so I took her word for it and tried them. When I tell you these pancakes were THEE ABSOLUTE BEST. They were huge (3 stacks) fluffy but had a sweet cornmeal type of taste and the maple syrup made it even better. Okay back to the rest of my meal so I had two eggs scrambled with cheese and shared an order of hash browns. My friend ordered the cheddar stuffed sausage which she said was delicious, as well as, those epic sourdough pancakes. My other friend got the omelette of the day which was filled with a spring onion cream cheese, pea tendrils, bacon and shallots. It looked good and she confirmed that it was but the smell of the cream cheese through me off so I won't order it.
