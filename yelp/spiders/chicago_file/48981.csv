Smoque BBQ////I'm from Memphis, appreciate great bbq with some pickiness.  Reluctant to give 5 stars to any bbq restaurant, but the best dishes from this restaurant are worth 5 stars and the worst are 4 stars, so I round up.  Not a lot of great bbq in Chicago (I've been to as many as I can), but this is one of my top 3 and worth visiting repeatedly until you find which 5 dishes treat you just right.  Frequently order to cater for meals with friends and family, most people sing praises.  Beef brisket often amazing, sometimes dry and 4 stars.  Love the beans and cornbread.  Slaw is well-balanced, not too risky...good solid choice.  Worth the time and effort, especially with friends to try many different offerings.
