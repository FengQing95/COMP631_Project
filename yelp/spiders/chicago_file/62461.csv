Smoque BBQ////Little story. I went to Nashville for work and flew to Nashville Airport. On the way back home, I almost got a ticket cuz I was almost late, but somehow, once I got checked in 'n' all, I had plenty of time! So, since I didn't eat lunch, I stopped by this random bar that served food (remember, this is in an AIRPORT). I had their pulled pork, and while their BBQ sauce was about on par with Smoque, the pulled pork itself was DELICIOUS! But this is not a review about Airport Bar Food, this is Smoque.
