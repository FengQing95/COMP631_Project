Art Institute of Chicago////The Impressionist Wing here rivals d'Orsay in Paris. Their Monet collection from every period of his life could almost be it's own museum with Renoir close behind. So many classics from all the Impressionist masters are housed here. Then there's the Modern Wing with Warhol, Jackson Pollack, Dali, Picasso. The American Wing houses Early American furniture pieces as well as art and beautiful sculpture with an exceptional Remington collection.
