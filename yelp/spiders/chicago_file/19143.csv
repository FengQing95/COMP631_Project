Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I took an hour and a half detour from my cross country road trip to get some infamous Chicago deep dish and I'm definitely impressed! The crust buttery yet crunchy and the house special was really tasteful in its use of sliced tomatoes in lieu of the tomato sauce. The prices are kind of absurd, however. I wonder if it's strictly their reputation that justifies a 25 dollar large pizza.
