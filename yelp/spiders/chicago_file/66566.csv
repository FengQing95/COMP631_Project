Little Goat Diner////Visited this restaurant for breakfast this past Sunday morning. The wait was longer than my hungover body/mind desired; however, once 40 minutes expired I was rewarded with the best corned beef hash and eggs that I have ever had!!! My friend ordered an omelette and declared that this was the best breakfast of our 5 day trip to the Midwest. Our server was well versed on which menu options are gluten free or can be altered to become gluten free. Good strong coffee was poured and the attentive staff made sure my mug never got below half full. I will definitely go back on my next visit to Chicago.
