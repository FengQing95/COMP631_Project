Art Institute of Chicago////Disclaimer, although I appreciate art from antiquities, I trend toward the beginning of the modern movement (I just don't get excited about most pieces prior to the Belle Epoque), so most of my review is based on the time I spent in these galleries. That said, I was delighted to find myself in hallways lined with Degas, rooms dedicated to Toulouse-Lautrec, suites filled with Monet/Renoir/Van Gogh (all of your ART/101 studies will come back to you as you are guaranteed to recognize numerous iconic pieces from these artists along these walls), and, for other Ferris Bueller fans, Seurat. Although I stated I don't normally get excited for ancient artifacts, I loved the layout, variety, and quantity of Eastern religious iconic art.
