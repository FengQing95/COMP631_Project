Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I wasn't overly impressed with this place, but it was okay.  I tried the minestrone soup (below average), calamari (below average), cheese bread (fantastic), and personal deep-dish pizza with butter crust (average).  Between my husband and I, we also sampled 6 of the desserts on the trio platters (all average).  The best thing there was definitely the cheese bread :)!
