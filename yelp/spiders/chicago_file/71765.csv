Little Goat Diner////Nothing amazing. Diner food. I had heard their sister restaurant Girl and the Goat was amazing but we couldn't get a table so wandered across the street here for dinner. My husband and I both started with the crab dip which was more cream cheese than crab. We then ordered sandwiches which were also underwhelming. Meh, don't think I would come back. Service was also extremely slow.
