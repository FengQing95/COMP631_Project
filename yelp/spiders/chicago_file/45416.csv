Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////With as many reviews as this place has, there is not much to add.  I have been going here more than 20 years since they first opened in the 80's.  I don't go often anymore, there are now many more tapas places to choose from.  But it was the first one I knew of in Chicago, although i was probably going here fifteen years before I realized it was a lettuce entertain you restaurant.
