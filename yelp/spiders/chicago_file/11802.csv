Art Institute of Chicago////Wow this was the best part about a recent trip to Chicago. We spent about 3 hours here on a Saturday afternoon. After a quick lunch at Brightwok we got in line to get tickets - there was a bit of a queue but it moved fast - maybe about 20 mins to get tickets . We checked in backpack and jacket for $1 each (paid by card).
