The Purple Pig////Once in awhile you find food nirvana. This place was recommended by a foodie friend and I only wish I'd come here with more people because I wanted to try everything! Â To make matters worse, I sat at the pass bar and watched, in wonder at the symphony of movement and timing as five quick as lightning staff members, under the baton of the lead, moved deftly to compose each plate. One seasoning, handing it off to the grilled, another checking each bone of marrow, as another painted flavor and color across a plate. A final inspection by the lead just as a server swept by to take it to an eagerly awaiting patron. Each dish, more tempting than the last. Each person, more impressive in organization, skill and presentation. I highly recommend. Bring friends, order everything, and enjoy!
