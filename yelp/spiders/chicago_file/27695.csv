Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went here for deep dish pizza. Be prepared for a 45 minute wait when it is not even busy. Â This was listed as a great place but I didn't think it was that good. The sauce needed more flavor, was very plain tomato - needed some garlic and or oregano- and the tomatoes needed to be chopped more. One of the kids pulled off a chunk of tomato the size of a ping pong ball. We liked Giordanos better.
