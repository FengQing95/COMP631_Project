Art Institute of Chicago////This was my first time in the city, and I was accompanied by a friend who goes to UChicago. He got in for free, while I managed to get $2 off as a student. The impressionism gallery alone made this one of the best museums I have visited in my life. It seemed like every other painting was by Monet. The architecture of new Modern Wing (opened in 2009) was worth admiring alone, never mind Picasso's The Old Guitarist. We were fortunate enough to catch the Roy Lichtenstein special exhibition, which really showcased how diverse he was as an artist beyond his famous comic panels. We easily spent a good 2.5 hours there in the morning, but came back for more after lunch; admission grants you all day entry. Be sure to also visit the Thorne Miniature Rooms, painstakingly constructed models of home interiors from all around the world.
