Little Goat Diner////Now, let's talk food.  I've been here a couple of times now, and will be a fan of the hot crab dip forever.  It's creamy and cheesy and salty and delicious.  The first time I went, I had the veggie burger (patty melt style) which wasn't good.  I'm sorry to say it, but it was almost flat out disgusting.  Fortunately, the person I was there with ordered the fish tostadas, which were great.  The fries are skinny and yummy (although I'm sure they don't make you skinny).  Best part of the meal?  The choco taco dessert.  Ridiculously amazing.
