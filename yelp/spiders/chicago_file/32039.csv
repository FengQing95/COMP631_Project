Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////THE PLACE: I went to two locations in the Chicago loop area. Both locations were clean and have a very cozy, welcoming environment. At one of the restaurants, we sat in and our waiter was so helpful and sweet. At the other location, we went only for pick up and our pizza's were ready at the estimated time with no problems at all.
