Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Been here two times now, and both times first-rate tapas. And some really lovely sangrias. The bacon wrapped dates taste almost like breakfast (sweet, salty and so nice); also they had hot cheese things that were breaded and oozy good. The fried calamari was nice and grease-less.  And the potatoes bravas are slammin'.  But the shrimp in garlic and olive oil is my favorite. I wanted to fill up a bathtub and set it in front of the TV so I could eat and watch Law and Order!
