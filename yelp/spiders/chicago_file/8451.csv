Art Institute of Chicago////The building itself is a work of art.  In my opinion the building design has an elegant modesty about it.  With its innovative sun shade system that allows gentle sunlight from the north, yet shields work from the harsh southern sun light, this canopy or "flying carpet" as it is called uses an estimated 50% less energy for light and heat than the existing portions of The Art Institute.  There are 3 levels to the new wing and each floor can provide full-length striking views of Millennium Park and the city beyond.
