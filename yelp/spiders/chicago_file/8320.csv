Art Institute of Chicago////There's so much more to this place than just the big important works ("American Gothic", "Sunday Afternoon at La Grand Jete", etc...) there are cool stories even in how the rooms are laid out. Hell, there's one room in there that is completely dedicated to the subjucation of women in art - and you'd never ever notice it unless someone made a point to mention it to you.
