Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For four people, we ordered 8 tapas and 2 servings of paella. It was the perfect amount of food, and we all left stuffed (after making our way through two baskets of bread as well...). The highlight of the meal was the spicy potatoes, burrata, hanger steak, and the paella. WOW those were all phenomenal. The empanadas were really good as well.
