Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////#32 Goat cheese baked in tomato sauce - I read a previous review from Jen B. that called this dish what it really is... deconstructed pizza. Very good for sharing with friends, but this is pretty much just a cheese spread with marinara sauce. I will say though, that this would be one damn good pizza. Â
