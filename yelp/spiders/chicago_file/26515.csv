Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////By 20h00 our table was ready, so we waited for 30 mins! Apart from pizza, we ordered MALTANI SALAD and it came in 15 mins! It was DELICIOUS! The salad was sweet yet has savoury taste from salami bits! Sooooooo gooooooood omg definitely worth to try! Then our pizza was ready 35 mins after we got our table! We ordered small MALTANI CHICAGO CLASSIC and it tasted AWESOME! Cheese was sooo gooey and the toppings were delicious! However we couldn't finish the crust tho....
