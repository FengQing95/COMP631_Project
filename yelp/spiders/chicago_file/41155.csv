Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So, we finally sit down, peruse the menu and are ready to order our drinks...of course, no waitress shows up for another 15 minutes, and when she finally showed up, she grabbed our drink order and darted.  Finally, the waitress returns and takes our order--everyone is ordering for the table.  So, I place my order for 3 tapas and when our food finally arrives, she missed two out of the items I had ordered.  How does that happen?  We address the issue and tell her to forget about one of the items and to bring the other... the other item never shows up....and then we wait, wait, and wait for her to show up, again, to inquire about the whereabouts of this item and to order more food.  The waitress finally shows up and plays dumb and says, "I thought you cancelled this item..." At this point, we are over wanting more food, so we skip ordering more.  The waitress disappears, again(now I know why they call them "wait"-tresses.  Then we wait, wait, and wait for her to ask if she received the memo that we have a birthday to celebrate and if we would like to see the dessert menu, so we can order a birthday dessert...did not happen.  The waitress shows up with the smallest sliver of chocolate cake with a candle on it...procedes to light the candle with 5 or 6 attempts and just gives up and hands the lighter to the birthday girl.  Okay, we can't change the fact that we were never given the option to get a better dessert for the birthday girl--issue excepted, however, at least  ask the rest of the table whether they want to see the dessert menu? 20 minutes go buy as my cousin is eating her pathetic chocolate birthday sliver(SO EMBARRASSING) and no offer to see a dessert menu.  Our waitress finally shows ups after my cousin has finished her dessert and the waitress asks finally if we want to see the dessert menu--it was the consensus at the table if she had  asked us at the appropriate time(after our meal), we ALL would have ordered dessert--but, no...
