Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A wonderful place to celebrate a special event with a group, this was the perfect choice for our group of 12. The menu works well with great variety to satisfy all. It was helpful to have one person coordinate the orders. After a couple cheese plates as appetizers, we ordered many tapas to share, and 2 servings of 3 different Paello to share, and had plenty of food. Yes u can always order more! And the pitchers of sangria, loved all 3 varieties we tried (peach, mango, and one red). Â Highly recommend, several of our group had been before and chose this for a grad celebration, and we'll certainly be back.
