Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I decided to come here after a friend recommended it to me to try when I was in Chicago. As a New Yorker, I'm often convinced that New York pizza is the best pizza, period. After this trip, I can honestly say that a fair comparison cannot be honestly made. NY-style pizza and Chicago deep dish are two entirely different things. You eat deep dish with a fork and knife and you eat NY style with your hands. Try to do one or the other and you'll either look weird in NY eating your slice with a fork and knife or you bathe your hands in oil eating deep dish in Chicago with your hands.
