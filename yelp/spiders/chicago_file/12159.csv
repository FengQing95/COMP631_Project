Art Institute of Chicago////The layout of the museum is great. Easily walkable to each exhibit and genre. The highlights for me were the Monet, Van Gough, Edward Hopper, and sculptures. Feel free to imitate your favorite Ferris Bueller scene. You'll definitely get a lot of amazement and culture from some of these great priceless works of art.
