Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have heard many good things about Cafe BaBaReeba, but just went for the first time last night. I was there for my friend's birthday with about 7 other people. We had a reservation, so were seated right away, It wasn't very busy (but I assume that's because it was a Monday evening). A few of the girls with us had been there many times before and already knew what to order, so the rest of us took a quick look at the menu and nothing else seemed to jump out at us so we just went with what ever they got.
