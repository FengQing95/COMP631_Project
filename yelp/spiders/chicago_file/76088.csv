Little Goat Diner////The food was great - I had the Asian style breakfast tasty thing, and my friends had the Parthas Burrito and Chocolate chip pancakes. The Asian style breakfast tasty thing was tasty: savory, funky, and sour. I only wished there was more of it! Chicago has ruined me for normal portion sizes, apparently.
