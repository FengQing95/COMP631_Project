Little Goat Diner////Food here is great and the ambience was amazing. Shoutout to our server GILLIAN. She is definitely a keeper! Extremely friendly, and passionate about her job and is super patient with our indecisiveness. (It was our first time here and we were not sure what to order) She gave great recommendations on the menu like the fried chicken and the fried seabass (special of the day YUM). Knowing that we are from Atlanta, she also recommended places to visit! How sweet of her! Will definitely come back here for the wonderful service we had. Way to go Gillian!!
