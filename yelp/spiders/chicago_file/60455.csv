Smoque BBQ////Smoque is the one place I've found in Chicago that comes close to replicating top-flight Texas barbeque.  The brisket is tender and bursting with flavor.  The St. Louis-style ribs (FAR superior to the baby backs, in my humble opinion) are fall off the bone tender, and paired with a tangy, vinegary barbeque sauce that puts Carson's molasses-based abomination to shame.  The sides are excellent - particularly the macaroni and cheese.  And this might be the highest compliment I can give - I ate every bite of my coleslaw, a food I generally despise.
