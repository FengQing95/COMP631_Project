Little Goat Diner////The drinks were nice, bartenders friendly and smilin', always good. When we got called for our table, our tableside meal assistant was overly selling himself, the concept, and the Chef who lives across the street, and anything but the food. He called me boss, he called my lady "chicky", and other outdated terms that just seemed really patronizing.
