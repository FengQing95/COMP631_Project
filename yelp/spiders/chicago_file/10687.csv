Art Institute of Chicago////$35 admission. Make sure you get tickets in advance online to avoid a wait. I am a lover of art and was personally impressed with the works of artists like Picasso, Joan Miro, Salvador Dali, Matisse, Georgia O'Keefe, Andy Warhol, Rene Magritte and more. We also enjoyed the photography exhibit when you enter on the left. It displayed various photographs of people from Bobo. Â There was also a film exhibition which was interesting. There were areas for contemporary and modern art as well as Asian, Greek, and other cultures. Definitely give yourself time to walk around and explore as there is so much to see.
