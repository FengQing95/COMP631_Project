Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had a terrific meal here and it was a great finale dinner to an epic Chicago honeymoon.  We really loved the atmosphere - and the space!  After getting to know way too many of our neighboring tables at other restaurants (as we're sitting inches away from them), it was an unbelievable treat to get to sit in a large booth just the two of us!  This just made me so darn happy.  Good thing we had all the room, because we ordered a ton!
