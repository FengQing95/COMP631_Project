Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////In the top 3 pizzas I have ever had and I've had a lot of pizza! It takes 25 minutes to make and it's worth the wait. This is super thick stuffed crust to die for. The crust is buttery and the cheese flavorful and thick with tomato sauce that has chunks of fresh tomatoes. Now I'm not going to be able to sleep just thinking about it!
