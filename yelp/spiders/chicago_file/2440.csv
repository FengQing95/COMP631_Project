The Purple Pig////Way to handle this in the future. Let us know, the three of us who ordered appetizers and drinks, that we couldn't until the full party arrived. Also let us know prior to providing extra seating and ordering more that the extra seat wasn't allowed. Don't ever take a condescending tone with a guest, no matter how annoyed you are. And don't forget you created the annoyance by not using common sense.
