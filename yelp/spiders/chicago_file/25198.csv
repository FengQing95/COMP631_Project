Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm from Jersey so I wanted to try different deep dish pizza's and this was the second once I tried. Their pizza was good but wasn't as cheesy as the other restaurants. I did like their sauce more and the pizza wasn't as greasy as the one I tried before. Also, their buffalo chicken wings were good! The only problem was the long wait it was about 35-40 mins so I advice to pre order your pizza and walk around because they will text you once your table is ready! I hope you enjoy.
