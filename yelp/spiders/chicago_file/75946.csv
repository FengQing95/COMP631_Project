Little Goat Diner////Our waiter was very friendly and helpful with recommendations, but seemed to forget about our table at times. Prices are fine, although again, I think the sandwiches/burgers should come with fries. Just a pet peeve of mine. I really would like to try the Goat Almighty, which is the colossal goat burger with BBQ pork, braised beef, and onion rings, and many other toppings. One of these days, I will bring the full power that is my appetite.
