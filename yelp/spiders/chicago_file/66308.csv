Little Goat Diner////I am not one to rave about breakfast  on a Saturday or Sunday that usually includes some underwhelming omlette and/or a reinveted club sandwich.  I've been wanting to try this place for weeks and finally got myself there on Sunday. We arrived about 12 25 PM and were given a 45 minute wait for 2 people. The actual wait was 1 hr 15 minutes. Be prepared to wait here and plan accordingly.  You can go next door to the bar area and try to find a seat at the bar and have a drink or some coffee. The bar area next to the dining room is the place to hang out - they have a coffee bar, regular bar as well as a carry out bakery should you choose to pop in and buy fresh bread and baked goods to take away. The dining room is large and open so naturally, it is loud. The menu is incredibly interesting and offers variety. After our 1 1/4 hr wait, we were seated at the counter. Not great, but hey food was in sight.  I had the fish tostadas and my sister had the sloppy goat and we shared a side of the hash browns. Holy explosive flavor.  Everything is made/baked in house. Amazing.  They were out of bagels otherwise I would have tried a bagel + shmear, which also come in interesting flavors.  Once our food was in front of us, I understood the wait. There is so much creativity using great ingredients with unique flavors on the menu.I wish i could have sampled everything!  You cannot possibly get a standard omlette or boring sandwich. I will be back time and again.
