Art Institute of Chicago////How can anyone give the Art Institute less than 5 stars? My goodness, the collection here is amazing. The only downside is the apathetic staff, and worse, the entitled members, in their Chanel boots and their Chanel attitude. If you've been here, and are not wearing Chanel boots, you know what I mean.
