Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We started with the pintxos platter. The deviled egg with serrano ham and the chorizo-wrapped date were the stand-outs for us. The calamari was also delicious--we enjoyed the red sauce better than the white. I think the paella was my favorite, though. Just keep in mind, "2 servings" is more like 4, so come hungry!
