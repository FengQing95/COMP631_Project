Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I was recommended bavettes by a Chi local and it lived up to their praise. Stylish classic decor, very friendly staff and accessible menu that I think stands up to all the usual named restaurants in the area. Also close to gilt so grab a drink there prior if you have the time. Wine menu isn't prolific but absolutely would go back and suggest to anyone looking for a great meal not named maestros, RPM or sienna. Just bring ur large size wallet
