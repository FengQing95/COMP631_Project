Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here twice, and both times it was phenomenal.  This is the only Tapas place I've been to so I don't have much of a basis for comparision, but as far as food goes it is awesome.   Baked Goat cheesey is probably one of my favorite dishes of all time.  The first time we went with a large group and the waiter was a real help and not overly attentive, and for some reason comped two pitchers of sangria for us.  Second time was on a hot date and our server recommended the raw fish on special.  This was not very good, but besides that and a couple minimal waits to sit, this place has been great, I will be back.
