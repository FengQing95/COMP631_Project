Little Goat Diner////Service/seating: We didn't wait because they sat us at the counter. I do not recommend this when the weather is hot outside because it is a broiler. The counter is in front of the kitchen and where the orders come up for pick up. There is heat emanating to the counters and I was sweating during my meal. Very uncomfortable. Service was good. Waiter was attentive.
