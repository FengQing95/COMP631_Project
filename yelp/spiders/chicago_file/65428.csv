Smoque BBQ////The ribs are dry-rub and served with their house made BBQ sauce. The Memphis thick BBQ sauce was definitely our favorite. Now let's talk about the fantastic BBQ gumbo! OH-M-GEE! It was smokey, meaty and just amazing. The mac&cheese had the right amount of cheese and a nice crispy bread coating. We opted for the sliced brisket which was good but a little dry. The slaw, corn bread and baked beans were standard.
