Little Goat Diner////Growing up in Middle East, I have a certain pallet for lamb (eating it my entire life, I'm very picky about lamb I eat).. I've tried lamb in multiple restaurants in the city, but no other restaurant compares with the quality and taste of the lamb they serve at the Little goat. The best lamb chops I tried in US!!!
