Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Anyhow, the pizza was great! Don't be one of those people that eats deep dish pizza with your hands or you'll look like a total fool! We got the Malnati Chicago Classic and it was fantastic. The way the cheese just melts over the pizza is terrific. The Buttercrust was phenomenal and crisp! I didn't care too much for the sausage. They just stick a giant sausage patty over the pizza which doesn't really sit well with me.
