Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A solid hands town tapa place.  Great selection of Sangria and excellent taps and service.  I lived a block away but know parking can be an issue.  It is in the hear of Lincoln Park a block or so from Armitage shopping.  My daughter LOVED it here and for ten years this was our family "go to" weekend splurge.  Great margaritas and if not too busy nice to hang at the bar and enjoy their tapas specials!!
