Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went last night and had such a good time. Sangria was great to start off, then we got some shishito peppers which were AMAZING. Followed by tons of other items, I really remember the escargot being super awesome as well as the garlic potato salad. Desserts were killer too, especially the butterscotch creme.
