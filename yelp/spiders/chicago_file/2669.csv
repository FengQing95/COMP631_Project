The Purple Pig////This place serves tapas and knew I HAD to order the pork shoulder, and the roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter. I also got a prosciutto for the table and ordered a Colombian old fashioned. Three plates was more than enough for dinner for two, as the portions were impressively large. The pork shoulder was a bit too salty, but very filling and tender. The BEETS were amazing! Everything else I could have done without.
