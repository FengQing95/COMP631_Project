Little Goat Diner////I was in Chicago for work and as a huge fan of Chef Izard, knew I had to find my way to one of her restaurants. I came to Little Goat with my suitcase and walked in, fully expecting to wait forever. I waited for about 20 minutes & got seated at the bar. I ordered a local beer (metropolitan Oktoberfest) and the Los Drowned beef sandwich. It was amazing. this was in October & I still think about this sandwich.
