Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Honestly, if you haven't been, GO.  Even with all the amazing food spots that Chicago has to offer, this has become my absolute favorite.  The ambiance is like an old time speak easy, and the cocktails match the decor - phenomenal.  Definitely get the duck terrine...it's too good for words.  Also, the wedge salad.  It's a SLAB of pork belly.  Holy Hell.  Of course, the steaks are incredible, and the sides are delish. I loved the brussel sprouts, and enjoyed the elotes (although, honestly, it was a little cream heavy for me).  Service is always outstanding.  This is place is 100% worth the hype and the wait list.
