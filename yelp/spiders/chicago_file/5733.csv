The Purple Pig////TL:DR - Service was great for me, despite what other people said. The food is top notch. Noteable is the hotdog and duck prosciutto. Serving size is larger than tapas sizes, but a tad smaller than regular entrees. I'd budget about 1.5 plates per person in your party. Place can get a bit tight and loud.
