Art Institute of Chicago////I am not knowledgeable about art history or art at all, but I really like the Art Institute. The architecture is a little iffy, because there's no real direction or order to it--you can pretty much go in any section at any point. My only regret about my visit is that I didn't give myself more time--I only spent a few hours there, but by the end of it, I was exhausted. Leave a full day, maybe a day and a half, if you want enough time to really spend time with everything.
