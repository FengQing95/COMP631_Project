Smoque BBQ////I would argue one of the best BBQ places in the city. Unfortunately that doesn't say a lot as there aren't too many in Chicago, but this one is top 3 for me. Low key, go up to the counter and order. I almost always get the brisket as it's tender and never dry. I also enjoy the sauces at smoque. Their Mac and Cheese is awesome along with the cornbread and French fries. I usually dodge their other sides only because they are standard. Def try all of the meats if you go, but I recommend the brisket followed by the pulled pork.
