Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A little bit of a wait but they seated 5 of us on a Friday night. You can get a drink at the bar while waiting. Great vegetarian options. Food was delicious. Get the stuffed mushrooms they're amazing. Servings were pretty big for tapas. We got 5 tapas and two servings of paella for 5 people and were more than full. Great spot to go before a night out.
