Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The only gripe I had (though not too tragic) was that their patio seating policy (only for groups of 6 or less) did not accommodate our group of 8. Â Nevertheless, that shall not hinder my return to BBRB in the near future --- hopefully before the summer in Chicago officially ends!
