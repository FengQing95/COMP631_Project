Art Institute of Chicago////Love the Art Institute!  It is always a delightful spot to while away a few hours downtown. Make sure to allow time to grab a bite or cup of coffee and take some down time between viewing collections. There is so much to see here, you can get overwhelmed if you attempt to take it all in at once!  Instead, pick your "treat" each visit so you can savor it: stop by the modern wing and browse the American artists on display one day. Take a quiet afternoon and enjoy the photography exhibit on the lower level another day. And every visit?  Stop into the expressionist gallery and take a moment with your favorite piece!  Don't forget: in the spring, summer and fall, the Institute gardens are a peaceful, quiet respite, just seconds from the bustle of Michigan Ave. Enjoy!
