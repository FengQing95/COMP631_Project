Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here with a group of people for dinner while I was in Chicago. There was about a 20-30 minute wait for about 8 of us. It was pretty crowded for a Tuesday night. The staff was also super friendly. When we got seated, we decided to share a bunch of tapas and everything was super delish! It's a bit on the pricy side as is most tapas bars. We got a couple pitchers of the red sangria which was alright (considering I don't usually like sangrias). We also ordered some potatoes (yum), brussels sprouts, mushrooms, beef tenderloin (yum), grilled hanger steak (yum), braised short ribs, shrimp, meatballs (a big hit), grilled pork with chimichurri (cause you know I LOVE chimichurri) and some other awesome things from the menu. Everything was really good! I'd love to try their paella next time. This place is definitely a must-try if you're visiting Chicago (like I was).
