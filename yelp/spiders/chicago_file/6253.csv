The Purple Pig////Taste: the ravioletto is something to behold, if youre a truffle lover you really get the bang for your buck, the taste is INSANE, especially when mixed in with ricotta. The tuna tartare is quality and a HUGE portion, amazing with the cracker ring and avocado! The corn salad veggie option is SO fresh and crunchy, love the basil in it! The bone marrow pork chop was cooked perfectly and was so buttery and amazing, I was obsessed with the onions it came with! The Greek salad was a solid starter (we preferred it without the olives they added a bitter aftertaste), and their hibiscus spritz was beautiful and tasted refreshing and fun!! ALSO, their wine list is amaaaaazing! We tried the Croatian wine it was chef's kiss!
