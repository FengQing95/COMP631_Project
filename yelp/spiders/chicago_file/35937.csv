Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I heard about this rest a day b4 I went. I went for my birthday. I have been to Chicago Cut, Swift & Sons, Gene & Georgettis and this one I like the most. Dark as can be inside but great music and perfect for a dinner date. The warm sourdough bread is big and delicious. The Lyonnaise Salad was good tasting and large portion. The bacon in that was thick and tasty. I had the 10oz filet mignon and a side of truffle mac and cheese. Both excellent, especially dipping it the b√©arnaise, mmmmmm good. I also ordered a french press coffee and the chocolate cream pie upon the waiters recommendation. Who by the way was friendly, informative and very patient with us. I would give a 5 star review but they didn't do anything for my bday. I called for reservation and told them, and even the hostess asked if it was my bday upon seating us. But no ice cream or even a sparkling candle stick. Mannnnn if i come to your restaurant for my birthday, all i am saying is it would be nice to get a little recognition in the form of something. Like a free piece of pie. Thats not too much too ask right? Oh well, good steakhouse!
