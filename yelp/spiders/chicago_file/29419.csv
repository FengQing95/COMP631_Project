Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Deep dish pizza heaven! Of course when we came to Chicago, my friend & I were on the hunt for the perfect deep dish pizza and this place did not let us down. We ordered the small Chicago malnati classic (4 decently-sized slices) which was more than enough for us to split. We also ordered a side of buffalo wings to split as an app which had a nice kick.
