Art Institute of Chicago////They have the most random stuff here; the original trading floor for the Chicago exchange (in its entirety), a collection of photos from a surveyor that worked out west in the 1800's and a Japanese kimono collection. The Islamic art section was probably my favorite. We saw almost everything we wanted to in about 3 hours.
