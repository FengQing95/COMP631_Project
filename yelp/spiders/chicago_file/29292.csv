Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first time having deep dish pizza in Chicago! We tried out the "Lou", which features spinach, mushrooms, and sliced roma tomatoes. I was surprised by how much I liked the pizza, despite lacking classic protein elements. Two things made the pizza stand out to me: 1) The fresh ingredients. 2) THAT CRUST. Not your standard doughy crust. It is a wonderful crispy buttercrust that is just as delicious as the rest of the pizza.
