Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was excellent. We went for happy hour. The bartender wasn't very friendly at first but lightened up as the night went on. (The food runners & bussers we're super nice though.) I really appreciated the remembered birthday as he brought out a flan with a candle even though we opted out of dessert. The drinks were fabulous. The Monday deal is insane. I just wish more LEY staff were trained in their discounts, promotions & app. We wanted to redeem my birthday dollars & of course add our points but it wasn't even noticed. I literally folded it to be overly visible. So we were charged full price, flagged down the bartender & mentioned it to him, he replied that he didn't see it & went on working. Hey, we still want our discount! So we flag him down again to fix it & he begrudgingly complies. It was kind of strange but all in all it was a pretty good experience. Would be 5 stars if it wasn't for those minor inconveniences.
