Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best pizza in all of Chicago! Absolutely worth the wait when you order...their sausage pizza is the best, in my opinion, but you can't go wrong with any topping you choose. The service is also great at any location - the wait staff is very attentive and quick to serve. Check them out!
