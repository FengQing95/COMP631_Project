Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here after a couple recommendations from friends. Perhaps being from Manhattan, I'm a bit spoiled, but it really wasn't all that it's cracked up to be. The patatas bravas were mediocre, the mango sangria was good but didn't taste that fresh, the croquettes were fine. The only thing that was delicious was the bacon mac n cheese -- but come on -- that's quite a low bar to clear.
