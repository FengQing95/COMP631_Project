Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, hands down.  Since moving here in July 2018, I think I've been 8+ times.  I've brought visitors from out-of-town, gone on date nights, and dragged big groups of friends to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba! It works for seriously any occasion, and the food and drinks are delicious (and reasonably priced for a satisfying dinner and cool atmosphere).
