Smoque BBQ////Smoque is probably some of the  best BBQ I've had but I'm sad to report it's not the best.  I had my usual pulled pork and the sauce that came on it was too spicy for me.  It was not to the point of being unable to eat but I was really craving a big glass of milk.  The same for my side of baked beans.  Too spicy.
