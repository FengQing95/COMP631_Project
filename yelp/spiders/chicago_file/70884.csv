Little Goat Diner////So cute, oh man. We went here on a Friday night around 6 or 6:30pm after Haymarket proved to be PACKED. The wait wasn't unreasonable for three people, but we were somewhat crunched for time, so we chose to be seated at the communal table within minutes. They had some weird grapefruit soda/beer mix, Stiegl?, and that was delicious and I wish I knew about it in the summertime. Â The decor of the restaurant is very nice, and though it was quite loud and somewhat hard to hear what my dinner partners were saying. The bathroom vents/fans/whatever are loud and bass-y, which was rather weird.
