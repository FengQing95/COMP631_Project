Art Institute of Chicago////Plan on spending at least 3-4 hours to see everything (that's moving fast).    There are several must see objects:   Nighthawks, American Gothic, etc.   One of the largest collections of Picasso, Monet and Renoir I have ever seen.    Start on the 3rd floor and work your way down.    Make it a day go next door and see Cloud Gate (the bean).
