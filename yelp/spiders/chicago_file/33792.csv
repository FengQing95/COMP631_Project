Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As many Yelpers have attested, the food is fabulously prepared and generously portioned. Also their wine policy allows you to make someone else happy while saving you a few bucks. Â I ordered the rib eye and mashed potatoes, which were to die for! The hubs had the stroganoff and coleslaw and ate every bite. My gimlet was amazing and his old fashioned lived up to the raves of others.
