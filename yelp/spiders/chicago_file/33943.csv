Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came here with a group of friends on a weeknight, and the place was packed. As everyone has said before, the decor is awesome- trendy yet laid back and comfortable. My biggest complaint about the restaurant itself is that the hostesses were a bit pretentious, as if they were doing me a favor by letting me spend my money there. Oh well.
