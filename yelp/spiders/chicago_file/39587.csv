Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The research we did and the advice we got told us to make a reservation in the downstairs Parlor, because it was supposed to be more intimate and a cool, jazzy place. That's how their website describes their atmosphere. And it looks the part when you walk in, it really does. Until you start hearing gangster rap/ hip hop playing during your meal yelling out profanities while your wife sits with you.
