Art Institute of Chicago////Amazing. Way too much to see, you'll definitely a whole day here. Came at 3:30pm when the museum closed at 5PM, such a pity since we only got 1.5 hours here and could only hit up the crown attractions (monet, picasso, seurat, andy warhol, dali, pollack among others). T__T need to come here again and definitely would like to try an audio tour or tour of some sort. What a collection!
