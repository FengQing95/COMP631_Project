Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Fast forward a few years to last night. I'm in the car with my best friend. We had made rum and Cokes with 7-11 slurpees, stopped at my piercer's shop to chat, had attempted to go to Peace Fest, and decided we should eat something. I'm particularly good at finding the best places to eat, and I usually refer to my Yelp app as a point of reference as far as what's near and what's good per the reviews. We're driving, I'm getting overwhelmed with what's near us at the moment (Lincoln Park area) and what's near our destination (Wrigleyville area), when Caf√© Ba Ba Reeba pops up. I had read up on it, bookmarked it, and was determined to go one day. Over 900 reviews and I wanted Spanish, so off we went.
