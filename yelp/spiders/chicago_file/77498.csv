Little Goat Diner////As a lot of the previous reviews stated, the food was really greasy, OVERLY salted and just overall not as good as I expected given my experience at chef Izard's other restaurants. Not to mention, you ARE paying West Loop prices which also didn't help stomach the salty food. The pork belly fries were salty, lacked more pork belly and really not good. The one star on the menu I did get to try was the roasted cauliflower. The sauce, roasting and crunchiness reminded me of a sweet and sour chicken or sorts.
