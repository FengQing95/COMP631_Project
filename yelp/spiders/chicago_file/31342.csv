Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Probably a great place, but not great tonight. Monday of memorial day, not that busy. Waited 12 minutes for drink order/etc (or anyone to come by the table). An hour into the experience, was told the printer had run out of paper when the order was placed, so another wait. Brief apology and a shrug.
