Art Institute of Chicago////OMG the miniatures are the coolest thing ever. Their perfection and tininess harkens the days of my youth getting lost in fantasy gazing into my friends enormous dollhouse, and Wes Anderson movies. There was a blurb posted stating that Wes Anderson loves the miniatures exhibit as well which made me feel super cool while I was looking into these tiny rooms, feeling like a big dork. I'm an ARTIST DAMMIT. Anyway the museum is lovely, a wonderful collection and lots to explore. I dipped in for a few hours but it could easily take a couple days to take in everything. The location is great, there is so much to do nearby. I had to relive one of my favorite moments from Ferris Bueller's Day Off while I was there...
