Smoque BBQ////This place is legit!! The reviews are pretty much right on. It's really good! And having it less than 10 minutes from my house might prove to be dangerous! I had the sliced brisket platter with the brisket chili (which was a little watery to my taste but flavorful nonetheless) and fries (more fries than I needed) as my 2 sides. Comes with slaw which was really very good! The brisket was tender, moist, lean and had a nice hint of smoky flavor. Was it the best brisket I ever had? No but I wasn't expecting it to be. That honor belongs to a friend of mine who does the best I've ever had on his Big Green Egg and smokes it low and slow for 16 hours. Yum.
