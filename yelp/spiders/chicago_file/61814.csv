Smoque BBQ////St Louis Ribs just fall off the bone. I know it looks burnt - but that smokiness you just can't get anywhere else. Just had to try this place since it's always been a dream of mine to check out the joints from Diners Drive-ins and Dives! It was well worth it! Their brisket was also super flavourful. It would've definitely been a 5 star rating if they had some cooler sides.
