Little Goat Diner////I checked out the cocktail/beer list and the menu.  Local brews on tap, and even Coors on draft.  That's pretty special considering there was a time when you couldn't get it East of the Rockies.  Breakfast is served all day, and that's what I'd be having.  I zeroed in on the Fat Elvis Waffles-banana/peanut butter butter/bacon maple syrup.  I also couldn't pass on the hash browns made with goat cheese.  I had some coffee with my brunch and my cup was never empty.  Service was spot on and every employee that I spoke with was helpful and very friendly.  The place is crowded, everyone's busy and they still have time to be pleasant.  Love it.  I enjoyed chatting with my fellow diners at the counter.  We all watched hungrily as dishes came out of the kitchen and made their way through the restaurant.  I saw milkshakes, onion rings and fried pickles, and the rueben with kimchee and they all looked great.
