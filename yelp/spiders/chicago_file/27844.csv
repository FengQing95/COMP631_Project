Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We came on a Monday night around 6pm and only faced a 20 minute wait for two. Started with the Calamari which came in delicious large juicy chunks. Then followed with a small Chicago Classic pizza. It was scrumptious. Sad we couldn't take our leftovers as we were lodging at a hotel. The crust is crunchy and heavily buttery just as promised on their menu, there was a thick (nearly solid) layer of sausage crumbled over a substantial Â layer of mozzarella, all covered with a delightfully fresh and light-tasting coating of chunky tomato sauce. There are no gimmicks here -- the ingredients for each flavorful and well made, layered for an impressive deep dish. Come here if you like your crusts super crunchy and buttery; that was definitely the standout characteristic for us.
