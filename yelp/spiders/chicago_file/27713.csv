Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here one evening with my boyfriend. I had such a great time. The food, drinks, and vibe was amazzzzing. We got calamari as an appetizer and we got a deep dish - half pepperoni and half sausage. It was so yummy. Its as good as everyone says it is ! We got blue moon beers as our drink and my boyfriend had way too many shots !!! Overall we had a great time and I'll be back whenever I'm in Chicago ! I recommend to anyone who is looking for a great time and some good deep dish.
