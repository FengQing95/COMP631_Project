Little Goat Diner////The only bad part of the meal was when I finished the tofu sammich and I didn't have any more sammich because it was so good that I'm pretty sure little hummus angels  were flying around my table and singing the glories of tofu and hummus and goat cheese and the best bread/bun that has ever happened in the history of baked goods.  Oh, and then I was sad again when we were so full that we couldn't get a milkshake.  So basically you should eat here if you want to experience hummus angels.
