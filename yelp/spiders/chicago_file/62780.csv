Smoque BBQ////First of all, they have Mikeska's family Bbq sausage from Texas. I grew up on Jerry Mikeska 's since his restaurant was less than a mile away from our house of 16+ years. Secondly, their Brisket is second to NONE as far as BBQ goes in Chicago. Get over there ASAP and don't worry if there is a line out the door, they are super efficient with their service and by the time your food is ready you'll be sitting down. Git it!
