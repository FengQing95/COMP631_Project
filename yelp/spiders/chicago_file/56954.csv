Smoque BBQ////My family goes to Smoque on an average of once/week: on the way to school, on the way home from school and at various times in between. My 8-year-old would probably rank this as his #1 restaurant in the neighborhood -- we go for a bag of piping hot, fresh-cut fries to share on the way home from school on Friday afternoons. My 4-year-old prefers Hot Woks, Cool Sushi, but he's unlikely to turn down a side of Smoque mac & cheese -- served with a nice crust of breadcrumbs on the top. My 6-year-old, a latent picky eater, turns up her nose at the kids' mac & cheese (served without the breadcrumbs and therefore a bit runnier)...and then promptly finishes the bowl.
