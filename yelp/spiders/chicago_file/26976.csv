Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The crust of the pizza was thick and under-cooked.  Under-cooked?  They were making it for an hour and 15 minutes, right?  On the top were huge chunks of tomatoes that had no taste.  There was a little bit of cheese and some pepperonis.   I've had pizza all over the country.  And this is hands down the worst pizza I've had in a restaurant!   $57 dollars for 2 pizzas and 3 sodas.  Wow.
