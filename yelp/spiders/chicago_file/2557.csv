The Purple Pig////The food came out surprisingly quickly, especially considering how busy the kitchen must constantly be and how packed the place is. The same can't be said for other tapas places I have been to (*coughArtesanoInLouisvillecough*) And that food....absolutely delicious! I love all brussels sprouts and these might be my favorite I've had! Teach me your waaaays! I wish i could have spent all day there, eating everything on the menu...but schedules and and my wallet said no.
