Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had to wait a little, but it was worth it. You're able to order ahead so once you're seated, you don't have to wait too long until your order comes out. Tons to choose from off the menu and I'm sure you can't go wrong. For us, we ordered the Chicken Louie Pasta and the Malnati Chicago Pizza, which was filling and so so so hearty. We loved it! It definitely hit the spot on a chilly day.
