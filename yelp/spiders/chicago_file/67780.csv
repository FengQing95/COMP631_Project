Little Goat Diner////I'm trying to think back to the last "meh" omelette I've had and I can't remember, because in general, I think all omelettes are fantastic.  However, I actually thought the Spanish Omelette here was almost gross.  It's about a foot long of peppers and eggs.  If you don't like peppers, don't bother, it's all egg and pepper.  Then on top they  added Dorrito tasting chips which were probably the best part, with what looked like a can of stewed tomatoes.  The home fries were nothing special either.
