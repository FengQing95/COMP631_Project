Little Goat Diner////Sloppy Goat - It was good, but I probably wouldn't have been able to tell the difference if they swapped out the goat for beef. The slaw on top gave it a nice cooling flavor and a little bit of crunch. The bread was just great. Usually bread is just a silent component of a sandwich, but this roll really stood out in both texture and the way it meshed well with the other ingredients.
