Little Goat Diner////Halve been wanting to eat at one of Stephanie Izard's restaurants for a very long time! Couldn't get into Girl & Goat so tried this instead. I was not disappointed! Excellent cocktails, nice menu selection. I got the Banh mi Goat burger and tried to lick my plate as the waiter took it away! My husband got a braised beef sandwich that he raved about. And then to top it off we got the Cheezit sundae. It sounds weird to have an ice cream sundae with cheezits but it was amazing- more plate licking needed! I want to go back and have breakfast!
