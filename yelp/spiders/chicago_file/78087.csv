Little Goat Diner////Been dying to come here since Stephanie Izard had won her respective season of Top Chef. Finally got the chance to do so when I was revisiting Chicago along with the bf and a friend last month. I'm glad we had made a reservation to come here in advance, because even though it was during the day on a Monday, the place was pretty packed and soon after we had arrived, a line had formed outside.
