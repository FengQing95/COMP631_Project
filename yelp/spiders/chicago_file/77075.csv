Little Goat Diner////We enjoy the food. Â I ordered The Piggy Goes to China. The cheddar biscuits are delicious and combined with sausage and a sunny side egg make for a hearty breakfast. (Portions are generous) the tangy flavor that coincide with her Asian flare made me breakfasts unique. Great balance of flavor.
