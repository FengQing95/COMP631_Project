Little Goat Diner////The brandade and belly tasted like...its constituent parts. This was one of those dishes where the sum was not greater than individual components. And given the lukewarm temperature of the dish, the combination of brandade / kimchi actually tasted slightly reminiscent of garbage. Not my favorite.
