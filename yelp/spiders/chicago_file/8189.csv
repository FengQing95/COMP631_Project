Art Institute of Chicago////When in Chicago, you must come to the Art Institute.  It was one of the best.  The traveling exhibits are top notch, as are the permanent collection.  Be prepared to spend at LEAST 3 hours here.  Seriously, if you have the stamina, go for all day.  Note to travelers :  no backpacks allowed, you'll have to check them, along with any bags that are over their size limit.  Also, no food, (they won't even let you store it in your checked bag! outrage!), which stinks for me, as I need a snack about every 2-3 hours.  Good thing they have a cute little cafe or two, with some pretty decent food.  I love the Modern Wing, the Impressionists, Early American, Folkart, etc....
