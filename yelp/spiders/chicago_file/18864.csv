Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm sure the pizza is great here, but I wouldn't know yet. Sat for 15 minutes and was ignored by two servers. Got up and told one of the servers to send someone over and she said she would. Waited another 10 minutes to no avail. Finally one of the other servers asked if we'd been helped and finally took our order. It's not even busy here right now. I've worked in the service industry and its not too much to ask to be acknowledged.
