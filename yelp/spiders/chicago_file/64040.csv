Smoque BBQ////BBQ Food, Chopped Brisket: They ran out of sliced brisket, so I ordered the Chopped Brisket meal and it came with 2 sides + coleslaw. A mound of Chopped brisket placed on my tray looked like a challenge to eat and I barely finished it. The charred flavors was just the right touch and the sauce in the meat was just enough. They do provide extra sauce and if you want, you can order 'extra char'
