Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm a foodie, have had lots of delicious ribeye all over our great states but this was seriously one of the best meals I've eaten. We lucked into an early reservation, wanting a Chicago steak house experience. We arrived at the restaurant just before 5 pm and found the line in front of the door (yes, really). We were quickly led in and escorted to a table. Brandon was our waiter and we had a spectacular, artistic shrimp cocktail for starters and then the classic rib eye and wonderful garlic mashed potatoes. I enjoyed all this with a Lillet Rose Martini which was perfection in a glass.
