Little Goat Diner////First of all, I 100000% recommend getting a reservation. Boyfriend and I almost chose to wing it, but the night before made the decision to play it safe and place a last-minute reservation online for 1:30pm. When we arrived the next day we overhead that a wait for a two was nearly two hours. NO FOOD on Earth is worth waiting that long for.
