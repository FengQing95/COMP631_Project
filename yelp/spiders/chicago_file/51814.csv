Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here for my 3rd time over the weekend. We had a half pitcher of their blackberry raspberry sangria and their seasonal blood orange sangria. Both were a great combination of fruity and just a little tart. We had the flank steak, spicy potatoes, beef tenderloin & blue cheese, and my favorite the chicken paella. *Note - order the paella first because it takes awhile!* We also had some desserts which were perfect small plates (what else would it be?) so we got to try a few and they did not disappoint.
