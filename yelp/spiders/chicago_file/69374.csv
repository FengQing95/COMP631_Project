Little Goat Diner////The thing I love about this place isn't just that they serve a great brunch with breakfast foods. The thing I love is that they serve a great brunch with breakfast foods that I can't/wouldn't make myself. Any breakfast joint (or even myself) can make an omelette, but I bet you'd be hard pressed to find another place that makes a kimchee & bacon & eggs & pancakes asian style breakfast tasty thing.
