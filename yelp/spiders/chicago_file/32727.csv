Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is probably my favorite restaurant in Chicago right now.  Amazing steaks, seafood and killer drinks.  They make a mean old fashioned and have a good whiskey selection.  BUT, back to the food - it is awesome!  Great deserts too.  Very hard to get a reservation and for good reason.
