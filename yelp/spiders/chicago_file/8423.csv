Art Institute of Chicago////The piece de resistance of the Art Institute is Georges Seurat's Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, featured most prominently in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. It's conveniently also one of my favorite paintings, and is worth the price of admission alone. The pointillism, detail, and stark upclose/faraway contrast be described by words but only marveled upon in person.
