Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here directly after work with a friend from work, so it wasn't too crowded. We sat at the bar, but noticed a table of four where packing up their things so we rushed our cutie little fashionista butts over to their bar table. We ordered the mango sangria after chatting with a cutie waiter about many glasses a full pitcher comes out to be. 7 or 8, sounds great! We then ordered the coat cheese in tomato sauce, spicy potatoes, and beef tenderloin with blue cheese. Everything was delicious & the sweet sangria complemented everything so nicely. I have to say the beef tenderloin topped with blue cheese & homemade chips was my favorite of the evening. The tender, juicy beef topped with the perfect amount of blue cheese. I don't even like blue cheese & was hoping I'd find another piece below all of those addictive, salty homemade chips.
