Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a native Chicagoan, I've got to say that Giordano's is still my favorite deep-dish pizza- their spinach pizza and the veggie supreme pizza can't be beat!  - I also like Gino's.  Granted, I've never had anyone's meat pizza so i can't judge those, but Lou's is the biggest loser for me thus far.
