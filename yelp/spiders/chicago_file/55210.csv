Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////An order of the Brussel sprout salad, albondigas, and chicken & ham croquettas later, we were feeling full. This is when we started to regret filing up on all the bread and sangria. We paused as I checked-in on Yelp. To our surprise, there was a check-in offer! And very serendipitously, it was for a free dessert tapa. We took that as our sign to return the dinner menu and take a look at the sweet offerings they had. We went with the butterscotch caramel custard, as referenced but our waiter as "the honey badger of desserts". Now, we had no clue what that meant. Maybe it was the sangria, maybe it was the mystery - but we went with it. It was pretty decent, but I'm not sure I'd go so far as "honey badger" good (still unclear what this actually means).
