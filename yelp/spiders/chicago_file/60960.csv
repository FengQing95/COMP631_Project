Smoque BBQ////This place is crammed full of cutsieness (a mini cupcake tin of mac n cheese), small portions (a mini cupcake tin of mac n cheese?), kind of bland food (a mini cupcake tin of mac n cheese) and a bunch of people that don't know shit about barbeque (and mini cupcake tins of mac n cheese) proclaiming it all just the best thing ever. Puh-lese.
