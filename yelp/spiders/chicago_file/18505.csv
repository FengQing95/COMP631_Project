Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a rare visitor to Chicago from a city not known for its Italian, it would be easy for a deep dish to fail to live up to my dreams. However, my sausage-spinach mix pizza was nothing short of perfection. The crust was sweet and buttery, the cheese generous but not overwhelming the rest of the pizza, and the ingredients fresh. To top it off, the creative and scrumptious deep dish cookie smothered in ice cream was flawless in taste and presentation.
