Smoque BBQ////I will admit I am not a huge BBQ snob, but this is pretty darn good food. The brisket, ribs, pork, and chicken are all super yummy, and the baked beans and mac and cheese are great sides. The cole slaw is vinegar-based, as opposed to mayo-based, and I know that's not everyone's cup of tea, but I like it. The peach cobbler is a nice finale.
