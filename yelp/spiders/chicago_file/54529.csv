Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////4) NOW for the worst part of the meal... DESSERT. I received a free dessert through Yelp and our server recommended the marcona-almond caramel bar. It's basically a glorified snickers bar, but worse... So we looked on Yelp and saw that folks reallllly liked the butterscotch custard. So for sh*ts and giggles we ordered that too... #fail. It tasted like overly sweetened condensed milk with flavoring.
