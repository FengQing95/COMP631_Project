Little Goat Diner////So little goat diner has a special place in my heart.  This is where my fiancé and I had our first date.  The food is pretty bad ass.  We found them on yelp and have been going here ever since!  The atmosphere is amazing the staff is great. We recently ate here this past Saturday and both got the Bull's Eye French Toast and it was to die for! This is one of our regular spots that we try to go to at least once a month.
