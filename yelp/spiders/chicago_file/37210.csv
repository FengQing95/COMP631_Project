Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm generally not a fan of ribeye, since it's such a fatty cut.  And indeed, there was plenty of fat here.  But the meat seemed to be from some kind of super-cow.  Possibly extra-terrestrial.  I've eaten cow before, and this was a more evolved creature.  The steak had a perfect salty crust on the outside, and the meat felt like a warm prodigal extension of my body that was coming home.  I wish I would have chewed slower.  That was incredible.  ($60 incredible?  Probably not.  But really damn good.)
