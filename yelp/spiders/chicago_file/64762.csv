Smoque BBQ////SIDES: Green Street's beans are the best. Smoque's are smokier, but less complex and tangy, and maybe a little watery. Still good. Smoque's cornbread is tasty but small. Their coleslaw is vinegary (a plus) and full of raw onion (which I found to be not great). Their mac n cheese is tasty, but I'm not a mac n cheese guy with BBQ. Green Street's sides are more varied and bigger. But neither place has collards! WHERE ARE THE COLLARD GREENS, GUYS?! Edge: Green Street.
