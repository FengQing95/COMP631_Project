Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////In all they took really good cuts of meat and ruined them with some strange concoction of flavors that were awful. I know after you've had great steak it's hard to distinguish what's best but this didn't even reach that level! My entree which should have been the highlight was a complete failure and the waiter service was nonexistent, I mean nil. Just wow.
