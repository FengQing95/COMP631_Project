Little Goat Diner////Open from 7am until late and located on Randolph in the Fulton Market there was little doubt in my mind that Stephanie Izard's second Chicago restaurant, the cleverly named Little Goat, would be successful and considering my single visit to Girl & The Goat I also expected the food to be bold, uncompromised, and delicious - the first two readily apparent the moment the website went live displaying a menu that read like Frankenstein mash-up of comfort foods gone overboard. Â The question then became, would it be delicious - an answer I decided to find out for myself when I gathered up the family for early Sunday Breakfast.
