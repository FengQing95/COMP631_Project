Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Took a trip to this location with some friends from out of town this past weekend, and I must say this is what deep dish is all about. We ordered two mediums (which is a lot of pizza for those not familar with Chicago style deep dish) . The signature "Lou" pizza with fresh spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, and cheese sounded good but was actually a bit disappointing. Still, the restaurant deserves its five stars because of the pepperoni and sausage deep dish. Probably my favorite deep dish in the city (though Giordano's stuffed pie is my favorite pizza!). We went here on a Saturday night, and while we did have to wait, it wasn't for that long, and like most Chicago pizza joints, you're able to order while you wait. Highly recommended!
