Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Basically the pizza needed some crushed red pepper and that helped a lot.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this pizza and ate every damn bite of it.  But I was expecting the best.  I don't know where the best Chicago Deep Dish pizza is, but some mom and pop in this city is making it.  These larger chains can only be so good because they aren't being made with love.
