Smoque BBQ////Had another good meal here recently, and I think they've earned another star. The BBQ beans were amazing(and have now become my favorite thing on their sides menu), and I only wish they'd make the portion of the macaroni and cheese they get(if you choose this as your side) equal to the portion you get of the BBQ beans. Finally tried the Saint Louis ribs, and those are excellent! The sauce that comes with the ribs(it has a very tomato-based taste) compliments the ribs very well. Peach cobbler isn't too bad, not my favorite place I've had it at, but certainly is still very enjoyable(and within the city of Chicago, how many places serve it anyway? not very many).
