Little Goat Diner////It took a while for the food to come and not in any particular order.  My friend finished their sandwich and then their fries arrive after.  We spoke with a manager, who was quite pretentious, and just stated "that's how our kitchen is."  I love the food here, but the service needs quite a bit of work.
