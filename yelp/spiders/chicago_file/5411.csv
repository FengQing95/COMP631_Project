The Purple Pig////MMMMMMM I'm so glad that my sister found this place because the food here is absolutely DELICIOUS! There was a wait to sit inside so we opted to sit outside (which wasn't bad), a little bit chilly but they had warmers which helped (especially since I went during the winter). The staff are friendly and they really know their stuff which helped with ordering our dinner. we got the pork belly, the duck, and the octopus for three people. the pork belly was SOOO juicy and delicious and the duck was HUGE!! we couldn't even finish it! the octopus we could have gone without though (nothing special). we all were licking our fingers because the food was so good! the meat literally melted off the bones and we wanted more ~ haha. definitely recommend, all around an amazing restaurant (just on the pricier side).
