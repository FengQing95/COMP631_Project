Little Goat Diner////First off, my cappuccino was good. Figuring that I'm such a "foodie", I went out on the limb and ordered the breakfast spaghetti and clams even though it sounded disgusting... because... I really don't know what I was thinking?? Verdict appears that it really wasn't that appetizing, so my recommendation cannot be for this.
