Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We came on a Sunday afternoon. The bloody mary bar was still open and wow--talk about a smorgasbord. Top shelf vodka only. AND filled at the halfway mark. Fresh tomato juice, gazpacho, skewered shrimp, horseradish, olives--the works. I think we spent 15 minutes perfecting our bloody mary's (horseradish does it every time).
