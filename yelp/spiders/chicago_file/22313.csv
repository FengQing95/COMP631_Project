Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The wait was long, but we could order the pizza and have it cooking while we waited. There is a text messaging system that updates you on how long your wait is!!! Amazing, loved that. Even when we finally got seated, there was still a wait so we got salad and breadsticks. We totally over ordered but we were hungry. The sausage pizza was amazing in that it was a confluence layer of sausage over cheese. Yum! The veggie one was not that way so not as good. Would try other places just because of the wait.
