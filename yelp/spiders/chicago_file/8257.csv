Art Institute of Chicago////Took a quick impromptu 2-hr cruise thru here and was impressed with the diversity of collections amidst an easily navigable space. Â  Could have easily spent a day gazing at Monet, Renoir, Cezanne, Gaugin, etc...but was on a one day mission to see as much of the city as I could...the Impressionists and post-impressionists were my mainstay but I did glimpse some of the other rooms and they appeared equally well presented...
