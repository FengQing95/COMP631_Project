Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After a very short wait, the hostess seated us in the back of the restaurant and we ordered right away. (We were just about to pre-order our pizza when we were called to get seated. If there's a wait when you're there, just go ahead and place your order as you wait for your table since it takes awhile to bake.)
