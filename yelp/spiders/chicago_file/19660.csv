Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was in Chicago for the day and was told by many to try this place because it was the best pizza place in the city. After waiting an hour for my personal pan pizza, I was not impressed. First, I ordered pepperoni (an extra $1+) and there was none on my pizza. Second, it was really just average. I don't know if it has to do with being from New York, but for me Chicago pizza is all talk if this is the best they have. I also added the buttery crust (an extra .79) to my pizza and either the place just neglected to make it that way or it was not as flavorful as I had imagined. I'll stick with my New York pizza.
