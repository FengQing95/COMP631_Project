Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////At the end of the meal, when I told the server I wanted the check, he came with dessert menus instead. (Boo!) Then when we told him we didn't want dessert, he left and came back with two desserts on the house since we were first-time customers. (Yay!) Very nice touch of service.
