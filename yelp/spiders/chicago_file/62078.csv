Smoque BBQ////Went here during my trip to see Michigan-Notre Dame football, NOTRE DAME WON!!! :) :) The BBQ in this place was FABULOUS!!! I had the brisket platter with mac&cheese and cole slaw as my sides. It comes with delicious hot corn bread. I am pretty sure they use cream style corn in the mixture. The brisket with their sauce, very tasty, on it was so tender it was hard to pickup with my fork so I used my personal ones, MY FINGERS!!! I also tasted the pulled pork and the St. Louis style ribs and was NOT disappointed. The pulled pork was smoky, moist and delicious. The ribs were pull-away from the bone heavenly!!! I highly, highly recommend going here if you are ever in Northwest Chicago. FYI, no alcohol sold here but it is BYOB but you can't sit outside with your adult beverages but that will not take away from having great BBQ here!!!!
