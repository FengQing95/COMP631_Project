Little Goat Diner////We brunched here over the weekend,  I had "This little piggy went to China" and my boyfriend ordered the Schnitzel Sandwich.  We ordered an additional hash brown and yogurt parfait.  The Schnitzel Sandwich was pretty tasty.  However, the little piggy who went to china likely came home with a tummy-ache.  There were so many overwhelming flavors in this dish! I don't know if it was my delicate palate, but I was left confused between the sesame cheddar biscuit, the egg yolk, the chili garlic sauce on the plate, the mustard aioli on the biscuit and the pork sausage. Sooo many flavors and none of them played nicely together on my tongue.  I took two bites, but couldn't bring myself to finish the monstrosity.  I ate the side of hash browns, which needed salt and left behind a bitter after-taste (perhaps it was the oil?).  I truly enjoyed the Yogurt parfait, it was simple and positively delicious (served with home made granola and fresh berry jam). I also had a latte from the cafe next door and it was simply divine.... so where does this leave us?  I think I would've enjoyed the food had I ordered a simple sandwich or sweet treat like pancakes.  Everything looked positively delicious, so I'm not sure where things went wrong.
