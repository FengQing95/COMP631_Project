Art Institute of Chicago////This art museum screams HUGE! So much to do without enough time in the day! Every turn takes you on a new voyage. You WILL not bump into the same exhibit twice. Illinois residents are also free from 5 to 8 on Thursdays. Parking is also only $21 from 4pm until 5am the next day, so with the summer coming it's convenient to park and stroll down Michigan Ave and enjoy the weather.
