Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Favorite thing on the menu is the paella (pork). If you go and do not get a serving or two of this you are truly missing out. The servings for the paella are large. There is a minimum of two servings when ordering the paella, but those two servings could feed three or four people. Especially if getting tapas in addition to the paella.
