Little Goat Diner////Diner food with a twist. Pretty good, but not the level of amazingness implied by some of these other reviews. Smoked corned beef hash is delicious as well as the pork belly pancake. Service is pleasant and the wait has been manageable the few times I've been there in recent months. Glad they're here, but you shouldn't be waiting around the corner for this spot (not that people are doing this anymore).
