Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Average food with bad service. We went on a Wednesday when it wasn't super crowded and it still took 5-10 minutes before our sever came over to see us. We ordered a bottle of wine and every time he filled my glass he reached across me and nearly elbowed me in the face and just left his arm inches from my face - I'm not a wine-o but learn how to pour man! We ordered a shrimp dish and it came out severely undercooked, sent it back and they brought out a new one where one one or two shrimp were still pretty questionable. Overall I expected the food to be better and with subpar service I'm not sure I'll bother to go back.
