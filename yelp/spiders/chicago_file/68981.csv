Little Goat Diner////This place just keeps getting worse by the visit. I really want to like it I really do but I cannot stand the subpar service anymore. I've been a host, server and bartender at many places, from high end to sports bars, most of my life and the standard of service is here is in the negatives. You walk in on almost any day that's relatively busy and no one had their shit together starting with one of the most inefficient host stands. They have to "look up" the wait time, rarely tell you about the areas that are open seating/first come first serve, and they just look and act generally confused. Has no one told them that they are literally the face of this place, they are the first interaction with guests- setting the tone for the rest of the experience. Come on guys get it together. The wait staff is not super great either. I've been here at least 100 times by now (because I love the vegan crumpets and theirs smoked fries-the only reason I come here) and I think I've had maybe one decent server. You can't get away with just having kooky/"eclectic" looking staff and allow crappy service. When it gets really busy, it's like all training goes out the Â window. I've had servers mess up my order, forget my order and just generally be rude to me because they're in the weeds. If your staff can't handle a full section on a busy day, PUT MORE SERVERS ON THE FLOOR!!!! I shouldn't be treated like shit because you can't handle volume. This morning I came here and sat at the back bar that was open seating. I sat there for about 10 minutes before I asked the staff to be acknowledged. If I'm sitting at your bar and there's a signed check and a clearly used plates and glasses that have been sitting there for a while before I even sat down, clean it up, acknowledge me, give me water and a menu. Do you not like money? Do you not want more guests at your bar? Like what is the logic here? My order was of course messed up but the bartender at least adjusted the price to be accurate with what I received. But the bartender acted like she had all the life sucked out of her. Little to no eye contact, no interaction, had to be asked for menus and to have the space cleaned before we order. There was no "Hi, how are you." No manners at all. The menus were dropped and she walked away. There's tons of communication problems between staff members and the FOH and the BOH, rarely things are in sync. Just really overall disappointed, LG I really want to like you! I just can't keep supporting such a mismanaged place with bad service :/
