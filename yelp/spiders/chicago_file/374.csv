Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This restaurant was close to our hotel and highly rated, so my wife and I decided to visit. Once again, in true Chicago style we were confronted with a patio full of people waiting for a table even though it was barely nine o'clock. This time, however, it was certainly worth the wait. At the reception area was a coffee bar where we could order a beverage while we waited. I ordered an amazing banana split smoothy both times we were there. It was great. When we were seated, our server was very attentive an courteous, and the food arrived hot fresh and quickly. The service both times was quick and efficient and although there were close to one hundred people waiting outside we did not feel rushed. I had their wild berry blast crepes the first time and my wife had blueberry pancakes. Both dishes were delicious. I would definitely recommend them. The next day, it was warm and we were seated outside. As a result we were not as comfortable as inside and we could feel the ground tremble as trucks rumbled by on East Randolph Street. My wife had cinnamon bun pancakes. and I had the cinnamon bun French toast, both of which were flavourful and warm. My only quibble is that I would have preferred the French toast to have been made from a cinnamon bun other than dressing up regular bread with cinnamon syrup and vanilla cream to simulate a Cinnabon. All in all, I would highly recommend this restaurant and I feel that it is certainly worth the wait. I'll definitely be back.
