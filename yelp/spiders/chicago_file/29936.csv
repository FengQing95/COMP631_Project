Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting Chicago from New York and chose this as the destination to try deep dish pizza. The spinach stuffed bread appetizer was really, really good. The pizza, although good for what it was, to me, was underwhelming. Also - you have to wait 45 minutes for the deep dish, just as an FYI if you are in a rush! The service here was top notch.
