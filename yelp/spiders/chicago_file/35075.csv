Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Had a salad to begin.  As the waiter said, it has the "Bentley of bacon" on top.  He was not kidding.  That has to be the best bacon I've had in my life.  Words can't describe it.  I ordered the bone-in, dry aged rib eye.  My gf had the petite fillet.  Both were fantastic.  However, I should have gone with my standard of either side of the t-bone.  I'm more of a fillet or New York guy.
