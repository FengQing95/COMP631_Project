Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////In terms of deep dish pizza, this is pretty good. But I am not gonna lie to you, I haven't had much experience with this type of pizza. I am more of the nyc thin slice type of gal. The butter crust here really puts it over the top for me. I am not the biggest fan of the wine menu though so -1. Also, I heard other places are better. But I have yet to try them. I will compare to other Chicago deep dish places at some point and let y'all know.
