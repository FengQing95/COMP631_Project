Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////On Lou's Pizza, I didn't find anything worth the trouble. It's basically a flavor-dense disk fried in butter, then covered in too much heavy cheese to make any sense at all. It's basically a handheld casserole of very little flavor. There's no herbs, no richness of tomato, just crusty buttery dough covered in cheese - then veggie, then the meat, and finally the sauce. It's a cheese casserole plain and simple. I even exchanged one just to be sure, and they all taste the same.
