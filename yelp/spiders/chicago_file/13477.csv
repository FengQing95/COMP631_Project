Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So we arrived around 1:30pm and this place was packed, we had to wait five to ten minutes for a seat, but that wasn't a problem. We started off our meal with two beers and an order of wings. They had a special ranch sauce that was very plain, there wasn't much of a ranch taste. But the wings still had a kick and were really good!
