Smoque BBQ////I gave this place 5 stars because 6 or higher isn't an option :) If you love bbq and are in the area, you gotta try it! I live in Texas and grew up in north Alabama so I've had some of the best bbq in the country and the guys at Smoque really do these regional meats right! I had a little of almost all the meats and loved them all! Great job guys!! :)
