Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a deep dish and cheese sticks to tide us over. Don't be in a hurry, deep dish took about 40 minutes...but worth the wait. Best. Pizza. Never had deep dish and here you are. So delicious. The sauce is on top and big tomato chunks, a layer of sausage, cheese and buttery crust. Large was 7 slices of amazing.
