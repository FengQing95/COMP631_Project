Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The Manager did offer to get me something else, and I ended up getting salmon. I obviously came to this restaurant to have a steak, but the salmon wasn't done quite right either. Way too raw, and the middle was cold. I did ask for medium but by that time I just wanted to leave.
