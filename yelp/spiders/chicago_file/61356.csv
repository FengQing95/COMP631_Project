Smoque BBQ////Hands down the Best BBQ in town, we love BBQ, so we've tried lots of BBQ places around Chicagoland, but nothing beats Smoque.  Not only do they BBQ it the right way, the reasoning is also great, the meat is so tender and tasty that you don't really need the BBQ sauce.  Besides the meat, their side dishes are fantastic, I love their bake beans, I always order an extra order of bake beans.  The only problem is the line, you have to be prepared to wait in line if you came during weekend, but you can remedy that by doing carryout and calling ahead.
