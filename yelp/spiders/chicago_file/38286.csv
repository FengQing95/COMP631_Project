Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is a serious date spot with phenomenal steaks. The best I've ever had. I had the 16oz RibEye with a side of asparagus and it was perfect. The restaurant is a more new-age Steakhouse, compared to the traditional top stakehouses like Joe's. The basement is very dark and romantic, great for a significant other or Â to impress someone
