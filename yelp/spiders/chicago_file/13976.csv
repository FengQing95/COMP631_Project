Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Deep-dish pizza, I owe you an apology. For years I thought lesser of you than your cousin from New York, probably due to the pasty and forgettable offerings from chain pizza joints scattered throughout the Midwest. But here in Chicago is the real-deal thing that slapped my taste buds upside the head and made them call it "Sally" and beg for mercy. This pizza is simply unlike any other pizza I've ever had. Living in New York for two years, I found that the vast majority of pizza places (usually with the name "Ray" in the restaurant title) were pretty interchangeable. But the deliciousness I had here is truly one-of-a-kind. So, which is better, New York or Chicago pizza? IT'S A TRICK QUESTION. They are two separate and delicious things. The "classic" that I had at Lou Malnati's is a sit-down-and-savor type of meal, not something you absentmindedly nosh while watching terrible reality shows. This was like a beautiful crimson pie stuffed with meat and other goodness. I'm a husky gent, and even I could only finish two enormous pieces before being stuffed beyond belief. That's OK, though, because it meant I had pizza for days and days. And when I finished my last piece back home in Cleveland, I almost wept, because it meant that I live six hours away from this treasure.
