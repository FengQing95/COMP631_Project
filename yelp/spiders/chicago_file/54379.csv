Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Anyway, our waiter was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. We let him know about all my allergies right away (gluten, nuts, shellfish ... yes my life sucks) and he immediately offered me gluten free bread, gave me the gluten free menu, and let the kitchen know about all of my allergies. It is SO nice when restaurants are this accommodating to allergies. Â
