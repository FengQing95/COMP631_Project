Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I came here for dinner with my bf during the work week. This place has a very dim, laid back and loungey atmosphere. The cocktails were on point. And the complimentary bread and butter was delicious. We had a sampling of oysters to start, which is never a bad decision. We skipped the bone marrow and bacon since it looked almost exactly like how they prepare it at Au Cheval. I had a medium rare classic ribeye. My bf ordered the new york strip, cooked medium. Unfortunately, his steak came medium rare and more bloody than mine, which turned him off. I told him to have it cooked a bit more, but he didn't want to make a fuss and ended up not eating as much as he usually does. We also had the elote style corn since everyone raved about it. I found it a little too rich. I wouldn't get it again. My bf said when he re-heated his steak in the broiler the next day, it was delicious. But, I'm not going to take that into consideration for this review, lol. Overall, it was an okay experience. Nothing amazing, unfortunately.
