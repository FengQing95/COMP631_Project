Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great atmosphere, great menu, great sangria. Make reservations well in advance for Fri/Sat. Good for parties and large groups because you can share tapas and pitchers of sangria. Be sure to try the bacon wrapped dates, olives, paella, and plates of sliced cheeses and meats. Also good for late-night dining, as they are open until midnight.
