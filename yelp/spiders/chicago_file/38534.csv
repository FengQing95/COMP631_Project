Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bone marrow exceptionally delicious. French martini was sweeter than expected. Steaks were medium rare as asked for but one of our steak corners was burnt! My only other complaint was how dark the place was. I can appreciate a calm and dim candlelit dinner, but it was almost too dark to read the menu or see our food. It wasnt uncommon to see people from another table using their phone flashlights to see off their menu. Ordered a grand tower seafood combo and was pleasantly surprised by the amount and quality of the fresh oysters, shrimp, and king crab. They also came with an assortment of dipping sauces and a fresh ceviche. Plates and silverware were exchanged for new ones between each course and waters were frequently refilled. Baked goat cheese came hot and savory. Was served with plenty of bread to eat with. This was definitely worth the high price tag and would come again for a special occasion.
