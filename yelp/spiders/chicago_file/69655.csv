Little Goat Diner////We were seated at the long counter which overlooks the kitchen.  Service was VERY slow, and I am wondering if it was where we were seated or just typical for Little Goat.  If I go back and service is this slow again (waiting 15 minutes for a cup of coffee early morning is inexcusable), I will have to go down to three stars.  Also, they need more coat racks to hang longer coats.
