Art Institute of Chicago////They have all kinds of art here as well.  You can easily get lost in here an entire day if you're the art lover.. there's something for everyone.  The temporary exhibits change up often, so you can always go back to see something new.  I'm so happy to have a museum like this in my city by the lake.
