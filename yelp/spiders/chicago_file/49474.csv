Smoque BBQ////Does this place need more reviews to prove they got good bbq? No, but I'm gonna say i was really pleased with my meal there and hope the owners are delighted with yet another good review. I had the rib combo with the mac and cheese, slaw, and brisket chili (of course, with a friend). It was all tasty and even though it was so far away from where I live and Â it was rainy like crazy going back home, I was full and happy with my meal that I didn't even care. I did also have a food coma afterwards.
