Little Goat Diner////I ordered the crumpets and chorizo and my husband got the corned beef hash.  He liked his but it wasn't his favorite.  Mine on the other hand was fantastic.  He kept trying to steal from my plate which normally I would allow but not in this case.  I would have a hard time coming back and not ordering the same thing.  There's a lot of delicious looking things on this menu.  I will definitely be back to try them all!
