Little Goat Diner////Fried Pickles and Onion Rings - were... fried pickles and onion rings - how can you go wrong with this one? Unfortunately, we didn't get to eat this dish right after it was prepared as it was delivered to us right before we were about to leave, but even as we ate them later on, at home, they were good! They are served with curry mayo and ranch - which I loved.  I love onion rings and my partner loves pickles so it was kind of a must get in our books.  Maybe it wasn't the best combination with our breakfast choices, but really, who cares?
