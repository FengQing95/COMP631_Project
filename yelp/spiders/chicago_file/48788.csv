Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been a patron of Ba Ba Reeba for years so I was ecstatic to learn that they held events when I was planning my rehearsal dinner. I worked with multiple staff members throughout the 10 month process who were all attentive and quick to answer all emails and calls. I was able to customize the entire menu and drink options. My 32 guests had an incredible time and everyone is still raving about it. I highly recommend their rooms for your small gatherings such as showers, rehearsals, and even weddings. Thank you to the Ba Ba Reeba and Lettuce Entertain You team!
