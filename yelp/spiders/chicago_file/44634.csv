Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service is horrible nowadays. When you have a reservation, you still have to wait 20 - 45 mins. Ridiculous! What is the point of having a reservation? Not to mention, even if you call to alter your reservation days before they will not do it. I asked to add an extra person to an 8 o clock rez and they told me no, the next available time would be 9:30 - it was only for a table of 4 (seems simple to add a person from 3 to 4).
