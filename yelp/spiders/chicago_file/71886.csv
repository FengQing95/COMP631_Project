Little Goat Diner////My second experience was almost as good. This time I ordered the Parathas Burrito. I really can't put into words how great it was. My boyfriend thought the same and he loves eating animals. We ended with the Pb&j pie, which a super smart decision. I couldn't believe how they were able to fully capture the flavor of a Pb&j in the pie. I don't know how they did it but they did.
