Smoque BBQ////We got there around 4:30 on a Sunday and a super friendly server greeted us and we were able to be seated outdoors. Wait time to order was 2-3 minutes, and food was another 5-7. My girlfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which she enjoyed. I had the sliced brisket with a 1/4 slab of ribs, mac and cheese, and peach cobbler. The brisket was absolutely the best I have had in my entire life. Perfect rub, great bark, and the smoke was just heavy enough to give you some of the flavor from the wood, but light enough that you could taste the meat. I grabbed a fork, however it was not necessary. The brisket was fall apart tender, my hands worked perfectly. The ribs were very good as well, however they were really overshadowed by the brisket. The mac was cheesy, but not overbearing, and the baked crust on the top was tasty. The peach cobbler was decent. The crust was awesome however I'm 99% positive it was made with canned peaches..they had somewhat of a rubbery texture. The sides did seem small, however I was barely able to finish my plate, so they were indeed appropriately sized.
