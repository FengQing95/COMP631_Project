Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'd say from a "fancy" perspective, this is a hair below some of the "famous" Chicago steakhouses - while there aren't white tablecloths adorning the wood tables, they also are pretty affordable in my opinion. I mention this because I'm very cognizant about the "bang-for-buck" factor of any restaurant.
