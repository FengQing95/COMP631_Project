Art Institute of Chicago////This was probably only the second real art museum I've ever gotten to go to, but I absolutely loved it! This place is huge and full of such a huge variety of pieces! I tend to lean more towards the older art styles, but they have tons of modern stuff too. Â I could totally undertsand someone needing an entire day (or couple of days) to really see everything they want to see here. Admission is a little on the expensive side, but they offer a lot of deals (discounts for Illinois and Chicago Residents, and the CityPass for those visiting who will also be going to other big attractions).
