The Purple Pig////My biggest criticism would be that the service was too rushed - we kept getting asked if we were done with our dishes when we were still nibbling our way through the last few bites, or were just taking a break from eating. Maybe this is due to the fact that the restaurant is so popular and it was getting busy so they were trying to be efficient. It's a subjective thing, but I prefer to eat my meals with a more relaxed pace.
