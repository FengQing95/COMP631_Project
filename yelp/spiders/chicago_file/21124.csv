Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friends and I came here for lunch last Saturday since everyone had raved about this pizza in Chicago.  The wait was about 20 minutes to sit outside.  We were instructed to order the pizza before we sat down, as this will make things more efficient.  We ordered a caesar salad to start, which was good, but the tomatoes in it were a little odd, and a personal pizza of one of their specialties with sausage in it, and a medium sized cheese deep dish. The pizza was such a disappointment. It was not what we were picturing.   No flavor inside the pizza, just stuffed with cheese.  Not to mention the birds outside were EVERYWHERE.  A bird laded on our table 3x and practically sat in our pie on the table.  Needless to say, we did not eat anymore.  This is definitely a tourist trap.  I will stick to my NY-style pizza.
