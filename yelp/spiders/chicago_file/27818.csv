Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I wish I liked deep dish pizza more than I actually do. I bet I would really enjoy this place a lot more. This restaurant was suggested to me by my friend who is a local here and I can see why. We came around lunch time and the place is super homey. Lots of sports stuff on the wall and the service was great. We had the veggie deep dish and the meat deep dish. I enjoyed the veggie one more, but I definitely did not finish my single slice. It was overwhelmingly deep for me: lots of red sauce and lots of cheese. I just think I prefer a substantial equal proportion of cheese, sauce, and crust. We also had the pizza chips and dip. Why did I get pizza chips if I was going to order pizza as an entree, you ask? Yeah, I'd question myself too, but I thoroughly enjoyed it! I liked all the dips and we were still snacking on it after our pizza. Def something I recommend!
