Smoque BBQ////Sinfully delicious. After seeing this place on "Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives" we had to try it. I got the chicken which was cooked to perfection, and mac & cheese which was heavy but amazing. There were only two downsides for me - no alcohol with your bbq and there was not a single vegetable on the menu.
