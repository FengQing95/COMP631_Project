Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came to Chicago for a week-long business trip and someone suggested Lou Malnati's for a good pizza.  I checked the reviews on yelp (good overall) and proceeded to order a medium, thin, sausage and roni.  Took about an hour to deliver to the hotel which is what the person on the phone told me.  Not sure what happened either in transit or during cooking but the pizza arrived dry, cold and tasted horrible.  It was like someone sucked all the moisture out of the thing.  It was tough to choke down.  Some reviews said they have a brick oven but mine sure didn't taste like it.  I have had cheap, frozen pizza's much better than this.  It may be just a one-time thing that happened to me judging from all of the other reviews but I will say this...I will never go there or order for delivery again.
