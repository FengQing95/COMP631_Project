Art Institute of Chicago////It's the bloody Art Institute of Chicago, people! What do you think! It's amazing. C'mon! Anyone who doesn't like this place is a whiner of Biblical proportions. If a whole room of Van Goughs, Monets and Picassos isn't good enough for you then check out the miles of renaissance masterpieces. What? painting isn't your thing? Then check out all the pristine Greek vases and sculpture. Still not impressed? then blame the American education system for not teaching you how to appreciate the aesthetic of art. I love it.
