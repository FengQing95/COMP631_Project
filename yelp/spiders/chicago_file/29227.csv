Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Holy Pizza!!! This was the BEST pizza we think we ever had! We ordered delivery and it came piping hot and delicious! There was only 3 of us - but a large pizza fed us well for dinner, and 2 late night snacks! The deep dish Malnati was amazing and I highly suggest it! The 3 cheese bread was delicious too!
