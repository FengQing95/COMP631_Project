Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Highly overrated and underwhelming. Subpar pancakes masked in a glaze of berries and other nonsense. Once you actually taste the pancakes, they are not that great. Unless you want to feel like you're about to burst with sugar, don't waste your time. And time you will waste, as the average wait time is an hour and a half.
