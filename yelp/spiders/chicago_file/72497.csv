Little Goat Diner////Service is great and the space has a vintage dinner nod, but with modern flair. Â They take reservations, which I recommend because the place is always busy. However, I rarely plan ahead, and frequently get seated at open space at the bar. This is actually more enjoyable, so you can watch the food being prepared.
