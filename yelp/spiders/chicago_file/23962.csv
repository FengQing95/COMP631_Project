Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting from Los Angeles and just had pizza delivered to my hotel. It was very good. I ordered a small personal pizza so by the time I made it to the hotel it wasn't super hot but I can't really fault anyone for that. Lots of ingredients all blended together very nicely. One of my biggest beef's about certain pizzas is when you lift up a slice and the ingredients slide off because they're not intermingled. That was not the case with this pizza it was quite good
