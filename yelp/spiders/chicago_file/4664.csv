The Purple Pig////We started with the recommended roasted bone marrow with an herb salad. We were provided 4 pieces of crusty bread. The bone was large and we used our provided bread quickly and were soon offered more which we happily accepted. The herb salad was perfectly seasoned with a Â light, tangy dressing which perfectly complimented the marrow.
