Art Institute of Chicago////I had to complete an assignment that required me to visit the Art Institute. Wow is pretty much all I can say. It was the most rewarding experience and I know I will be visiting more often. There is so much to see that it would take several visits and even then you wouldn't have enough time due to how often some the exhibits are changed. I would suggest everyone visit at least once if you've never been. It's a wonderful experience and you don't have to be an art connoisseur to enjoy it.
