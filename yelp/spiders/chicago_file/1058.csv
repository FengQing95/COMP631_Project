Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I am rarely tempted by sprawling brunch menus because my eyes are immediately drawn to eggs benedict dishes, but somehow Wildberry managed to capture my rarely-present sweet tooth and convinced me to order the Berry Bliss Crepes. I thought to myself, "Well, I'm craving something sweet, and the crepes should be nice and light and I won't go into a food coma after lunch." Well, they were sweet, and they were nice and light, but the fact that there were THREE on the plate put a wrench in my "no food coma" plans. They were so good, I just couldn't stop myself...My lunch mates were equally impressed with their omelets and sides of specialty pancakes, and their portions were equally as large as mine. Whew, so much food.
