Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I know that I have already mentioned this a few times but it is fun to go to a Tapas restaurant with a large group because you get to enjoy so many dishes. I want to highlight A handful of my favorite dishes from the meal last night. I would definitely say the Patatas Bravas, Shrimp with garlic sauce was excellent, the Burrata was super soft and sweet, the short rib which was melt in your mouth good and the Brussel sprouts salad was stellar too!! I also really enjoyed the sangria as we got a pitcher of blackberry sangria. On top of excellent food, we dined at a round table next to the window facing Halsted white and enjoyed the beautiful night in Chicago. The service was also top notch as our Waiter was super quick and the Manager made this is a very special night too. I would only think that this restaurant does extremely well financially because of its size, speed of distributing dishes, quality of food, and maintaining and even improving their quality reputation over the last 35 years.
