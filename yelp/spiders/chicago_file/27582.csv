Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm a big fan of the Malnati Chicago Classic, which has sausage and extra cheese. I've had it with added pepperoni and jalape√±os too. The "Lou" is also fantastic, despite the fact that it contains no meat. It's really a special pie that tastes amazing, so I recommend you try it even if you are a dyed in the wool carnivore like me.
