Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We then were taken downstairs and seated in a nice booth. It was much smaller, slightly darker and had some stuffed trophy animal heads on the wall. But instead of the nice Sinatra style music (upstairs) they were playing some nasty hip hop and it was significantly louder.  That single-handedly ruined the Bavette's experience.  The service was amazing and our food was delicious and cocktails were great but the music killed it.  I'd never sit down there again.
