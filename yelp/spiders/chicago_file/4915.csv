The Purple Pig////We came on a Friday night, so we knew we would be waiting. It just happened to be raining that day. When we walked up we could tell they were busy, we put our name on the wait and decided to stay to wait they had a tarp we off area with heaters; perfect for a cold rainy night.  I think we were quoted 30 minutes, but didn't even wait half of that.
