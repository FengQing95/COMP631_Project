Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great service and fun space -- definitely felt like I was out on the town. There were some unusual patrons, however -- the table of girls next to us were ordering vodka Sprites and sent back the duck terrine because they didn't know what a terrine was. Hopefully they won't be back!
