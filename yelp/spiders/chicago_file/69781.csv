Little Goat Diner////We happened upon this place while in town for the weekend and didn't get out to dinner until almost 10pm, so we got a table rather quickly .  It was still packed at that time of night but the service was impeccable and our waitress was clearly a fan of the food.  The BF had the Sloppy Club and I had the Goat Cheese Fries.  Both were amaze-a-balls!  Super YUM!!  We finished with a milkshake and a smile.  It was so so so good.
