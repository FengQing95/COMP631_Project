Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The service system is the problem, more than anything else. So look, they aren't going to be able to seat you for awhile, but they let you order before being seated. There is a small bar and you can order a drink. So I handed the bartender a card, since I didn't know how long we were going to be waiting. But there isn't a seat at the bar, and we have to sit behind the bar on a bench. We get a call that our table is ready... and present ourselves to the hostess with our drinks in hand and she takes us upstairs. And it is a way upstairs.
