Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The spicy potatoes, beef skewers, empanadas and bacon wrapped dates are my favorites - to name a few. The sangria is tasty and a good choice if you're not looking for a buzz. Â The environment is overall pleasant - especially in the summer, but again, it is pretty crowded and often like walking through a maze to get to your table or to get to the bathroom.
