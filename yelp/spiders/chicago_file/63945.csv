Smoque BBQ////It was really hard to discern the better of the two, but the baby back just slightly edged out the STL ribs. Both were outstanding. Just as a note, my husband liked these second best for the crawl, as he said they tasted a bit of liquid smoke. Apparently, either he was high, or I'm totally ok with that. Either way, I'm so happy I know where I am getting ribs from now on. The sides were just ok for us, tho I did really like those BBQ beans, and my 2 bites of the cobbler. But this was most definitely all about the meat, baby.
