Smoque BBQ////Great food.  Sometimes Yelp hits one out of the park.  I was visiting some good friends in Chicago and Yelp'd some BBQ places.  Smoque looked good and off we went.  The decor is bad.  Cheap paint on the walls, cheap tables and chairs, and so what!  The food is so good I wouldn't care if I had to sit on a cactus.  I travel a lot, and these are my favorite ribs I can remember eating.  BBQ is a very personal thing and I'm sure that if you grew up on a certain kind of BBQ you can always find fault with BBQ that is done different then you are used to.  But don't be a sucka.  This place is great.  Ribs, sausage, brisket, all good.
