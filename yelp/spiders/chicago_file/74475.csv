Little Goat Diner////This review is for the 2nd floor private dining. This was such an amazing experience! Even tho it was for work, I had a great time. I mean, I probably wouldn't have been (or will not ever in the future be) able to experience this again, since it's for a larger group. And it's kind of expensive..
