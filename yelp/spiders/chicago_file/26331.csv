Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is our third trip to this particular location.  Past two have been perfect.  This visit was off the mark.  Ordered a Lou classic.  Toppings were lacking, crust was hard.  Top and bottom and cool to the touch.  Almost sent it back but we ate it.   Salad was good.    Service was adequate given the amount of people and time.   Seating was quick and 30 min ahead of schedule.
