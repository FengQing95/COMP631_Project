Art Institute of Chicago////This is one of the better art. museums I have visited. I went during the Picasso exhibit, which was above average. The collection of impressionist paintings is excellent. There are various collections offer interesting perspectives. It is rather busy in the summer, so go early. The price is affordable and the place is huge, so plan four plus hours.
