Lou Malnati's Pizzeria//// I ordered the personal deep dish cheese pizza and a side of salad with the creamy lemon garlic dressing. That salad dressing is really what ruined this lunch for me. It was neither lemony nor garlicky and just tasted like straight-up mayo. It even had the consistency of globby mayo straight from the jar, it was that thick. And they just plopped it right on the salad like you would a scoop of frickin' ice cream. I took two bites of that salad, the second one just to make sure I wasn't imagining things, before putting my fork down and pushing the plate away. I was so grossed out.
