Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting cousins living close to Chicago. They recommended this place. It did not disappoint! Tasty and juicy calamari...Cobb salad with perfect amount of dressing, Chicago-style deep dish pizzas with generous portions of meat and cheese, tasty sauce and crunchy crust. My goodness! I needed a second stomach! Everything was so delish! If you are in Chicago, must stop and eat here!
