Art Institute of Chicago////I've always loved the Art Institute.  It beats the museums in LA and it is a close rival to some of the ones in New York.  Renaissance, they have it. If you want to do dark ages, you can see it.  Monet? A room full of it. I could not believe they had an entire room full of original Monets.  Jackson Pollock, Warhol, Johns, yes please!
