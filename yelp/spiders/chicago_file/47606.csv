Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Recommendations: For starters, the bacon wrapped shrimp is a petite plate but nevertheless, delicious. I also really like their Octopus a la Plancha, fried calamari, shrimp with garlic, and chicken kebab. As for dessert, their empanda and caramelized banana, let's just say, I ordered a second. Keep in mind, these food are a bit more salty than usual because it was meant to be served with some sort of alcohol/drinks.
