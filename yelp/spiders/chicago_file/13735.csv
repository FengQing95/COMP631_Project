Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place was really quite good for the price. The service was a little slow, but it was quite busy. The deep dish pizzas were a little soggy, but if you like a lot of tomato sauce then you'll probably like it. The Buff-a-Lou wings, despite the ridiculous name, were really bangin. Better than the pizza in my opinion. Our waitress was really sweet, too.
