Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was our third deep dish pizza restaurant to try during our 4-day vacation in Chicago, and third one's the charm. It was my favorite because of the soft crust , lots of cheese and the tasty sausage patty they put in the pizza. We got a small Chicago classic and loved it. We also ordered the Chicken Louie and devoured all those carbs. The pizza takes a while to cook but I am so glad we came here. Better than Giordano's and Pizano's in my opinion.
