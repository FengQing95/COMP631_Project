Smoque BBQ////If you're looking for a respectable, quality BBQ place then this is it. Their entire menu has been perfected, the sides, the brisket, the ribs and the pork; everything is outstanding. I frequently travel all the way from the suburbs into this beautiful neighborhood to have a superb lunch or dinner. You won't regret having an affordable and delicious meal at Smoque.
