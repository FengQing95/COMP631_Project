Smoque BBQ////I think what really puts this over the top though is the sides are actually really good.  For instance the baked beans are top notch as is the cole slaw.  A lot of BBQ places have good meat but stumble on the other things.  Chicago Q is a particularly egregious example, though their free starters (OMG pickles) are an exception.
