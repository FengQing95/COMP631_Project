The Purple Pig////Honestly giving this a two star because we received SO MANY recommendations to come here and after three weeks in Chicago, this was the worst meal we've had. We got the chicken thighs, the pork shoulder and the broccoli. The broccoli was ok but the main dishes were so salty, they weren't edible. I couldn't finish my dish and my boyfriend was starving so ate his. Honestly we just had higher expectations and this was a pricey place! They also took our dinners we hardly touched, didn't offer to pay for even one, or to wrap them. Not that we wanted them but like clearly they weren't good so make it right in some way. They did get two stars was because the staff was nice and attentive and we got in with no problem. Also very clean. Edit**** one star because we were both sick for the next 24 hours.
