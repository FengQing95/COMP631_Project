Little Goat Diner////I got the pork belly potato side and the chocolate chip pancakes and I was in heaven! The pork belly with the potatoes were crunchy, juicy, and salty and needed no extra sauce! The pancake was huge and the chocolate was in the center so you could spread them out as you'd like. Their syrup wasn't overly sweet too :-)
