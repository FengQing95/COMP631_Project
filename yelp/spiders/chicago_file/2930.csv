The Purple Pig////When is it ever an off-peak time to dine at the Purple Pig?  We were quoted a 30-40 min wait time at 1pm on a summer Friday.  What better way to rev up an appetite than to run back to PP from Do-Rite Donuts after receiving a phone call that your table is ready (not that we had any experience with that or anything)?
