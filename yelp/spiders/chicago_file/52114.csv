Smoque BBQ////I'd give five stars, except that I didn't get to try the baby backs, and that's gotta be my test.  But everything else we tried--the St. Louis ribs, the sliced brisket, and the pulled pork sandwich--was great.  The barbecue sauces are awesome.  Both have a very zingy vinegar taste, and I love that.  The sides were incredible as well:  mayonnaise-less slaw, baked beans, mac and cheese, and cornbread.  None of it was bad.  In fact, I liked far better than our other Chicago BBQ foray a year or so ago.  I can say without hesitation that we'll go back to Smoque, and I had no idea I liked BBQ this much.
