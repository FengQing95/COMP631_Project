Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First up, I made a 6:00 reservation through Yelp/ OpenTable which was incredibly easy.  It turned out we were going to be about 30 minutes late.  I called to adjust but the host told me they were full at 6:30 but she would note the reservation and we would be seated as soon as possible.  We got there shortly before 6:30 and were seated almost immediately.
