Little Goat Diner////Visited Little Goat this past weekend for brunch and overall I was pleased. First, I got there around 10:30 on Sunday and it was already running at about an hour and half wait for a party of four. I always seem to be the only person I know on time for brunch (or anything) so I was thrilled with the "we'll text when your table is ready policy".  This means my early riser self can come in and put in my parties' name while my slower moving friends catch up. Perfect.  The host staff which consisted of three ladies up front were immediately welcoming and friendly despite the rush. This was a big relief for me, as I already boycott many hot brunch spots because of rude attitude at the door.  With my name on the waiting list and none of my friends there anyway, I headed to the bakery side, which is separate from the diner side and has its own entrance.  Wasn't really impressed with the fancy three dollar coffee, however, I enjoyed sitting at the bar and reading the paper while waiting for the rest of my party to show up.  Again more friendly service at the bar (its tiny, maybe eight seats) and some fun gift shop type items to browse. You also get a fun a view of the bakery, which I enjoyed.  When my friends showed up we went across the street to Hay Market for Bloody Mary's while we waited.  After about an hour and 45 minutes I called them, as I had not received a text to my phone. No record of my name being on the list. Yikes. No worries, they told us to come on over and they would get us a table ASAP.  We walked in, were apologized to right away (I guess they had taken my phone number wrong) and seated. Yay! Crisis averted by excellent service.
