Smoque BBQ////Actually it didn't take us long to eat because you want to scarf down these goodies. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with one side (mac and cheese) and a "taste" of Texas sausage, plus the complimentary cole slaw. The juicy, succulent pork arrived atop a forgettable soft roll, with a choice of Memphis (sweet) or Carolina (vinegar) sauces in small cups.
