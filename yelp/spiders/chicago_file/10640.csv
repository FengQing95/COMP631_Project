Art Institute of Chicago////I was coming into Chicago and did not stay in a hotel but I wanted to experience the Art Institute of Chicago AND walk around downtown without bringing my luggage around with me. Well this place is a blessing because they can keep your luggage, backpack, coats, etc. for $1/item!!!
