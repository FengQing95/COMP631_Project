Little Goat Diner////Breakfast: Not as many desirable venues as there used to be, and certainly less options than there are for dinner. I'm not usually out of the house this early, so so I decided to take advantage, and try LG for breakfast.  I had the "Parathas Burrito" (Indian flatbread, sunnyside eggs, avocado bean salad, chili pepper sauce),  hash browns, and coffee. The hash browns were the first properly-done restaurant HBs I've had in years. (Perhaps because they're real potatoes, they don't need to be over-done to -seem- real.)  The "Burrito" looked small on my plate, but after seeing most of it still waiting for me after quite few bites, I realized it was deep rather than broad. All together, as much food as I could handle, and all of it, (including the coffee), a major cut above typical diner fare. (My waitress, Mallory, is a doll!)
