Art Institute of Chicago////Having lived in Chicago for a couple of years prior to my now 17yr tenure in Las Vegas. This is one of the spots I gravitate towards. What better than revolving art? Where else can you see American Gothic to stand and marvel for however long you may need. Or the painting of Dorian Gray. Remembrant. That guy Picasso. Magritte.
