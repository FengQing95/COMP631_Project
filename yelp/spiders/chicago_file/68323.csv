Little Goat Diner////Negatives: all the other food we had. We started out with the fried pickles and onion rings. They were disappointing -- ate two and left the rest. For the main course, I had the chickpea salad (blah) and my friend had the kimchee & bacon & eggs & pancakes asian style breakfast tasty thing.
