Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////You should definitely make reservations because now this place stays packed. You have to book days in advance because the reservations go fast. I brought my friend from out of town here. We didn't have reservations (because I tried 2 days in advance and they were booked). Come to find out, there were 2 wedding rehearsal dinners there. The wait was well over an hour, however, we were lucky enough to snag seats at the bar when a couple left. Since it was so crowded with people waiting for tables, we couldn't really enjoy our time there. We were crammed, getting bumped, and it was really loud.
