Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you are reading a review for Lou Malnati's to determine whether or not you want to try it, I will assume you are visiting Chicago. This is one of the greatest pizza staples in the entire Chicagoland area. They are renowned for their deep dish, and it is truly excellent. One of the more out of the norm things they do is their sausage deep dish pizza- you don't get little chunks of sausage, there is a giant, unbroken wheel of it! Sausage in every bite! If you are looking for something other than deep dish, they have some other great options for you: their thin crust is great, with great thin slices and a very crunchy crust to top it off. If pizza is not your thing, they make a ridiculously good Caesar salad (just don't count the calories, you may hate yourself). My personal favorite here is "The Lou" which is a buttercrust deep dish pizza with mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes, three cheeses, and a blend of spices that compliment it all perfectly. If you want to experience true Chicago pizza, this is one of the top two. Be warned, as it is so wildly popular, it can get very crowded. And don't forget that it does take a little while longer to fully cook a behemoth of a pizza that is their deep dish.
