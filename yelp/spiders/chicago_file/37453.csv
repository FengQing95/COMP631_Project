Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Everything we have ordered here has been delicious.  The bone marrow in particular comes in a very generous portion. It was actually almost too much for the 2 of us (and we're pigs so thought we'd be fine).  While we still finished the entire dish, I'd probably recommend only ordering it if you're a group of 3-4 people.
