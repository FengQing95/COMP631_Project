Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am absolutely disgusted by this pizza that I had delivered to me and my co-worker. I am not going to go in, but the picture is enough to see that the pizza is clearly burnt and felt like we were eating crackers with hard cheese and some sort of meat on it. I can't believe they are delivering pizzas like this from the great and mighty Lou Malnati's. You should be ashamed for this sort of quality. Will never order from this place or dine again. Just order from Pizano's.
