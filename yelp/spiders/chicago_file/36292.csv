Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////On to the food, which is what we're here for.  I had the 22 oz dry aged bone in rib eye.  When asked how I like my steak cooked, typically, I like to let the chef decide how to cook the steak since they know the meat better.  Here, they will not give you a recommendation because they believe it is "pretentious" in assuming a customer's tastes and want them to enjoy themselves to the fullest.  I disagree with this notion, but told them to cook it medium rare.  The steak came out perfectly.  In fact, most of the meat was medium rare in an even cook, rather than in layers of temperature like -- (hard crust outside, medium, medium rare, medium, hard crust).  I also had the broccoli and sweet potato as sides.  Both were perfectly cooked with the right amount of seasoning.  It was all very simple and not too complicated.
