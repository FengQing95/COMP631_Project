Little Goat Diner////A new favorite in west loop! Everything I had was delicious, and plenty more on the menu I'm excited to come back to try! Had the Brussels sprouts and okonomiyaki that we're both tasty. Topped it all off with a chocolate sundae which was incredible. All the staff we encountered was also super friendly. Will be back here soon
