Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Really disappointed this morning.  It's the 22nd of Feb.  I called to make a reservation for March 8 for eight people.  Not 20 people, just 8.  I was told that they have very few tables that will host a large group and cant get in until 9:30.  What?  This place holds a ton of tables and I'm requesting 3 weeks out.  Is the demand for booking a full month in advance really there?    I asked if the ones they did have available were all currently booked and could not get a strait answer no matter how the question was asked.  My low review does not have anything to do with the food or the service.  I have eaten here many times (with groups of 8 or more) and actually have recommended this restaurant to many people traveling into the city.  My low review is that an attempt to help us make our reservation was not made at all and I could not get an answer on why (other than they dont have many group tables).  On to one of the other many other fabulous Tapas spots....Cafe,  you let me down. :(
