Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Next we ordered 2 BEEF TENDERLOIN & BLUE CHEESE, 2 BEEF SKEWER W/ HORSERADISH AND RED ONIONS, 2 BRAISED SHORT RIB W/ MASHED POTATOES, and OCTOPUS. The beef tenderloin was fantastic...very juicy and medium rare (just how I like my beef). I did not particularly care for the beef skewer, it tasted a bit charred and was not very juicy. The braised short rib was so tender and yummy...and the mashed potatoes weren't bad either. I didn't try the octopus (not a big seafood person).
