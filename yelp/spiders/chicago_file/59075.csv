Smoque BBQ////I don't eat meat, however my boyfriend will not stop sneaking to Smoque BBQ during his lunch breaks. I might be getting tired of the very fragrant, sweet scent of brisket, but he has not one bit. He was even thinking about buying some to bring to his mom under the guise of his inner master chef, though I'm not sure that she'll buy his little bluff. Anyway, as a vegetarian, I do really enjoy the mac & cheese.
