Smoque BBQ////Attended my Nieces Daughter's Birthday Party in Park Ridge.  The Event was catered by Smoque BBQ, Heard of it and was happy that I was going to get a chance to enjoy their faire. We had Pork, Ribs, Sides, Brisket, Chicken to choose from, not to mention all the extra side dishes (Beans, Mac & Cheese, Potato Salad, Coleslaw...) they ordered.  I & my Family are Fan's!  Delicious is an understatement for someone that truly enjoys good, moist & favorable BBQ.  Looks like they are going to be around for a long time. When in Chicago, near Pulaski Road & south of Irving Park Road, or cater your next event! You must stop on by.  You may have a wait, but definitely worth it.  Cheers!
