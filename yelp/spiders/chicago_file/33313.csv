Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went there for anniversary dinner. Wonderful atmosphere, excellent service. We had horrible seating and my food was so-so. Had the pleasure of staring at a brick wall and tables are very close together.  Ordered short rib fettuccine with mushrooms, got 4 mushrooms. The waiter brought more and tried to make things better, but my mood was pretty much in a bad place at that point.  Disappointing anniversary dinner. Not going back.
