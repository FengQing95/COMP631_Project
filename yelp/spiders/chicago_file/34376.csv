Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was amazing.  The duck terrine was flavorful and tangy with the infusions of goat cheese to compliment the duck, the grilled break was warm and soft while still holding the desired crispiness.  My steak was perfectly cooked med rare.  No need for the seasoning salt that comes on the side.
