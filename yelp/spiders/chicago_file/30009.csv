Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My boyfriend and I came here on Saturday a little after 5PM and were seated immediately at a booth. Lou's is a casual, cozy pizza restaurant. We ordered the calamari and a medium deep dish (half The Malnati Chicago Classic and half The Lou - yes you can do half and half!). The appetizer took 25 minutes and the pizza 45 minutes to be served.
