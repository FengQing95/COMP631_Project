Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So unfortunately, by the time we got OUR pizza delivered, it had been sitting in the box for a bit longer than a normal delivery time, and the crust had time to get a little soggy. Â The flavors were good, but compared to my trusty Little Star Pizza in SF, I can't give LM more than 3 stars.
