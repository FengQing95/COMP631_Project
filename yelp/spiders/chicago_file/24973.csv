Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////MOZZARELLA STICKS: terrible.  awful.  stay away.  It tasted like they barely made it out of the freezer before getting on the plate.  I think the appetizer menu exists only because the deep dish takes ~45 min so they want you to have something to munch on, even if it's awful.
