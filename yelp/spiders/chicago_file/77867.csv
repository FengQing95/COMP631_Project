Little Goat Diner////Great ambience and fantastic servicr, perfect for a late Saturday brunch! The booths were comfy and there was plenty of sunlight. Servers were very friendly, quick, and attentive. As a vegetarian, I found it satisfyingly healthy, but not necessarily the best food I've had in Chicago. Honestly, the food I had was slightly bland and needed a little more added to it. Drinks were also decent, but not absolutely the best, but the coffee was quite satisfying. I would recommend this as a safe option for a brunch or warm meal in this area!
