Art Institute of Chicago////Then I went downstairs to the photography exhibit, where I was surprised to see 20th-century portraits by Yousuf Karsh--the same exhibit that I had seen at the Boston Public Library in December.  The AIC version has about three times as many photographs:  portraits of writers, statesmen, scientists, artists, celebrities of all stripes, many of the heavy-hitters of the middle third of the century.  Karsh's lighting effects are very evocative.
