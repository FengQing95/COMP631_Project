Smoque BBQ////The place can't be beat for BBQ in Chicago. Most of the bad reviews seem to come from people who thought it was some nicer sit-down restaurant or people who base it off of their personal idiosyncratic tastes. The brisket is amazing, with the pulled pork not too far behind. The real gem is the Peach Cobbler, I'd eat it every day if I lived nearby.
