Art Institute of Chicago////There's a reason the Art Institute of Chicago is one of the highest rated museums in the country: it truly has a phenomenal collection and great rotating exhibitions. I particularly loved their glass paperweight collection to awe over the fabulous Paul Stankard's work. The Tomma Abts exhibition was a showstopper, and the exhibition on the Hairy Who was enlightening to learn about some of the Chicago art scene. I'm sad I didn't get to go through the whole museum (there just wasn't enough time!), but this is a must-see in Chicago!
