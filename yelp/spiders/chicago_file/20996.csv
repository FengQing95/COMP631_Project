Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place holds a special place in my heart as the restaurant that served me my first slice of authentic deep dish pizza. Â I was in Chicago to run a half marathon, and for some reason I thought it would be a good idea to "carb up" with some deep dish pizza (note: this turned out to be a very bad idea).
