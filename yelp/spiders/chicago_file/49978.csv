Smoque BBQ////The pulled pork is great. So is the sausage. Tender and tasty. The platters win over the sammies, because you get TWO sides instead of one. The sides are great. Mac and cheese and peach cobbler are at the top of the list. You get a ton of fries if you pick that one, so maybe plan to share that side. The cole slaw is really good- sweet and tangy but not creamy. Don't forget to BYOB if that's your thang. And don't forget to come at an off time, before the dinner rush. But even if you find yourself in a crowd - this place is run quite efficiently.
