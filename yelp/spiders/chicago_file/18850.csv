Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My advice, if you haven't been to this location, come in early and pre order while you're waiting. We came here about 4pm and the wait was about 20 minutes (not bad). When it was our time to sit on our table, we didn't know that the pizza would take 45 minutes, we should have pre-ordered. We were hungry! We ordered calamari for appetizer and finished it really fast. While waiting for our pizza, my friend and I stopped by Firecake donuts and got us some dessert, while our boyfriends just waited for our pizza. Our order came after 45 minutes; it was the "Lou" and the Chicago Classic. My favorite was the Chicago Classic; it's got lean sausage, cheese, and vine-ripened tomato on a butter crust. I wished I added sausage to the "Lou" pizza, it's all veggies. It would be perfect if it came with sausage. So now I know what to order next time. If you're not hungry, they also serve a personal size (1 person) or a small size, which feeds 2 people. Our server was nice, but didn't refill our drinks. The place was packed when we left. I will definitely come back for more Lou Malnati's deep-dish pizza.
