Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This steakhouse was one of the best ones I've ever been to. My husband and I celebrated our 3rd wedding anniversary here so when I made the reservation, it asked if we were celebrating anything. When I checked in, the hostess wished us a happy anniversary. Then the waiter, who was phenomenal, told us happy anniversary and said for any celebration they like to give guests champagne to toast. We ordered the bacon, truffle Mac and cheese, dry-ages bone-in ribeye, and the bone-in filet mignon. Every single item was unbelievably delicious. My husband got their old fashioned and he said it was one of the best ones he has ever had. Cannot day enough great things about this place. From the atmosphere to the service to the amazing food, it's an absolute must dinner experience
