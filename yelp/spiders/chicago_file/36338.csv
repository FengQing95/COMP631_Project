Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////First off, the place is not designed for big groups. It's a really intimate, dark setting where you bring the hottest girl you know for a romantic dinner to get waited on by sophisticated hipster-esque young people who know they have to live up to the name Bavette's has created for itself. The décor is reminiscent of a French speakeasy, so awesome!  We kind of walked in with a group of 16, half of which were over 50. Needless to say we got some strange looks and I could just see the fear in the staff's faces as we filed in and made our way to the basement (yes, there is a basement, go see it if you haven't).
