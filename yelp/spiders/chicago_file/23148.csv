Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We finally got to the hostess and we were advised that it's a 45 min wait but we could go ahead and order our pizzas so that it'll be ready by the time we're seated.  We were totally excited about this.  So, placed our order at the counter and had to fight the crowd to get outside.  Man, did I regret going outside.  It was freezing, there was no place to sit and I tried going back inside, but there just wasn't enough room.
