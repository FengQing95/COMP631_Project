Art Institute of Chicago////There is so much to explore here! And they have lots of exhibits ranging from impressionism to more modern stuff all over the world. They have sculptures, rocks, homeware, and even armor. It was really cool getting to see chainmail. But I don't advise you to wear heels if you plan on looking at every exhibit/room. I spent 5-6 hours here and I don't think I went to every room. There was a long line to pay for the tickets, but I think it may have been due to the popularity of Andy Warhol. They also participate in Bank of America's Museums on Us program. I'm not surprised they were on Trip Advisor's Best Museums list.
