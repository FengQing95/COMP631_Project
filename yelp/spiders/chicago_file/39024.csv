Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Can I rate this 6 or 7 stars? No? Ok then 5 out of 5 will have to do. What more can you say then perfection? It's perfect. I really don't know what else to say. Everything. The interior space, the service, the aura, the music, the vibes. It's all so beautiful. I started off with a Tokyo Old-Fashioned. Awesome cocktail. We brought two bottles of wine with us too. The corkage fee is just sharing a glass of wine with another table. Very fun. For appetizers, we did crab cakes, shrimp scampi, thick cut bacon, and steak tartare. Everything was beautiful. The bacon and crab cake were my favorite, but all items contained the best flavors and highest quality ingredients. Our waiter John was really helpful and gave us some nice advice on things to order. Very nice gentleman! We all had steaks to eat, and they were beautifully prepared pieces of amazing beef. Â You can't find a better steak in Chicago. Sides were Elote and Truffle Mac & Cheese. I swear this has to be the best macaroni and cheese I've had in my entire life. I cannot imagine finding a better tasting Mac & cheese. The truffle was just right. I am not a huge truffle guy, but it works so well in this dish. I truly believe this was the best meal I've ever had in my life, and I cannot wait to go back. There are only a few meals in life that stand out years later, and I can rest easy knowing this will be one of them.
