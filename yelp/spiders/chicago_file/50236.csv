Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was extremely pleased that all the guests decided to get in the true European spirit and split the food and the bill. It made things so much easier and gave everyone a little sample of most of the items on the menu. I'm ashamed to admit, but I ate: bacon wrapped dates, potato and onion omelette with some type of seasoned mayo, goat cheese in a tomato sauce with garlic bread, escargot with tomato and cheese atop buttered bread, pan fried squid, octopus salad, country style potatoes with a mild but bold red pepper sauce (my favorite), garlic potato salad and seafood paella bursting with fruits of the sea. The stuffed mushrooms looked and smelled amazing, but I loath mushrooms and didn't taste. My dining companions raved about them, though.
