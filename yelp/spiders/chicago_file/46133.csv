Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The husband and I are both fans of BaBaReeba (though I personally prefer Arco De Cuchilleros on Halsted), and visit them at least once every 2-3 months.  The citrus-cured salmon on cucumber bread is, IMHO, worth the trip in and of itself.  However, I am giving them five stars based purely on today's "New Year's Pajama Brunch" -- so much FUN!
