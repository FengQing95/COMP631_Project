Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I was so impressed with Bavettes and can't wait to go back! I sat at the bar- bartender recommended a wonderful Japanese old fashioned using hibiki- excellent. The princess cut filet was small but perfect with the pepper crust add-on. The loaded baked potato was classic and perfect. And lastly, the chocolate cream pie was something I keep thinking about how great it was! The GM that night also helped me to sort out payment electronically which was a life saver! Thanks !!! I'll come back for sure, this time with my wallet!
