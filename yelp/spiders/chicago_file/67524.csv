Little Goat Diner////My friend and I came here around 2pm on a weekday. There was no wait, and we were seated right away. Our hostess was cheerful and helpful, and successfully helped me navigate the menu and gave suggestions. I ended up going with the korean burger with a veggie patty, and my friend got the fish tacos. We split the onion rings and the fried pickles. They were absolutely divine. A perfectly seasoned batter, fried to perfection, with delicious sauces to accompany them. As for the burger, I was in love. I can count on one hand the number of good veggie patties I've had in Chicago, and this makes the list. You can see tender chunks of vegetables throughout, and the patty is spiced perfectly. Not mushy, and crispy on the outside. The rest of the burger was amazing as well. Fried egg, kimchi, you can't go wrong. I was a little apprehensive about the kimchi as I had had Girl and the Goat's kimchi a few weeks earlier and it was very salty. This was perfect and gave a nice punch to the burger.
