Smoque BBQ////There are only a few restaurants where patrons walk in with a smile on their face, order their food with a smile on their face, eat huge tender chunks of meat with a smile on their face, and leave with a smile on their face. Smoque does that. When people talk about Chicago, lots of people mention the hot dogs or the deep dish, but they should really be talking about the BBQ.
