Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I also really enjoy the environment at Café Babareeba. It can both be a casual place to catch up with friends, or a beautiful date night evening. The décor is well thought out and it almost feels like you're in different worlds based of which part of the restaurant you sit in. Sometimes you can even catch customers seated and dining on cushions on the window panes as you walk into the entrance!
