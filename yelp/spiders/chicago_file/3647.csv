The Purple Pig////Went here for my bday for the first time. Was a little hard to find and they do not offer valet parking so that definitely sucked. Other than that the experience was great. The food was delicious also. We had Bone marrow, the Duck, pork tongue and a few drinks! Everything was delicious and the service was good too. It was towards the end of the night and the servers were getting ready to leave so that took away from the overall experience but it was great.
