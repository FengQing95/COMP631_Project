Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////No doubt Lou Malnati's Pizza is the best for me but I'm giving this specific restaurant location one star because they didn't only failed to provide silverwares with my family dinner order but also failed to send them after I called immediately after delivery. Almost an hour passed so I give up. How do they expect my family to eat salad without silverwares???? Shameful. I have visitors that are so disappointed.
