Smoque BBQ////Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I had hoped for a better dining experience. With painted concrete floor and metal roof ceiling, the crowded restaurant was loud and difficult to carry on a conversation. Although a patron standing in line interrupted our meal to ask about the french fries. Barry, one of the owners, stopped by to ask how everything was. He was friendly and proud of his food and spoke about their efforts to maintain consistency.
