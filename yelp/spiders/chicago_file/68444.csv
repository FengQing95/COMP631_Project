Little Goat Diner////Sure enough, it was our turn and, wow, it was amazing. The gf and I shared the Hot Crab Dib (Highly recommended). It was amazing, we realized after our 3rd bite, that there weren't enough crackers for all the dip, and before we even asked the waiter came back with more crackers. Im pretty sure hes a mind-reader. We also shared a side of the mac-n-cheese, it looked so good from all the yelp photos, however, I regret to say that it was only okay. If I could have done it again, i would have chosen a another side or appetizer instead.
