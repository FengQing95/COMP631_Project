Art Institute of Chicago////When I lived in Chicago this was my favorite museum to go to, especially on freebie night, and now as a visitor, I have to say nothing has changed.  The new addition is wonderful, they did an unbelievable job of making the flow great and ensuring that more international pieces are available for viewing. The old standbys of Seurat, Monet, and American Gothic are still there, but in new locations, and new crazy American Modern installations (my least favorite being Clown Torture - disturbing).The only bummer for me was that the Chagall windows, which are my favorite , were taken down during the expansion, and they still haven't been put back up.  I guess that means that I will have to plan another trip in the future, and that will just kill me :) Next time I will spend a whole day, though, because I ran out of time.  It is definitely worth the price.
