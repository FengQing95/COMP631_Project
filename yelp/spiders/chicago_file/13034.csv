Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Rating based on carry-out. I live in NYC and thought that NYC would always be better than Chicago-style, a belief I still hold. Although I'm not a fan of waiting so long for a pizza, I have to say Lou's was good - even as carry-out. I used a fork and knife to eat it though because it was a bit hard to hold for me. The "Lou" and "Malnati Original" were both pretty good. After two slices, the chicago deep-dish was a bit heavy and it became hard for me to eat more.
