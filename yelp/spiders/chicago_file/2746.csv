The Purple Pig////Party of 8 please-recommended by tons of friends that it is a must that we come to Purple Pig to eat. Service was impeccable, I do believe everyone should be treated with 1st class all the way. The restaurant itself is spacious but tight, either way it was memorable and they make it work.
