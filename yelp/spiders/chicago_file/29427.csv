Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Holy moly the line for this place was ridiculous. The first thing on my Chicago to do list was to try deep dish pizza so I asked around and was told Lou Malnati's was one of the best. When I got there the line went out the door. By the time I got to the front of the line to put my name down I was told my wait was about 30-40 minutes. The nice thing is that they will text you when your table to ready so you don't have to wait inside necessarily. Since I was a party of 1 I decided to take my chances and wait by the bar as a backup plan because it's open seating there. Right when a seat opened up I was notified my table was available. The hostess said that there were no more couples on the waitlist left so they had a table for me. Not sure how I felt about that comment, but was glad I would have a table instead of being crammed at the bar.
