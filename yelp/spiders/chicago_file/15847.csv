Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went here for my first testing of Chicago's Deep dish pizza, the pizza was amazing, but the service was the worst!!!!! We sat outside, our waiter had 3 tables, and couldn't seem to handle basic server responsibilities like checking to see how our food was, do we need a box for our leftovers, would we like dessert or how about our check? I might mention that it was 8:00 on Labor Day Monday, it was muggy with humidity so I am assuming he wanted to hang out more in the air conditioning, then service the diners outside. I couldn't help but wonder how many people leave without paying for their meal
