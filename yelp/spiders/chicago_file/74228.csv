Little Goat Diner////I opted for pork belly nachos and could only eat a portion of it because it wasn't very good. I didn't care for the sauce and it was a whole lot of chips and not much anything else. My boyfriend got a salad which was big but he said didn't have much flavor. I also got a strawberry shake that had interesting bits of shortbread at the bottom of it. It really didn't add anything other than it was super overpriced.
