Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Finally had a chance to try some Chicago style deep dish in the city that invented it. I gotta say I was pretty impressed. Had a pepperoni and mushroom deep dish on the signature "Buttercrust" (there has to be some kind of butterface joke in there somewhere). The toppings and especially the cheese were really tasty...mozzarella can be really flavorless at a lot of chain pizza places but the stuff they use here has a great milky taste. Toppings were good, and contrary to what I thought would be the case, it wasn't smothered by sauce.
