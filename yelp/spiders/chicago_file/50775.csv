Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Stopped by here on the way to the Zoolights! We made a reservation, having heard great things but were sad the "latest" time they had for dinner was 3:30pm! We picked this, assuming they were busy and considered it an early dinner. We arrived however and noticed a few empty tables, even past 4:30pm-5pm. Do they not reserve the whole restaurant? Made us feel a little cheated by the system. (Although I guess we could have called in to check.)
