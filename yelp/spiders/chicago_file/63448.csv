Smoque BBQ////What have you done to the fries?  I know, according to your manifesto that you don't feel fries are a good match with BBQ but up until the last visit, they were great.  The latest fries, while tasty, looked like they came out of the Ore Ida bag.  No longer the heavy skin, dark brown, juicy fries that once were.  Tell me this was just a substitute due to some supply problem?  I also noticed Barry wasn't around so maybe that had something to do with it.  On the plus side, the brisket and candied jalapenos were outstanding as usual.
