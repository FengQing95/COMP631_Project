Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My only complaint is the inconsistent service.  It's generally good in the restaurant, but if you eat at the bar to avoid the wait be warned.  The bartenders are a little forgetful and sometimes orders mysteriously don't get put in.  I've also had a bartender leave at the end of the shift without really transitioning us over to anyone else or letting us know he was going to be gone.  I don't expect as good a service experience at the bar, but I DO expect my orders to be remembered and somewhat timely service.
