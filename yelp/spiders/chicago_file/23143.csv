Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Sorry for the short review but I've only had this pizza delivered. I have no idea about the actual restaurant and how their service is. I had the deep dish sausage pizza and it was very bland! No flavor at all. I'm not sure why this place has a good rating...it was not good.
