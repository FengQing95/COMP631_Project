Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had my first tapas experience here and it was just OKAY. The sangria was okay, and the food was just okay- but good enough for you to get an idea of what tapas is, and try it again somewhere else. And when you go somewhere else, you will realize that Cafe Ba Ba Reba, is over priced and the food is just OKAY, and that the only thing going for them is the space they are in.
