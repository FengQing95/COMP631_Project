Smoque BBQ////After some strategizing, we put in a big order for our party of five, accounting for three of us who already had bellies full of hot dogs.  We ordered brisket, a half rack of St. Louis style ribs, a taste of pulled pork, and a sausage, with sides of cole slaw, BBQ beans, brisket chili, macaroni and cheese, and cornbread, and a little peach cobbler for dessert.  This feast, about enough to feed three hungry people, cost a little over $40 with sodas.
