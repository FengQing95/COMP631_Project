Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Tried the "Lou" style deep dish pizza . Lots of cheese and veggies and was well worth the 45 mins wait time. I was pretty hungry so I ordered the "small" size for 2 and was able to finish it on my own . A little on the pricy side when considering this is a pizza for one but the quality was good
