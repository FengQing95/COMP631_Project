Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our water was EXTREMELY knowledgeable with not only the food but the entire bar and brought everyone delicious drinks. I had the sazerac which was made absolutely perfect (you can tell a lot about a bar by the way they can make a sazerac, if you haven't tried one then I highly recommend it!).
