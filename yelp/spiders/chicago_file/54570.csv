Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great place but definitely a little over hyped. The environment is great for date nights, servers usually knows what they are talking about and very attentive. However, for the price, the plates are very small, delicious but small. This is not a great place where you want to show up hungry, if you do, just be ready for the bill.
