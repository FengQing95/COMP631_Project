Smoque BBQ////I heard good things about Smoque so I had to give it a shot while in Chicago and staying close to O'Hare.  Extremely easy to get to by train using the Blue line and Irving Park stop.  They are only 1 1/2 blocks from the station.  This is a BYOB hole in the wall place where you order and pay, then give the number in your party and your order number to the "table guy" who will find a place for you at the lineup of tables when someone finishes and leaves.  Very low keyed place; get your own soft drink or ice tea (sweet and unsweetened) and wait for the table guy to seat you.  Remember - it's BYOB.  Your number will be called and you will need to go get your trays from the kitchen area.  You will eat elbow to elbow so don't expect a romantic atmosphere.  The sweet tea was just OK although they do it much better down south.  I LOVE smoked meats and have a smoker at home which I have worked hard to perfect my recipes so I am discriminating when it comes to smoked BBQ.  Here's my review:  The chicken is off the charts - best damn smoked chicken I have ever tasted.  Rich smoky flavor, moist, tender, nice crispy skin and good flavor.  Pulled Pork, brisket, and St. Louis ribs were a disapointment.  The meats were tender but the smoke flavor was not there.  I would go back for chicken but not for the pork or beef.  Baked beans are spicy, contain meat, onions, and are tasty.  They could use some nice smoke flavor and tone down the spice.  The spicyness overrides this dish.  Slaw is very basic - sliced cabbage in a non-creamy sauce, i.e. no mayo in it.  It's on the sweet side which I like but the large slices of cabbage made it a bit messy to eat.  The peach cobbler comes in individual portions the size of a cupcake.  The top crust was harder than it should have been but was tasty.  Overall it's OK - not terrific.  The fries are home cut and fried, and are served in a small brown paper bag to soak up the grease.  They were very good.
