Little Goat Diner////The goat patty Korean burger is delicious but difficult to eat - a goat patty topped with kimchi, braised bok choy, bacon, spicy mayo, served on a fluffy sweet bun.  The blue plate special today was salmon bruschetta - this was also delicious but difficult to eat - tender chunks of salmon on clam-baguette with blueberries and grape tomatoes.  Goat patty loco moco was interesting as well - this was served with fried rice, roasted tomatoes, braised bok choy and a sweet and sour sauce.  It was tasty but somewhat heavy-handed with the sweet and sour sauce.
