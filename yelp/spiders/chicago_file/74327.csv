Little Goat Diner////It goes without saying that Stephanie holds a special place in my heart as one of my fave Top Chef contestants. Of course, I was excited to try one of her restos and am still recovering from one seriously hearty meal that warmed my soul -- head to toe. I think we ordered nearly every appetizer on the menu so our entrees were in excess. Pure gluttony all around. That's how I want to spend my days in Chicago or anywhere for that matter.
