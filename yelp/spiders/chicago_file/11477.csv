Art Institute of Chicago////I had conveniently bought my tickets online through through the AIC website and was taken back at first as while entering my credit card info that the webpage was not HTTPS but after hitting complete I noticed the transaction went though to a secured site that basically generated the tickets that were emailed to me. Â For non-Chicago residents the tickets were 25 dollars each.
