Little Goat Diner////2. The second time here, I sat at a communal table with about 5 friends. Our food took some time to get to the table, and they completely forgot one of our orders. They brought her some soup while she waited (saying it was taking a while, but it didn't come out for another 35+ minutes--clearly they didn't even put it in). The most absurd part? They put the complimentary soup on the bill. We got it taken off but this was one of the most unprofessional dining experiences I've ever had (especially given the price point!!).
