Art Institute of Chicago////It is a bit idiotic to write a review of THE art "Institute" , I mean, I really even love the NAME.  Institute.  If you don't go here you misunderstood your initial dislike of art or museums because this place has something for everyone. Don't try to see everything or you will end up hating art AND life because you will be so overstimulatedexhausted.  If you go in the summer bother going to the little courtyard with a cup of something cold and breathe and be grateful for the wealthy who make art possible, even if you hate the wealthy the rest of the time, really, this place makes you forgive them a bit.
