Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We arrived about 5 minutes before our reservation time. We sat in the lounge by the door and ordered drinks. Right around our reservation time one of the hostesses came and escorted us downstairs to our table. The ambience is great for special occasions and very cozy. Once we sat at our table we were greeted by our waiter, who was really nice and professional. We ordered the Garlic Shrimp De Jonghe, which was absolutely delicious.
