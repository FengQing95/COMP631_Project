Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Can I say Chicago has the BEST breakfast food ever hands down? Wildberry is pretty up there with Bongo Room. I went on a Friday morning, super crowded, but the wait for 2 was only 15 minutes. I ordered the Garden skillet which comes with a side of pancakes or if you want one of the specialty pancakes it's $1 extra so I opted for the Cinnamon roll pancakes. Soooo gooood it was nice and warm and tasted just like a Cinnabon if you're into cinnabons. The Garden skillet with hash browns, all sorts of veggies, and 2 eggs over easy was really delicious too and portions are huge I took more than half to-go. Mix the eggs in with the rest of the ingredients so the yolk gets mixed in nom nom nom. I can't wait to try their special wild berry pancakes the next time
