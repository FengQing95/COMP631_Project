Little Goat Diner////I loved Little Goat Diner. The ambiance is bright/airy. The service is fast. The food is great. I was celebrating my birthday, and they treated me to a delicious cinnamon roll! I had the omelette of the day and it was huge. I tasted a bit of the apple pancakes, which were incredible. If I lived in Chicago I would come here all the time and try the whole menu.
