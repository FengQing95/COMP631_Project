Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm really not a huge fan of deep dish (sorry Chicago) but it is a great spot to take visitors and has, quite frankly, been my go to. They do not take reservations, it is busy literally every single night, and you have to stop by, give your name, and stay within 5 minutes to receive a table. The only reason I give it 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because of the incredibly inconvenient system. Let a girl make a reservation! Other than that the pizza is pizza and everyone I have taken there has enjoyed it.
