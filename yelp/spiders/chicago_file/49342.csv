Smoque BBQ////This is the best BBQ shop in Chicago. The pulled pork sandwich is perfectly delicious. The sauce is so good I get a quart to take home every time I go. The mac and cheese and cornbread are amazing additions to an already incredible sandwich. The sliced brisket is also a standard at this eatery; you must at least try it. When you go always be sure to "add a taste" of whatever you didn't order as your main meal--you won't be sorry!
