Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'd never been to a breakfast/brunch tapas place before, and was so intrigued by the setup! The menu is fairly large with a good selection of both sweet and savory items, with some all-day selections as well if you didn't want to do brunch. I love that their menu marks off the popular items - something that I am guilty of asking my server about on a regular basis.
