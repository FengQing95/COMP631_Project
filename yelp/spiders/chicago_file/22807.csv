Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time is Chicago and Lou was highly recommended. We went on a Friday night and the wait was not bad, 15 minutes or so. We preorder the Original Deep Dish when we came in. It was fantastic. The sauce was light and fresh tasting. I could taste the tomatoes. The cheese was perfect. The sausage was excellent. And the Croat was out of this world. I expected a pizza that heavy and over salt and not fresh tasting since I had deep dish before, but this was outstanding. I highly recommend Lou when you come to Chicago.
