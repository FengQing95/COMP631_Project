Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Over the busy Christmas holiday, our kids wanted deep dish pizza. As former Chicagoans, we try to avoid the bustling touristy North Michigan Ave. scene, but Lou's has great food. What made this experience top notch was that we were seated at our reservation time, and though there was a glitch with the meal delivery, our waitress alerted us and apologized . Â Then shortly thereafter the manager spoke with us. Proactive friendly staff can soothe hungry stomachs and the kids said it was worth the slight wait.
