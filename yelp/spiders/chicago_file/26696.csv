Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First impression it looks very very different compared to Giordiano's. The top layer of the pizza pie you have tomatoes, middle is sausage, and then the cheese is on the bottom protecting the crust. Let me tell you, this place is freaking great and the ingredients they used made such a huge difference. You can actually taste the sweetness and the acidity of the tomatoes and its a nice balance with the savory sausage and the mozerella cheese. It's so simple but the individual ingredients are great and combined blends together really well.
