Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My first ever Classic Chicago Deep Dish Pizza certainly did not disappoint. I had the Malnati Chicago Classic and WOW! it was very tasty. The sausage and cheese blended perfectly with the sauce, and the buttercrust was delicious, not soggy at all. The pizza was preceeded by a Chicken Caesar Salad: warm chicken, crisp greens, crunchy croutons with just the right amount of their delicious salad dressing. Of course, my waiter, Eddie, was extremely helpful in asking questions and making excellent suggestions. This gem certainly deserves a 5 star rating.
