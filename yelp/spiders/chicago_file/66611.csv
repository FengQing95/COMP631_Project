Little Goat Diner////4 stars for the food, 2 for the service. Came with a group of friends. We had a reservation and were seated promptly. We ordered the crab dip and fried pickles and onion rings to start. It took a long time to get our food. My friend ordered a beer and it took almost 15 min to bring it over. We then ordered our entrees and 2 sides. Entrees came out at random times over about 10 min and then our sides finally came out about 15 min after the last entree was brought out. I had the crispy chicken sandwich and it was very good. The fries were also crispy and had good flavor. I just wish the service wasn't so slow.
