Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My go-to stop for chicago deep dish pizza.  Everyone has their favorite and Lou is what I crave.  The lunch special is a great deal and if you are happy with cheese or pepperoni, you can get a pizza pretty quickly.  I prefer the sauce used at Lou's but I am not a fan of the butter crust and go with the regular crust.  I say you need to come in and try and try the others.  I think you will stick with Lou's.
