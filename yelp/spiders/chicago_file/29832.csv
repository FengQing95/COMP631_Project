Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I love pizza. All kinds of pizza. And Lou Malnati's Pizza was very unique but I'm not quite sure it lived up to its hype. Of course when you're in Chicago, you are told to must try deep dish pizza. My impression of deep dish was thick dough and little toppings. I was wrong. At Lou's, the dough was actually not super thick and the toppings were layer upon layer! There's a wait though.....a long one. Definitely go there and put your name on the list then go shopping or walk around. Don't go hungry expecting to eat right away. Their system is very efficient though. They'll call you when they're ready and you also pre-order your pizza so it is already cooking by the time you sit down.
