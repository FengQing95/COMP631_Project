Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We were 15 min late for our reservations. Even though we called ahead and told them we were running late, and they said they would save our table, by the time we got there, they gave our table away!  We saw so much empty seating and yet they kept making people wait... We walked up  to the hostess and kept inquiring as to whether they had called us yet and they kept reassuring us that we would hear it over the loud speakers... we never did so we went back for the 3rd time and they said they had called us 10 min ago. We were right there in front waiting and I swear they NEVER called us! I was furious, we ended up waiting a total of 40 minutes!! I would have given this place 5 stars had the hostess been more competent.
