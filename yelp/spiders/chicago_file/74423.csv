Little Goat Diner////Breakfast was very reasonably priced and I am SO GLAD we made a reservation because as we were leaving, we could barely slip out of our booth because there were people EVERYWHERE waiting to get seated. I don't know that I'd return to Little Goat, but I still want to try Girl & the Goat, which I'm certain would be even better.
