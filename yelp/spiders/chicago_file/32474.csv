Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is going to be an odd review because it's not about the pizza. We ordered only the Malnati's Salad and the Calamari ^.^ This is my second time eating the salad and it was just as I remembered it the first time. I think it might be the best salad I have ever eaten. Something about the lemon vinaigrette, salami bits, and fresh tomatoes that make the salad soooooo good!!!! The salami bits! I just want to eat it by myself but the medium definitely serves 2-3 person. The calamari was very tasty too with a splash of lemon. The breading was delicious.
