Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been dining here for over 27 years and they absolutely have the best Spanish food this side of España, and it keeps getting better. A glass or two of fino sherry to start with cold tapas, and wine throughout the rest is a more traditional way to dine. The sangria is the best anywhere but I have CBBR's recipe so I make it at home. The Gambas a la Plancha, Calamares a la Parilla, Tortilla Española, Pincho de Solomillo and many others from the original menu NEVER disappoint. I'm still awaiting the return of the Pastel de Cordero, though. I miss the Spanish or pseudo-Spanish music the likes of Julio Iglesias, Azúcar Moreno and the Gipsy Kings. (If my favourite Madrileño was crooning, I couldn't hear him.) And I'm not a fan of the 'ordering by number system' although I understand its purpose as the menu can be intimidating to the uninitiated. That's when knowledgable waitstaff will make your night. Request Tabitha to be your server, let her order for you and your experience will be fabulous!
