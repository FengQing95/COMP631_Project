Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I will be looking forward to more pizza adventures in Chicago.  I was recommended by numerous people as well as seeing it on the Travel Channel.  The ambiance is amazing.  You can definitely tell a good amount of heart was put into this place when they built this location back in the 80's.
