Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I arrived at 4:30 pm on Friday. There was a 15 minute wait for a table. It helped to preorder the pizza. I went with the Classic Lou personnel pizza. It took about an hour for the pizza to arrrive but it was very busy. The pizza was delicious! The crust was perfectly baked and you can taste the high quality toppings. The server and management really went out of their way for me though. I left my credit card there and had to go back before heading out of town. Management had it locked up for me in the safe for when I got there after calling.
