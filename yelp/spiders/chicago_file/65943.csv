Smoque BBQ////Great BBQ !!! On the outskirts of Chicago, you would wanna stop here to get some great BBQ! Staff was sweet, gave us recommendations and were really sweet when it came to serving our food and sitting us. Very humble and very sweet! Service was quick and we I guess beat the rush hour line that was our the door by the time we got to the front !
