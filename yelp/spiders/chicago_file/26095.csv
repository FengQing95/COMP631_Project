Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If there's a better deep dish in Chicago I'd be impressed. I'm a New York style pizza type, and was kind of reluctant to try Chicago style pizza. I've been so wrong!!!! I still prefer thin crust, but this place is excellent, surprisingly affordable Â (15 for a pizza that feeds two) and it's delicious!!!
