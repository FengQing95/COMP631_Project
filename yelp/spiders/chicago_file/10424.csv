Art Institute of Chicago////I love the Art Institute and have been a premier subscriber of the museum for several years now. Â The standing galleries are enjoyable, but its the constant rotation of new exhibits, each one carrying a captivating story or adventure into a variety of medias, that keeps me coming back year in and out.
