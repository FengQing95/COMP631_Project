Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////GRILLED OCTOPUS - Very Good! This dish consisted of grilled octopus, heirloom tomatoes, crispy chickepeas, roasted garlic, arugula, and garlic-chili vinaigrette. This dish was very good! I have had plenty of octopus from restaurants and this place is on the top list. The octopus was cooked perfect, nice and tender. It wasn't very chewy and had a good flavor. All of the side ingredients helped make the dish come together and added more depth of flavor.
