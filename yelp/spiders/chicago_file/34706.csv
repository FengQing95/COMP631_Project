Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Super casual and un-rushed atmosphere.  Good drinks and probably the best, yeah that's right, the best steak I've had at any restaurant or steakhouse.  We were able to get a table without reservations by getting there early, but hey, who said you have to eat as soon as you get there.  Did I mention the un-rushed atmosphere?
