Smoque BBQ////The location is a little inconvenient, but it's well worth it.  The place could use a better sign for anyone coming from the north.  Even if you don't see it, just make a right on the first little street that isn't right up against the freeway embankment.  Still, the place is only a couple years old, the prices are reasonable, the service is good, and I'm looking forward to filling in any gaps when I go back yet again.
