Little Goat Diner////Had a very interesting meal here at the little goat diner. They have very interesting dishes, some of which you probably won't find most anywhere. I myself had the onoryamikai (or something like that) it was a scallion pancake, with pork belly, some sweet soy sauce, kewpie Mayo, some crunchy things, and some bonito flakes. It was a very nice combination of flavors and textures. My only complaint with the dish, was the Bonita flakes. They were a strange texture, but more importantly, really overpowered the flavor. My sister had the to tonkatsu sandwich, which was really nice. Had a strong Korean flavor, and great ingredients.
