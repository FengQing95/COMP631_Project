Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is the quintessential Chicago Steak House!! The food was perfection and Angie the bartender was top of her class. Classic cocktails and some house inventions she executive them all. I'm a martini fan and shall my glass go I frosted Â they quickly poured the remainder into a newly frosted glass. Impeccable service. I can't recommend this place enough. If you're lucky Angie will be working at the bar! Ask for her!!!!
