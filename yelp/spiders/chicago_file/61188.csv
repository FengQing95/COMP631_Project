Smoque BBQ////I picked up some brisket, a slab of ribs, mac & cheese, cornbread, and the BBQ beans. They were all fantastic, and fulfilled my craving. The brisket had a deep smoke line, nice char and great flavor. One of the owners was manning the cash register, and she provided me with all of their sauces to try. I'm a bigger fan of the smoky, spicy BBQ sauces as opposed to those of the sweet variety. The ribs were pretty good too, but I wouldn't call them lights out.
