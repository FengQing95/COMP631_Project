The Purple Pig////It is a little on the pricier side for only tapas, but it was great trying those 3 that seem to be some of the most popular dishes. The service was quick, a little rushed since they want to get through the wait list as fast as possible it seems like. Also, the food didn't all come out at once which wasn't that big of a deal but sometimes there's waits in between until the next one was ready.
