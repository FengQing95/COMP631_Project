Smoque BBQ////Smoque is amazing!! I had the brisket sandwich and it was so good that I ended up placing a to-go order and took home more brisket and also the St. Louis Ribs, which were also phenomenal. The meat has so much flavor and its so moist. I would eat at this place multiple times a week if it was closer to where I live. This is a must for anyone who likes barbecue, and even those who dont!
