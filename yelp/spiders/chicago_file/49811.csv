Smoque BBQ////Wife and I have tried it and had better.  It's way too far from downtown and the environment and endless wait (outside,  then inside) are pretty terrible.  The seating and seating capacity were also terrible--any high school lunchroom is more roomy and looks better.  After all of that time waiting, there is no reason or chance to stay longer.
