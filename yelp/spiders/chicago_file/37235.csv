Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Amazing! We ordered the brussel sprouts, loaded baked potato, roast chicken, and the ribeye. The brussel sprouts were tender and proportions in both sides were plentiful. The steak was cooked to perfection and the roast chicken was to die for. Everything came out quickly and we loved the ambiance and vibe of the restaurant. Not only was the server great and attentive, but the rest of the staff was on point and extremely cordial. We loved our experience here and will definitely be returning in the future!
