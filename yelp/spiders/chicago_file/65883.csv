Smoque BBQ////I'd definitely give them more stars if I could! The food is always amazing, well packaged and super fast delivery! Had a mix up with our Caviar order tonight, but called the restaurant and they graciously gave us options to try to make things right. One of their on site empoyees named Salvador( I hope I remembered his name right, he was so sweet!) ended up delivering our correct order in no time flat& I tried like hell to make him accept some money as a tip but he politely declined since it was "their mistake" so sweet but I so wish I could have compensated him for his time, especially since they were so understanding. Your staff has amazing customer service for sure!
