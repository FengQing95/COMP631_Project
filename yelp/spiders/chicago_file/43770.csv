Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Atmosphere: The store front is deceptively small. Once inside, you'll be surprised by the large tables, and the depth of the dining area (just try finding the restrooms). If you are looking for an intimate experience, ask that your recommendations are on the right/restaurant side, and not the indoor patio area. Â
