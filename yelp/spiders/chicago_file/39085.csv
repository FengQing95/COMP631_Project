Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////--- Ehh, these were decent. For as good as everything else was, these could've been a little better. I did appreciate the amount of gravy and garlic and whatnot. Honestly, the taste and consistency was only good for a 3/5, but the portion was large enough to love it with the meal.
