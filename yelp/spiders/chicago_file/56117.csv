Smoque BBQ////We ordered up a brisket platter with two sides of mac n cheese (I mean really, how do you not get down with their mac n cheese), a half slab of st louis ribs, and an order of brisket chilli. Well, all of the food got demolished when we got back (along with some of the food getting picked at in the car as well). The brisket was insanely tender and was falling apart left and right. The ribs were very good, but the chilli was awesome and the mac n cheese got inhaled
