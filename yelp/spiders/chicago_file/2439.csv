The Purple Pig////My story: I arrived about 1:45 hoping to eat within an hr, they quoted an hr, I texted my friends, and then one of the girls whispered to the hostess, a table was ready!! Great right!! No, only 3 of 5 friends were nearby parking and the others were 30 minutes away. I explained that to the wait staff and we were seated, I waited abt 15 mins and realized the waiter hadn't been By because all the seats weren't filled (last two). I called a waiter over to start some plates  and drinks for the friends who were there. She seemed reluctant, but placed the order. We then got another waiter, who seemed also equally annoyed the other friends weren't there yet, This was abt 30 minutes in, and my other friends were at the door with an extra guest. We needed needed an extra seat. The staff brings over an extra seat. Abt 10 minutes later, the manager comes over and ask us to all go back to the waiting area, because we needed an extra seat and they only expected 5. Of course i countered, the staff had placed the seat there, we already ordered and starting consuming food. And to be asked to abandon, now that everyone was seated and noshing was absolutely ridiculous. In addition, there was an empty two seater table next to us. When she saw we weren't budging and us recommending she add the empty table, she claimed to go check if she could do that. Lol(people). The waiter comes over and takes more orders and drinks, while all of this is happening. I was shocked to say the least. The manager Left and never returned.  The end. Quick note: this happened a year ago.
