Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I heard this place was good so we stopped in to try it. Stopped in Chicago for the first time and decided to try this pizza out. We ordered the minestrone soup which was the only good thing. Honestly, I didnt like the pizza. We ordered the classic deep dish. The tomato sauce was very watery, pizza had no flavor and it tasted like someone threw it in microwave. When I cut a small piece off my slice, it was cold. It made our stomach hurt a little while after. I wouldn't come here again.
