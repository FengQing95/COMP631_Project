Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Had the beef skewer, the grilled octopus, croquetas, and patatas bravas.  Everything we ordered as a true delight.  The croquetas were certainly the highlight for me - perfectly fried rolls oozing with potatoes, ham, and cheese.  The beef was also excellently cooked and was complimented nicely by some horseradish.  The citrusy-sourness of the octopus was a little overpowering for my seafood tastes, but my partner enjoyed it, so perhaps it's just me.
