Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////All their meats are aged 28 days giving everything a rich, deep and robustly beefy flavor and texture. I got the 20 oz. ribeye which was cooked perfectly, no need for the extra table side steak salt. We also got the lamb which was also very well and richly flavored. The sides were good though were only sides: roasted heirloom tomatoes and cole slaw. For dessert, we got the cantaloupe sorbet which was surprisingly overly sweet though good; compliments of mint or some brighter flavor would have brought more balance to the dessert.
