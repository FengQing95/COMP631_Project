Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The staff was very friendly and wished us a happy birthday when we arrived. We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, which we kind of expected since the place was packed. Our server was knowledgeable about the dishes. My one word of advice is listen to the server regarding the number of tapas to order. We did not and we were beyond full!
