Smoque BBQ////Yuuuuum. These people know what they're doing. One of the best BBQ I've had in the city. Like everyone else says, get the sliced brisket - you will not be disappointed. Minus one star because it's a pretty small spot and you're literally elbow to elbow with people if it's busy. Wouldn't stop me from going back or doing carry-out in the future though.
