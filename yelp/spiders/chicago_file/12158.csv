Art Institute of Chicago////Wow! Wow! One of the premiere museums of the world. Masterpieces all around and even if you are not that much into art you'll recognize some of these gems. Situated right in mellinium park it is very easy to get to within downtown chicago via train or bus. The line to get in wasn't too bad and it flowed quickly. About 10 min. midweek in autumn.
