Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The crust is so unique: crispy, buttery, and slightly crumbly almost like a pie crust but savory and not as thick as you'd think! There was a generous amount of stretchy, gooey cheese. The sauce is so flavorful and bright, and I really appreciate the literal layer of sausage so that you don't miss it in any bite. Be warned though, you're gonna feel the food coma afterwards. But it's worth it.
