Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is a great spot for a casual outing with friends or for a date. They have a great selection of drinks and tapas, and what's best is that the menu has certain popular items highlighted for you in case you're indecisive. We tried the hangar steak, the stuffed mushrooms, and the burrata, along with the caramelized bananas for dessert. I had a classic red sangria, which was great/decently strong. I recommend you get all of these! Very delicious, a great atmosphere and friendly service.
