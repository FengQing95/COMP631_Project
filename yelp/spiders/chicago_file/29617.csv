Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We came on a Sunday for lunch and to our surprise we were seated right away. Since this location is nestled at the edge of River North, the Gold Coast and South Loop locations tend to be much more crowded. Not having to wait for our seat meant that we can order our food right away. Mind you, the pizza still takes 35-40 min to cook because that's just the way deep dish is - you have to go in with the expectation to wait.
