Art Institute of Chicago////If you are an art fanatic like me, this is a most see in Chicago. Despite being one of Chicago's famous landmarks, the art is great. With the portrait of VanGough to the Sunday Afternoon painting. I have been there and will not be coming back for a long time because I have experienced whats there.
