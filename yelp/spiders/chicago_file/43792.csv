Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Food was tasty; we stuck to the veggie side of stuff, since that's her proclivity. Garlic potatos salad was completely yummy. Tortilla was a little bland but much helped by the aioli that came alongside it. The roasted eggplant was good, although we both got tired of it pretty quickly. Had a white peach sangria which was tast. Stuffed mushrooms were massive and very nice. The highlight was the dessert pincxo platter we ordered: an array of 6 itty-bitty desserts. SO TINY! SO TASTY!
