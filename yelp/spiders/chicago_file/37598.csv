Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For the entree ordered the Steak frites. Did not realize the sliced meant not just a single sliced slab but the steak is actually pre-cut for you into slices. The meat was seasoned heavily, and medium rare was a tad more cooked than preferred. Tasty but overpowered the meat flavor. Would like to try a cut from their "Le Boef" section rather than their "Butcher's Cut" section next time.
