The Purple Pig////For the three of us, we only ordered three tapas (Olive Oil Poached Tuna, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder, and Roasted Bone Marrow) and one dessert (Coffee Cake). I was a bit concerned in the beginning that this wouldn't be enough because tapas are known for their small size. However, I was totally wrong as they turned out to be pretty big. My favorite dish was definitely the Roasted Bone Marrow, which according to the waitress was one of their most popular dishes. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Chicago!!!
