Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////You definitely will enjoy the restaurant as much as I did it if you like tapas and the food from Spain. As a Spaniard I was reluctant when I went in expecting something not very elaborated and kind of  superficial  at the expense of a more traditional Spanish cuisine but it turned out that their menu is pretty balanced, which  brings the opportunity of experiencing an authentic Spanish meal not only because of the food but also because of the wine list and beers (e.g. Estrella Damm Inedit) and the atmosphere. It could be cool for a casual dinner if you're in a mood for Spanish food. Plus one of the strengthens is that the quality is quite high with decent prices for a casual dinner!
