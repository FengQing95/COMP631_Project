Little Goat Diner////The Bloody Mary I had was awesome, but I only had one since it was $11. I ordered the chicken and French toast, and if I return I will probably order something else. The French toast ended up being a little too soggy for my liking. I will probably return and try something else on the menu. Oh! The rooftop patio is only for private parties, which is a mega bummer.
