Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////All the food we did try was really good. The crab and avacado, the fried chicken and the shortrib stroganoff were great. The mashed potatoes...not so much. They are described as "buttery" with garlic and chicken jus. But what I got was a big bowl of potatoes that were swimming in butter. Like 1/3 of the dish was butter. This was just too much.
