Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Delicious! We just missed the morning rush so get there early. Service was awesome and food was fast. You can definitely share but why would you? If you have to wait there isn't a lot of space to do so...so if it's cold out you're either crammed inside or cold outsides.
