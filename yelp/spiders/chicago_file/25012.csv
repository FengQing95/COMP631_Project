Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came on a Friday evening. There was a long wait. You get in line to put your name down and they text you when your table is ready. After you put your name down, they give you the menu so you can pre-order your pizza. We ordered a small Chicago style pizza, Buffalo wings, and the minestrone soup. Surprisingly, I liked the wings best here. The soup was average, I've had better. I was super excited to try Chicago style pizza (even though many people have told me it wouldn't be as good as New York's pizza). I was a bit disappointed. The tomato sauce was really tasty but the cheese was too heavy and hard. It wasn't melted at all. There was a big layer of it on top of the crust. I don't know if that's how all Chicago pizza is made but I wasn't a Â fan of it. Next time I'm back in Chicago I'll give the pizza another try.
