Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service we received was sub par. Our sever was less than attentive. My date tried to summon her to the table on many occasions and was ignored. Our busboy was the only reason I gave this place 2 stars. I wanted to tip him instead of the server. I am assuming she thought her tip was going to be minimal because we decided to partake of the restaurant week deal. It took a while in between courses which was pretty surprising. Even with the deal our check was about $130 which is a pretty hefty check for 2 people considering the price of their menu. My date works in the service industry so he tipped 25%. She is very lucky I was out with him and not my friends because under normal circumstances this lack luster experience would have warranted a discussion with the manager.
