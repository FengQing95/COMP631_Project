Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it's so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
