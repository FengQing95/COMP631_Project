The Purple Pig////Generally disappointed in the experience. Contrary to other reviews we found the portion sizes to be ridiculously small for what was considered 'sharable'.  5 little pieces of octopus for a 24 dollar item was off-putting. Also we found the dishes including feta and goat cheese had the cheese fluffed with what I assumed was heavy cream.  While it seems an exotic way to present artisan cheese, the flavor was heavily diluted and screams of a restaurant trying--and in this case failing, to mask food cost reductions.
