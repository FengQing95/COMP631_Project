Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great dinner. Crab cakes are chunky, fresh, with a perfect blend of sauce, not too creamy or dry. They also have a slight outer crisp. The oysters were also great, reminds me of GT, although seems hard to mess up, most places just taste days old or dried out. Recommend the bone in filet mignon, best I've had from any steakhouse downtown. The boneless filet minion wasn't bad, just not as good as David Burkes, cooked perfectly, just lacked as much flavor. Chocolate cream pie to finish is plenty for two, not too rich.
