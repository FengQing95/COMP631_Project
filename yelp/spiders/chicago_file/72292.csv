Little Goat Diner////The menu is extensive (in true diner fashion) and we needed some time to work our way through it. Our server, Andrea, was attentive but willing to give us as much time as we needed to make a decision. She was very knowledgable about their beer selections (we didn't have cocktails or wine but I trust that this girl really knows her stuff). She also noticed me struggling to choose between four different menu items and provided her recommendation (which was spot on btw). My fiancé and I ultimately decided to share the fish tostadas, bahn mi goat burger, and a side of the "not chinese broccoli". She was incredibly careful with my fiancé's tree nut allergy, even coming back to check that he could have ingredients like peanuts and sesame. We really trusted her which is hard for us to do.
