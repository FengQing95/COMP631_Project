Art Institute of Chicago////My absolute favorite floor was the upper floor. This is where they have a whole wing of Impressionism art include Renoir and Degas. My parents had some prints of these hanging in their living room as I was growing up and it brought back so many nostalgic memories. There were also many Italian Renaissance paintings and a whole room decorated to weapons and armor.
