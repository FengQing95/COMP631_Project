Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Fun and authentic ambience and tasty Spanish tapas! I highly recommend getting a reservation and taking a group here. The Brussels sprout salad w/ marcona almonds and manchego cheese, spicy potatoes w/ tomato aioli, and citrus cured salmon are delicious! They've got great drink selections too including wine, sangria, and mocktails.
