Smoque BBQ////Yep, it's that good.  Favorites included the sliced brisket and sausage.  The brisket was so tender and with the sauce, I could have eaten a pound by myself.  I also love that the slaw is vinegar based (I hate mayo!).  We ordered take-out and it was super efficient, albeit a little soup nazi-esque.  We ordered a very early dinner (5:30 pick up).  Will for sure keep this on my go-to list for Chicago visits!
