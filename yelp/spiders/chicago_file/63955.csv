Smoque BBQ////These guys have just lost touch with reality, food is fine but an increase in their chopped brisket from $16.99 to $19.99 is evidence that their intent on gouging the "foodie" klans that roam Chicago. This place used to be nice departure from conventional cuisine but they're clearly intent on exploiting their "niche" in their culinary space. It's an easy decision for me, just say no, there is no justification for such drastic price increases that grossly outpace the rate of inflation, and I can assure none their employees saw a cent of this additional increase. Nice try, maybe the folks that come in from the suburbs will pay this ridiculous price but for those of us who live in the neighborhood understand what's going over there. Simple just don't go there any longer until they start to become reasonable.
