Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We also had a really wonderful server for this last dinner - he had blond hair and glasses and worked downstairs. He even procured my dad his favorite cocktail that wasn't on the menu anymore, and offered (without us asking) to chop up our wedge salad so we could split it more easily. Very thoughtful.
