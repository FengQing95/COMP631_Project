The Purple Pig////The service is great: wonderful presentation of food, and the food was very tasty. We got the bone marrow, scallops, and meatballs. The bone marrow was very interesting. I've never had bone marrow before, but it looked very impressive and the balance of flavors and textures between the cilantro, bread, salt, and bone marrow was excellent. The scallops looked great on the plate, one of them was a little over cooked, but the other two were perfect. The polenta and garnishes were great complements to the scallops. The meatballs were just amazing. They were soft, with nice mild flavors, and the sauces and garnishes complemented them very well.
