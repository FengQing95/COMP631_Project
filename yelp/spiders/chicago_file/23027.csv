Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Not sure if I'm just not a deep dish pizza fan, but I tried Lou Malnati's and thought it was solid, but not amazing (especially for the price!) I had a flight to catch this afternoon, so I called ahead to Lou Malnati's so that my order would be ready right when they opened at 11am. Sure enough, it was ready and I was excited to try my piping hot personal-sized Chicago classic pizza. I do love a good crust, and particularly loved the crunch of the crust. The mozzarella was also fantastic--you could just tell by the way it stretched! Sauce was good, sausage was good. But given the price ~$10 for a 6" pizza, would I get it again? Probably not.
