The Purple Pig////I chose The Purple Pig for our group (of five) for lunch because it popped up on Yelp as one of the highest-rated and most-reviewed restaurants on The Magnificent Mile. We were already on the Mag Mile, so I wanted to choose a place that was within walking distance. The Purple Pig is located near the south end of the Mag Mile, a few blocks north of the river.
