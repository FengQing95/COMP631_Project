Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering.
