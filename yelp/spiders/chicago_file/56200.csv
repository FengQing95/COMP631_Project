Smoque BBQ////I do have two complaints though which held back a 5-star rating. They lost one star for being out of pulled-pork by the time I went to eat dinner (around 8:45pm on a Friday). This is understandable as pulled-pork is delicious and in high demand, but they should really plan to have more cooked on a busy Friday night so they don't run out. They lost another star because of the price. The place is run like an upscale Boston Market, where you place your order, hang out for a while until your order number is called before you go get your tray of food and a couple of plastic utensils. I have no problem for this if I'm dropping $7 at a fast food restaurant, but if it's a BYOB self-serve joint I shouldn't have to pay $15+ for a meal. For these prices they should really have wait service and some real knives and forks.
