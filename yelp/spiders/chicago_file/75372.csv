Little Goat Diner////Brunch is probably my favorite meal of the day. When I'm traveling I'm always trying to find the best brunch places. There are so many in the Chicago area and Little Goat diner does not disappoint! This place was packed!! Fortunately they take reservations. I ordered this little piggy went to China and boy was it packed with flavor. We also got a cinnamon roll, who knew simple cinnamon roll can be soooo good. It was moist and had the right amount of sweetness. Service was fairly fast. Can't wait to return to Little Goat!
