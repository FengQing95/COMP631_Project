Smoque BBQ////What is this unbelievably popular BBQ joint doing a mile south of my middle-of-nowhere house? I've never eaten there (the dining area is rather smallish), but I have ordered the BBQ to go on several occasions, and you know there is the anticipation when you have a smile on your face as you leave the premises with your bag of food. The St. Louis Ribs are tasty, smoky and chewy with very little fat and a tangy sauce on the side. They also have baby back ribs. The pulled pork is tender although the meat begs to be smothered with the sauce. The brisket has a heartier flavor. Sides include cole slaw, fries, beans and cornbread. I like the mac and cheese and peach cobbler as the best sides, both served warm in foil cups. I ate half a leftover pulled pork sandwich at the office today and the aroma was just slaying my co-workers. It tasted as good as it smelled even as leftovers. Â
