Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I brought a date here on the recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed. The servers were attentive and not pretentious, and the price was way better than a lot of other steakhouses in the city. Their bread and butter that they serve is amazing, but do not fill up on it because once you taste one of their steaks it melts in your mouth and is cooked to perfection. Also you can try one of their burgers, but if you do ask them to caramelize the onions and your palette can thank me later.
