The Purple Pig////Since the place specialize in all things pork, we decided on the Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder. The meat could have been more tender, it was tasty but again, it didn't wow me but was enjoyable enough. We also had the Crispy Pigs Ears with kale and fried egg. This dish was quite nice.
