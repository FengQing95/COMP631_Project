Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Now on to the food. Uh, yum. My husband is a baker and is always extremely critical about bread. He LOVES the bread here. To start we ordered the wood roasted pepper, eggplant and tomato spread which was delicioooooousss!!! I could have ordered more but after receiving it and ordering a ridiculous amount of tapas I just couldn't.
