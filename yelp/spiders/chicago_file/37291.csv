Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The courses came out in a timely manner. Since we were celebrating our anniversary, they had specially printed menus to help us celebrate just that. It was great. There were even two glasses of champagne waiting for us. Like I said, the service was superb and I can't wait to go back.
