Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The deep dish pizza is so good.. from the sound of a pizza having a lot of cheese, i thought it would be disgusting but when I tried it.. I was so surprised and amazed of how I could not stop eating my slice, and I wanted more!! The marinara sauce is what makes a pizza, and their pizza had a lot of flavorful sauce that it made it the perfect comfort food for the Chicago cold weather.
