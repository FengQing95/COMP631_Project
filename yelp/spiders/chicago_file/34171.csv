Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////BTW my other friend got the chicken as well and our other friend has the beef stroganoff with extra mushrooms per our waiter.  You can get the stroganoff w/o beef for a few bucks less.  It looked to be a very rich and heavy dinner.  Just right for winter and bourbon drinking!!
