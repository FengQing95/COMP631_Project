Little Goat Diner////Stopped in here for lunch on a Wednesday.  Had the chick pea salad (added grilled chicken), and loved it.  Added a cup of their tomato/apple soup on the side, which was also yummy.  I'm not a fan of tomato soup in general, but the apple made it just sweet enough, while still enjoying the richness of the tomato.  Back to the salad, it was chock full of very fresh and crunchy veggies, and came topped with a few vegetable fritters on top.
