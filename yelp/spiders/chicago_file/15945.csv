Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had one of the best thin crust pizzas I've had in Chicago here. My friend and I ordered the spinach and mushroom pizza and it was delicious. FYI: the spinach is sauteed with basil, garlic and onions. The sauce is sweet and zesty and slightly chunky. The crust is thin and crisp.
