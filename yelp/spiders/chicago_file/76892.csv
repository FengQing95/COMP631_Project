Little Goat Diner////Really nothing healthy on the menu so don't go if you are on a diet.  While the food was good I found the service to be a little rushed.  I also thought the price point was a little high for what is was (casual American with some ethnic/fusion twists).  Guess that's what comes with the territory for a celebrity chef joint.
