Little Goat Diner////I have already decided that when--not if--but when I come back to Chicago, the first place I'm revisiting is Little Goat Diner. I mean this was incredible. I'd give it more stars if I could. After dining at Girl and the Goat two nights before, I genuinely did not have high expectations. I figured it'd be like a spin-off of that restaurant with some decent diner food. Are you kidding me? I was shooketh. So we walked in on a Wednesday afternoon and the place was already packed. We had no reservations and lucked out with two seats at the bar stools. We were excited. After looking through the menu, we noticed the diner was home to many ethnically-diverse food items. We both chose sandwiches.
