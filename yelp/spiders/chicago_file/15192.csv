Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They have the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. I have been to all the other deep dish pizza restaurants in Chicago and no other restaurant even comes close. Be prepared to wait for up to an hour to get a table. Don't forget to try the malnati salad here. It is amazing. The pizza and other items on their menu are very reasonable priced considering how popular they are. I have been here on several occasions and never been disappointed. If you count your calories like me the low fat cheese with gluten free crust option is not bad at all.
