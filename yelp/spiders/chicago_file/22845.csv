Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was honestly such a disappointment...after reading all of the reviews raving about the pizza, my friends and I decided to try it out. What a mistake. It was over packed and they told us the wait would be 1.5 hrs, which was pretty true. However the wait was not worth it at all. Upon being seated, they asked us what we would like aside from the pizza we had ordered at the cashier's...we ordered the calimari upon their recommendation. This was the first mistake. It was flavorless without the cocktail sauce they provided on the side. When the pizza came out, they cut it for us and served it for it. The bottom of the crust was extremely hard and did not even really cut with the knife...the flavor was honestly just salty. The cheese stopped being hot really quickly, almost immediate after they served us... so it just turned hard. It was lacking in so many areas..I really was looking forward to Chicago deep dish pizza, but...this was so disappointing. We will give deep dish pizza a try elsewhere.
