Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Service here is INCREDIBLY slow. Yes I know the pizza takes an hour to cook. But it shouldn't take 20 minutes for someone to give us glasses of water. It shouldn't take another 20 minutes to get beer order. These people are working hard, but the service here is still incredibly slow.
