Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Starters: Definitely get the warm sourdough & fresh butter to start with. If you're wanting a starter, try their bone marrow- its 5 bones with fresh bread & the most savory onion jam you've ever had! You can also just get an add-on to your steak dish if you don't want the whole order. They also have a great seafood selection!
