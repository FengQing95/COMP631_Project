Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ok I was there on Wednesday November 27 with my family I had a reservation for 8:30pm the hostess said we should be able to get you seated before 9:30 so I said ok but I thought about it wait a reservation means that you should be able to get a table a little but sooner than 1 hour I had forgotten my other phone where I had the information of the reservation so my wife ask the lady why an hour wait she said because your reservation is at 9:30pm so log in my email and I found the reservation and it was for 8:30 I didn't say anything because they called us in for our table. But that's not it so this is what a call false advertising we order a pitcher of sangria the waitress said full pitcher should be able to serve you from 4-6 glasses of sangria so we ordered one but since my wife was under the weather she said no ice when the waitress brought us the sangria because she got close enough to the table she started to pour it on the glass so we wouldn't noticed how little they was bringing to the table she served us one glass each and my wife asked her are you bringing more sangria because the pitcher was almost empty after she only served us one glass each so she responded sorry this is the portion of sangria you get because you don't want ice so I just told wife let's finish our drink and let's go elsewhere for dinner  I don't like to get robbed if that's the case just tell me it's more money than just charge me $30 for 2 glasses of sangria FYI I still tip the waitress I don't think it's her fault she's  just fallowing orders from the management.
