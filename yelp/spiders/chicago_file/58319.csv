Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered the 1/2 pitcher of red classic sangria which is excellent, Croquttes, Chicken empanada, Brussels sprouts, lamb chops, chicken & Chorizo skewer, scallops. Desserts we got chocolate cake, almond bar, flan and some berry sponge cake with icecream. We also got a free dessert with Yelp Checkin. I love coming here and hope we always get seated in the main dining space!!!
