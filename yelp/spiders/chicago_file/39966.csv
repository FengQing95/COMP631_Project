Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The sides were my favorite part of the meal. We ordered the truffle Mac & cheese and the Brussels sprouts. Both were outstanding. The Mac had a really rich cheese sauce. The Brussels sprouts had a great vinegarette and they were cooked so well that they just melted in my mouth.
