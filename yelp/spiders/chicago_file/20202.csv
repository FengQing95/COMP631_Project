Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////On my recent trip to Chicago, I had to get in my share of the famous Chicago Pizza. Everyone I know told me I needed to go to Lou Malanati's. So on my 2nd day in Chicago, I waited in line. The hostess told us our wait was 45 mins to an hour, so we decided to go for a walk, little did we know, we would get seated with in 20. So my group and I rushed back, all sweaty and stuff. Good thing, the work out increased our appetite because I was ready to down some deep dish pizza.
