Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is one of mine and my husbands favorite restaurants.  We've been there enough times where we have our favorites (beef tenderloin medallions, spicy potatoes, ham & chicken croquettes, braised lamb, and the carmelized banana dessert).  Of course with the red sangria.   We have tried a few different things that we weren't the biggest fan of, but I still think Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba deserves 5 stars.  We are always stuffed and able to drink sangria the entire meal for a decent price.
