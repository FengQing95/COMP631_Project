Smoque BBQ////OMG - can I say BBQ heaven???!!!  Now I'm no bbq expert, but this is damn good food.  I make the 20 mile car ride once a month to treck out to this little hole in the wall bbq joint.  I've had the sliced brisket,  pulled pork, Texas sausage, BBQ beans, corn bread, peach cobbler, and cole slaw.  I love the sliced the brisket, and their cornbread.  The cornbread is moist, brisket is tender, and their bbq sauce is very tasty.  Pulled pork is delicious, but I prefer the brisket.  The Texas sausage is a very yummy, smokey sausage.  Their cole slaw is vinegar based and no mayo.
