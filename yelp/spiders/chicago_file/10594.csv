Art Institute of Chicago////As a life long Chicagoan I've been here many times over the course of my life. Finally I'm giving them a review! Although we don't live in Chicago anymore I always try to make a trip while in town. They usually have fabulous exhibits and exhibitions coming as they are a major museum. They have not just world class art they have a great restaurant as well. They have all the greats art wise just name one and they have at least one if not two of them. The modern art wing is a must see with huge Jackson Pollack's and more.... it's a Chicago institution and the museum is well planned out and the staff is helpful. You can read other reviews below on this gem but please go it's one of those places on Your museum bucket list to go to it should be! If you go you can take the "el" , bus, walk, Uber, Drive in the street can be a pain they do have a lot. It's great to see during the holidays as they decorate the lions out front. Go and enjoy
