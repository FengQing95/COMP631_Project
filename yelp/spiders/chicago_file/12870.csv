Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Stopped in for a quick bite had an individual pizza. Each pizza takes about 45 minutes to make, so make sure you don't go if you need food immediately, at least without ordering some appetizers. The pizza is quite tasty and pretty much what you would expect for a traditional Chicago style pizza shop; definitely worth a visit for tourists and locals alike.
