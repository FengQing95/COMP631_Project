Smoque BBQ////Sides were indifferent.  We did not touch the slaw due to the significant dose of red onion.  We would not have ordered it if we had known.  I am the only one who liked the baked, thick style mac and cheese.  I prefer this to the Kraft Velveeta kind.  This was made with actual cheese, so consequently it was a little grainy.  That happens.  I also liked the corn bread.  It was pretty sweet with some sweet corn kernals.
