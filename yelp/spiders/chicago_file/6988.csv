Art Institute of Chicago////Cost:  A painful subject.  At $18 per, it's about the most expensive museum you can walk into...except for the Field Museum. I think they do still have deals for families and reduced prices for kids and students. European visitors, who are used to paying 10€  to walk into iconic museums like the Louvre and Prado, should understand that the high cost of our museums has to do with the fact that the arts receive almost no funding/subsidies from state and federal tax coffers.
