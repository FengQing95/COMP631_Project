Art Institute of Chicago////One word: amazing.  And when I was originally making an itinerary for my trip to Chicago, I wasn't even planning on visiting!  There is so much gorgeous/interesting stuff to see here; I want to tell people to plan more than one day for it!... but I know that's probably unrealistic.  Me, I spent three hours here and would have stayed longer if my flight weren't leaving a couple hours later.  I feel like I missed out on so much I had left I wanted to see!
