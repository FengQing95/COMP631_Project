Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Stuffed Spinach Bread: 5/5. Knowing we'd be waiting a while for our food, our server recommended ordering an appetizer to nibble on in the meantime. The Stuffed Spinach Bread was small, but so flaky and delicious. I could've eaten five of them. It wasn't so much "bread" as it was a crust - it was like a Hot Pocket, if he went off to college and became a successful businessman.
