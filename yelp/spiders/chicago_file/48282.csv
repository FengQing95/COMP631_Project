Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tapas were delicious! My favorite was the chorizo-wrapped medjool date and cheese. We ordered many different items off the menu. It was plenty for a meal. Also enjoyed the pitcher of sangria on happy hour. It was a deal! Don't forego the dessert tapas. They were also excellent!
