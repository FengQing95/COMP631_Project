Smoque BBQ////I've been here many times, but last week, I realized my love for Smoque. My dad called and asked if I wanted to come over for dinner. I said maybe, I had some work to catch up, and should probably clean my apartment. He replied, "Well, let me know because we're ordering Smoque and need to know how much to order." Smoque, you say? Forget work and cleaning, I'm coming over for dinner!
