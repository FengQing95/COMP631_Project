Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Overall the atmosphere was nice, service was great, and the food was awesome. Â It is a little on the pricy side for pizza, we spent about a hundred between the three of us (we did get 5 drinks). Nevertheless, I would still recommend it if you want to try the Chicago style deep dish pizza.
