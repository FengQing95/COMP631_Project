Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The meal was also fantastic, and honestly, the prices were not outrageous, which I was fully expecting. We started with oysters which were fresh and outstanding. We also got the wedge salad, which is a must as the homemade dressing and thick-cut bacon was unreal. We opted for the smaller filet for dinner, which was perfectly cooked and had a great char on the outside. Â But honestly, the sides took the show. I am not a mac and cheese fan, but the truffle mac and cheese and mashed potatoes were unbelievable. At this point in the meal, I was doubled over in pain from the amount of food, but I couldn't resist the Lemon Meringue pie, which by the way, has enough meringue for twenty people.
