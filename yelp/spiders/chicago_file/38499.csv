Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Upon entering, it's hard not to notice how great the ambiance is. It's easy to get the feeling like you walked back in time, like maybe the 40s. We got a cocktail at the upstairs bar/dining area before being brought to our table downstairs. I got a Sazerac which was excellent. I tasted their Negroni and Lion's Tail, both were well made too. The 5 of us shared a bottle of wine iwth our meal too that fit our meal perfectly. Once downstairs, you'll notice there is a different vibe from upstairs. It feels more lounge/den like which worked too. I do prefer the upstairs though.
