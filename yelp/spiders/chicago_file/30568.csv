Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The best part of this pizza is the sauce.  That's where most of the flavor was coming from and I could have used a little more of it.  It's an excellent robust sauce.  I love the concept of an entire layer of sausage patty like a manhole cover that covers the bottom layer of crust and then layer mozzarella.  However the sausage was very mild.  It would be awesome if they had a hot Italian sausage option.  After the sausage lid, came the sauce and then the rest of the toppings were kind of thrown on very sloppily.  Someone couldn't be bothered to separate the pepperoni, so some pieces were actually 4 pieces thick, and others were just one.  Also the pepperoni lacked character and was pretty forgettable.
