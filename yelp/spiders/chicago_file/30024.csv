Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you've never had deep-dish pizza in Chicago before, Lou Malnati's is one of the classic places to get it. According to the menu, this location in River North is the oldest (established 1986) of its four city locations. Another place to consider is competitor Giordano's. There's a location about a block off the Mag Mile at Superior and Rush.
