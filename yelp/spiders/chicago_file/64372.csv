Smoque BBQ////So, we're standing in this obnoxious line and I say to my wife, "this better be the best BBQ I've ever had"....since I hate standing in lines and almost never do.  It was.  I had the brisket platter chopped with burndt ends with corn bread, cole slaw, and mac and cheese.  My wife had a half slab of ribs with corn bread, baked beans, and cole slaw.  We had the pecan bread pudding for desert.  The highlight was really the brisket.  It was so tender and tasty.  Really, really outstanding.  The corn bread was very good too.  We thought her ribs were good but not great.  The desert....wow.  IT WAS SO GOOD.  I was glad that we only got one to share....cuz I would have eaten 2 or 3 of those.
