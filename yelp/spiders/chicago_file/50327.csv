Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I like Cafe Ba Ba Reeba for a variety of reasons. Their sangria is tops, I always start with a glass or three. The passion fruit sangria is my favorite. The tapas are bit larger than most at other restaurants. I always forget this when I am there and end up ordering too much, but there are worse problems to have.
