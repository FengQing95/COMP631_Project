Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago is massive. You need more than a whole day to really see and appreciate everything here. This place has art from all corners of the world, pieces from the ancient era to the modern era, and not just paintings and sculptures but also photographs, ceramics, textiles, artifacts and so much more - spread out over four gigantic levels.
