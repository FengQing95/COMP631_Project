Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Went for Sunday brunch with a party of 4 and had almost an hour wait. We expected that though, so it was ok. We were seated inside, and I was disappointed at how cramped it was and to find the tables so close together. The food was very good--tried several signature dishes. My husband really enjoyed the Illy coffee and the fresh squeezed OJ. Overall, I have had better brunch experiences elsewhere.
