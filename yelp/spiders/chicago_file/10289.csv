Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is a world class museum. Having visited countless art collections in London, Paris, Amsterdam and Berlin, I'm still impressed by this collection in our own back yard. Sometimes you just have to take time to be a tourist in your own city and for the month of February the Art Institute is helping you do just that, because it's free! So let's put on our black turtle necks, horn rimmed glasses and berets and take a tour!
