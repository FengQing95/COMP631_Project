Smoque BBQ////First time in Chicago, and all I heard was "gotta try out Smoque's" BBQ. Great location on the north side, pretty busy for a Sunday evening. Line was out the door and wait time till We got to the counter to order was about 25-30mins not bad, but not good. Other than the wait, the food was pretty good, I got the 1/2 slab rib dinner with 2 sides and a peach cobbler, pretty amazing. I'll definitely be back to Smoque's on my next Chicago visit.
