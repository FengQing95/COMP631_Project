Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I would hate to have had to clean up after our 18-person gluttony-fest here. We ate and drank until I was sure I weighed at least 15 pounds more. I like everything except the serrano ham (because, ew, ham) and everyone I was with was thrilled too. We waited a while for our table even though we had called ahead, but there were a ton of us, so that's to be expected. Very fun and very delicious and highly recommended.
