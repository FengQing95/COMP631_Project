Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////-Bone Marrow-this could be an acquired taste but I love it! if you are like me and are filipino or have grown up in ethnic kitchens, we have a obsession with fatty foods and that is exactly what bone marrow is. It gets all the tasty slivers of fat and when you smother it on your piece of bread mixed with the jam and onions...YES.
