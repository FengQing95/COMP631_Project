Little Goat Diner////Fair warning, my review is quite biased and I've only been here once. That one experience was not the typical patron's experience, as it was for a private event held upstairs. I was not responsible for the arrangements, so I can't even speak to whether this restaurant creates these menus for each event or what. I don't see any of the dishes I enjoyed in the pictures or the current menu. But... y'all. It's so worth it to call and ask.
