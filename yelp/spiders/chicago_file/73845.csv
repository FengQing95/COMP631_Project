Little Goat Diner////We were anxious to get this place after all the hype. The food did not disappoint, however the service was abominable! It was a Friday afternoon around 2pm. We waited to be greeted by our server for at least 10 minutes. Waited another 10 minutes for water. Â We were a party of 5 with pretty simple drink orders, ice tea, Diet Coke and a glass of wine. The drinks came AFTER the food which took 30 minutes to arrive at our table. I had to ask a second time for the glass of wine. Left this place with a "bad taste in my mouth"......other restaurants with far superior service in Chicago....visit them instead.
