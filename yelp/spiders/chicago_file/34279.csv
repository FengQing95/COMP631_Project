Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came here for a drink before dinner in river north. Sat at the bar and loved it, can't wait to come back again for dinner! The decor is dark but makes you feel like you've traveled back in time and are at a supper club. Removed a star since it's slightly overpriced, but it's river north.
