Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Was visiting friends and we decided to get a delivery to have a quick dinner before going out for the night. Typical delivery time, about 45 mins or so. When the pizza arrived it was still perfect! Hot, cheesy, crispy. I am obsessed. I can't imagine how amazing it would be getting it fresh out of the oven! Can't wait to go back.
