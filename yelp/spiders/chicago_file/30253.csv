Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They did have free pizza made and sitting on the counter for those who were waiting which is a nice touch. Â They were also allowing people to pre order which is a good option. While I don't know how much longer it would have been if I didn't pre order, it's still better than waiting and hour for a table then ordering.
