Art Institute of Chicago////I ended up spending 2 hours here with family and still was not able to go through the entire building. I ended up walkig through with my mother and it was talking and walking through the museum and seeing artists that I had learned about in my art history classes. It was even entertaining having my mom recognize some because she has helped me study. Â
