Art Institute of Chicago////I wish I could spend all day here. My boyfriend and I came to Chicago for the weekend and got to the museum around 10:00 am to get in line before it opened. We spent a good two and a half hours exploring the museum and still kept finding additional exhibits that were interesting. Too bad we had other plans for the day and had to head out after lunch.
