Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Service is AWFUL. Even if you have a reservation, you usually have to wait 10-15 minutes for a table, and last time we were there, we were literally waving at our waiter to try to get his attention. He'd walk straight by and not make eye contact...about five times before taking our order, getting us more drinks, etc. So much for that tip.
