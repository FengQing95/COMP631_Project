Art Institute of Chicago////There's literally something for everyone here. Â The art is broken down into different eras and styles. Some rooms have recurring videos and others have items from Classic movies of the last century. Whether or not art and museums are your cup of tea, this is a very interesting experience that one can come to alone, with a significant other or with the family. Either way, it will make for a memorable experience and keep your attention.
