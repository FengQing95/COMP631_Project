The Purple Pig////All the dishes are served tapas style with a Mediterranean flare, so try to come with at least 3-4 people! They recommend about 2 dish per person and that was more than enough for us. The seating here is a bit strange though. We got seated at a communal table outside but instead of having us sit 2 on each side facing each other, we had 2 on one side, 1 at the head, and 1 on the other side. That made talking to each other a bit awkward.
