Little Goat Diner////Fried Chicken - The chicken was actually really tasty. The skin/breading was very light and crunchy and did not at all have that greasy taste/texture. The meat was ultra juicy too. My only complaint is that it was a little on the small side. The breast seemed more like half the size of what you get at KFC/Popeyes. I wasn't the biggest fan of the coleslaw that was on the side, but it was topped with some delicious crunchy fried onions so it was ok.
