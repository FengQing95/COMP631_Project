Little Goat Diner////Amazing food! This was my first time at the restaurant - after having been to girl and the goat, I was excited to try out little goat. The entire restaurant has a cute diner feel with a great vibe. The service was great, as well. My favorite part was the food - the drowned sandwich was divine and I adore the fact that they have chocolate milk. It was the first time I've had chocolate milk since I was 12, and it was glorious. Overall, cute restaurant and delicious food. I can't wait to go back!
