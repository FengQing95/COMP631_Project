Smoque BBQ////I have gone to Smoque since the week it opened and have tried everything on this menu several times (well, except the salad).  Smoque serves both baby back and St Louis style ribs, but, they are on a mission to convert Chicagoans to St Louis style.  I've got to say, they're doing a good job.  Also, I can't say enough good things about the brisket and pulled pork.  The sides are delicious and despite consistently eating too much of the bbq, I always save room for the tiny peach cobbler.  The only bad thing is that sometimes they do run out of menu items-- if that happens, just try something else, it's all great!
