Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is in the running for the worst service at a restaurant. We got there and ordered our pizza even before we were seated. Once seated it took them forever to even bring out menus. 30 minutes into the meal we finally got the pitcher of beer we ordered, how long does it take to get beer? 45 minutes into the meal we got the appetizer we ordered. And about an hour and 15 minutes into the meal we finally got our pizza. We boxed it up and left so we wouldn't have to deal with the terrible service anymore.
