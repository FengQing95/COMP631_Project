Little Goat Diner////The first time I went, my wife and I found a packed diner but were seated within 10 mins at the diner counter. The cool thing about eating at the diner counter is that you get a direct view of the kitchen and dishes coming out. I also saw Stephanie walk past, which was a huge plus!
