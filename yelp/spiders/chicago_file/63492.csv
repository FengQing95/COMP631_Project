Smoque BBQ////For the sides, I have one word to describe them, Vinegar.  The slaw you get is like a carolina style with no sweetness at all.  I am a huge fan of slaw, but I could not eat this at all.  The bbq sauces are very runny and lacking in much flavor.  The beans were decent, but could have used a bit more sweetness.  The fries were really tasty.  We also ordered a  bread pudding desert, but were disappointed with that as well.
