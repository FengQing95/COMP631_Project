Art Institute of Chicago////I'm not a museum or artsy person but I really enjoyed walking around here.  Open and easy to navigate. They have a Manet exhibit going on right now but I did not have time for it.  I've discovered I like Renoir. When I was a kid we used to play the game Masterpiece and I knew many of the works of art here because of that game.
