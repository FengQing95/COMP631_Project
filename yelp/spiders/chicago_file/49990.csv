Smoque BBQ////The sliced brisket sandwich was good, not great, not bad, just good. The portion size of beef was very small considering what the sandwich cost. I was expecting a pile of meat but the two halfs of the bun were touching each other. Meaning not much meat was between the bread. The beans really were not that great, kind of watery with an addition of the bbq sauce which again made for an off flavor.
