Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came with a group of friends that had never had Chicago style pizza before. The four of them decided to get the Malnati Chicago Classic. Since I don't eat meat, I ordered the Lou's personal pizza. I feel like my review might be higher if I had tried the pizza in the big pan versus the personal one. The personal one doesn't come in a pan, and it honestly is a bit pricy for what you get! Flavors were ok, but wasn't wow.
