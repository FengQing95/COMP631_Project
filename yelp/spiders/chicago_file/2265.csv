The Purple Pig////Beware it is a small tight space. Everything has lines, the bar, the bathroom, the line to put your name on the list to wait in line. Because of how crowded it was it is a bit hard to sit completely comfortable. People are constantly moving and hitting your chair or awkwardly standing next to your table staring at you as you eat and they do wait, wait in line. Because people have to wait to put their name on the list they keep the door open and a few of the women got VERY cold with the drafty door open about 75% of our time there.
