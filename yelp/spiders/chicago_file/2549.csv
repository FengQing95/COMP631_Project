The Purple Pig////The food and wine menus are both pretty expansive and full of delicious options. The service was quick, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. It sounds like the menu regularly changes and the chefs are constantly coming up with creative new specials and menu items. The menu is tapas style but seems to have a lot of meat/cheese combos, seafood, and creative vegetable options. We had the heirloom tomato and feta salad, pesto octopus, and turkey leg. Everything was absolutely delicious! The turkey leg was a pretty big plate, so three items to split was more than enough for two!
