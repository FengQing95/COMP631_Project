Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The large pizzas are big. For a party of 4 I would recommend 3 pizzas. That's more than enough to feed the table. The Malnati Classic pizza had great sausage, but the tasted was a bit smothered by the mass amounts of cheese. Nonetheless, Lou's is a must try if you're visiting Chicago.
