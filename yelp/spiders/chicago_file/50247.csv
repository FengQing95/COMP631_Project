Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If I have my choice of cuisine I usually don't pick tapas (although I can't resist a glass of sangria). However, I think Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is a pretty good tapas restaurant in Chicago. I've enjoyed many of their dishes, especially the goat cheese with marinara sauce and the stuffed mushrooms.  It's the perfect place for a big group...my team at work had a dinner here last summer and it was very enjoyable!  I'm not the only person in Chicago who loves Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba so make sure you make a reservation ahead of time to avoid a very long wait.
