Little Goat Diner////We ordered coffee, two Bloody Mary's, biscuits and gravy (both large and small), scrambled eggs, sausage, and grits (totaling $63 before tip). The coffee was really good and tasted like Intelligentsia but wasn't. The Bloody Mary's were okay but we've definitely had better ones. I thought the sausage was the most amazing thing there - it tasted like bacon and I LOVE bacon. M and I both gobbled down the grits. We liked the biscuits and gravy (the biscuits were sweet and the gravy was savory) but we probably wouldn't get it again. My sister didn't say anything about her eggs.
