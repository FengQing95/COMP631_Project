Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I ordered the salmon au poivre and he ordered a ribeye steak. Â We split side dishes of roasted brocolli, garlic mashed potatoes, and butternut squash. The vegetables were flavorful and perfectly cooked, and the salmon was amazing - the pepper coated crust added an interesting touch to the delicate fish.
