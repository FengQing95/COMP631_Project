Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////After my previous visit a member of the Hogsalt team reached out to me and apologized for any issues I encountered in my visit. She was very accommodating and secured me a new reservation to give them a redo. This visit could not have been better. We were well taken care of by all the waitstaff and the food was to the high standard that we are used to here even though the room was packed. As usual we probably ordered too much food but the experience was fantastic.
