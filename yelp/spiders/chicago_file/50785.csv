Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We did the short rib, garlic shrimp - which were great - but, two others stood out. The melon and serrano ham was insane! I never would have paired the two, but took a leap. Tasty and thinly sliced melon draped a pile of thin-sliced ham. You just go to town on it and it's all good. The other one I loved most was the peri-peri chicken. I'm sure the chef would filet me for saying it, but think - chicken nuggets in an awesome peri-peri pepper sauce. The result? AMAZING! I could have just eaten that and loved the place.
