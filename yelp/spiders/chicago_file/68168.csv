Little Goat Diner////The coffee arrived shortly after our lil' redhead stepped away.  We had cream and a few sips and like magic little pink goats appeared dancing along the interior walls of our mugs.  CUTE!!!  Our entrees arrived soon and I just stared at it.  There were two nice-sized slices of brioche with sliced chicken tenders and strawberries scattered across them.  They were sitting in an irregular pool of maple syrup that smelled divine but I was expecting more on my plate.  Something was missing.  I couldn't put my finger on what it was nor could I remember all the fancy words that were on the menu but  I sliced and nibbled on the corner of one of the slices and forked a piece of chicken along with a strawberry slice.  I put it in my mouth and the flavors and textures went really well together.  I was a little surprised.  We kept at our conversation and I took more bites of what my knife and fork could chop off.  The toast was a lil' soft towards the center-ish and while knifing through it a gush of yellow stuff came spilling out.  OMG!!  It was as if I was a Beverley hillbilly and I had struck black gold....or yellow....or whatever.  I was so excited because THIS is what was missing.  There was a running yolk egg in my damn French toast!!  It was Christmas all over again.  HOW did they do that??!!  Needless to say, the rest of the plate did not have a chance.  I devoured the entire plate.  There was nothing left.  My date ate half of his but he's watching his weight.  Meanwhile, I am watching mine balloon.
