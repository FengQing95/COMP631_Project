Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////But now, I have to say that Lou Malnati's is the best out of all of them, and I am definitely going back the next time I'm in Chicago. They've perfected deep dish pizza so that the crust isn't soggy, the toppings stay intact on your plate instead of flowing flat into a pile of ingredients, and the flavors are simple and delicious.
