Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I needed a wheelbarrow at this point, but we decided to indulge in a flourless chocolate cake dessert. It was the PERFECT size. Very small. But that sucker was DENSE. Very rich chocolate. It had the texture of fudge. And it came with some kind of whipped cream thing. Goodness. I couldn't help myself. I ate a few bites, although I was full.
