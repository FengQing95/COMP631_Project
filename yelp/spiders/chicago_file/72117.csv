Little Goat Diner////Apps: Oh dear god. Mac n' cheese...YES PLEASE! Creamy white cheddar magic served up in a little bowl. Definitely a must. Also amazing to note: the brussel sprouts. Brussel sprouts you're thinking, ewe. But no, not ewe. They were stir fried in a delicious almond sauce with just a hint of garlic. ahhhh
