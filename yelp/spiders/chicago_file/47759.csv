Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Some of the staples that you MUST order are numbers 30 (spicy potatoes with tomato alioli) and 44 (shrimp with garlic). If you visit here those are some of the best tapas on the menu. Beyond that you can't go wrong with another other plate, and that's the best thing about this style of food, if you happen to not enjoy the particular food you ordered then not to worry! They're all small portions so just order something else! Be mindful those cause the bill can easily rack up if you don't pay attention (I just spent $80 there for just the two of us, but left with leftovers and a food baby so it was all good). Try the paella too! Just know that you need to order a minimum of two servings ($12 a serving) and it takes about 30 minutes to cook. The entire thing could feed probably four people though for the two servings (that's if you're also ordering other tapas).
