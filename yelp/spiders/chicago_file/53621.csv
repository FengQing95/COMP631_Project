Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had the immense pleasure of dining with Ashley as my server and I could not have been happier. It was my first time in the city and she was more than willing to share local spots with my group to visit. As someone who has been a server at a few restaurants, Ashley went way above and beyond what I've ever seen and I could not have enjoyed her presence more. If management reads this, please give her a raise because she is an immense asset to your team.
