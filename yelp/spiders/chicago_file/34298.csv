Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is by far the best steak meal I have ever had! Me and a few other friends came to Chicago for my birthday and I wanted a nice steak place. After reading all the reviews on Yelp and comparing it to other places, Bavettes was the one chosen and we were all happy. I had the 16oz Chicago cut ribeye with bone marrow on top and it was the most decadent meal I have ever had. I love steak and I've been to a fair share of upscale places in San Diego and Bavettes trumps them all. The biggest surprise was the Brussels sprouts! I'm not a fan but that was so good. The vinaigrette was carmelized and it had this sweet taste to it. I wanted to order seconds. The ambience is amazing with that jazz, speakeasy feel to it. Our server Shawn was amazing, super friendly and was a blast to converse with. I would go back here again if I'm ever in Chicago in the future. I would give this place 10 stars if I could.
