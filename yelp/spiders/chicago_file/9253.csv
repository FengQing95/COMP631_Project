Art Institute of Chicago////The place was really neat. However, the structure really bothered me a little as it was confusing where we were heading to even when we were looking at the map. The place was really loud, which seemed like the staff did not care about the noise level at all. The art work was good yet I wish they had more pieces of contemporary arts, as I feel like I encountered more artisan works during the whole museum tour.
