Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I call, no reservation available unless I'm ready to come right then at 5:30 pm.  I'm not,  but I figure not the entire house is set up for reservations and I'm willing to wait a while--there's always a bar. We uber over from the hotel. I can't really tell where this place is, the signage seemed iffy. I see an entrance with a canopy and figure I've found it. We walk in and I explain to the hostess we're there for dinner, no res. She reacts with mild disdain, there will be an hour and 15 min wait, no problem. There's a bar.
