Art Institute of Chicago////If you have limited time in Chicago, Art Institute should be one of the places you get to visit. Amazing selection of art from prehistoric to impressionist to modern and contemporary! Make sure you have at least 3 hours and eat before you go there because you will need all the time and energy to see all that this place has to offer! There are a few places for food and drinks at the museum, albeit a bit pricy! Before leaving this place, make sure to stop by the Museum Store- excellent selection of goodies and lots of marked down items!!!
