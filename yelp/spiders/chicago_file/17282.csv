Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////While in Chicago I ate pizza 3 nights in a row, and this was the best. The sauce was literally heaven in your mouth. It was tangy and sweet all at the same time. I knew the tomatoes were fresh because we order an appetizer of bruschetta and the tomatoes were Devine. I usually don't like plain uncooked tomatoes but I was actually scraping these off my plate to eat. If you have only one night in Chicago you should go here for deep dish pizza. Their dessert is really good too! But I can't even put into words how good the sauce was.
