Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I always book through open table to avoid the wait, and I've found that sometimes you can get a table through open table when there is still a line out the door. I have had birthday dinners, graduation celebrations, and anniversary dinners there and never been disappointed. They have even been nice enough to send over a free dessert for some of these occasions.
