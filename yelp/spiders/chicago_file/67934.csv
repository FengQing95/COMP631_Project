Little Goat Diner////was super stoked to try this place, as our can't-get-a-rezzo-at-girl-and-the-goat option. the wait wasn't terrible, just shy of 40 minutes. I was super intrigued by the BREAKFAST SPAGHETTI and was looking forward to the seafood; alas the dish came with a spaghetti/crab/clams patty in a broth that was SO. SALTY. I initially ate through it but once I passed mid-way, it felt like my tongue was corroding away. I was too timid to say anything to the server so unfortunately I can't comment on how they might've responded.
