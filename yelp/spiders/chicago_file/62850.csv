Smoque BBQ////Meats:  The brisket and pulled pork get an A.  The chicken was a bit dry but had a wonderful charred/grilled flavor so that gets a B+.  Now that two days have passed and my stomach is empty again, I am kicking myself for not getting a taste of the ribs.  But at the time, it might have killed me.
