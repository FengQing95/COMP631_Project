Art Institute of Chicago////That isn't a portrait, it's a physical structure inside the exhibit, and that is a real person looking at it (I talked to her in line, don't remember her name, but that tends to happen a lot). This was the featured attraction that ended on 5/10/16. It was so crowded (at about 2pm on a Monday) that it made it difficult to enjoy it and really take in everything. In this way, this pic represents how I was trying to get a look at everything, but couldn't quite see it all (like her). Plus, when my feet got tired, I really wish I could use that bed.
