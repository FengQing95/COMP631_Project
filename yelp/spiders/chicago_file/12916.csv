Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Definitely worth the hype. During my few days in Chicago, I ate here and at Giordano's, one of the other main chains people claim to be the best. I would easily put Lou Malnati's on top. I was by myself and ate a personal Chicago Classic. That was plenty for an individual without feeling groddy afterwards. If you're really hungry or want to take a slice or two home then get the small. Waiter told me the cookie pizza dessert would be life changing and he was right. It was "slap yo ass" good! Long waits but if you're by yourself or just a couple it's definitely worth just sitting at the bar.
