Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was good, I'll give you that.  I've never been one to worship at the altar of thin-crust pizza; I like a thicker crust.  So, on that score, Malnati's deep-dish was already ahead of the game -- I needed no convincing.  It was tasty, and very filling.  On food alone, they would have earned 4 stars.
