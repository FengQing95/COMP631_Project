Art Institute of Chicago////I was also surprised to see the admission price jacked up to $12.  It's been years since I've paid to get in, since my last visit was in February 2007 when they were having a "free month," and for a few years before that, my then-girlfriend had a membership.  I'm happy to pay $12 once per year or so, because I can afford it, and I love the museum and believe in its mission, but that's pretty steep for your average visitor.  They no longer advertise the "suggested donation" idea, so I'm not sure if it's a hard-and-fast rate or still just a requested amount.  The student fee is $7, which is a generous discount instead of the usual $1 or $2 like most places.
