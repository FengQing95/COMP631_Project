Smoque BBQ////Last but not least the pecan bread pudding was an absolutely must! Neither of us typically like bread pudding but it was cheap and we decided it was worth the try. It had a sweet burbon caramel sauce and covered in candied pecans. The pudding itself had a more cake texture which I really enjoyed. Despite being stuffed, we spent time really debating buying more to go.
