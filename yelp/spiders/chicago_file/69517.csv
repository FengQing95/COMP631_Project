Little Goat Diner////The coffee was up there with the fries as the best thing we ate or drank so shout out to Stumptown for that. Â The bill ran about $30 which wasn't too bad but I would say sit at the bar in Little Goat Bread and enjoy a cocktail and the ambiance...maybe wait until Little Goat has their kinks figured out.
