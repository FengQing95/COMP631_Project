Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Easily one of my top 5 dining experiences, from the onset the service was amazing. Free coat check, and the bartender was very friendly while we waited for our table. Reservations recommended ( we waited a bit longer for a booth which was totally ok). Not once did my water glass get empty, the type of attentiveness without being intrusive is priceless . Our waitress, also a Sacramento State alumni was not only fun, but very helpful and made sure my partners birthday dinner was memorable. Will definitely be coming back, next visit to Chicago
