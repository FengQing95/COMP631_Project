Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I really enjoy Lou Malnati's. This location on the weekend for lunch has a ridiculously long wait, but it you have something you need to do around the area that will take 30 min or so, definitely convenient. Put your name in, pre-order your pizza and then run your errands or go walk around or have a drink at the bar and they will text you when the host(ess) is ready to seat you.
