The Purple Pig////Not gonna lie, I'm normally a non-believer in fancy cuisine, but my friend who was visiting wanted to come here, and now I can't wait to go back. We came early and enjoyed being the only guests for brunch. It's a beautiful restaurant with great service. All three dishes we tried, we liked.
