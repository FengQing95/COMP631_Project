Smoque BBQ////So there is a chance that because the restaurant was really busy there is a possibility that their food isn't always as I have described it, so because of the plethora of great reviews, I have decided I will give Smoque BBQ a second chance some time in the future.  However based on our experience today I cannot rate this restaurant above 2 stars overall.  I feel like everyone who has reviewed Smoque BBQ are native Chicagoans that have never truly experienced great BBQ, but then again I could be wrong!   I hope this helps!  Cheers!
