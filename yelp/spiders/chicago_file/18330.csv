Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we got to the restaurant, we were told it would be a 45 minute wait. They said we could order the pizza ahead of time so we wouldn't have to wait. We thought to ourselves, perfect! Boy were we wrong. The pizza was cold and there was no sauce on it. When we asked for more sauce, the waitress said she would get us some. 20 minutes later, she asked how everything was. We asked for the sauce again, and she brought it 5 minutes later. Only got one refill for the hour we were there. Terrible service. I would never go back.
