Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The Brunch Tapas menu here is literally the best. I live out in the suburbs and getting brunch at this restaurant is worth the trip. I first went with a group and ordered the peach sangria, the hash, and the Nutella waffles. I was not disappointed. My cocktail was crowned with delicious chunks of fruit, including apples, which I let sit in the cocktail and absorb it for a delicious after cocktail treat. I definitely recommend ordering at least a half pitcher especially if one in your party orders it as well. The buttermilk waffle with marcona almond Nutella and bananas is deep wonderfully balanced and not too sweet. A great dish if you're craving the sweeter side of breakfast. If you're craving the savory side of breakfast I loved the ham hash with vegetables, potatoes and poached egg, it was perfectly seasoned and a great way to start off my meal. 10/10 brunch recommendation. I went back a second time and ordered the same thing. I can't say enough good things about this place. If I had one complaint it would be that the place can get loud if you are seated near large groups.
