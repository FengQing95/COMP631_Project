Art Institute of Chicago////There's a ton to look at. On the back of the visitors guide is essentially a scavenger hunt to see 12 works of art under an hour. After walking around the city all day, we decided to follow the list. We some how managed to get distracted and lost. It's pretty difficult to navigate thru all the exhibits since only the first floor has access to all areas. You'd probably need to spend days here to really enjoy and learn about all the works and exhibits.
