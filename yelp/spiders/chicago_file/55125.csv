Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is the restaurant in Chicago that I've been to the most. They have the best happy hour in the city. Between 4-6pm everyday in the bar area, you can get very inexpensive tapas and $16 pitchers of their classic red sangria. My favorite item here is the spicy potatoes. If you like crisp potatoes and a kick of heat, this place is it and they serve it up with a spicy aioli. They have a wonderful Moroccan chickpea stew that's very comforting especially during the winter time. I used to love their Catatalan bread with ripe tomato & garlic but they changed the bread to be the same as the one they serve in their bread basket and it doesn't work nearly as well. I've not had the beef empanada or chicken and ham croquetas from the happy hour but have heard they're good.
