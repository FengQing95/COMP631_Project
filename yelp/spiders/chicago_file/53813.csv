Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went for dinner with out reservations.  So we decided to eat at the bar.  Wait was about 10-15 minutes.  Food was good. Server was good and patient since it was our first time.  Deducted a star for people who brought our food.  Not pleasant and just drops the plate without clearing other plates to make space
