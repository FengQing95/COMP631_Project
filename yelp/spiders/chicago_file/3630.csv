The Purple Pig////This is what we ordered for a party of 2 adults and 2 young kids. Â House made meatballs (very moist and delicious), Sweet potato polenta and whipped burrata cheese (the flavors are amazing...really good), crispy pigs ears salad (good because it's fried), and the turkey leg confit (too salty for me and the flavors didn't really jive well)
