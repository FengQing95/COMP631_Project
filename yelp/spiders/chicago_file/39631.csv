Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Abstract: Mediocre food, no real hip spin on the steak or sides, and not worth the price. You'd be better off going to an actual Americana steakhouse (words I thought I'd never say). Interior looks like a bachelor set, it's dimly lit, loud and honestly quite dingy. The service is actually garbage.
