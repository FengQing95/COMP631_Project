Art Institute of Chicago////Overall, a GREAT museum. Beautiful architecture, amazing artworks, interesting exhibitions. Plus, it's free for some students (Uchicago and Northwestern I believe). However, some members of the staff are incredibly rude. Especially one lady, who is always angry and disrespectful. I saw her multiple times yelling at visitors for nothing. She seems to hate tourists (why does she work in a museum, then?). Recently, as I was walking out of the museum through the Asian gallery, she shouted at me because I was texting, saying that I might run into the artworks. That's not how you talk to people! This woman is out of her mind.
