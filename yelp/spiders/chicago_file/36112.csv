Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I can't say there was anything in particular that stood out about Bavette's in comparison to Chicago's other steakhouses food-wise, but overall it was tasty and had a bountiful selection of food and drinks. I think this would be a good place to come back for a date night because of the mood lighting and intimate setting.
