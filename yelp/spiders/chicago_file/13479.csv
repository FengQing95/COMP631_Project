Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Pzookie (or half baked cookie with ice cream, whipped cream, and a cherry on top) definitely hit the spot. While this meal was filling and should have knocked us out, we kept going and trying new places in Chicago all day! Great meal, great for lunch, but even better for those days when you get off at 3pm!
