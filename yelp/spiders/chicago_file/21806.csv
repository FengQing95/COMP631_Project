Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went there with my wife on Black Friday for lunch...the place was jam packed with long waiting lines, but they got us in in less than 25 mins. The place from the inside was classic, the service was very good and the waiting time they gave us to be seated and get our pizza was accurate. Deep dish pizza takes about 40 mins to get ready. We had the veggie deep dish and we both loved it. Their dough was excellent and had a significant taste to it compared to other deep dishes I've had in Chicago and other places, which is why I gave them 5 stars. I'll be visiting this place whenever I'm in Chicago.
