Smoque BBQ////By Far, My favorite BBQ place. My favorite is the 1/2 & 1/2 Sandwich, with brisket and pulled pork. The sauces are all amazing, Â and the mac & cheese reminds me of some homemade recipe that only your grandma can make. I just wish the sides were bigger, I can't get enough. I tried the ribs for the first time last week, and it was almost breath taking, mainly because I didn't want to waste a second on breathing, but rather eating these ribs. You haven't lived until you try it out.
