Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My main dish (still on the Tapas Menu) was the Rioja Short Ribs with manchego mashed potatoes.  YUM! My mouth is watering as I write this.  The short ribs were perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious.  The mashed potatoes went perfectly with it.  My boyfriend wished he had ordered what I ordered when he tried mine!  He got the Beef Skewer, served with horseradish cream and red onion.  He loved his, but loved mine even more.  He is not the easiest to please either, quite a picky eater.
