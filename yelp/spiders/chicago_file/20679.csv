Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was the first restaurant we visited during our Chicago trip - we went in with high expectations of the "best chicago pizza" (due to yelp and friends' reccos) and unfortunately left less than satisfied. The pizza was above average, but the service ruined it for us. It was about 2:30pm on a Wednesday, and our intended quick bite turned into a 2.5 hour venture. Upon ordering we were told it would take 35-40 min, which was fine...but after an hour we were finally served a luke warm pizza - on top of that it wasn't what we had ordered. Asking for a side of ranch, our bill and water refills took 20 min each. I'm pretty understanding when it comes to popular spots but there were hardly any tables filled. Decent pizza, the slowest service...
