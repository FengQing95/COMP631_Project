Little Goat Diner////As someone else said, make sure you double check that they have your number down right to text you.  Luckily I walked in and made sure, and she said she had just tried to text me.  Strangely she had completely forgotten my face and name within 6 minutes.  The place was lunch-crowded, but I think that's part of your job as a hostess.
