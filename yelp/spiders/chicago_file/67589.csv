Little Goat Diner////This review is only in regards to the bar as I did not eat here. However, I ordered the cocktail Hoopoe's hope and it was delicous. It was so freshing and tasted of peaches and lemon. I had 2 in fact. I am really picky about drinks but this drink was a winner. However, my husband had an old fashioned and he thought it was kind of meh. He likes the ones at Bavette's better. Anyways, we will have to come back to try the food, but I really liked the layout of the space.
