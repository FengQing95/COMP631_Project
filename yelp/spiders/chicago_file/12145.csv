Art Institute of Chicago////Certainly one of the top art museums in the world.  It is truly fabulous with easy access to many of world's masterpieces.  Be sure to wear your walking shoes.  The museum is huge and probably not the best place to show off those fancy new Jimmy Choo's (though he might even have a place here some day).
