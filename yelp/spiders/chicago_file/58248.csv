Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We have been faithful customers since the 90s! A little disappointed with our last visit. They have taken off several staples from the menu-chicken salad, carmelized bananas and bread for the table! They are packed and it's nearly impossible to get a dinner reservation but they are still charging a 3% fee for COVID? I am so confused. I hope they bring back their full menu. Service was very good, as always. And the food they did have was excellent. Just feels like a money grab...
