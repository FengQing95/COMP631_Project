Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our server Daniel was very dapper and awesome - his very subtle charm and ease seemed to fit right in with the vibe there.  We had a couple cocktails and then took advantage of their fun BYOB policy and sent a glass of wine to a woman who was waiting for a table.  We also started out with some East Coast oysters, a perfect simple salty beginning.
