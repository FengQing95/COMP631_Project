Smoque BBQ////The down sides for me: first off -- the slaw.  It was simple -- just big long chunks of grated green cabbage and grated red onion...but that's it.  Luckily I could navigate around the chunks of onion (so my husband could bear to spend the rest of the day with me) and the dressing they used actually ended up saving the day...otherwise this would have been a total miss in my opinion.
