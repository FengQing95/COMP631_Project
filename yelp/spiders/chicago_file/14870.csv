Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We also ordered the breaded zucchini appetizer.  It was probably the crispiest fried zucchini I've ever had, as it usually turns to mush within a few minutes of serving.  Lou's zucchini held its crispy, crunchy texture, and I appreciated that.  It was a bit salty, even for me, someone who often cooks her food with restaurant-style sodium levels.
