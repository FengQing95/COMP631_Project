Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite restaurants in the city! Always get the sangria and the brussels sprout salad (#22), or goat cheese baked in tomato sauce (#32). They have amazing small desserts and port wine, as well. Definitely get a reservation on the weekend, even the bar is busy, but worth the call ahead and the wait. Also, bar is full service, so you can eat at it!
