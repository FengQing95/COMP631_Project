Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute was my one "must see" for my recent trip.  I must say, it did not disappoint!  The collections here are amazing.  Even if you can only hit the "don't miss" items - do it!  If you are an art lover, or even just an art liker, this museum is a place not to be skipped.
