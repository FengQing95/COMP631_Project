Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This was such a perfect cozy place to warm up on a frigid, snowy Chicago night. Bavette's is dim and swanky, but Â round red leather couches, vest-wearing bartenders, and huge chandeliers give it a bit of relaxed old-school rusticness. And, while it's right next door to Gilt and also owned by the Hogsalt Group, you can actually hear yourself think in here.
