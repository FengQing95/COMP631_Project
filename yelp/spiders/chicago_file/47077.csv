Smoque BBQ////Smoque is a great neighborhood BBQ joint. It has some very nice smoked food and a BYOB policy so you can leave without spending much at all. I would recommend the ribs and sausages. They are very nice. My wife really enjoyed their mac and cheese as well. Overall, this is a nice neighborhood joint and if you don't have access to your own BBQ grill or smoker a nice place to go.
