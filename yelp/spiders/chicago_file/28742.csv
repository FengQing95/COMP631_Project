Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our pizza took fifty minutes to come out, which wouldn't have been an issue if it were as hot as a pizza straight from the over should be. Our cookie pizza was completely dough and obviously just wasn't done cooking. I had thought that maybe it was just a certain part of the cookie, but the entire thing was mediocre because of the texture being a sloppy mess after the whipped cream and ice cream soaking into the dough. For a $7 dessert, there's a certain expectation that a consumer has. My edible cookie dough just fell short.
