Smoque BBQ////It's high time I do a review for this restaurant.  I had only tried brisket one time before ever stepping foot in Smoque and I didn't think too highly of it and didn't understand why anyone liked brisket.  Then one day, I stepped into Smoque and decided to tempt fate and try the brisket that I heard was so good on D.D.D.  After one bite, it was like the heavens opened up and the angels were singing.  The brisket just melted in my mouth and I knew I had a rare find on my hands.  As for the rest of the food, my mother said the beans were the best she had ever had and being a southern cook, that was high praise from mom (they are quite good).  The peach cobbler is fantastic, fries are good, cole slaw was an acquired taste but I have grown to love it.  The only thing I didn't care for was the mac & cheese.
