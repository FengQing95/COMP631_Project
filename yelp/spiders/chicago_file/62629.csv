Smoque BBQ////Negative - It's way up north (irving park area) so it's not convenient unless you live near there. It's worth the trip but I mean, I'm looking forward to the time they relocate out south for us south siders. BBQ is getting big in Chicago, but only some meet the cut. Many newcomers are food truck ppl and novices, these people are killing the game right now. Don't be fooled by Q in the Goldcoast, Husky Hog in Bridgeport, or some of these uppity and expensive downtown and west loop places like Green Street Smoked Meats... This place has the QUALITY and FLAVOR at a great value, if not less than the competitors, the consistency of the food is always there.
