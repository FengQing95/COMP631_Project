Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So being from NYC, we have our own wonderful pizza spots. I had thos delivered from chicago to NYC for my husband's birthday. He is a pizza enthusiast. He was pleasantly surprised and after the first bite, he was extremely elated. The pizza tasted so fresh and the crust was so crunchy! Â This was our first chicago deep dish, and it was so worth it. We can only imagine what a hot, fresh out of the oven, pie would taste like, since this one was outrageous!
