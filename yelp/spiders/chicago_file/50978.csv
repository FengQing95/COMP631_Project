Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Immediate reaction after eating: stopped in at 2pm on a Sat, busy but we (party of 2) was seated immediately. I really wanted a paella and though the menu was half brunch and did not list the regular paella, had no problem ordering the chicken paella. Also we got the octopus, spicy potatoes and the buttermilk chicken. the tender octopus and the buttermilk chicken....whoa whoa!!! I started closing my eyes while eating those, the dishes were off the chain, I could have passed on the potatoes but they were great with the sauce...the paella came and was hot and the chicken was tender, too much Lima beans but that is just me....we also did a check in and got the free dessert and we picked flan from the dessert list. Nice small tapas size of flan perfect for 2 people to share, I am glad it didn't taste lipgloss cause flan sometimes can do that. We also had the passion fruit sangria and it was solid but not something I will likely remember..if you want good sangria go to nandos
