The Purple Pig////The special that day was sausage with black truffle and egg, all on top of an English muffin ($23). This dish actually came out first (aside from the glass of Babic Reserve), and it was definitely my FAVORITE dish I had here. The sausage and the black truffle were so flavorful, and the egg was nice and runny. The dish was brought out with a knife, so I ended up eating it with a knife and fork rather than as a sandwich because it was a bit messy.
