Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For the fine-tuning on the steak, Bavette's has succulent options.  The place has au poivre, Roquefort, etc., and next time I will reluctantly try one of these preparations just to see if it is possible to make this steak any better.  The portion will leave you fully satiated regardless of the cut you choose.  Again, though, I fail to see how it could get any better.
