The Purple Pig////LITERALLY the best meal I've ever had. The octopus didn't even taste like normal octopus; it tasted like a delicious white fish with exuberant flavors. The fois gras was to die for and the bone marrow was the best I've ever had. The chef, Jimmy, was fuckin' awesome. I literally teared up twice, during the meal; the food was that good. Check the pictures I'm posting and decide for yourself but this was a once in a lifetime experience.
