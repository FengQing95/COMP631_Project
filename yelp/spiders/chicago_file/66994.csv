Little Goat Diner////A friend of mine and I came in on Friday night around 7:15. The place was crowded and we had about a 30 min wait. Not bad! We weren't starving so we decided to grab a drink at the bar. (On a side note I thought it was very cool that they text you when your table is ready.) The bar area is a little small because it's a combo bar, store, and coffee counter. Different but I'll go with it. We finally got a table and ordered food. My friend got the salad and I got the chili with a side of roasted root veggies. We also shared the blood orange meringue for dessert. The food was good but that's where it ends.
