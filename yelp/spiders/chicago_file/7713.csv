Art Institute of Chicago////It took about an hour and a half to make it thru the exhibit and might have taken longer if it weren't for the fact art museums are a bit stuffy and warm to protect the art and that my feet were killing me towards the end. After a nice rest, we were on a hunt for nudes per my request. This is where I was disappointed. They had maybe a dozen nude paintings that I could find. In all fairness we didn't peruse the entire museum as it's huge. I will have to make another trip to explore it further and hopefully find a few more portrayals of the naked human form.
