Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I had the the filet mignon 10oz cut cooked medium well (the steak was literally perfect. Tender and juicy and I could cut through it like butter) with the following sides: butter mashed potatoes topped with garlic black pepper and minced fresh green onions (the potatoes are thick, creamy and rich in flavor) , and truffle macaroni and cheese topped with thick sliced bacon(the Mac and cheese was great. It was baked and on top it was flaky and crisp but gooey and cheesy underneath the top) (mind you the sides come in large rations so me and my girlfriend shared our sides and still had leftovers). My girlfriend had the lamb chops also cooked till medium with the same sides.
