Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////1) Malnati Chicago Classic - Sausage pizza where the sausage is a thin slab that covers the bottom of the pizza.  Sausage with substance.  Even better is the buttercrust, which manages to support a deep dish offering without being the layer of rigid particle board you get on so many other deep dish crusts.   Can deep dish pizza be light?  This might be as close as it gets to that gustatory oxymoron.
