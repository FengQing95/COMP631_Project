Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband ordered a filet mignon & I had the ribeye! It was cooked perfectly medium as requested & had awesome marbling. I topped it with the MatriD butter topping & that just sent it over the top! The steak melted in my mouth. My husband ceased hid conversation with me because he was so busy eating his filet. Our sides paired well with our steaks. The potatoes & elotes corn were creamy, and seasoned well.
