Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went here on the suggestion of a local. Got there and the place was slammed busy. You can order your pizza ahead of time if you know you will be waiting more than 30 minutes which is cool and a time saver. Ordered the Chicago style with sausage and basil and it took about 30 minutes but well worth the wait. Crust was amazing , sauce was super and all delicious ! Had a trio of dips while we waited and those were excellent as well! Great service , I would recommend!
