Little Goat Diner////The first time I went here I ordered all the wrong things and me and my wife didn't like anything we got.  The waitress could tell as our plates were full at the end of the meal.  She brought out some other things for us to try which we ironically did not like either but appreciated the gesture.  A few days went by and we kept thinking how this just couldn't have been right so we tried it again and were blown away.  Thank god for good service as the food here is absolutely amazing.  Pretty much anything on the menu is out of this world.  The coffee on the other hand is not so great.  It's strange, maybe watery or there is something added that I can not put my finger on.  It's not bad but certainly unique.  I like my brew strong so that it wakes me up in the morning which this does. You'll just have to try it for yourself.  I strongly recommend this place.
