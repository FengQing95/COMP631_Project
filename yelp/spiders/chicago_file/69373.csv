Little Goat Diner////I came here for brunch (well, technically breakfast as it was 8am) on a weekend. I was glad I went early. By the time we left around 9:15, the line was out the door and a ton of people were waiting outside on a frosty day. As they don't accept reservations, I guess it's go early or be prepared for the long wait in the cold.
