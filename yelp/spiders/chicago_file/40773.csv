Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The simplest dish happened to be my favorite and that was the grilled chili pepper topped with Mediterranean sea salt. Yum!! Another idea to steal for a party! Anyhow the dessert I wasn't too crazy about but not worth complaining about. I don't think I would be back anytime soon..
