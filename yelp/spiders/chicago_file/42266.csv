Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Its not that I hate this place, I once ending up coming here 3x within a month. But it's just that I always come, eat, leave and forget everything about it! there is nothing memorable about the food here. The paella is mushy and filled with overcooked seafood. The dishes are small. Just...boring?
