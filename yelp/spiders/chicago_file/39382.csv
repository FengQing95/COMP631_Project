Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our server, Hope, was FABULOUS. Bavette's is lucky to have her. She made wonderful recommendations, always showed up at the right time to refill a glass or refold a napkin and most importantly she didn't throw a barrage of upsells at us. She told us she'd only worked there for a couple months but I'd never have known- she fits in perfectly with the whole experience.
