Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I love Bavette's and they've quickly become one of favorite places.  Everything from the food & drinks, to the service & ambiance; it's just all done so well.  I'm a big fan of Gilt Bar next door (and also enjoy me some Doughnut Vault), so I had high hopes for this place and I wasn't disappointed one bit.
