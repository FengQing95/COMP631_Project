The Purple Pig////Be warned; unless you specifically say you do not want to sit at the communal tables, you will be. The atmosphere was very busy. At first I was coming with a party of 7 and there was no way we would have been able to hear each other speak or be seated comfortably. You are literally sharing a large table for 14 with strangers. There is good music but awfully loud. My party of 7 went down to a party of 5 where my husband and I decided to wait the 1.5 hours, since the amount of the reviews were so high.
