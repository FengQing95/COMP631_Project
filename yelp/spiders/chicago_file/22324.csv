Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We searched and read many reviews on best deep dish pizza in Chicago and finally decided on this place and are happy we did. Had wings and cheese bread for appetizer and while both were good , the cheese bread was beyond good. Pizza was very good. My husband and I got a medium with sausage, cheese, pepperoni, black olives, jalape√±os and we stuffed ourselves trying to eat it all but of course couldn't and that was the only disappointment. We were so full and satisfied, That ended being our only meal of the day.
