Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The martini and Manhattan we started with were good. My wife had the small filet. I had the aged New York strip. Her filet was excellent. I have had tastier and more tender New York strips. The Béarnaise sauce was below average. We also split the spinach, mushrooms, and baked potato. My wife really liked the spinach. I thought it was OK. We both really likes the mushrooms. She had a Pinot with dinner and I had a Cab.  Both were very good. They brought her a bowl of caramel salted vanilla ice cream for her birthday. It was great.
