Smoque BBQ////The look on some people's faces could only be compared to that of a college kid running out after a massive liquor run as I saw guys hauling hundreds of dollars of food with boxes stacked upon boxes looking like a giant tower of Jenga ready to collapse in seconds. We made our heist and hauled back the food to Super Bowl central.
