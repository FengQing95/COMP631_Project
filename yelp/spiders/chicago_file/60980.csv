Smoque BBQ////The restaurant is fairly clean, with 2 bussers just waiting for you to take your last bite so they can snatch your tray. There were also other randomly scattered employees who have clearly mastered their trade, but appeared none-too-happy to be working there. I caught a couple of random scowls. Maybe it's because I was dressed like a total d-bag? I rocked the untucked Polo shirt, khakis, and flip flops getup today. I might as well have had "How do I get back to Wrigleyville?" tattooed on my forehead.
