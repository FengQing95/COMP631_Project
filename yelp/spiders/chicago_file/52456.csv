Smoque BBQ////I'm a southern girl, from Louisiana/Texas and this place is LEGIT. The brisket is the best i've ever had in my life. The sausage is good, the pork is good. My first trip i loved the ribs, but my second trip they were a bit dry. The fries are great and crispy. The peach cobbler is my favorite part!
