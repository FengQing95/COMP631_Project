Smoque BBQ////Their cornbread is good, but nothing to write home about IMO. Same for the peach cobbler. Come for great food at very reasonable prices in a no-fuss place--it's not fancy but you get seated and your food comes out very quickly, I've been told you can BYOB and it's just a fun vibe all around.
