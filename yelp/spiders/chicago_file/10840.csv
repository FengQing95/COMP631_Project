Art Institute of Chicago////It is really mind boggling to stroll around these huge buildings filled w such notable pieces of artwork.  Regardless of your interests, there is something for you here.  Seriously.  There are statues, artifacts, paintings, photography, architecture... wow.  I initially only intended on spending 3-4 hours here but ended up 5 hours and ended up leaving only cause they were closing up!  -- Def come early so you can spend as much time as you want -- better to leave early than get kicked out ;P
