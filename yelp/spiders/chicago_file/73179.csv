Little Goat Diner////Loved it! Had the Pork Belly Pancake and my daughter had the biscuits and gravy with pork sausage! We will definitely be back! Roof top and private room for groups available. Bar with Bakery attached. Quality food at an affordable price. Very busy place, so be prepared to wait a bit, but so worth it!
