Smoque BBQ////ATMOSPHERE/SERVICE: Whereas Green Street presents itself as the trendier location-- barn/warehouse decor, West Loop locale, etc., Smoque is more of a neighborhood joint. It's in a more residential area, with plenty of parking on side streets (there's even a small parking lot, suburban style!). The interior is pretty bare-bones, like countless BBQ joints in the South. It's more authentic, but, at the same time, I'm a bit of a sucker for the warehouse vibe, and it's a little more unique. Both places can have long lines for food, but Smoque has more limited seating and kind of botched our order at first. Edge: Green Street.
