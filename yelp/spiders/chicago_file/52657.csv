Smoque BBQ////This place is all about the food. No frills. Just delicious smoked tender barbecue.  Probably the best north of the mason Dixon line. My moist tender chicken was covered in a spiced ebony skin. The generous sides are perfect foils to the mains. I adore the crispy fries that come in a brown bag. The slaw is crunchy with the right amount of tang. I don't know how they do it but no matter how crowded they always manage to get you to a table by the time your food is ready.  I just keep coming back for more.
