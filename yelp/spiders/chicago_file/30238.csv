Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////"The Lou" add pepperoni was bursting with flavors from the Spinach mix, mushrooms and sliced roma tomatoes covered with blend of mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese on garlic Buttercrust PLUS I added those pepperonis.  This one was my favorite of the two.  Added just a bit of roughage in to break up the brick of cheese I was eating.
