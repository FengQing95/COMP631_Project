Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We often visit Bavette's because we never tire of their food and the ambience.  I wouldn't say they consider themselves a steakhouse, but their steak is phenomenal. Their cocktails are innovative and their servers attentive.  All their pasta is house-made (of which I am always a sucker for), and they have good sides and salads to accompany whatever entree you select.
