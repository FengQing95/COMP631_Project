Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What can i say...this place is fantastic!  Came here on a Thursday night with the bf.  We wanted to grab a nice cocktail and I suggested Bavettes and I'm sure glad i did.  Not too crowded but not empty either.  Place is dark, sexy and surprisingly large.   If Au Cheval is the mid twenties fun younger brother, then Bavette's is its more sophisticated, older 30 yr old sibling.
