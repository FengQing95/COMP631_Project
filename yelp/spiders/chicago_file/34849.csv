Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The term dressy sure is very loose in this restaurant.  It may have once been like this, but it's pretty much casual now.  The servers wear jeans.  This shouldn't matter because it doesn't have any negative effect on the food.  I was shocked with how quickly the food came out, most steak places take forever to churn out your food.
