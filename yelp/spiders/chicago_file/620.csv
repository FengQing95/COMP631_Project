Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////OMG. This place was AMAZZZZZING! When my girlfriend and I arrived in Chicago, the first thing we did was look on Yelp for the best brunch place and this popped up. We headed right over and ended up waiting for close to an hour and a half. We did not mind as they told us to come back at a specific time to get a buzzer, then we would be seated. While we waited, we were able to check out The Bean, which is a 5 minute walk to the restaurant. When the time came, we went back to the restaurant and received out buzzer. We waited another 15 minutes and were seated. The portions of food they serve were enormous but we were not phased. The food was prepared very well and tasted magnificent. I also ordered a berry shake which was very good. Once we were done with our food, we understood why this place is so highly rated and the wait times are very long. We would recommend this place to everyone that visits or lives in the Chicago area.
