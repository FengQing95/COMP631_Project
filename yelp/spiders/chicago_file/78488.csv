Little Goat Diner////I went to Little Goat Diner in March of 2021 for dinner. The great thing about this place is that it has breakfast, lunch, and dinner, all day long Â we ordered the Bull's Eye French Toast, which was just okay. It was a little soggy and didn't care for the egg that comes on top. We also ordered the Los Drowned, which was so so delicious. The toppings and bolillo bread really take the beef to the next level. It's accompanied by what seems to be a broth, to help make the bread more chewable. And it's also fire. Highly recommend the Los Drowned.
