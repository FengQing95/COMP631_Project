Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We tried to do our own pizza tour this trip. Pequod's vs Lou's. Maybe it's cause I'm from the Heartland where pizza is a food and not a way of life, but the dough at Pequod's didn't do it for me. I know this is blasphemy to Chicagoans, but Lou's was better as a whole. Same basic elements except Lou's sauce had salt and seasoning (Pequods was just tomato, very natural, a tad sweet), more gooey cheese, and a better crust (more common to me). The elements just came together better for a more gooey, garlicky pizza that wanted to be a lasagna. Lou's was our winner.
