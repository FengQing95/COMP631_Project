Little Goat Diner////This place is definitely misleading, in a good way. This place is labeled as a diner, but it's definitely elevated "diner" food. I highly recommend the "this little pig went to China". Biscuit, flavored sausage patty, and egg with a sweet and spicy Sichuan sauce. Delicious! Â Nice and bright for breakfast. Super friendly staff. Waitress had great recommendations. Busser took dirty plates promptly and didn't feel like they were interrupting. Definitely a must go to the next time I'm in Chicago!
