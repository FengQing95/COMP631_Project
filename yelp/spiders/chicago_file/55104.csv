Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The paella was perfect! I'm usually picky about whether or not the flavors are right or the rice is quality but this was everything and more. A server brings out the paella in a large pan and mixes it at your table. The portions are then served out and they are huge! You have to order a minimum of two servings but if you're getting tapas as well, the two servings could easily feed more than two people! So delicious!
