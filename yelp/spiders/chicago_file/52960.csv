Smoque BBQ////I got the sliced brisket sandwich, slaw, and a side of mac and cheese.  Even though my food cooled down a bit, my brisket was still moist, tender, and juicy, with a few bites here and there of the fatty portions.  The BBQ sauce was a fine compliment-- zesty and tangy to balance out the richness of the meat.
