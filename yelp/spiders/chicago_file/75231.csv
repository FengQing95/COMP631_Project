Little Goat Diner////Went to The Little Goat for a spontaneous date night with my wife and was very surprised by the experience! The atmosphere is very casual with a modern dinner style feel.  The music was not so load that is hindered conversation.  The food was delicious!  We had the paratha burrito, macho nachos (without meat) and the tempura mashed potatoes. The tempura potatoes is a mush try! The nachos are a meal of its own; don't be fooled by the fact that it is listed as an accompaniment.  The parathas came with a delicious sauce, eggs, fresh greens and red kidney beans. We did not try their famous burgers however we will return to try the burgers and mushroom pasta.  Finally, the meal was very reasonably priced so if you are looking for delicious food at a reasonable price than look no further!
