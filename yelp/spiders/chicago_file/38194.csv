Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Had no idea what to order and the bartender recommended the filet mignon. He told me it's the best filet mignon in Chicago. Who wouldn't say that about their own restaurant though right?! Didn't wait long before my filet came. Cooked to perfection (medium rare) and the meat just melted in my mouth!! Bartender mentioned sprinkling a pinch of sea salt for flavor if needed but no garnishes/sauces were needed for this filet. Full of flavor and felt like I was in heaven for a few minutes!! Hands down one of the BEST filet mignon's that I ever had in my life!
