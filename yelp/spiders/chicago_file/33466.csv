Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Dessert was equally caloric and lavish. Chocolate cream pie. Awesome, thick chocolate piled a mile high on an oreo crust and topped with a soft ball sized sphere of whipped cream. The whipped cream was unlike any I've had. Second best to Peter Luger's schlag, the consistency was almost ice cream like. This dessert was damn near perfect. I'd take this over any foo foo one bite dessert any fine dining restaurant throws at you these days.
