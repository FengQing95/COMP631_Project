Smoque BBQ////Um, HELLO?  Where have I been?  Why haven't I tried this place before?  My loss.  Went to Smoque because my BF went to grade school with the owner. OMG, can I say DELICIOUS?!?!  So we each order 1/2 sandwich & 1 side - I got the chopped brisket and fries and he got the pulled pork & mac-n-cheese. I have never had a better BBQ brisket sandwich! As we're digging into that we are treated to a full slab of ribs and some of the spicy texas saaaaaasage. I have to say that neither of us are a fan of eating meat off of the bone but the ribs were awesome!  The rub had the perfect blend of sweet & smoky flavors.  The sauce is amazing - If I could buy a vat of it to take home with me I would. To end our meal we had the peach cobbler.  YUM!  I highly recommend Smoque but get there early because it's a popular place.  WELL worth the wait and the line goes quickly!
