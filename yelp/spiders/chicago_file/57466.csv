Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Wow- yes, wow! We were lucky enough to stumble in for brunch and it was even better than we had hoped. We started with a breakfast combination that did not disappoint. The deviled egg, the yogurt bowl, the frittata were all good. The French toast and the waffle/chicken were outstanding! Two of us shared a pitcher of passion fruit sangria and enjoyed every drop. Both the macaroni and cheese and beef empanada were winners as well. There were many more things to try on the menu and I'm looking forward to a return visit.
