Art Institute of Chicago////They are best know for their Impressionist through Modern collections.  Even if you aren't a huge fan of this time period in art, it shouldn't be missed.  Chicago houses many well know paintings such as "American Gothic" by Wood, "Nighthawks" by Hopper, "Sunday Afternoon on La Grande Jatte" by Seurat, and "Rainy Day in Paris" by Caillebotte.  You might not recognize the names, but you will certainly recognize the works.  I especially like the entire room of Monet paintings and the room of surrealist works.
