Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food - best wedge salad ever and I generally think they are disgusting.  They elevated the tradition.  Steak was worth it for the price.  Eliote corn was great but don't need to get it a second time. Potatoes were solid and I really liked the cream spinach, it was made with baby spinach.
