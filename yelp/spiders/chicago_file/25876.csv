Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I can't stop obsessing about this place! I seriously recommend Lou's deep dish pizza to everyone that's in town. This quaint little restaurant is filled with so much history and delicious smells lingering all around. The locals love it, so you know it must be legit. Get ready to wait a little since it always gets packed but as the saying goes, "all good things come to those who wait". Don't make this your quick lunch stop, you're bound to spend at LEAST 2 hours in here. Enjoy the experience. Take it all in.
