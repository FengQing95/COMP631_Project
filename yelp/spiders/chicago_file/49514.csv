Smoque BBQ////This place is so good. I can see why people trek to it. Just off the Blue Line makes it pretty easy to. Lucky for me I live a couple blocks away. I have to will myself not to go in there all the time. I think my favorite is the brisket, but the ribs are great too. The BBQ sauce is amazing. I like all the sides. The slaw is refreshingly real and light. Really good. So is the cornbread. I could order a whole meal of just that.
