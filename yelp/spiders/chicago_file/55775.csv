Smoque BBQ////Some friends brought me here and it was a pleasant meal.  It's BYOB when you eat inside, bonus!  This is good, average priced for BBQ.  I enjoyed everything I tried from the menu here, but I wanted to find a bbq sauce that was an A+ but didn't, although theirs is good.  The beef brisket was good.  Not sure if they have any healthy side items, but this is on par with other bbq joints.
