Smoque BBQ////My daughter likes this place. The ribs are OK I guess, kind of dry,I didn't like their house bbque sauce it was bitter . I'm used to more juicy ribs. The Mac and cheese was awesome also the bread pudding, size orders are too small for the price. the brisket was delicious. I would not come back way too pricey.
