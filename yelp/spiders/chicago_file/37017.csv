Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This restaurant is amazing. We were seated downstairs and preferred it!!! So much more quiet and intimate. Make sure you make a reservation, it was super busy. Our host was Daniel and he's one of the best! Their drink selection is unique and have many we were unfamiliar with. Basically we told him what we like to drink and he knew what to recommend. His choices were on point. He was very patient with us and gave us time with the menu, no pressure or rush.
