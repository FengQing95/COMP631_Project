Little Goat Diner////Went there for lunch and had a hard time deciding what to order, so many good options.   I went with the Ruben, it was very tasty, the kimchee on it was a nice touch and added to the sandwich.  Only complaint was it was very messy to eat and had too much "special sauce" on it.    The smoke fries and mac-and-cheese were also tasty.  I wasn't a huge fan of the hash browns.
