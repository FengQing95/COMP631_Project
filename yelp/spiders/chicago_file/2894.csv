The Purple Pig////A friend of ours told us this place is a must and we are glad we listened. We did family style and ordered the pig ears, bone marrow, tongue and milk braised shoulder. Everything was Delish. I would say my favorite of all would be the pig ears. It was crunchy and fried perfectly. It was accompanied by a nice crisp kale salad, a sweet pepper mixture and a sunny side up egg. My mouth is watering as I'm explaining it. We all got a Cuban old fashion which was smooth and refreshing with the perfect amount of alcohol.
