Little Goat Diner////Sometimes I think because this is a Stephanie Izard place people feel like they should give it another star just for that... I don't disagree with them that, that's why I'd prioritze this place over other "diners" but likely for it's cute look/feel & the creative items on the menu which is why I'd go or give it an extra star. But overall everything I've had has really just been A-Ok... therefore three stars! Don't hate!
