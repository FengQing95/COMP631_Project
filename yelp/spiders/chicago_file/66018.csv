Smoque BBQ////Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I'd give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband's full slab was fine.
