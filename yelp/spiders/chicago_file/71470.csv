Little Goat Diner////Our teenage girls opted for breakfast options (served all day) of sourdough pancakes and chocolate chip crunch pancakes.  Two girls ordered Caesar salad with chicken.  I had the shrimp and cheese grits, and my friend had the Fat  Club.  All of the food was tasty but nothing over the top amazing.  After sampling all of the dishes we all agreed that the breakfast items were the best call.
