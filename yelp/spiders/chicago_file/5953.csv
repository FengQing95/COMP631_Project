The Purple Pig////The purple pig was such a fun place to go for a date night! The tapas style food was perfect. We ordered 4 dishes for the 2 of us. 2-3 definitely could've been enough, depending what you order. A few of them were surprisingly very big and filling. First, we each ordered a glass of wine & got the whipped chickpea hummus spread with focaccia bread. It was amazing & had little roasted chickpeas mixed into it. Then we had the ahi tuna & avocado dish which was phenomenal. The third one was the ravioleta, which was also very good but super rich so wasn't my favorite. The last one we got was the slow braised pork shoulder which I'd highly recommend. Such a fun restaurant to go to! Definitely not an every week type of place but a very fun occasion. Our waiter was very nice, but we were at a little 2 person table and we were extremely close to the table next to us. We could hear their conversations & they could hear ours. Didn't bother us much, but something to note.
