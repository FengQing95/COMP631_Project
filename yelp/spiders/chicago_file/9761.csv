Art Institute of Chicago////Today was the last free Saturday and I was wandering in crowds of myriad, middling people, however felt the experience intimate. I was stunned, overwhelmed, intimidated, my heart raced, and I was thrilled to tears at some points. The only valid comparison would be to falling in love; thank the Lord I was alone and able to reconcile my reactions without framing them with another's. Especially, since I dorked out in the presence of such greatness.
