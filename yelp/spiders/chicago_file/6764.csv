Art Institute of Chicago////Great great place. I have lived in Chicago all my life save for a couple years out west (where i met my wife). I moved back home and my new wife wanted to visit here so we did and i have gone back 11 times now. It`s big, Beautiful and addicting. Beautiful art from so many wonderful artists. I never knew how great and liberating art could be :)
