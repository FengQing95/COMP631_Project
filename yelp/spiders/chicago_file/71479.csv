Little Goat Diner////Food consumed this night were (was?) onion rings and fried pickles, smoked fries, mac and cheese, macho nachos, pulled pork sandwich, and the patty melt.  No I was not alone.  I came for the burger.  The patty melt was great.  The beef was cooked perfectly and seasoned great.  Cooked medium in every bite.  Did not disappoint. I travel to Chicago pretty regularly and have had many of the cities so called best burgers.  This is pretty high up on my list now.  All the sides were good.  Fries were pretty good, not outstanding.  Mac and cheese was really good.  Nachos were much better then average.  The fried pickles and onion rings were really really good.  I have never had such a sweet tasting onion ring.  Once the ring was dipped in the curried mustard....WOW.  Also had a few of the menu cocktails. These were good too.
