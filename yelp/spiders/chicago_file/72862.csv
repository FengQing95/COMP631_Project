Little Goat Diner////We had a group of 8 last Thursday at Little Goat and it was a wonderful time.  I would rate this a 4.5 Diner+.  Really good food, lots of fun and a lot more than a diner (I'm from the East and we know diners!).  I recommend Little Goat highly and will be back again.  Great compliment to  The Girl when you can't get in (and we couldn't).  Win win here.
