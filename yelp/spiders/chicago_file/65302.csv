Smoque BBQ////I ordered brisket, and forgot to specify sliced or chopped.   They have me chopped and it was excellent. I also got pulled pork, Mac and cheese, cornbread and slaw.  Everything was spot on. I am a big fan of a slaw that has a vinegary note to it. Smoque's slaw is just that.   Damn near perfect.  The pork was on point.  Fabulous mac and the cornbread was decent, although a bit dry.
