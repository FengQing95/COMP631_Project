Smoque BBQ////As a yearly visitor to Chicago this is one of my must stops.  Let's start with the negatives.  Parking can be bad and you may have to wait for a seat.  That's about it.  Their beef brisket is one of the best I've ever had and I love me some brisket.  You can leave the knife at the counter because the brisket is so tender it just falls apart.  A MUST HAVE is the mac and cheese....I have dreams about it.  The crunchy bread topping just takes it to another level.  Cornbread is solid.  The last time I went I had the brisket chili and I'll be having it again when I go back.  The prices are very reasonable and the owner walks the floor to make sure everything is awesome...Well sir...IT IS
