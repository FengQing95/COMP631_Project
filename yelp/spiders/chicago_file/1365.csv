Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The only good berry latte in town, and believe me, I've looked.  Endless options of your favorites; crepes, waffles, pancakes, french toast, omelettes, skillets, and eggs benedict!  I would return often if they were open later and weren't always so busy!  Maybe they'll open a new location.... :p
