Smoque BBQ////At least we were richly rewarded for our wait in line.  Pulled pork platter was a great choice.  My pile o' pulled pork was juicy and topped with some excellent BBQ sauce.  The cole slaw was zingy, and the mac n cheese holds its own against Fat Willy's.  Yup, I said it.  I was sad that they were out of peach cobbler (I blame you Guy Fieri) and I opted for some brisket chili which was good, but not as great as my other goodies.
