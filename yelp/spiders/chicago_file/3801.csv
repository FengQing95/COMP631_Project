The Purple Pig////Food was good but we were still hungry. Portions small and pricey. The service was good tho. They kept on coming to check on us to the point of it's annoying bc we weren't done eating and they're already getting your plate. Their food presentation was excellent and tasty as well, the only thing is very small portions. So don't expect too much if u come hungry but I think it's nice just to hang out with friends .
