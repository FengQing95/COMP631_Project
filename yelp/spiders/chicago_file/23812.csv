Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza, however, was a bit of a disappointment.  The crust is nice and buttery, better than Giordano's.  But the rest of the pizza was lacking.  It seemed as if the sauce consisted of a can of crushed tomatoes that had been opened and poured over the top with absolutely no seasonings.  The sausage was strangely stringy.  The layers of crust, cheese, toppings and tomatoes were not nearly as thick as Giordano's.  Some people don't appreciate feeling full after only two pieces of pizza, but I do.  I guess that's why I'm a Giordano's guy.
