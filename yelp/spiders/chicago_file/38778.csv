Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My dining partner always goes for a bone-in filet whenever it's on a menu at a steakhouse. I went with the petite duchess cut filet, and we split an order of the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach as sides. The steaks were cooked to perfection (medium rare) and the sides were wonderful. The mashed potatoes came with a delicious chicken jus and was just so creamy and decadent. I've ordered the double bone Berkshire pork chop before and that is also a delicious option if you want to try something aside from beef. I've also had the truffle mac & cheese too which is so so decadent.
