Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had never had tapas before coming here, but I had always heard how great their food was so I gave it a try.  There are so many choices on the menu, and you could definitely feel lost if you were a newbie if the waiters didn't lead you in the right direction.  They offer 'safe' suggestions on what most people like.  If you decide you like something, your server will offer choices based on that.
