Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here a few times.  The passion fruit sangria is great.  So far I've eaten the meat and potatoes (great) tomato bread (great) the pieai (I can't spell the dish name  :( ) (seafood, awsome) and the chicken skewers.  It is expensive but everytime the meal is the same quality which for me, makes it worth more.
