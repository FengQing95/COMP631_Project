Little Goat Diner////One of the most fun brunches I've ever had. While you wait for the table, go to the back and grab a Bloody Mary or a cup of joe. They sell house mad pastries also, and have a giant window that you can watch where these pastries come from (they're production program.) The burgers are great, like their Korean style kimchi burger. French toast was amazing. Before you leave, be sure to take a seat in the photo booth, so you can take Little Goat with you wherever you go.
