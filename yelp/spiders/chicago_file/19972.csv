Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Very very good Pizza. My party split the sausage deep dish biggest size pizza they had. The service was pretty good. We also enjoyed the cookie pizza for dinner and that is a must!! Go here it was a nice environment but try to show up before 5 on the weekends beacuse it gets filled with people in line.
