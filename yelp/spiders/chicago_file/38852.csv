Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our drinks were delicious and it was fun to watch them being made. The sourdough they bring out is as big as your head and it's among the best sourdough I've ever had. I ordered the petite filet and a loaded baked potato to share. My filet was a perfect medium rare and the accompanying herbs and bernaise were perfection.
