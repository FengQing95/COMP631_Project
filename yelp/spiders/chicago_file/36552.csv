Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had the garlic shrimp de jongne appetizer (which I am not a big seafood person) but I defiantly ate all the shrimp. It was cooked to perfection and flavored well.  My husband had the Prime Bone dry aged ribeye with the bone marrow on top it was fantastic and I had the filet mignon cooked perfect usually places always cook it to medium for me but medium well was delicious!!  I suggest everyone to go here I am defiantly going back! :)
