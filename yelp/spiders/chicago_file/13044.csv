Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'd give it 3-1/2 if possible ... mainly due to the service.  Carry-out's - hey, what can you expect on service - right?  Well they treated me just as though I were going to sit down and dine - and all I was doing was picking up a pie.  They threw in a bunch of extra stuff for me without my even asking ... I'd give it 4 stars if I were more a deep-dish fan.  Solid in everywhere ...looks like a fun place to sit at the bar and take it easy too (think I'll come back with that excuse in mind).
