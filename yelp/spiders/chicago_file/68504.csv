Little Goat Diner////The food is all great and very reasonable for the quantity and quality of what's available. Had a bit of the Nachos, Fat Elvis Waffle, Goat Chili and Hash Browns. All of it was incredible, a word that is probably thrown around too often on yelp, but I'm certain it's full meaning is appropriate here. Special shout out to the Hash Browns which seemed to have a sour cream (or maybe just cream?) infusion. Holy cow. Amazing.
