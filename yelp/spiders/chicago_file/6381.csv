The Purple Pig////This has long been one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago, and it did NOT disappoint on a recent trip back home.  Hubs and I met fellow foodie friends for an early dinner.  Of course we got the pig ear (1 for each couple!) and a nice collection of several other sharing plates.  Tuna tartare, bacon wrapped shrimp (prob my least favorite, TBH), Cauliflower and beets.  Probably the star of our visit (at least for me) was the Ravioletto.  Just enough for each of us to have a bite, but the memory lasted with that savory creamy truffle-y goodness--I was still thinking about it several days later!  Pork belly and ribs finished up the meal and even though I was full, could not resist, especially the ribs.  No to-go boxes needed.
