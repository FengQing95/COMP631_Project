Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The bartenders were ridiculously accommodating and took a good amount of time to prepare our drinks just right. I had an amazing dirty gin martini to start (it seems simple but it really is an art). With my meal, the bartender actually made me two half drinks to pair with what I ordered. Um, awesome?! The food was also incredible. Everything came out promptly and the portions were fairly large.
