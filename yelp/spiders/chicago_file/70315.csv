Little Goat Diner////My girl had the Brandade and pork belly with kimchee, way over thought with chewy pork belly and runny brandade.  This chef does wonderful things and is ann amazing talent, unfortunately whoever is funding this thing is running the show.  This menu reads like her concept and Leona's execution.
