Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm ashamed to admit that Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba was my first tapas experience, however I was not disappointed!  Everything we tried was great, and the sangria is positively to die for!  It did seem a little expensive, but the food was worth it.  The atmosphere, on the other hand, was not too great.  Despite making reservations we had one of the crappiest tables in the house, right next to the smoldering kitchen and next to the walkway to the rest of the restaurant so people kept knocking my chair every time they walked by.  It definitely won't stop me from going back to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, but I know now to ask for a table away from the kitchen.
