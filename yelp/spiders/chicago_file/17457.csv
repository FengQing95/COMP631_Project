Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is by far our favorite pizza in Chicago.  We lucked out and got there right before the masses hit on Sunday night around 6 p.m. The pizza is perfectly balanced,  unlike Uno which has too much dough. We ordered a large for 4 people and couldn't finish it,  but we sure tried.  Had the Classic,  which was delicious!
