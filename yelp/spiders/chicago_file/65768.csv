Smoque BBQ////Update: I just want to say that since shut down I have eaten ribs from Smoque six times. I see how very careful they are and I feel very confident that they are doing everything to keep their employees safe and keeping us enjoying these amazing dishes. Thank you to all who work there for being so awesome!
