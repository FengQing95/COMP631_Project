Art Institute of Chicago////My friend has a yearly membership and she was generous enough to take me with her so I didn't have to pay admission. If you're an Illinois resident, the museum is free 5-8 pm on Thursday's. There is a coat/bag check as soon as you enter to the left side of the main entrance. My friend and I were there for about an hour and we didn't got to explore about 1/5 of the museum. If you want to visit all the exhibits, definitely set aside an entire day because you're going to need it! There are a few cafes if you're hungry and want to grab some lunch but they're overpriced tourist traps in my opinion so I would avoid them.
