Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I believe our server's name was Ben? He was great! He gave us a rundown of the menu and we ended up getting the crab cake, the fillet mignon, and the dry aged bone in ribeye. He would float behind us and ask if we needed anything without being overbearing. Loved the service!
