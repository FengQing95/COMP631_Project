Little Goat Diner////For what it's worth, I do I think the popularity (of both goat restaurants) is a factor. I think some people go in with very high expectations and then are disappointed. And then there are the people who are extra critical of anything with hype. I'm really tired of hearing "It's not as good as Girl and the Goat." No kidding. It's also a totally different type of restaurant and isn't as expensive/hard to get a reservation. People complain too much.
