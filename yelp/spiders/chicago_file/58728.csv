Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Haven't been here in so long and I'm glad I came back to check out their restaurant week! My family friend and I were able to get seated right away and earlier than our reservation time which was kind of them to accommodate. Our server was great, informative, prompt, and humorous throughout our dinner. The restaurant week provides you a 3 course meal with a sangria pairing which their red sangria is the most authentic sangria I've tried yet! I ordered my choice of pintxo, the house charcuterie plate, grilled iberico pork, and the marcona almond-caramel bar. Our pintxo and appetizers came out very quickly! My friend got the bacon wrapped dates which I highly recommend - they were amazing! Unfortunately we did have to wait a little for our entrees, but the quality of the food was worth the wait. My pork didn't come with a side which I was surprised about, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the texture of it. The almond caramel bar was also a really good dessert and a great finish to the dinner. Overall paid ~$47 including tax and tip for a tasty dinner!
