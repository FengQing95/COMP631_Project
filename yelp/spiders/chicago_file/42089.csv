Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Service was good, but my one gripe would be that several of our small plates came out all at once and I prefer to have them come separately or 2 at a time. Other than that, it was great...and as for the post below me, I definitely did not get any wiffs or smells that signaled a 4 AM burrito spot and I have quite the nose.
