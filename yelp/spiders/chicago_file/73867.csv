Little Goat Diner////Get the French toast with fried chicken !! You won't regret it , I think it's called the Bulls eye French toast. Â My favorite part was the pork belly home fries , but I'm a sucker for anything potato. But like previous reviews , be prepared to wait cause there was a lonnng line .
