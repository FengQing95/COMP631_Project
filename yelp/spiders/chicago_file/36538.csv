Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For our entree, we shared the 22oz. bone in dry aged ribeye & added the roasted bone marrow, along with a side of elote style corn. The ribeye was mouthwatering and cooked medium rare to perfection. Every bite was tender, and only close to the bone was the meat too raw (for me). The elote style corn was good, as all corn is usually, but the dish was WAY too salty. We each had a few tiny spoonfuls and that was all we could withstand.
