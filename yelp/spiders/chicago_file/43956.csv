Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Everything I've had here is pretty good; go with what you feel like. If it sounds greasy, it probably is, but still delicious. Looks like they change their menu somewhat regularly, but I particularly liked their fried doughnuts w a dark chocolate dipping sauce when I was there for brunch over a year ago.
