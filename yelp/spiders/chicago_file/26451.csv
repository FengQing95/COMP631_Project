Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm gonna say this right now that I've never had a deep dish pizza before. This was my first time visiting Chicago and my boyfriend (ex-chicago resident) really wanted to come back here. The place was PACKED, as expected, but we were quickly seated. We ordered some minestrone soup and the Malnati classic Medium, which is for 3-4 people. If you don't want leftovers please listen to the suggestions on the menu (small=2 people). Soup was yummy, but very small (I've never had minestrone soup before either so I'm not a good judge). We waited about an hour for the pizza, which is understandable since they told us ahead of time when we ordered. Our pizza was good, I just don't think I'm a deep dish kind of girl, I had to find out after giving it a try of course. My boyfriend loves it though! So if you know you love deep dish, go for it! Definitely a must try for tourists (me).
