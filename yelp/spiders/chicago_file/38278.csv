Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've been going here for years, all of my special events are celebrated here. I'm actually in disbelief I've never reviewed. There has never been a single time I have been disappointed. Not a single time where the food wasn't fresh, or the people weren't warm. It's a happy place.
