Art Institute of Chicago////Spent a full day at the museum and wish I could have returned for more!  I went on a Wednesday and was surprised to see the line was out the door for tickets. It moved quickly and was well organized, but next time I'll buy online.  I also paid the $7 for the audio guide-  it was very informative, but I didn't use it nearly as much as I'd like as there was so much to see and the audio commentaries can be rather lengthy.  You could skip it and be fine with the descriptions near the work.
