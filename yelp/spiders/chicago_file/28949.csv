Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I heard about this pizza SO MANY TIMES before I made my first visit to Chicago, so naturally, I had to go check out what the hype was all about! And it really was some of the best pizza I've ever had!!!  The Lou - one of their deep dish pizzas - was buttery, cheesy, favorful, and filling - all of the yes.  We actually got an order to-go (because otherwise it was a 2 hour wait for a table...), each ate 2 glorious pieces of pizza, and were very full afterwards.  Every bite was delicious.  Highly recommend, and highly recommend going to Lou's as a pre-Chicago Marathon carb-up meal.
