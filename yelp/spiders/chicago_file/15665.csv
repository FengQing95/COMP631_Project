Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Wow - this place had delicious deep dish pizza.  We got the butter crust, but I couldn't taste the butter, so maybe it just makes it extra crunchy?  I ordered the personal pepperoni with spinach, which was quite small but juicy.  My two friends shared a medium pizza with sausage and some other veggies - I really liked theirs, though it had less sauce than mine did.  I thought the sausage would be like the kind you get at McDonalds for breakfast, but it was more like an apple sausage and came in HUGE chunks.  I thought the crust wouId be extremely thick but it was maybe double the thickness of a thin pizza. Also tried their minestrone soup, which definitely tasted homemade, and their house salad, which came with a sweet balsamic vinagrette.
