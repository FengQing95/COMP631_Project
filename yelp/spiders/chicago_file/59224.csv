Smoque BBQ////I had the half sliced brisket plate with coleslaw and baked beans - everyting was seriously great! The brisket wasn't doused with BBQ it was just enough to flavor it and not drip down your arm like some places. Hubbie had brisket platter with fries and beans and added on ribs. He loved the brisket but, is still raving about the ribs - he will be geting just ribs next time we go!
