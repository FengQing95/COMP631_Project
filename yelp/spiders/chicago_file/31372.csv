Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came to Chicago for the first time and loved it!! We are from Las Vegas and our experience was great David was our server he was awesome, and Pablo made our night so fun, manager Janeen sure knows how to run this place! She treated us like royalty!! I'm so pleased with the service that I forgot to mention the food but overall recommend a must in Chicago
