Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband insisted on trying this place even though I don't eat red meat.  Took forever to get a reservation - so plan ahead.  I was relieved to find salmon on the menu, along with a number of appealing sides.  Ambience is nice, tables perhaps a tad too close together, but lots of wood and tasteful low lighting.  Goat cheese starter was excellent, husband's filet was excellent, side order of elote outstanding.  My salmon (which they had warned was cooked "Medium rare") was raw on the inside.  They took it back to the kitchen and cooked it some more but it was still raw.  They were very kind, took it off the bill immediately, and to be candid I was already full with the side dishes so, no harm no foul.  Moral: if you go to a meat place, don't expect them to know how to cook a fish.
