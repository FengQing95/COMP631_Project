Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I used to love his place, but became disappointed during my last visit. I don't know if it had anything to do with the fact that it was a Sunday evening. Service was ok, but the food didn't taste fresh. We ordered a paella, which they used to make upon your order and serve it with the pan. This time they brought the rice on a plate; it seemed like it had been cooked a while ago and they just cooked the pork and mixed it up. Even worse, I took a bite of a piece of pork and thought it was probably undercooked, but I just kept telling myself "nah, it's just a bit of the fat". Well, I got soooo sick later that night I regretted not spitting it out when the thought first crossed my mind.
