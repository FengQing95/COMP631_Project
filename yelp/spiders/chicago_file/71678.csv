Little Goat Diner////Plus, I had one of the best experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. One time when I went here, I was eating very clean; no sugar, no grain, no dairy, basically just the pure protein, and vegetables. I told the waiter up front and he went back and asked about this item I was interested in. I couldn't have it, the sauce had soy. I ended up just getting the salad with some items taken off of it. He was so accommodating to make sure everything I stated I couldn't have wasn't on there, and I was so appreciative of the thoroughness of him making sure everything I ate was acceptable for my restrictions. I even asked for no dressing and on his own accord, he provided olive oil and balsamic vinegar (which I can have but didn't ask for.) I was SO IMPRESSED. This same night/experience, we were out for my husband's birthday. I made reservations on Open Table and in the notes section I stated it's his birthday and if they do anything for birthdays, that would be greatly appreciated. I didn't really hear anything from them, so I just expected nothing would happen. We were finishing up dinner, I believe we asked for the check. I see someone with a shake with a candle in it, and I say to my husband "Man, they do do stuff for birthdays. I should have asked in person. I requested something be done for you." And next thing I know the shake was coming to us!! I think I was more surprised and happy than my husband was. And they didn't sing or anything, which was great. My husband doesn't like that.
