Little Goat Diner////Saw some Instagram photos from Little Goat Diner of delicious looking food, so on our trip to Chicago I knew I wanted to try it. To start, make sure to make a reservation unless you're okay with sitting at the counter or the communal tables. We didn't want to wait 20 minutes for a table so we opted for the counter, which was fine, just not a private booth.
