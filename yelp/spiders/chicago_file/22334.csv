Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Some of the best Chicago Style pizza you will find. Generous ration and even distribution of toppings makes a big difference in pizza, especially deep dish pizza, and Giordano's does it right. The atmosphere is nice and has an authentic pizzeria feel right as you enter. The only real downfalls are that the pizza takes a long time to make (not their fault), and one time when I went there, one of my pizzas came out at about room temperature. It probably was ready before the other pizza and had to sit and wait. I would rather they brought it out when it was hot, even if not all at once.
