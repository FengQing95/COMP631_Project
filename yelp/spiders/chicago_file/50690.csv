Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was a great spot for brunch with friends! Because their menu is tapas, we were able to order many small plates and sample lots of different food. The food was good, the service was good, and I liked the atmosphere and neighborhood of this place. We also enjoyed a pitcher of their sangria. A great, fun place for groups.
