Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Just about every Chicago pizzeria claims to have the best pizza of some sort (Pat's for thincrust, Gino's, Chicago, Giordano's for pan). It's subjective, but I give Lou's the edge. It also has the feel of being Chicago's oldest family run pizza restaurant, though this location ws only opened in 1986. While Lou Malnati (who died in 1978) did work in Chicago's first deep dish pizzeria in the 1940s, the first branch wasn't opened until 1971 in Lincolnwood. Â
