Smoque BBQ////To date, I have not had anything but great experiences at Smoque.  The brisket is excellent, as is the pulled pork, and they don't put up a stink or charge you extra if you ask for extra sauce.  Sides are equally excellent, the beans are hearty, the fries crispy, and the coleslaw is defiantly simple, almost to the point of being an afterthought (although that doesn't mean it isn't tasty).
