Smoque BBQ////First of all I was not impressed at all with their BBQ ribs nor with their brisket. The first time I went I ordered the ribs and I did not like their BBQ sauce, it was too tangy and full of Smoque flavor that to be honest it was overpowering for me. Their meat was hard to come off the bone, i felt like i was fighting it off the bone and was more chewy than tender. I did like the mac and cheese I just wish they would serve bigger sides, you can literally pick it all up at once with a spoon.
