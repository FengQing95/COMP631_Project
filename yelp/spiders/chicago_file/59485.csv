Smoque BBQ////In comparison to my last review I really don't think much has changed. Except for my rating. I recently took a trip Texas and went to a few BBQ places and I realized that smoke hits the nail pretty dead center. So I came back, and sure enough I was right. All around great flavor on the brisket, good BBQ sauce similar to that of Texas and good portion sizes. I think my personal taste is to have the sauce a little thicker. The best part about this recent trip was their Texas Chili. By far some of the best chili that I have had in long time. It could even beat my family's recipe.
