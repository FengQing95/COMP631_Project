Little Goat Diner////This was fine but not as interesting or good as I was expecting. Certainly, I knew that it would be an entirely different experience than G&tG, but I was hoping the same melding of delicious flavors and playful recipes would be in play. We did get interesting-sounding dishes but in the end they were just okay, and priced as though they were excellent. Would I go again? Probably, if in the area, but I wouldn't make a destination out of it again.
