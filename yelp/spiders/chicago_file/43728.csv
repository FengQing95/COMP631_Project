Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I know I had said 12 but 3 friends unexpectedly surprised me and when I told the waitress it would 15 she said we would have to sit at separate tables or wait another 30 mins so we can sit together. At that point I was already frustrated with time and went ahead and had 6 guests at one table and 9 at another. The waitress came over and apologized which I appreciated but the LONG wait caused 6 of my guests to sit at another table and I lost my table reservation at the night club. A good manager would have comped something off the bill but that didn't happen.
