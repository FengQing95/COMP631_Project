Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I've been to Wildberry's three times, ordering different dishes each time, and every time I have been impressed with the food quality and the service. Everything tastes great. I'd recommend going earlier than most (before 9am) or after lunch (around 1pm) to not to have to wait too long to get a table. But if you do happen to catch it during the "rush hours," I'd be surprised if you'd have to wait for more than 15-20 min maximum. They get people in super quickly as compared to other places. Hands down worth any wait time!
