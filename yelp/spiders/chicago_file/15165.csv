Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////-Malnati salad:  To be honest, I was surprised at the tastiness of the salad because I feel that a lot of restaurants only serve salads as a requisite. The salad is tossed with sweet vinaigrette dressing, gorgonzola, salami, olives, tomatoes, mushrooms and romano cheese.  I'd definitely order it again without any changes.  The menu says it serves 3-4 people, but our table of six all had enough salad.
