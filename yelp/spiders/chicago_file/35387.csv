Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was also really good, we got a bottle of wine, Lamb Shank, Fillet Mignon Petite, Pomme Frites, and Chocolate Cream Pie. Everything was good except this place lost my 5 star review because everything was over salted. We even had a side of seasoned salt to go with our over salted meal which we found very odd.
