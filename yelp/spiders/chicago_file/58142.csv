Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place was amazing!  Everyone's favorite at the table was their Brussels sprouts salad. It was "a to die for" dish. The tables second favorite was the bacon wrapped dates; they were amazing! (We even ordered a second helping of these). Next their goat cheese with tomato sauce was Yum!  The seafood paella was delicious!  The steak dish was good but couldn't hold a candle to the other plates. Great service and atmosphere and very clean (I really pay attention to that with the pandemic on going). I have nothing but great things to say about this place!!
