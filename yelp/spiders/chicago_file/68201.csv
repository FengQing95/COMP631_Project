Little Goat Diner////- Bullseye French toast- thick Texas toast with a hole cut out middle and replaced with an egg ad oozes out when you cut into it.  Really good (but not for those that like separation of church and state of sweet and savory).  The sliced chicken tenders were dry and overcooked on top.
