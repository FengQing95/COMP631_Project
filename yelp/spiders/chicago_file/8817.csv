Art Institute of Chicago////Extensive collection, so vast you easily need an entire day or more to fully appreciate the works. Spent most time in Impressionism and European art with short visits to Asian Art exhibit, American Art, and Modern. Some fantastic pieces throughout, many famous. Handheld audio commentary was worth the $7. Would highly recommend for anyone visiting Chicago, as we were from Los Angeles. Personal favorite was The Rock by Peter Blume in American 262. My companion was enchanted by the entire Impressionist collection but her favorite was Loading Corn by Thomas Hart Benton in Modern.
