The Purple Pig////If you're coming to Chicago, put Purple Pig on your must eat list. I'll add that I was planning to grab an Italian beef/hot dog after this meal, kinda just assuming it was going to be one of those fancy, unfulfilling meals. Happy to announce that I left the Purple Pig fully satiated.. and we're grabbing Chicago dogs tomorrow. :)
