Art Institute of Chicago////The museum is best known for its collections of impressionist, post-impressionist and American paintings, and I always hit up these sections when I'm there. I've also been to the new modern wing twice now, and it is a truly beautiful space. Definitely a must-see. I was recently at the Art Institute for the Picasso and Chicago exhibit, which was really nicely done.
