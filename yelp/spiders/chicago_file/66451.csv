Little Goat Diner////The cafe/bread shop next door is super charming, I got the "Little Goat" coffee that comes with caramel and whipped cream. Definitely has a unique flavor due to the goat milk, I'm a coffee vacuum but I think the 12oz is PLENTY. Especially if you just ate like, 15 pounds of food.
