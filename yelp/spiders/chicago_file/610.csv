Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I did my due diligence and selected Wild Berry for my last breakfast before leaving Chicago. I checked in on Yelp which is highly recommended as you'll likely be face a huge wait time, better to enjoy your time in the park than actually in line right? After receiving a text saying our table was ready, we checked in at the front desk and waited for about ten minutes prior to being seated. Despite that small inconsistency, it's immediately apparent that this is a well-oiled machine. Service is efficient and friendly, there is no slack here, everyone is hustling to pump out pancakes for the masses. The interior isn't very inspiring but it is clean and neat which I appreciate. The reason I dock 1 star is because of the two savory dishes we tried, both were under-seasoned and not really containing any strong or memorable flavors. I think it's safe to say that the ingredients were fresh but they could definitely benefit from extra spice or fresh herbs to satisfy the palette more than just the stomach (servings are generous). On a side note, I had a side of Blueberry Danish pancake which was very good so maybe the sweet portion of the menu is where their strengths are. All in all, it was a good experience but I can't say I would recommend waiting in line for hours for the food, definitely checkin on Yelp if you'd like to give this place a chance.
