Art Institute of Chicago////This was a first visit for us, and the place didn't disappoint.  We didn't have a ton of time, so we kept to the more well-known exhibits:  Renoir, Chagall, Warhol, Grant Wood and of course, Seurat.  Seeing some of these up close was somewhat of a surreal experience.  Experiencing the "pointillism" in Seurat's "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte" was worth the trip in itself.
