Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Seriously. These are fresh, amazing, delicious pizza pies. We got the butter crust (c'mon, you gotta go all the way when you're visiting Chicago and only have one night to try pizza)! I think our pizza was the equivalent of the "kitchen sink" in some other shops, and I'd get it all over again even though I'm usually a one-topping gal.
