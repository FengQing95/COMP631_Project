Little Goat Diner////I ordered the Reuben & a side of mac and cheese. The sandwiches are a bit pricey, considering no sides come with it. I would've liked to see you get french fries at least for a $14 sandwich. They are enormous tho, and one half of it went home for my dinner. Mac and cheese was wonderful!! Ordered it for the kids, but us adults ate it up too quick ;)
