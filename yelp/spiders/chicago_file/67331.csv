Little Goat Diner////We were finally seated an hour after we arrived at the counter facing the kitchen.  I felt that the counter was absolutely comfortable, being lower to the ground with comfortable stools and there was also a lot of counter space.  It was also exciting for us as Stephanie Izard was in the kitchen cooking right before our eyes.  Our server seemed a bit overwhelmed, but was still extremely nice and helpful.  We ordered Cheerwine to start off with.  While I have never had this soda before, my partner was oh so excited that they carried this drink as she has only seen it in the South.  For food, we asked for the Fried Pickles & Onion Rings as an appetizer and then the Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing and the Spiced Apple Pancakes (with cream cheese butter and oatmeal crumble) as our main dishes to share between the two of us.  We received our two main dishes before the appetizer - actually, WAY before - as in we received our main dishes and then 30 minutes later, right before we were going to ask for the check, the appetizer then arrives.  We decided to just box them up and I said to my partner that the server must have mistakenly heard us say "afterizer" instead of "appetizer" - I was joking, of course.
