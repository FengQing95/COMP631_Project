Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is just a really fun, old-school tapas spot and is perfect for a boozy, weekend brunch in Lincoln Park. This spot has been around since the 80's, and the menu and vibe sort of reflect that in the best way- Ba-Ba-Reeba is not the place to go for the newest takes on Spanish cuisine, but is instead the place to go with friends for the old standards and a really fun time. We stopped in rather late on a Sunday afternoon, and were immediately seated on their beautiful covered atrium-style patio. We started with olives and an order of their "crystal bread"- their take on pan con tomate- which was delicious and topped with generous slices of salty manchego. We also had a small cup of their really fresh and clean gazpacho, which was a great way to start the meal. From there, we had the Brussels sprout salad, studded with almonds and manchego, which really might have been the surprising standout. It was seriously really good, and hard not to get another order. We paired that with the patatas bravas, served with a big splat of paprika aioli, and their rich and creamy goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, served alongside garlic bread. While the food was delicious, the sangria really stole the show. We went with a pitcher of the cava sangria- sparkling white flavored with Spanish liquer and creme de cassis. It was fantastic, sweet, alcoholic and almost creamy, and I would be remiss to say it might be the best sangria I have ever had. The vibe was also fantastic- convivial and fun, with light pouring in from the sun roof. You can really tell that this institution is the place to come to celebrate. All in all, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is a wonderful brunch spot, and is a new addition to my list of Chicago favorites.
