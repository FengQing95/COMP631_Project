Little Goat Diner////I used to love Little Goat! It was my mom and I's go-to place whenever we visited Chicago, so when my husband and I moved just a few minutes away, I was beyond excited to be able to indulge at Little Goat whenever my heart desired. My meal of choice was always the tempura mash potatoes and the grilled cheese and the weekend after we moved to Chicago, that's exactly what I was craving. To my surprise, some items on the menu had changed and unfortunately the grilled cheese that I'd been dreaming of all week was one of those items. The new sandwich is made on bacon gouda bread. I'm a vegetarian but no matter, I figured I'd just ask for it on the bread it used to come on. The new sandwich also comes with pork on it (the old one came with meat as well, can't remember what kind though), but just like I used to, I figured I'd order it without. When I went to order, I was told that these changes could not be made and that the chef recommends the items as they are on the menu. I explained that I understood that and wasn't disrespecting the chef's sandwich, but that for dietary reasons, I would need the sandwich to be made on a different bread and for the pork to be left off. Again, I was told that this could not be done. Since I specifically came to Little Goat for this sandwich, I told the waiter that that was fine but that we'd be leaving (there's plenty of food in Fulton market, I figured I'd take this opportunity to branch out and find a new "go-to" spot). After being told we would be leaving, the waiter then went to check to see if the chef would be willing to make the changes. He came back a few minutes later and said the chef would be willing to but only because it wasn't very busy. The sandwich came out and I couldn't wait to chow down but unfortunately it just wasn't as good as it used to be. The bread was burnt, there wasn't much cheese for it being a grilled cheese, and there were olives in the apple-tomato relish (I don't mind olives but it seemed a bit fancy for what used to be a really delicious simple - in a good way - grilled cheese). Needless to say, I'm pretty bummed they changed this sandwich and probably won't be back. Â I left three stars because I would've given their old sandwich 5 stars easy and their tempura mashed potatoes are still good so I didn't want to discredit them completely.
