Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went here last night- our waiter brandon was super nice, fun and helpful. The food was delicious as well! We got the oysters, duck and goat cheese terrine, a wedge salad, a burger, and the broccoli. The broccoli was my least favorite but the other 4 items were all equally spectacular. The drinks are great too, boozy but tasty, and you can tell the bartenders know what they're doing. If you're looking for a delicious meal, great atmosphere, and good staff, you should check it out. We will definitely be back. Make reservations soon, they fill up!
