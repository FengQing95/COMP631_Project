Little Goat Diner////There's no way to go wrong at Little Goat. My husband and I split the Los Drowned sandwich and the pork belly and scallion pancake dish. They were both so good and it was hard to decide which to have as the last bite. We were going to get a cinnamon roll bc our waitress said they were better than Ann Sather's. She thought there was one left, but it was gone after all. She gave us an oatmeal cherry cookie on the house since she "let us down" after "convincing us to try the cinnamon roll." We were excited to have gotten a free cookie, but a little bummed when she told us the flavor -- until we tried it. It was so good!
