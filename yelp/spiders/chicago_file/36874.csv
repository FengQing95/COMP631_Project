Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////With such a marvelous scene, there's got to be exquisite food, and they also delivered on that end. I ordered the filet mignon; done medium-well, while my girlfriend had the steak frites; well-done. We also shared a side of mashed potatoes. Everything was done perfectly. The filet mignon had the right amount of seasoning and the grilled tomatoes that accompanied the steak elevated the dish. The steak frites tasted good; ideally I wouldn't get the steak well-done but that's what my girlfriend's scared of a little pink. There was no flaws in the food, it was all outstanding.
