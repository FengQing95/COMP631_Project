Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Some of the best Chicago style pizza I've had. I tried the bbq chicken personal pan and bruschetta to start. The bruschetta was fantastic paired perfect with the pizza and had a Windy City sour to wash it all down with. Highly recommend this place over eating at the typical large chain pizzerias.
