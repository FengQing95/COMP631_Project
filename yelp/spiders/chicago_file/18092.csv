Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////One of the worst pick up setups in River north. Hostesses forget you are there. Do not acknowledge you even when this business is slow.Front desk will only help you if you are obnoxious.People frequently cut in line at the front desk.To top the whole experience off food is not ready when you call 45 minutes before to pickup.They try and get you to pay so you can wait for food you previously ordered. Really inconvenient if you are on your lunch break. This is in correlation to numerous visits.
