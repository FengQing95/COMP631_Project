The Purple Pig////Came here on a busy Friday evening and my party was running a tad late. I ended up having to wait 20 minutes for them to arrive, and was worried that the staff would be annoyed, but they were beyond friendly and accommodating and I didn't feel rushed at all. Our server was phenomenal...knew all of the favorite dishes and had terrific recommendations. We went with the three mushrooms, the chicken Bolognese and the pork shoulder and each dish was phenomenal. I'm not the biggest fan of mushrooms, but this dish alone has converted me to a mushroom fan. Also, the chicken bolognese was surprisingly rich in flavor. I was a bit doubtful of the flavor since I usually have pork bolognese, but was pleasantly surprised. Pork shoulder was juicy, cooked to perfection and we didn't even have to use a knife to cut it because it was so tender! I would 100% order all of these dishes again. My only complaint is the portions sizes were a bit small for shareable plates. I will most definitely be back to try more of their menu!
