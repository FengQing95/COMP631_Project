Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I went to Wildberry on a Monday morning around 11am with a friend and there was a 30 minute wait. Yelpers did not lead me wrong. The meal was well worth the wait. It's across the street from Millennium Park and was beautiful inside. I had the special- Cinnamon French Toast Crunch. Caramel drizzled French toast with powdered sugar and Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal on top. AMAZING! My friend had the Tiramisu pancakes and we ordered a side of hash browns and sausage patties. We also gave the flavored lemonades a try. Not bad. The menu was extensive and I can't wait to go back to try more from Wildberry. With tip & tax, the meal was about $21/ person. A definite must-try.
