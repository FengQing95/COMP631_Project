Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We made a reservation two weeks in advance for the night before Valentine's Day so we could avoid a wait. Still waited for about 10 minutes, but no worries. Everything is really, really good and our server was very helpful with suggestions. We ended up getting 5-6 small plates, two desserts and a couple drinks each. The total bill was EXTREMELY reasonable. I highly recommend the coconut flan.
