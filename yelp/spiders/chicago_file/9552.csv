Art Institute of Chicago////That's just the European galleries up through the early 19th century.  Of course you also have the Impressionists and all the other usual suspects:  the Picassos, American Gothic, Nighthawks, the Chagall windows, etc etc etc.  Usually I don't make it out of the second-floor European section before museum fatigue sets in after two hours or so.
