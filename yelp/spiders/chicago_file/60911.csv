Smoque BBQ////I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly we were seated and eating considering how busy the place was.  If you do dine in here, it's probably best that you go in even numbers and have conversation ready that you're comfortable for your neighbors to overhear.  The (creepy) guys to our left stayed an extra 20 minutes while my friend back for the holidays discussed her sexual experimentation with other women with me.
