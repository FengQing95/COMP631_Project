Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Maybe I am just not a deep dish gal. My friend and I ordered a small to share. It was just very sloppy, cheesy and not as hot as it should be for pizza. The mozzarella cheese got hard pretty quickly. We ended up not eating a lot of the crust. I still prefer thin crust. If deep dish, then Zachary still does it well.
