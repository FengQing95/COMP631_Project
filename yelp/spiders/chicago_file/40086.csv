Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is like a big turn on. The mood is flirty & seductive - dark unobtrusive lighting adorned by flickering candlelight throughout.. Masculine feel, speakeasy vibe. Deep red leather booths..exposed brick walls...soft, jazzy tunes. Intimate yet comfortable. Posh without being pretentious. Â I love everything about the ambiance. But I will say the acoustics leave more to be desired...We found ourselves struggling to hear one another.
