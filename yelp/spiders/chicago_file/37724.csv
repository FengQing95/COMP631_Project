Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It was totally a romantic vibe. Candle lit and pretty dim. The music reminds me of being at an Italian restaurant and it wasn't too loud where you couldn't here. The majority of people I saw were in pairs and there were a few groups of 4 so I'm not sure if a larger group would do here but they are so accommodating that I'm sure they'll make it work.
