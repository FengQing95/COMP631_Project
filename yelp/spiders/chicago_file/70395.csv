Little Goat Diner////Love their food. I went their 3 time and every time I went to restaurant I'm not disappointed. They have a very good vegetarian option. Ask for their vegan menu the food is delicious. The restaurant decor is nice and comfortable. Their waiter is nice and friendly. I will definitely be back to restaurant again!!
