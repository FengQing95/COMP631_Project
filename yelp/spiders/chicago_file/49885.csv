Smoque BBQ////Having lived in Austin, Texas, and experienced the BBQ of the Hill Country, I feel it is hard to find good BBQ. I think Smoque does a pretty decent job of bringing good BBQ to Chicago - in my opinion, a town that sorely needs decent BBQ. The food is always fresh and inexpensive. Over four of five trips, I have tried both styles of ribs, the brisket, and the pulled pork. I think the brisket still needs work. It lacks the deep smoke ring you see at places like Ruby's or Smokey Moe's or the Salt Lick in the Austin area. It is also a little dry. The pit masters of the Hill Country seem to be able to smoke brisket for 24 hours and have it emerge with a perfect consistency of smoke, moisture, and texture. I think if Smoque continues to work on their technique, they will eventually start getting better quality brisket. The other thing I wonder is where they're getting their brisket from? The meat is good quality but it doesn't seem to be the highest quality you might find in the BBQ meccas. Lastly, I think they add a little too much brine to the brisket, therefore detracting from the smoke.
