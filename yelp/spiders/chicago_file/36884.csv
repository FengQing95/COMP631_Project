Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I don't know why they burned the outer part of our dry aged meat but it seems like it is quite normal as I see on other customers pictures here in yelp. I have been to a lot of steakhouse and we also grill prime meats at home in a special occasions but we don't do that to the meat. It is supposed to be browned. So when we told this to the waiter they changed our meat upgraded our mushroom side and given us free desserts. So for the 2nd time the meat was perfectly seared and perfect medium rare. The wild mushroom was good but too much butter and salty so probably you have to discuss how you like your wild mushroom to be prepared in advance. We also had spinach with gorgonzola and it was heavenly. The chocolate mousse was good but the carrot cake is just ok it has raisins and less walnut. Ambiance is nice but too dark for me. Good to try will explore other place nextime.
