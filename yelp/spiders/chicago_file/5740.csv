The Purple Pig////Such a fun time. The long tables are so communal, and the place is purple and dimly lit and everyone is talking and having a good time. The food is spectacular and creative, but funny enough, the best thing I had on the menu wasn't pork - it was duck! The drinks were good, and everyone had a good time. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Chicago .
