Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Alison and Ashley are some of my favorite people ever. My wedding day went off without a hitch because the entire staff is amazing. Literally amazing. We wanted to pay for everything before the wedding day because who wants to think about that when you're getting married. And it was so easy, and they ran our card for the final payment like we asked and let us know once they did. They think of everything before you do, which comes in handy if you're a frazzled, busy bride.
