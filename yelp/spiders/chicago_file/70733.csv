Little Goat Diner////The sides were again, good, but not great. We tried the tempura mashed, super unique but I wouldn't get them again, the mac & cheese - probably the best thing I ate, and the home fries - slightly below average diner home fries. Maybe the breakfast items would be better and more flavorful?
