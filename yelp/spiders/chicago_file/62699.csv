Smoque BBQ////And now for the review: Seriously, let me start first by saying that damn, this place is super efficient. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and informed that upon ordering we'd then be seated. So it's 6:30 on a Friday night and there's a manageable line in front of us, okay, no big deal. I ordered the Pulled Pork Platter and my boyfriend got the brisket platter.
