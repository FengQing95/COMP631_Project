Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After leaving a bad review of our horrible experience at our first and only time at Lou Malnati's, a customer service rep contacted me through yelp. I spoke with them on the phone about the service we received, and the rep was very apologetic. They stated that they are not perfect, is a family run restaurant chain, and apologized for an experience we should not have had. Since we are from California, they compensated us with a digital gift card thats good for an online purchase of any food products/gifts that they sell, along with their partner companies. In the end, great follow up customer service. It's true that we may have had an isolated bad experience, but unfortunately I will not be returning to have pizza there on my next visit to my family in Chicago.
