Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I went really early to avoid the wait and was one of the last people to get a table without a wait. By the time I left you can't get in the door. Sat at the bar and had trouble getting anybody's attention. Finally ordered and was told 35-40 minute wait for pizza to cook which I knew about. After 50 minutes I asked what was up and people who ordered after me got their pizza. He told me 10 more minutes. After 15 more minutes pizza came out. A total of one hour five minutes. Not sure what happened but that's a bit too long. Pizza was ok and I may have thought better than that but mood was low due to excruciating wait. You can take 40 minutes to make a great pie but after more than 1 1/2 times that long you should be ashamed.
