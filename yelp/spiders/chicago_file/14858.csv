Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'll admit that I actually love thin crust pizza - NY Style pizza but was ready to dive into Lou Malnati's pizza. We went with half and half of the {LOU} and {MALNATIS CHICAGO CLASSIC} the {CLASSIC} is definitely the way to go (if you are a meat eater anyways!) it trumped the Lou a lot. Definitely the much tastier option.
