Little Goat Diner////5 of my friends and I went and we ordered an entree each, but we all ended up leaving so much on our plates. I ordered the goat chili and it was way too salty and oily for my liking. My friend ordered the donkatsu sandwich and it really was just mediocre donkatsu with white wonderbread-like bread.. . My friend got a kimchi pancake, and that was really interesting and delicious. My other friend got a hamburger and he was incredibly shocked by the amount of salt in the burger-he had to order something else.
