Art Institute of Chicago////This building is huge and beautiful. At first I didn't really care about going but once inside, I was impressed by all the amazing art pieces. From Asian to African, Greek to American, it's always astonishing to see sculptures and art from hundreds of years ago. To see so much of it in pristine condition is mind boggling. I was able to go during the Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity exhibition. Some of the paintings were so real that they looked like actual photographs. They also had on display similar dresses that were worn in the portraits. I'm no art buff by any means and not even an art enthusiast, but I still recognized some of the paintings that were on display at the museum. Like I said, I didn't care about going but once inside, I was definitely able to appreciate all the different exhibits.
