Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've gone to this restaurant several times over the years, as well as many other of the famous steakhouses in Chicago. There are many great ones, but this place is the best. You can bring a bottle of wine and skip any corking fees if you share one glass with another table. This makes for a great environment. Another beautiful thing is the steaks are perfectly cooked and the highest quality. The wait staff is also always on point and excellent. Nothing but good things to say about this place. One thing to note, make your reservations a few weeks or months in advance because it's popular!!!
