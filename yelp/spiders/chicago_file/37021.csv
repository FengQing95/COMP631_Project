Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////When a place has great bread and butter I'm sold. And yes a lot of people have good bread and butter but I am snob when it comes to chips and salsa so of course I'm going to critique this restaurant that makes me wait until 10 for a reservation on a Tuesday night! Their warm sourdough and fresh salted butter just melt on your tongue. (We have not even started on appetizers!) My friends love their crab cakes they claim they could eat four of those for dinner and be completely satisfied. I on the other hand, I do not like fish or shellfish.
