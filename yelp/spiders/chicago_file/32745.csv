Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////In a city of great restaurant choices, Bavette's is a stand-out.  The smoky paneled walls make you feel like you are dining in a library.  They make a mean Old Fashioned, which is always a nice way to start out.  The meal is one of the best we've had in the last two years.  We started with a fois gras terrine and tomato salad, then had amazing steaks for our main courses.  A side of corn and a side of bacon made the meal perfect.  On top of it all, the staff was great - friendly, knowledgeable and professional  Can't recommend Bavette's highly enough!
