Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came for their famous deep dish pizza. 45 min wait to cook the pizza, so we ordered an appetizer and beer first. Loved the calamari, crispy and fresh. Ordered Small Lou add pepperoni and hot giardiniera, which was awesome. Extremely filling; a small was enough for the 2 of us.
