Smoque BBQ////Excellent baby back ribs. I didn't care for the Memphis sauce but my husband liked it. The ribs did not need the sauce at all. The dry rub was awesome. I loved the pecan bread pudding and the fries were good. I think the sides could have been larger for the price. I loved the cole slaw. The meal cost us $37 for one slab of ribs, 2 small sides, 2 drinks, as bread pudding.
