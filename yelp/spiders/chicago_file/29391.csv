Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was expecting sooooo much deliciousness... I ate at another deep dish pizza restaurant the other day that was rated 3.5 and loved it... I thought, wow, if this is 3.5 star pizza I can't wait to try this 4 star pizza...sadly, this place didn't live up to the hype I've been reading about. We got the sausage deep dish and a thin cheese crust for the kids. The sausage deep dish had a layer of sauce, sausage, cheese and more sauce. I'm used to pieces of sausage in my pizza and didn't really like the sausage layer that covered the whole pizza. Crust was crispy which I thought I would love, but just didn't do it for me. All in all good pizza, but wasn't great for me.
