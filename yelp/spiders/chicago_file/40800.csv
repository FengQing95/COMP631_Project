Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Awesome atmosphere! I loved the ambiance, low lighting, lots of people, but didn't feel cramped or over-crowded. Food was really good, but slightly more expensive than the Spanish tapas place I am used to in my native Dallas. Food came out really quickly though, and for some reason we felt rush to scarf everything down, probably our fault though! The shirtribs were awesome- extremely tender, just melted in your mouth, and the mashed potatoes were SO good with it, really buttery. Also, one of my favorites was the goat cheese spread with pistachios and orange marmalade- holy moly, I gotta try and make that one myself! Love that they have Matilda beer on tap. Blackberry (or blueberry?) sangria was light and fruity, but not too sugary- good combo with the strongly-flavored Spanish food, but...that's probably why the Spaniards created sangria in the first place. Overall, I am definitely coming back!
