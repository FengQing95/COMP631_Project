Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm visiting Chicago for the second time ever, and the last time I was here I tried the other famed deep-dish pizza place, Giordano's, which turned me off of deep-dish pizza. As a native New Yorker, I couldn't get behind a sauce cake, which is what it seemed to be, based on that experience. But I decided to give it another shot at Lou Malnati's and THANK GOD I did. I had the Malnati's classic (individual sized) and it was so incredibly delicious!! I can't stop thinking about it - the combo of the sauce, butter crust, sausage, cheese - mouth watering! I also love that they have different sizing too so my vegetarian husband could get his own veggie pizza, while I could enjoy a meat lover's dream. Service was friendly. You have to wait a little before getting a table but it's worth it!! My only negative is that the red wine is served too warm, but the pizza is divine. Thank you Lou Malnati's!
