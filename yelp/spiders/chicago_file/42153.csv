Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been to this place several times over the past five years and every time I go back its just as good as I remembered. They have great sangria, and great pintxos as well as tapas. Very authentic to Spain and very tasty and reasonably priced for Lincoln Park. Great for groups as well as an intimate date.
