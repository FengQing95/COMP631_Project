Art Institute of Chicago////Wonderful art museum!  But as others have stated it is a ALL DAY visit - so plan accordingly.  There is just so much to see!  We spent the whole day there and I still felt rushed at the end.  Perhaps it was because I was on vacation and my first time there, I wanted to look at everything, but there isn't enough time in one visit.  There's a lot of art work, a lot.
