Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We went because they showed in a cross-list of restaurants that were highly rated in general and had GF options.  The hotel told us that on Fridays, the weekends and holidays there is a wait. There certainly was: 45 min at 9 in the morning on a Friday. I grabbed an iced soy latte with caramel while I waited. It was about the same price as major coffee chains.  It was good. The milk they used seemed to be a little thicker than others. We were seated outside. Staff was very friendly, seemed to (generally) be happy to be there, and were helpful. As others have said, they did seem very knowledgable on handling dietary requests. Even when they didn't seem to hear me when I asked lemon, they brought it so good service in my book. NOTE: the GF pancakes have buttermilk in them and they seem to cook the eggs in real butter. So, if you are also DF, the wait may not be worth it to you. I did think the food was fresh - truly fresh fruit, for example. I requested eggs over medium and they were over easy. This is rather typical unfortunately. The bacon was thick but crispy: excellent job there. If you like your biscuits drenched in gravy, ask for extra gravy. Even for a busy place they said don't rush and seemed to truly mean it. I did not feel rushed which says a lot about a super popular restaurant, with long lines and lots of requests. They kept it cool. And, prices were reasonable to boot. I would still recommend going earlier than we did; 30 minutes is usually the tipping point for me.
