Art Institute of Chicago////What a pleasant visit, especially with free admission for Illinois residents this month. Â Not crowded like on the usual "free day". Docents very helpful in locating specific art, calming quiet while admiring pieces, even gift shop employees were quite knowledgeable and helpful. Can't wait to go back to visit Van Gogh's exhibit starting in February
