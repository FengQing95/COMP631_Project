Little Goat Diner////Tried the Pork Belly Pancake on the 1st visit and Breakfast Spaghetti on the 2nd visit. The Breakfast Spaghetti was surprisingly good, and the PBP blew me away! I dream about it sometimes. On both visits, service was amazing and really made me feel comfortable. I can't wait to bring my parents here and show them what Chicago's food scene really has to offer!
