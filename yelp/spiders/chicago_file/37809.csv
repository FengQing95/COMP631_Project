Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Five stars all around! From arrival you are treated like a high class diner. The aesthetic of the restaurant is similar to a speakeasy. Tables are candle lit and old school romantic jazz songs are playing in the background. This is not a white tablecloth restaurant with boujee waiters. This is almost comparable to an upscale American steakhouse but it is great. The food was awesome. We went straight for the main course and each had a steak. I had the original filet and my hubby had the dry aged ribeye. It was by far the best steak I have had in the city. We paired it with the charred broccoli, candied sweat potatoes (a must have), and the truffle mac.
