Little Goat Diner////A couple things that we appreciated besides the food was the coffee shop that's attached and the seating system. Our wait was 20-25 minutes and the entry area was crowded, so having the option of hanging out in the coffee shop while we waited was really nice. We also liked that they text you when your table is ready instead of giving you crappy pagers or just screaming your name. Texting gives you the freedom to wonder about outside or whatever while waiting. We will definitely be visiting Little Goat in the future.
