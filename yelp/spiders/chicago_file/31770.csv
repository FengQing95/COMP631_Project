Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we arrived at almost 10pm, it was still packed. We got our names on the waiting list for a table and ordered our pizza right then and there. We opted for the The Lou, which is a meat-free combination of spinach, garlic, basil, onion, mushrooms, and sliced Roma tomatoes covered with three cheeses on a garlic deep-dish buttercrust. My wife and I avoid eating meat whenever possible, so we were happy to see this option on the menu.
