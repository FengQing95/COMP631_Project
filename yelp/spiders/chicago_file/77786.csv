Little Goat Diner////The brunch crowd was slowly dying down (it was 3PM, after all) so it didn't take long for my food to come. In front of me was a beautiful plate of cheesy grits in a pool of garlic butter sauce, topped with at least a dozen shrimp, and some brussels sprouts and pistachio. I have had shrimp and grits in New Orleans, and dare I say it, but this was much better than the one I had in the South! The was just enough grits, as opposed to an entire plate full of grits and the sauce was so buttery, that I wish I had a biscuit to soak up all that excess sauce with.
