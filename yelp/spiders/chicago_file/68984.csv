Little Goat Diner////This is the kind of place where you have to come multiple times to even scratch the surface of the menu. The menu is almost overwhelming in that everything sounds amazing and sadly, you can't have it all. We had a reservation for Sunday breakfast. We were seated at a nice large booth that easily could have twice the size of our party of 4. Although the non breakfast items are served all day, I just couldn't see myself eating a patty melt at 8:30 in the morning, as mouth-wateringly delicious it sounded. Instead I opted for the Fat Elvis waffles which is an excellent choice for a sweet tooth. The generous scoop (I'm talking almost ice cream sized) of peanut butter butter was heavenly. The waffles were nicely chewy and I was very satisfied with the dish. In addition to my waffles, I tried 3 other entrees. The special blue plate of salmon, tomato and clam baguette was delicious. The Korean burger was tasty and the goat party pleasantly gamey. My brother loves loco moco so he tried Little Goat's version with fried rice and sweet and sour sauce. Unfortunately this was the most unsuccessful dish in that it had too much sweet and sour. For all the true loco moco fans out there, stick to the traditional Hawaiian style with white rice and dark gravy. On the table, we shared the special bread and the tempura hash brown. The tempura hash brown was so good, incredibly fluffy on the inside and delicately crispy on the outside. Would definitely recommend. Overall, Little Goat is as good as it gets as far as diners go. Hope to be back many times!
