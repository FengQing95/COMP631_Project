Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place was highly recommended and it didn't disappoint. Waited 2 hours here once you put your names down. Make sure you walk inside right away and pre-order your deep dish because it apparently takes an hour to make it. Once you sit down, it takes another 30 mins to get your pizza. Â Not sure if it's really worth the wait because this wait time wouldn't fly in NYC.
