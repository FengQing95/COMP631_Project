Little Goat Diner////My friend works the sandwich bar and I decided to swing by before hand to relax instead of just picking him up. I walked into the hostess station and asked if my friend was working but they had no idea. I ended up just walking back to the bar and there he was. I mentioned it to him and there were apparently some 'communication issues.' I was getting hungry and since we were getting set to put our drinking pants on I should line my stomach with something. The sandwich bar was closing in 30 minutes so my bud handed me the sandwich menu and the diner menu.
