Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Fantastic service, disappointing food. Wanted to love this place (especially after they took such great care of us) but they really missed the mark. Asparagus was extremely under cooked and I wasn't a fan of the bearnaise, as I found it a little sour. However, both of our steaks were cooked to perfection!
