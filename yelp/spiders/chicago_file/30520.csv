Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Not a huge huge fan of deep dish (sorry guys I'm not from here) but Lou's was delicious! We went there on a short trip to Chicago and it was a must go (well that's what we heard at least). So we went! and it did not disappoint. When we got the restaurant it was PACKED but of course since it was a Saturday. They were very organized and told us they we should expect a wait for 30mins but it was much less. Always a plus! We were sat and ordered beforehand when we put ourselves in line since the deep dish takes awhile to cook. Tables even pulled out to fit the huge pie on the table. We were happy we ordered a salad too to combat the oiliness.
