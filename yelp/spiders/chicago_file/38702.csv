Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I had oysters (East Coast), the bone-in filet with bone marrow and roasted broccoli while my wife enjoyed a wedge salad, the crab cake and macaroni and cheese. Everything was excellent. I am very particular about my steak. Bavette's managed to put a great crunchy char on the outside while keeping the inside rare edge to edge. The pre-dinner cocktails were wonderful and the wine selection was very comprehensive (although I would have liked to have seen a couple more Spanish reds from the Rioja or Ribera del Duero region).
