Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I regret choosing Lou Malnati's Pizzeria for our last lunch in Chicago on Sunday. We ate lunch at the Wells St location on Sunday morning. We arrived right at 11 because we know that it takes a while to cook a deep dish pizza and these places can become very busy.  Gloria was our server and it's possible this review would be very different if I had been seated in someone else's section. However, our experience on Sunday was with Gloria.  We ordered the stuffed spinach bread and the small Malnati Chicago Classic, which is a deep dish pizza with butter crust, lean sausage, tomato sauce and cheese. Gloria said it would be 35 minutes. Everyone in the other sections who arrived at the same time as us received their pizzas, ate, paid, and left the restaurant. Our pizza was finally served an hour and nine minutes later. We were so tired of sitting there we only ate a piece each and got out of there as fast as we could. I really wish we had not wasted our time in the place.  Not a recommendation from me.
