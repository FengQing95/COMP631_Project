Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So starting at the beginning (finally) we had limited time and settled on going to the two biggest players in town (so far as I could ascertain), Lou Malnati's and Giordano's. Now I know that there are a LOT of other options but again, limited time and a long absence made me want to keep things as simple as I could. Â So although I did cheat and have a thin-crust at the place next to our hotel, we stuck with the plan when it came to deep dish.
