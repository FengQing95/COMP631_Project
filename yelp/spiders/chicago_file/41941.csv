Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Bottom line, this restaurant is okay.  Based on what I heard prior to trying the restaurant, I thought I was going to have the best tapas ever.  They were average, and lots of the servings tasted the same even though they were meant to be different.  Luckily the wine was quality and I had good company.  My suggestion is if you are going out to people watch and eat average food, go here.
