Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////- Surprisingly, the thing I liked least was a dish I usually love: shrimp and grits. Their spin used chorizo-flavored polenta in place of the grits (I should mention that this menu is loaded with chorizo in general, so if you don't care for sausage your options are somewhat limited.) The shrimp were what is described as "Spanish baby ghost shrimp," which turned out to be half-inch-long minnow-looking things. The tiny pinpoint black eyes on each is clearly visible, which disturbed me somewhat. Tasted okay, but would not order again.
