Little Goat Diner////Stumbled across this cute diner place while waiting for a table at Au Cheval. Walked down the street looking for some coffee. Ordered an iced little goat minus the goat milk. I can honestly say, this was the best coffee I have ever had. Too bad I wasn't able to order any pastries or check out the food.
