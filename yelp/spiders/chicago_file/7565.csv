Art Institute of Chicago////Best of the best!I loved this museum! We just so happened to be visiting Chicago the week after the new modern art wing opened. I was so excited to visit, as I've always heard about the great art there. Unfortunately, we chose to visit on our last day there so our feet were oh so tired from our previous adventures around the city. This, of course dampened our experience, but I was still able to enjoy on of my favorite Seraut works..Afternoon in the Park and a few Durer etchings..also a favorite artist of mine. We can't wait to go back and visit again...this time we will go here first!
