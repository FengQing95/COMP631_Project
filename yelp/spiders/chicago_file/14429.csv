Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I would have to say that the only downfall is that there is only one stall in the ladies restroom on the first floor. I had to wait for what felt like centuries for one of their own waitresses to finish doing god knows what in there before I could go in. A few times the friendly staff informed me of the upstairs bathrooms, but since my table was on the first floor, I didn't really feel like trekking all the way upstairs. During said bathroom wait though I overheard two managers talking about how a customer gave great remarks on how good the pizza was. They seemed genuinely excited about the great comments so to me that translates as pride in their work and restaurant.
