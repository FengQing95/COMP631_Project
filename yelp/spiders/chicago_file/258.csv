Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Each time revealed great service and delicious food.  The first encounter was on a Monday morning after a weekend in Chicago.  My wife and I ordered WAY too much food because we had trouble deciding. I had the Butcher Block skillet with red velvet pancakes. My wife had the chocolate chip pancakes and a veggie omelet. Superb.  Our last visit was later, around noon on a Sunday so the crowd was larger which resulted in a 45 minute wait.  We brought another couple with us and everyone was more than satisfied with our entrees.  I was too busy eating my biscuits and gravy to properly pay attention to the other items ordered by our entourage but can tell you that the gravy here has a wonderfully unique seasoning.  After finishing the remainder of my wife's turkey burger I was in no mood to trek through the city on foot. But I did, because I couldn't very well sleep in the park.
