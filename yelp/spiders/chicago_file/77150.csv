Little Goat Diner////I've been to the Little Goat several times and am always pleased! They have all-day breakfast, great cocktails and beers, fun Asian fusion, and good meats and veg options. For the meat-eaters, definitely try a goat dish on your first visit, like the sloppy joe. For the vegetarians, give the scrumptious crumpets a go.
