Smoque BBQ////Can't really put my fingers on the reason why this place is so popular.  I've had people say "you HAVE to try Smoque, it will change your life!" SO I'm like cool, there really aren't very many BBQ spots on the Northside (really in Chicago) that are decent, let alone good. So I gave it a try. First trip a no go.  Was gonna do the walk in thing. line was almost out the front door.  Also it was an odd way to have the line waiting. It's in the middle of the restaurant so you have a lot of ppl moving back and forth between the line including servers bringing food to customers who were eating in. I have issues this I know! however, something rubs me the wrong way when I see food traveling to tables having to weave its way through a line of mouth-breathers, looky lous and coughers before it gets to the table. I'm sure it happens in other places but maybe because I don't see it it doesn't bother me as much.  Anyway after catching that glispse I decided another day would be my opportunity to try them and it would definitely be via call in.
