Art Institute of Chicago////This place is pretty incredible if you love art. I came here when I was in college on a school trip and couldn't believe how huge it was! I don't think I have even seen all of it to this day. There is a little bit of everything for everyone. Lots of history and beauty in this place. I would definitely recommend getting a tour guide or something to help explain the meaning behind the artwork. If you are an art lover, this is a must see.
