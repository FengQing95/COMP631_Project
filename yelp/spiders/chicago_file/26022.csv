Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered, my oldest ordered a plate of ravioli and the server recommended we get the adult version. We did. Turned out that he still got us the kids' version which had 3 miserable and unappetizing ravioli on them. The sauce I'm betting was Ragu or something because I've tasted better from store bought. It was pretty sad. We eventually had to order a second plate of ravioli for my child.
