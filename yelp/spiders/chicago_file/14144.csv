Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have never waited this long for pizza.. When we arrived and were told it would take 1.5 wait but we could pre-order our pizza so it would be ready by the time the table was ready, so we went ahead and "pre-order"... our table ended up being ready within 45 minutes so we were excited! unfortunately our waitress was not the friendliest or attentive, took 15 min to get drinks then when she took our order we indicated we had a "pre-order" for the pizza so she said ok. Thankfully we order some wings which came out within 15-20 min, no pizza... so we patiently waited another 20-30 minutes and noticed other tables seated after us got their pizza,
