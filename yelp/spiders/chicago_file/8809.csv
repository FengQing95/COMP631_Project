Art Institute of Chicago////I'm really bummed that in order to use the free pass that you can check out from the library, you now have to bring a child.  It was explained to us that too many people were abusing the pass, so since July, they had set a limit by requiring someone under 18 to be with the adult using the pass.  Something tells me that people who have the capacity to abuse the pass are just going to get more creative.  I know there's a free day, but doesn't always work with everyone's schedule.
