Smoque BBQ////You know a place is cooking up some mean BBQ when you can smell the smoque (sic) down the street.  This place definitely lived up to all the hype!  The brisket is very smokey with a perfectly charred exterior.  Most of the sides come in foil cups (including the corn bread!?!) which was somewhat surprising but I'm sure helps them keep the line moving.  The coleslaw was pretty bland, but the sweet and smokey beans definitely made up for it.
