Smoque BBQ////Fat worth having. Forget the sides, eat a salad earlier in the day, this should be a meat only meal. This small specialty bbq shop apparently always has a line but it moves quickly. Once inside, the humid smoky smell of roasting meat hits your nose and the anticipation of tender, juicy meat consumes all thought processes. With an assortment of baby back ribs, brisket and pulled pork, I made myself a custom napkin bib and rolled up my sleeves to indulge in this decadent meal. The brisket was my favorite and the bbq sauce was spicy, sweet, tangy. Just go.
