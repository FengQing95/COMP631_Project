Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place has great tapas and the sangria is delicious as well.  The food isn't pricey either. My friends and I love this place. Its a great place to just have a good time. Definitely a great place for groups. I love this place because we order many tapas and share them.  The mini desserts are good also.
