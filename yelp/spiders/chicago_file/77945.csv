Little Goat Diner////This is a neat, stylish diner with a bakery attached. One thing I think that's cool about its design is the hidden entrance to the restrooms. The door blends in with the wall like the entrance to some secret lair in a movie. I do like the playfulness about this place from the cartoon graphics on the menu to little touches like actually printing the words "Blue Plate" on the blue plate special plates.
