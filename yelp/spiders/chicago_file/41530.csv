Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I think I expected more because of everyone else's rave reviews. Loved the spicy potatoes, but nothing else was too terribly memorable for me. I felt like the portion sizes were very small, because I had to eat a lot to get full and there were only 4 of us dining together. My White Peach Sangria also seemed to be watered down. I would give Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba another try though, because the service was good and I enjoyed the atmosphere. Next time I want to be wowed.
