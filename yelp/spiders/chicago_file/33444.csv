Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////That Negroni embodies the sole critique: service.  I understand that it takes awhile to adjust to hype combined with a Friday night.  However, when you blow an 8:00 P.M. res. by an hour and forty-two minutes, I begin to think you did that on purpose to run up our drink tab and make more money.  By my next visit, I hope this is remedied, otherwise, the ice water will flow like wine in protest; but I can do better because I deduced the root cause of the slow service: hipsters.
