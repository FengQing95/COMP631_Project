The Purple Pig////My husband and I really liked the food at Purple Pig. It's a restaurant that's much better for groups because the portions are huge and you want to be able to try a lot of different things. We ordered a lot just to try. My favorite was the duck and the fried pig ears. All flavors were delicious though. Be sure to make a reservation because this place is packed by 11:30 am.
