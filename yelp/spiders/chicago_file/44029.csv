Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What a fun delicious place.. Brussel sprout peanut slaw was killer, as were the other 5 or six tapas we shared. Unique & sophisticated sangria (not the flavored vodka or the peach sangria- those concepts were a  bit too precious for me to try).  Bacon wrapped dates, mushrooms with fontina, charcuterie plates all good.  Desserts:  chocolate crema with orange & butterscotch were lovely with coffee.
