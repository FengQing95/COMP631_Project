Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had no problems finding tasty dishes on the gluten free menu though.  As dishes were brought out, Hector would come to let us know which ones were safe for me to eat and which weren't gluten free.  Partway through the meal he brought freshly toasted gluten free bread for me since he explained, "this gluten free bread doesn't taste so good once it's cold."
