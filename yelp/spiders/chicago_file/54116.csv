Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We were excited to try this venerable Chicago institution.  It started great but it went downhill.  We were running a bit late but got lucky and scored a street parking close to the restaurant on a snowy cold night.  Even though it was Sunday night, it was hopping with not very many empty seats.  Tables are pretty close since they packed in so many, however, we got a nice table.
