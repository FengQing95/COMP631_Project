Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Walked in on a Saturday night around 630pm. The spot was pretty busy. We had an hour and a half wait. Thankfully, it only Ended up being a 40 minute wait. We were seated in the back right if the restaurant, but my group and I ended up moving ourselves to a different table. The Corner we were originally seated had a heck of a fly problem. They were even inside the parmasian shakers. The pizza came out about 30 minutes after we ordered, which wasn't bad. The deep dish pizza was ok, but didn't make up for the unclean environment. Definitely not the spot for a the best deepdish spot in chicago. The Hunt continues
