Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we were finally seated, we received our salads and then pizza. Service was quick and nice. The salad wasn't bad, the dressing was yummy. Finally...the pizza arrived and we couldn't wait to dig in. We thought the first bite was nothing to write home about and kept eating, hoping to taste the what made this place so amazing for others. While we did enjoy the crust, the cheese and sauce was seriously lacking. The sauce I think was the worst, zero flavor and almost watery.
