The Purple Pig////We also ordered the Crispy Pig's Ears ($15), which is one of their most popular dishes. It comes topped with a sunnyside egg to mixed into the crispy pig ears and veggies. This was a nice dish with a sour twist, but didn't stand out as much to me. The Grilled Broccoli ($13) was a very unique take of the vegetable with a crispy yet creamy texture in a hint of sour taste as well. This was a favorite amongst our table.
