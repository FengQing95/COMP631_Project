Little Goat Diner////Hit this spot for brunch with my friend and really enjoyed it. The food was good, the service great and fast, and the atmosphere was great. I would've given 5 stars, but I'm not feening to go back and have another brunch there - food was good, not great. Still, I definitely recommend for a fun brunch.
