Smoque BBQ////A note on the ribs: if you're looking for "off-the-bone" ribs, this isn't that type of place.  These are heavily rubbed and smoked for hours and hours, so you have to take your time with each rib bone and slowly play the meat off with every bite.  I'm making my own mouth water as I type this.  =D
