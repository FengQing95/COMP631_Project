Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I gotta just give it five stars. My first time was a great experience. The Spanish hams? Delicious. Â The empanada? Even more delicious. The spare rib was perfect and the shrimp was so tasty. Any place that focuses on Spanish wines gets my vote of approval. Plus, at the end of dinner, I indulged in some sangria which was just excellent. I would even consider coming to cafe ba ba reeba solely to sip on some sangria. I should make a date of it.
