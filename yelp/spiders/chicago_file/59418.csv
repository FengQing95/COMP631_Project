Smoque BBQ////This place would get five stars except for the seating arrangement. Yes, I'm a baby because I don't like sitting next to other people like I'm at a church picnic. I'm sure, however, that there are dozens of us. The food is incredible. Best pulled pork sandwich ever. People are okay. Not terribly nice, but I don't really care about that. Just counter service.
