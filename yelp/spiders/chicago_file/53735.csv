Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is really good. When I first moved to the city (around 2011) I used to go here at least once a week. In the past few years they have taken away some of my favorite menu items and the prices have increased. What remains is the best sangria I've had and the sangria continues to be reasonably priced. Some of my favorite tapas that are still on the menu include the meatballs in sherry sauce, bacon wrapped dates, goat cheese and tomato sauce, and ham and cheese croquettes. The service has always been excellent.
