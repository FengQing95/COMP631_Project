Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////- No joke, food was really good. As for the deep dish pizza, we had the Â Malnati Chicago Classic deep dish pizza as recommended by our server. The core of the pizza was good and cheesy, though it was not as deep as I thought it would be. However, it could be because we had the smaller pan. The crust was ok, but I wish it was crispier.
