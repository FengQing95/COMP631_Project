Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We tried every sangria on the menu except the standard white and the white peach.  My favorite was the black raspberry, but they were all really good!  Strong enough, not too sweet, and the flavored ones did have really good flavor (black rasp., mango, passion fruit).  Plus, as more sangria was consumed, the hard / no-back bar stools became more and more comfortable.  So that was a bonus.
