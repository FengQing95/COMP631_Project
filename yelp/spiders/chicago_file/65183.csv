Smoque BBQ////I've been to Nashville and I can honestly say that I have never sampled food that was just as good as one of the areas that made it popular. I wish Smoque offered more food combination meals, while also offering additional flavors of sauce. On the other hand, I was able to put my own variety together and still walk away paying a reasonable price.
