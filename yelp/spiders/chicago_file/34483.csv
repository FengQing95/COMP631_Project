Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went here in October to celebrate our wedding anniversary and could not ask for more. Ambiance is very romantic with dim lighting and swanky relaxing music behind casual restaurant conversations. We were catered to by Benjamin, who pulled out all stops to make sure the wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our evening out. Must mention the amazing corkage fee, i.e. giving a complimentary glass to a patron of our choosing (we made a 50th birthday celebrant a little happier that night!).
