The Purple Pig////Purple Pig is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Every dish I have had there has been unique and delicious. The service is great and very knowledgeable. The waiters have extensive knowledge of Purple Pigs long wine list. I was introduce to one of my favorite wines, Barbara, there.
