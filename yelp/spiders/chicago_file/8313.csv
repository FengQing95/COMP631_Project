Art Institute of Chicago////For my 50th review, I'd like to talk about something I recently scratched off the ol' Bucket List: I have been obsessed with a painting since 1986. It was the year I first saw Ferris Bueller's Day off, and Cameron Frye stared into the eyes of the little girl holding her mother's hand in A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat. I'd seen replicas since, and own a print of it as well. But, I made it my mission to see this painting in more than photographs and reproductions. I had to see the real thing that I called "My Painting".
