Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Hands down my new favorite restaurant in Chicago. My husband and I came here for our anniversary and had an amazing experience. The food was perfect (we had the baked goat cheese, filets, sage/bourbon butternut squash, mashed potatoes and the chocolate pie + their delicious cocktails...and the sourdough bread...oh my!) but it's important to note that the service was outstanding. Our server (Julio I think?) explained the menu well, made us feel comfortable and made sure not to rush us which is always appreciated. The ambiance is lovely and we could have stayed all night! We will be back soon!
