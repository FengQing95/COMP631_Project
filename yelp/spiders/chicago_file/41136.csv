Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm not a big fan of the tapas concept in general - it has always just seemed to me like a convenient excuse to serve small portions - but if there was a place to change my mind about that, Ba-Ba-Reeba seems to be the place. Â The food, service, and atmosphere was all pretty good.
