Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////dayummm! talk about a Chicago style pizza. i came here on a nice afternoon and was surprised to be sat down very quickly in the patio. which was so awesome. i got the house favorite Chicago style pizza that came with all sorts of toppings. i liked that the waitress gave us the exact time it would take to make our pizza. 35 minutes for a small. i also ordered the house salad with sweet onion dressing. YUMMMY it was such a tasty crunchy salad! when the pizza finally came out i had no choice but to destroy that beautiful thing. the cheese, the sauce, the toppings. perfection!
