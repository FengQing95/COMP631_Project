The Purple Pig////I loved everything here! It was so delicious and lots of unique flavors that I couldn't get enough of! I came with a friend on our short visit to Chicago one night around 930pm and it was very busy! We were lucky there was only 2 of us and a spot had just opened at the bar so we were seated right away. Right off the Magnificent Mile, me friend and I started getting hungry after some shopping and saw that this place was close by. Very cool atmosphere. Staff was nice, we were served by the bartender and he was very attentive. Ordered wine but I noticed they have a lot of cocktail choices, wish I got the chance to try them! Noticed a lot of patrons drinking the night away there!
