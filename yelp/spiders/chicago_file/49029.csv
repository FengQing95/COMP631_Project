Smoque BBQ////I'm from Dallas, Texas where BBQ reigns supreme so I feel like I'm a pretty good judge of what is considered fine BBQ. This place is the real deal. The Briskett is so succulent- it litterally falls apart on the fork. Even the BBQ Beans are perfect- made with a delcious smoky flavor. I also tried the Texas Sausage and again, was not dissapointed. The only knock against Smoque is the portions aren't as big as I would like. I'm used to eating, getting full and taking some home for later. I was able to finish my entire plate and honestly could've eaten a bit more.
