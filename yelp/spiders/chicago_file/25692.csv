Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great pizza with some good vegetarian options. My brother and sister-in-law even had their rehearsal dinner there (great for out of town era). We often order pizza and the salads for delivery when we are with the fam at home for a football game. My bro and sister in law get it only half baked so they can finish it in their own oven but I'm too impatient for that. It's also good for my sister in law bc they have good gluten free dough.
