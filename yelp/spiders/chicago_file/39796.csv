Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For my fellow foodie friends, yes even though the steaks are unbelievably mouthwatering good, I do encourage you to look past the obvious drooling options on the menu and try the beef stroganoff (I literally crave this dish & it never fails to satisfy) paired with a full bodied red and order generously on the side dishes (most meals come a la carte).
