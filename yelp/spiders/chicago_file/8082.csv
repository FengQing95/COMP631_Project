Art Institute of Chicago////Art Institute is one of the best art museums in the the country, that's for sure. But it's ridiculously expensive, for everything. The work is great and a pretty wide selection, though a major attraction tends to be Impressionism. I really wish they would show more of the things they have in the back, for instance prints like German Expressionist etchings.
