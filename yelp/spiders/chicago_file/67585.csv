Little Goat Diner////Loooved the fried pickle sandwich! It was a bit messy to eat (it's less of a sandwich and more of a big pile of yummy ingredients on pita bread) but it was oh-so-delicious. And although I don't have any dietary restrictions, one of my friends was very impressed with the separate gluten-free menu. Service was prompt and attentive as well. I enjoyed the decor, which definitely had a diner feel, but not in a tacky or overdone way. Bonus points for the photo booth at the front, which provided some entertainment during our 45-minute wait!
