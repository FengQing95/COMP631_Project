Art Institute of Chicago////Fantastic to visit even if you're not an art buff. I have visited twice and I mostly enjoy the modern and contemporary sections, as well as the American artists. There are so many beautiful and famous works here. I was disappointed to see Nighthawks was out on loan on my first visit, so I was thrilled to see it this time! My husband is a Rothko lover, and they have five of his pieces!
