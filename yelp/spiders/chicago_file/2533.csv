The Purple Pig////So i don't usually post reviews unless i am blown away and i was definitely blown away. Our server Troy was pleasant and attentive with a great personality. The food was INCREDIBLE!!!! I am from NY which is the food capital and have eaten at some of the best restaurants and The Purple Pig is high on my list. Big props to the chef!!!
