Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Before we even get into the meat of things, lets talk about the bread basket. Easily, one of if not the best breads I've ever had in a restaurant. They could easily charge $5 a basket and have people dish out for it. Thick chunks of fresh, piping hot (not just warm) bread comes to the table with a tub of butter. Yes, tons of butter. This is how every restaurant should serve their bread. Without getting too detailed, the taste was phenomenal, yeasty, incredibly soft, luscious and almost silky. The butter melted almost instantly upon spreading, and the bread literally melted like cotton candy once it hit my tongue. A great way to get introduced to such a fine establishment.
