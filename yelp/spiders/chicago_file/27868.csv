Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I called and asked if they would take reservations. They said not the day of. But they never told me I could add my name to the waitlist in advance! WTF. So I called a second time and asked how long the wait time was. I ASKED THE SERVER if I could add my name to the list and she said yes. So I did. I got a text that said check your place in line and order your pizza in advance. I could see where I stood in line, but no way to order my pizza. So we headed down there and got seated within 10 minutes of arriving.
