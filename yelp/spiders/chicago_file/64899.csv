Smoque BBQ////Smoque does a great barbecue, that's for certain. However, when you pay $15 for only a mild amount of brisket, you can still feel disappointed. Their $15 for two sides and a the brisket itself still left me decently hungry after the meal. However, I can absolutely say that Smoque was better barbecue than any I've had in Chicago.
