Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If you're looking to have a physical reaction to food - a good one, I mean - this is spot to hit. Now, I love tapas because it gives a food lover like me the opportunity to try all sorts of food in one sitting, and that's exactly what you should do. The sangria is delicious, the empandas to die for, and the flan is divine. The decor is cheesy and it's a little pricey (but I'm poor, so what isn't?), but the waitstaff is friendly and I guarantee you'll leave happy ... and stuffed.
