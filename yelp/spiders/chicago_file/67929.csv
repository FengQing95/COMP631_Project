Little Goat Diner////This place was so adorable! I loved the decor. The service is great too. Our waitress was amazing. As far as the food goes it really lives up to the hype. I had a burger with a fried egg and it was delicious. We also had the Brussel sprouts which I usually dont order but they were so good here. I would say you really need to order them along with the tempura mashed potatoes.
