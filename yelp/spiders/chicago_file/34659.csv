Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Awesome in every aspect. The place is beautiful, the service was helpful but not invasive, the food was tasty and the prices accordingly to the place (around $100 for two). We had the salmon tartare as appetizer, perfect flavor. Roast chicken and meatloaf as entrees with sweet potato and spinach as sides. Everything was flavorful, we had a great night.
