Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Long story: After waiting 40 minutes (quote time was 30) a staff member who wasn't our server brought us the wrong pizza. We waited approximately another 5-10 minutes waiting for our waitress to see how we were doing. We brought to her attention that we got the wrong pizza, and she apologized immediately. She went to get the manager who went to go apologize to the other table first (you know, the table that had already had food for 15 minutes). The manager asked if we wanted the pizza that was brought to us, after we said no she said they would put in a new one. She then asked if we wanted anything else. We waited for another 30 minutes for our pizza to come out. The waitress brought us a bill not that far after we received the right pizza. The bill showed that we order TWO pizzas and ONE of them was discounted. Additionally, the item we order that was offered to us for our extended wait. We asked out waitress to see the manager, our waitress asked us if we had a problem with the bill (you know, besides there being one). The manager came over and acted as if the restaurant was in the right, after we had been there over two hours.
