Smoque BBQ////Can't be a great entree without some yummy sides to go with.  Baked mac and cheese, coleslaw and corn bread are my choice sides.  The slaw isn't creamy at all, it's has more of a vinaigrette kick to it.  Make room for dessert or at least order it to go because the peach cobbler is a MUST.
