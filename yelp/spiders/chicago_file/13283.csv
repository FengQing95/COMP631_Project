Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Wake up and change or revamp your pizza. I had visitors from Dallas Texas over Labor Day Weekend, Friday night and hungry, wanted to try one of the best most renowned pizza restaurants in Chicago. Disappointed will be understated. Service was ah, the veggie pizza although it was big enough to feed 4 people, wasn't good enough to claim as best Chicago deep dish pizza. 2 stars, just for size and hope for change.
