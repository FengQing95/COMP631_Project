Little Goat Diner////There are a bunch of other delicious breakfast, lunch, and dinner menu items. There's a full bar, full coffee bar, and not to forget that they serve breakfast all day. It's a perfect place to begin or end your day, and this will definitely be on my list of places to visit when I come back to Chicago!
