Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Posting this review late. Yelp was crashing on me when I was trying to do it originally. But absolutely delish! Atmosphere is warm and personal. The tapas are perfect for people who don't mind sharing food. The sangria is flavorful and refreshing! I wish the experience were fresher in my mind because I would love to add more details -- but a definite must visit if you are in town.
