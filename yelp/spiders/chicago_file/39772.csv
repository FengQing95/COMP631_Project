Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our entrees and sides were delicious.   My husband had the New York Strip (bone on) that he said was in the Top 3 he ever had. (Though when pressed couldn't name the other 2)!!!  I had the salmon which was fantastic (if a little more well done than I usually go for).  Our sides were the garlic mashed, "Street" corn, and a to-die-for truffle Mac and Cheese.
