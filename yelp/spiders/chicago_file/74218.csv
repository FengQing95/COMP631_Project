Little Goat Diner////On to the food. Dining partner is a pescetarian, so not wanting to shut the sharing door on her, I ordered the gemelli with mushroom ragout, she got the spiced saut√©ed shrimp, and we split a bowl of the Brussels sprouts. Wasn't disappointed about my pasta choice being meatless. In fact, I actually wanted breakfast food for dinner, but we both thought it might be a little strange to have with our cocktails, so I opted against it. The mushrooms have just enough umami to make the pasta kind of meaty on its own, and as it turns out, she loves mushrooms too! The overall profile of that dish made it so I didn't miss the meat, and that's a great feat to accomplish. Her dish was pretty good as well, although I didn't really taste the Kim chee in the dish as described on the menu. Brussels sprouts - don't let the fish sauce discourage you! It had almonds and a fish sauce vinaigrette, topped with crispy onions that look like Durkees but taste like homemade. So good. Like a warm salad. Not sure if warm salad is really your speed or not, but the dish worked well. I mean, we were scraping the bowl. So there's that.
