The Purple Pig////roasted bone marrow- aw so underwhelmed. i was really excited to try this. but it didnt taste what i thought bone marrow would taste. i like the cilantro pieces to use to garnish, i think the cilantro made the bone marrow instead of being just a garnish. it came with a small bowl of salt, but with all the other salty dishes, i didnt need to add any!
