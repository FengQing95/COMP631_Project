Little Goat Diner////We wanted to avoid typical diner food so this was a cool change up with a slightly Asian twist on some of the traditional brunch items! We shared goat chili and tempura mashed potatoes - the goat chili was great, although I didn't think the mashed potatoes were THAT interesting (it's fried mashed potatoes. Of course it'll taste good).
