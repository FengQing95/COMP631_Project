Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We are fans of the Lincolnwood location. Their recent expansion with a dedicated take out lot and counter are great. The pizza is always great. They don't list their soups on the web page and I was told it was because not all locations have soup. Seems as though they could set up the web page to reflect those locations that do have soup.
