Art Institute of Chicago////Most recently my friend and I went to an After Dark event which the Art Institute of Chicago holds about every two months. This month featured Edward Hopper. There was great wine, an awesome live band, and an amazing Edward Hopper exhibit. I knew I liked his most famous painting, but I didn't realize how much I truly enjoyed his work until seeing it first hand this past Friday.
