Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When in Chicago, one must deep dish.  I should mention that I absolutely detest deep dish pizza.  What's the appeal?  It tastes like a fancy quiche with too much tomato sauce and not enough cheese.  I would rather get a thinner slice (I lurve New York) with double the cheese and  a little less butter (at least noticeable butter).
