Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food was un FRIGGIN believable and the service was spectacular as well. Got seated right away. The only complaint of the night was it took a little while for our waiter to get to us for the drink and appetizer order, which he was very apologetic for later on and made up for with a free glass of champagne and free tea.
