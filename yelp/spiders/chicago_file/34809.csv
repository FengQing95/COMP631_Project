Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great food and service! Went with a couple friends to celebrate and split a few steaks and side dishes. They were accommodating and even cut the salads and steaks up for us. Everything was amazing. Highly recommend the filet and mashed potatoes! Finished the night with the chocolate cake and a sparkler!
