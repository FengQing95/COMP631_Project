Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our free bread came out burnt. Told our server, Russ, he informed us that the bread was suppose to be crusty and burnt like that. Took our discarded burnt bread pieces and didn't return with a new bread until the bus boy asked us. Guess what? The new bread wasn't burnt and actually good. I understand it was busy, but you don't have to make excuses. Just look at the food and make a judgement call.
