Little Goat Diner////Now, as far as food and atmosphere are concerned. Let me put it this way...I cannot WAIT to come back! The atmosphere is that of a traditional diner, if it were given a good touch of class. Candles were lit at every table, people were dressed in "dress casual" yet, it was still the same volume almost as a sports bar. (not to say it was too loud to hear eachother talk, but it wasn't so quiet that you had to whisper either) Â
