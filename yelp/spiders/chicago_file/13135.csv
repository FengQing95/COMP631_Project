Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered the Chicago Classic pizza which included the famous butter crust and sausage, to this I added pepperoni.  What I noticed on the menu was that you can order extra tomato sauce on the pizza.  Never having seen 'extra tomato sauce' as an option I didn't order it.  It was a mistake.  I think the pizza really lacked that great tomato flavor.  The crust, mild sausage, and mountain of cheese made the pizza everything I expected.  It would have been perfect with more sauce.
