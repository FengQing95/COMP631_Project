Little Goat Diner////Little Goat Diner is great. I used to live in the neighborhood, and this is probably my most visited restaurant in Chicago. The menu is extensive, so you have the chance to keep coming back and trying new items. On my most recent visit, I got the Parathas Burrito. The flavor was pretty good, but I did not realize how bean heavy of a dish it would be. I am not particularly a bean person, so that was not ideal. However, there are some other dishes that I would recommend over and over again. "This Little Piggy Went to China" is one of the most flavorful dishes I have ever tasted. I have also really enjoyed the Banh Mi burger, crab dip, Brussels sprouts, and fish tostadas. Perhaps most delicious of all are their milkshakes. Last time I got the cookies and cream, which I am still having dreams about. It was packed with ice cream and a bunch of actual, crumbled up cookies. Please do yourself a favor and save (or make) room for this at the end of your meal!
