Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago has something for everyone, ranging from paintings to photography to sculpture to furniture.  It took me about 3 hours to go through the museum.  So much work blew me away, particularly the Master of Bamboo exhibition that was actually tucked away in a corner of the Japanese section.  I'm glad I stumbled across it!  The baskets in this exhibition were extraordinary.
