Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started with some cocktails-- the champagne smash was excellent! Garnished with a generous portion of mint- the nose alone on the drink made your mouth water. I also had the mint julep which was strong but gentle at the same time. It was as if a big tough guy gave you a big massage before kicking you in the throat.
