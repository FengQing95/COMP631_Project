Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Neither my wife nor I had any experience with chicago deep dish pizzas but I am an pizza enthusiast and was excited to try deep dish from the source. Â Wow! Both my wife and I agree the classic Maltini was the best pizza we had ever had. I will miss this place when I get back home. The calamari is a pretty awesome snack while your waiting for you pizza.
