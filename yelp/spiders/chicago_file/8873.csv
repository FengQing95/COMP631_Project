Art Institute of Chicago////Having already read that they were rated the best museum in the world by Trip Advisor for 2014 and being told by others that this place was worth a visit, the Art Institute of Chicago lived up to its billing for my family and me.  Comprised of a series of connected buildings taking up three city blocks, this sprawling museum complex was replete with gallery upon gallery of incredible, world class exhibits.  Some of my favorites included their collection of Monet paintings (the largest in the world), their Chicago Architecture exhibit (featuring remnants of since demolished Chicago architectural landmarks), and their Victorian era furniture collection.  The main museum building itself is a beautiful and historic structure worth some attention.  Unfortunately my family and I didn't allot nearly enough time to our visit there so a followup visit someday would be great.  On the northeastern corner of the property (outdoors) is the Old Chicago Stock Exchange Arch (a relocated remnant of a far larger building dating from the 1890s).  This former entrance archway is exquisitely detailed and rises some thirty feet off the ground.  Designed by the renowned architectural firm of Adler & Sullivan, this is one of the most beautiful pieces of architecture I've ever seen in person.  Unfortunately, we couldn't find any informational panels surrounding it but thankfully my dad already had done some background research on it the day before.  There are also some beautiful gardens immediately surrounding the museum buildings for those wanting a break from the artwork within.  Millennium Park and Michigan Avenue are just beyond the grounds.  At twenty-three dollars per person, the ticket price is definitely worth the price of admission.
