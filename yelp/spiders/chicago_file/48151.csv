Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great Sangria, lovely bread. The tapas need to be a little more fresh, whole, and something green would be great. The food was overly prepared.  For example, in the the tortilla espanola, there were cubed potatoes.  I don't understand why. But, I will end with. . . they make their own bread and it is good.
