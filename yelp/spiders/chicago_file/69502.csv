Little Goat Diner////I ordered the Patty Melt, medium. Also pretty disappointing. I would rather of had one from Waffle House. The bread was good, grilled nicely. The meat was under seasoned and shaped like a softball. That it probably why the whole of the inside of it was raw and cold. It had not yet reached "rare" This sucker was still wiggling. The other problem with the shape of the "patty/ball" was that it sat in the center of the bread and you had to take 3 big bites from the side before you ever hit meat. Picture two frisbees with a baseball in the middle. That's what I had. But it was buttered. So... Buttered frisbees.
