The Purple Pig////We ordered the bone marrow, lamb ribs and half duck. The bone marrow just melts in your mouth and goes perfect with the bread and arugula, but it was a bit salty. The lamb ribs come right off of the bone, but was a tad too sweet, so the yogurt on the side helped to bring down the sweetness. Finally, the half duck is a lot of meat! There were some parts of the duck that were a little too dry, and it isn't like Chinese Peking duck. You need that bread to go with it.
