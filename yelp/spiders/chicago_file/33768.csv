Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We enjoyed a fabulous meal while in town for a wedding.  The entire experience was most enjoyable!!!  Honestly, this is one of the best meals we have ever had in any restaurant.  Started with the Caesar Salad with Smoked Salmon......just outrageously delicious!  My husband had a steak and I had the salmon......both fabulous!  Great French fries and sourdough bread which unfortunately left us too full to try one of their great desserts.  Next time for sure.  Service was excellent and the decor is just charming.  A real winner!!!
