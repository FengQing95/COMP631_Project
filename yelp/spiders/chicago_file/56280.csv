Smoque BBQ////Smoque would be a 5 star review if it weren't for the sides.  It's not that the sides weren't good it's just they seemed to be overlooked.  They were super small portions even for the large, and when I think of having a bbq it entails huge ass portions of sides.  I want to be able to get big ass buckets of beans, slaw, etc.   Also I felt having the mac and cheese in the metal ramekins gave it a metallic taste which I did not enjoy.
