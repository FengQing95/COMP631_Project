Art Institute of Chicago////On another note, I would highly recommend renting the audio guide headset for the day. It's only $7 for the general public; it's $5 for members and Art Institute students. We got it for the Picasso exhibit but were able to use it all over the museum. A headphone symbol on placards next to works indicates there is accompanying audio, and you just type in the number in the symbol to listen. Super-easy, and the information for each piece was interesting and informative. Definitely worth the extra fee!
