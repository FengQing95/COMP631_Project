Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We also ordered "The Lou" (spinach, mushrooms and sliced tomatoes with mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese.) and the "The "Malnati Chicago Classic" (lean sausage, vine-ripened tomato sauce on our famous Buttercrust). There were a lot of tomatoes on The Lou, but not enough spinach and mushrooms.
