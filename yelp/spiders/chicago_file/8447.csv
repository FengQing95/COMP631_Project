Art Institute of Chicago////Nearly a decade in the making, the Modern Wing of the Art Institute of Chicago has now opened its doors.  Designed by the Pritzker-Prize winning architect Renzo Piano, the Modern Wing showcases the museum's exemplary collections of 20th & 21st century art, architecture, design, and photography (my favorite).  With this addition, the Modern Wing makes the Art Institute the second largest art museum in the country which was something I didn't know until this event.
