Little Goat Diner////I have gotten bagels and pastries from the bread side a couple of times and only eaten in the restaurant once, so this review is for my limited experiences. The bagels and cream cheese are good, and I really enjoy the unusual flavors.  The bagels themselves are tasty but don't expect a good New York-quality bagel. I have made bagels at home before and these are on par with what I made.  They are time-consuming to make, so thank goodness for bagel places, right?? I really like the everything bagel with green bean cream cheese. The grumpy goat bagel (raisins and cheese) is great with the honey masala cream cheese--a little sweet-salty combo. I've also tried the mushroom butter and it's delicious, but the portion is hefty--so you may want to get it on the side unless you loooove a ton of butter on your bagel!  Scones were tasty, but nothing revolutionary.
