Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We took our drinks down into the 1920's-esque dimly candle light dining room and instantly knew this was going to be a memorable experience.  We were sat in a comfy half circle booth and quickly greeted by John, who happens to be the BEST waiter we've ever had in any establishment (and that's saying a lot).
