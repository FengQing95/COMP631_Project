Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There was a bit of wait, but not bad for accommodating a party of 7 without reservations. Our total was $71, which seems like a lot but for 7 people (and including an appetizer sampler), but when you divide it that many ways this place was actually pretty cheap, especially compared to most other places in the area.
