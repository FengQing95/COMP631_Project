Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As for the food. It was mouth-watering. The steak (aged rib-eye) was cooked perfectly (we shared it), the sides (truffle mac n' cheese and mashed potatoes) complimented each other and the steak, and the appetiser was perfect for two. The corkage fee is so clever and brilliant (bring your own bottle and share a small glass with another patron/ess) that we brought two bottles. And the desserts (chocolate tart and ice cream) put us over the edge directly into food heaven.
