Art Institute of Chicago////We came here in the morning right before it opened. Lots of beautiful art to see. You'll definitely spend over 2.5 hours here. This museum got packed pretty quickly for a Friday morning. Everything is so well organized. There are 3 levels to wander off around and seating for when your feet get tired or if you want to just sit and take in a piece of art. Highly recommend visiting this if you're in Chicago!
