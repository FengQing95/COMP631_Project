Art Institute of Chicago////One thing that I think is worth mentioning is that some of the staff is incredibly rude. I know that, working downtown in a big city in an art museum must be mentally taxing at times, but I just wish they were a bit friendlier. It almost dampens a good experience when the staff is snotty and rude.
