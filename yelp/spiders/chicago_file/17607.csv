Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's always wins in the "best Chicago pizza" debate in my house. They have the most buttery crust and best chunky tomato sauce. I also think it keeps and reheats better than the others. I also appreciate that they offer a lower-fat cheese option (even if it sounds kind of silly, given the amount consumed in a slice!) Anyway, their classics are great, and the spinach is one of my all-time favorites. I also love that you can ship it--which we ordered numerous times when we moved from Chicago for a few years! Yum!!
