Smoque BBQ////overated. It really is. For what Â you're spending at Smoque, you could have a fantastic meal at a restaurant in the city that has a quiet, comfortable atmosphere. Call me crazy but I really don't enjoy spending $40-$50 on a meal for two people just to be crammed between loud talkers at dirty picnic tables. It's just not my thing. When I want to sit at a picnic table, I go camping. The three stars are for the delicious pulled pork. It's fantastic. However, the sides leave something to be desired. They are expensive and the size of a cereal bowl from which The Littles would eat.
