Little Goat Diner////Ordered the breakfast spaghetti this time. Thought it was a very unique combination of noodles, eggs, and clams, but I've gotta say, it just wasn't for me. The broth was a little too salty in my opinion, and I really just regretted not ordering the Bulls Eye French Toast that I was planning on ordering when I went there. I mean overall though, I LOVE this place, but I guess there are just some things on the menu that I'm not the biggest fan of.
