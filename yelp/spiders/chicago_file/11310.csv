Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute Museum is great for all ages, 3 to 93. On the basis of "cool stuff" per square foot, I find it more enjoyable than the Smithsonian Museums. The cafes offer enjoyable food options for families. Makes it not worth exiting the museum to get a meal or snack.
