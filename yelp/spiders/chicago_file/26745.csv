Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Typical pizza joint environment, very nice staff! My boyfriend and I went for lunch and knowing ahead of time it usually takes a deep dish pizza 45 minutes to bake we went early and had a couple beers and the small deep dish serves 2 slices for 2 people, good size for 2 if you don't want leftovers. The pizza wasn't very hot but the flavor was delicious, I however thought the original had a little too much cheese my boyfriend loved the pizza! (If you don't like cheese that much like I do, ask for light cheese) Our server was Brenda F and she did awesome!
