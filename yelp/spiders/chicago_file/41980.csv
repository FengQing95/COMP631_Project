Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My roommates and I go here a couple times a year and have always enjoyed it.  It's typical tapas, so you can find some classic favorites (and the patatas bravas and bacon wrapped dates are as good as expected), as well as some interesting new flavors (I'm a sucker for their shishito peppers).  And you simply can't go without having dessert - they offer really small desserts, so you can get a couple, but the butterscotch pudding is one of the most delicious things I've ever put in my mouth.  Even if you don't think you like butterscotch, it's worth trying it - it came recommended to me and was better than I could have imagined!  Sangria is only ok, but a couple glasses in and you won't mind so much.
