Little Goat Diner////I love Girl and the Goat and was super excited to try the Little Goat. The place is so cute. A nice looking diner with a modern feel. We ordered macho nachos, Asian shrimp salad, goat sloppy joe, and fried pickle sandwich. Nachos took about 15 min to come out, but were delicious. Home made chips, fresh ingredients, yumm. Everything else came out shortly after and was just okay. Pickle sandwich was good, not great. Sloppy joe was a little dry. Asian salad was missing something. It was bland. Will most likely try it again.
