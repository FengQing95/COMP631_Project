Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It was just ok.  Some of the best sangria around, but I somewhat remember it being expensive $9-10 a glass - you'd be better going with friends and getting a pitcher.  The food was great.  Me and my lady got a bunch of tapas to share and the steak on a skewer.  That steak was a little more expensive, but well worth it.  I think I dropped about $80 for two of us.  Overall not too bad.
