Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The menu has serving suggestions for the different sizes, and though there were two of us we picked the medium (serves three) because my boyfriend wanted leftovers. I am here to tell you that you do not need to size up to leave with extra pizza. Despite being ravenous when we walked in, I was only able to take down a slice and a half and my boyfriend two and a half. Even a small would have left us with extra slices.
