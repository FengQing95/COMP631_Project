Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Fabulous Chicago-style, deep-dish pizza! Went for the special, and wasn't disappointed. Ordered a medium, which was too big for two people. On the positive, I brought the leftovers home the next day to bring a taste of Chicago down south to family! Could highly recommend for a tasty pizza!
