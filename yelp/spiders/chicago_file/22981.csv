Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had a spinach pie and the famous pie. Both were good. The spinach pie was lighter than expected, which was great considering the heaviness of the sausage pie. The butter crust is definitely worth it, it adds so much more flavor and grease. You do not come here expecting a healthy meal.
