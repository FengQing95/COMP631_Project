Art Institute of Chicago////I didn't expect the Art Institute to be as impressive as it was. I've been to several prestigious art museums around the world, and the Art Institute of Chicago stands up to them, if not EXCEEDS them. While museums like the Louvre certainly boast larger collections, the Art Institute has so many renowned pieces. Also, the staff here, both paid and volunteer, are so friendly and willing to guide you to your destination. Kind docents, beautiful art, great collection. Check out the miniature rooms collection and the paper weights collection!! Of course, don't forget the 18th-19th century European paintings. Truly full of gems!
