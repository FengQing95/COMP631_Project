Smoque BBQ////Chicago isn't a place particularly known for BBQ but with a record like the one it has on Yelp it was a must try. I have high expectations for BBQ joints. No, I'm not from the South and won't harp on authentic this or non authentic that. I just love meat and BBQ so much that I would go broke going out to eat it all the time. So instead I make the time to make it myself hours at a time in my own smoker. I know how much care and time it takes to do this. It can't be rushed, and mistakes covered with sauce will be wet messy mistakes indeed.
