Little Goat Diner////For the most part, the food is very sub-par.  The food seems very unbalanced and each dish is either too rich, lacks in seasoning, or is just not good.  I'm really disappointed that this place is associated with Girl & the Goat - which is out of this world- I feel like this is the red headed step child. If you can't afford Girl & the Goat, or you just don't want to wait to get in, DO NOT think this is anything like it... it's just not.
