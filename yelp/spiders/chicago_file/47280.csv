Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went on a weeknight, I believe it was a Wednesday night.  Half off on bottles of wine! Bonus.  Food was excellent and not terribly expensive for tapas.  Everything we ordered was tasty.  Had the roasted peppers, sweet potato, potato salad, scallops, octopus, paella, a cheese platter and flan to end the meal! Service was also very good.  They accomodated our seatin request and made great suggestions on wine and food.
