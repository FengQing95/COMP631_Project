Smoque BBQ////When I got home and ate my meal, it was all I could have asked for, and more. The meat was perfectly tender. If you want sauce on your brisket you'll have to pour it on, because it's too tender to dip. The slow-cooked brisket tasted similar to that my grandma used to make. I really enjoyed it. I tried a piece of the pulled pork sandwich, and it, too, was really tasty. I like that they put the sauce on the side. I'm a dipper, I love sauces, but the meat is just as delicious without it. The entree also came with a side of slaw which is vinegar based and made with fresh cabbage.
