The Purple Pig////Service was great! We also ordered a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon that went well with our plates. Everything was so inexpensive which I'm not use to because a dinner like this in Los Angeles would be so much more. Extremely satisfied with this place and highly recommend it as well!!!
