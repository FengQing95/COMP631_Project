Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Made a reservation at the recommendation of a good friend and the restaurant did not disappoint. The candlelit ambiance was complemented by the good music playing in the background. Service was attentive, cocktails were yummy, wine selection was good, and the food was mouthwatering. Highly recommend. We had the steak, mashed potatoes, oysters, and the bread...all tasty
