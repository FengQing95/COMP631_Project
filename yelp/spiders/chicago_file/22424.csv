Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So all Chicagoans swear by this place. I think it's awful - but I've only lived here for a year, so I guess it takes multiple horrid winters to make you love this strange sort of cheese soup the locals call pizza. The wait is super long, this place is vastly overhyped. Portions are huge. Maybe it's better delivered?.. not coming back here, even if out of town guests want to try deep dish pizza.
