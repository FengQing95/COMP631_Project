Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Just had a fabulous friend who recently re-located to Chicago send my friend and I in Orlando two pizzas from Lou's! We broke into the veggie pizza yesterday (even though I have not had bread products in 2 weeks) and went to town. I have only had one Chicago pizza experience prior but I have no idea where it was from.
