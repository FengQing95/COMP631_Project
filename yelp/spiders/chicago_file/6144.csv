The Purple Pig////Fantastic experience!! Wish we could have eaten more than we did but were absolutely stuffed. Enjoyed the bone marrow, ahi tuna tartar and the beets! Everything was out of this world. Just wish we had more space to try the pastas and perhaps some dessert :( Service was nice and the ambiance was wonderful. Definitely recommend making a reso outside of peak timings!
