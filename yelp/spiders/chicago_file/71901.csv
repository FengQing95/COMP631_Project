Little Goat Diner////Fun spot - fun menu - great staff.  We went with a big group (12?) - they handled the situation really well.  Good beer selection, crab dip to start (good, not great), I had the Goat Almighty burger - awesomely large, but tasty.  I finished most of it! All the dishes around the table were a hit - chicken pot pie, omelet, etc.  We shared a peach pie/cobbler. Very good.  Pricing was reasonable.
