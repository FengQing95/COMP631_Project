Little Goat Diner////While it was a nice brunch/lunch, I can't justify spending $40 on 2 people unless it was some special occasion. Thus, minus 1 star for value. If you're from out of town, the streets are kind of strange there and parking is probably 1/2 a block down where they have the pay-to-park stations. I'd probably come back in the future, just that there are so many other unique breakfast options in Chi town I've got to try before stumbling back here again.
