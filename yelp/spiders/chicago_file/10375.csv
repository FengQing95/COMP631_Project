Art Institute of Chicago////With our 1200+ reviews already, it would be hard for me to add something unique, but indeed that is how I would describe in one word this place. For any visitor to Chicago - I would recommend this as a "must visit" spot. Very majestic entrance, tons of interesting art from all over, very knowledgeable and helpful staff, two cafeterias inside for convenience plus a nice sit down dining just outside. Lovely gift shop. A little garden outside to enjoy during the warmer months. One should avail of the "FastPass" or the combined city card. Rated by many, as one of the best museums in the world.
