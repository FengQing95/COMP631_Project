Little Goat Diner////For a while I seriously doubted the hype because I had only eaten here in passing on a day I wasn't ready to drop a lot of money on food - so I ended up having just a little cup of the tomato apple soup and then, to be funny, split a glass of chocolate goat milk with my friend - we thought it was funny and in retrospect, really it wasn't that funny, except that I usually don't drink milk and only wanted it "because it came from a goat." My stomach certainly didn't find it funny.
