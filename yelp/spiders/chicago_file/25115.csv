Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////But after all of that it was just okay. She's had better gluten free and I've had better deep dish even in Toronto. Mine looked great and was more than acceptable but just wasn't as doughy, as savory, as buttery and as cheesy awesome as I was expecting. I don't know why, I really don't. It was fine and it was pizza and I still liked it but I felt a bit let down. When the salad is the best part of the meal, there's something not quite right. So on our next trip we probably won't be back to Lou's, given the vast array of other choices. Still, like I said it WAS pizza...and there's rarely ever anything wrong with pizza in my book.
