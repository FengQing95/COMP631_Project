Little Goat Diner////Pretty good but expensive.  For example, my second time around, I asked for a small glass so that I could pour milk that I brought for my son.  Instead, he brought out a tiny glass of milk.  Tiny as in 3 inches tall tiny.  I figured I'd just pay for it.  Bill came and that tiny milk was $3.75!  With tax and tip, that's $5.  Crazy for about 3 gulps of milk.  I had a coffee and two entrees between my wife and I with a side of fruit.  Total with tax and tip was close to $60.  Pretty pricey for brunch but like I said, it's pretty good.
