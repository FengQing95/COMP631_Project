Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I tried the marinated olives, spicy potatoes, endive salad w/walnuts & gorgonzola, grilled calamari, seared salmon and dates wrapped in bacon.  The plates here were much bigger than what I am used to at tapas places in the Philly area (which is why I ordered 6-- had I known how large they are here, I probably would have ordered 3 or 4.)  I also had 3 glasses of sangria, 2 red and 1 white.
