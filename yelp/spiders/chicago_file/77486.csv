Little Goat Diner////We were getting hungry late on a Friday night and took a stroll down to the West Loop to find some good late night eats. After finding out Grange Hall's kitchen was closed we just took a shot at Little Goat. Usually when passing by Little Goat I've come to just assume the wait is longer than I'm willing to deal with, but surprisingly we were seated immediately. I guess 11PM is a sweet spot.
