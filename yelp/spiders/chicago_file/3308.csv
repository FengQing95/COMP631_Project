The Purple Pig////Bone marrows - the size of my forearm. Surprisingly flavorless. I sprinkled the entire cup of sea salt paired with the dish, yet still found it very bland. The grilled toasts however were da bomb. Spreading the bone marrow onto the toast seemed unnecessary.. Maybe I should order more toasts.
