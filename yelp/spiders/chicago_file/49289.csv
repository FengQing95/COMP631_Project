Smoque BBQ////The food is the main attraction of course and when I went to Smoque I had the BBQ Rib Combo. I wanted to try both the baby backs and the St. louis ribs. The St. Louis style ribs are much better, some how more tender and definitely more flavorful. Full of smoke and pork flavor and deliciously meaty (they're not too thin but thinner than the baby backs for sure). I was very happy with the baby backs as well due to the real smoke flavor however if you are deciding between the two, save yourself the trouble and get a full slab of St. Louis ribs. I will note however, that both ribs were a bit dry on the edges. I attribute this to the inconsistencies of BBQ smoking. This is not an easy thing to avoid when you are cranking out many racks of ribs a day so I let it slide (especially since this may be the most faithful BBQ representation in the area). However as time goes on I expect this to get better.
