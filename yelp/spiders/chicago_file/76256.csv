Little Goat Diner////We got the French toast which included a sunny side up egg inside, sprinkled with syrup and strawberries on top. It was a unique combo, but tasted delicious. We also had the hash browns with cheese. They were kinda burnt but I think this was intentional. Unexpectedly, they were still yummy. Since the portions were pretty large, I shared with one other person and still left stuffed. Other than the food, this place has the typical diner feel because of the seating and decorating. All of the staff is super friendly and warm. Â It also has a ridiculously long wait so be sure to make a reservation for brunch. It gets super packed!
