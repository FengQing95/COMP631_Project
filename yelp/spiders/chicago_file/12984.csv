Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Yelpers were right! This place is awesome! My hubby, Martin, has had deep dish in the past yet always favored the thin crust NY style pizza, and he is now a fan! What more can I say? Just read the previous reviews! It's all true! The crust is fabulous! We had the ChicagoClassic! Perfect Post-Marathon celebration food!
