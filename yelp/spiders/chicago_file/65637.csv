Smoque BBQ////Food- I went with the Brisket, because if the brisket is good mostly everything else is as well. What I appreciated most was lean cuts of meat that are very tender. Combined with a soft bun it reminded me of one of my favorite BBQ places in Georgia. Â Last but not least the hand cut fries completed the meal.
