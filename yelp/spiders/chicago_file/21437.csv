Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My husband and I were in Chicago last week. It was his first time in Chicago and he wanted some authentic deep dish pizza. I'd had Lou Malnati's before on a prior trip so brought him there. We shared The Malnati Chicago Classic which has lean sausage, extra cheese, tomato sauce, and crispy crust. We added mushrooms. He said it was the best pizza he's had in his life and it lived up to what I remembered from before. We ordered a bigger pizza so we'd have a couple pieces leftover and they held up well until the next day and the crust didn't become soggy overnight which was nice! Great pizza!!
