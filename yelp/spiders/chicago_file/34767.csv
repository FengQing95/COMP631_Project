Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The next real highlight of the meal was the side of elote-style corn, which I highly recommend getting as a side no matter what you order at Bavette's.  It's bathed in a cream sauce with an  interesting mix of chili powder and lime, giving it a nice spicy-sour taste with hints of parmesan.
