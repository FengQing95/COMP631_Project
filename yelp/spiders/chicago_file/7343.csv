Art Institute of Chicago////They also did a terrific job laying out the new exhibits.  The architecture and design section had many interesting pieces by most of the leading architects of the past century.  I particularly enjoyed the contemporary art section.  Many of the rooms are specific to a single artist, and each room has a lengthy description on the wall about who the artist is, what they set out to accomplish, and how.  This is critical for an untrained museum-goer to appreciate what can be quite challenging pieces of art.  Rather than go for the widest range of art pieces, they focused on 10 or so artists, which I think really increased the impact of the exhibit.  Also the European section was really impressive, with many pieces from big names like Picasso, Leger, Magritte, and Matisse.
