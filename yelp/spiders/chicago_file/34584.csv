Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Oh crap, I almost forgot about the bread.  Best bread and butter I recall having at a restaurant in the city.  Obviously not the focal point of the meal, but my gf did comment after her first bite that, if the bread was any indication, we were in for a great meal.  It was and we were.
