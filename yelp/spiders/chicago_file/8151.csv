Art Institute of Chicago////I love museums and I've said that many times before, but even if you are an art lover or have little understanding about art I think you will find something you love about this place too.  The building itself is a treasure built in 1893 and houses some of the most beautiful and impressive pieces.  The new exhibits are also thought provoking and beautifully displayed.
