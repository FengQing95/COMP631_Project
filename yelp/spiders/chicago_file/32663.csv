Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was pretty good but service was off. My husband enjoyed his fried chicken and I liked my steak, which I got with the bone marrow. I asked for a bit of bread so I could eat some of the marrow separately, but the server kept insisting that the marrow was supposed to be eaten only with the steak. He eventually brought me some bread but the damage was done and I was left with the distinct feeling that my server thought I was some hillbilly (I'm not, but even if I was, why does this matter to him)?  The service issues continued after we paid and started to leave. The server actually ran after us, and asked us in front of a number of patrons where our bill was, since it was not on the table. The implication, I guess, was that we had taken the bill with us and tried to dine and dash. In fact, a busser had picked up our signed bill with tip immediately after we had gotten up without informing the server.  This happened a few months ago, so perhaps service has improved or we just chanced upon a bad server.  But we haven't thought about going back so far.
