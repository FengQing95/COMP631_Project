Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////With only 2 days in Chicago, we wanted to try at least a Deep Dish Pizza and the Chicago hot dog. Yelp gave rave ratings of this pizza joint which is a chain with many locations in the Chicago area. Having just finished dinner, we opted for a 6-inch individual classic (just to try) and waited out the standard 30 minutes because the pizza was being made from scratch. It feels like a homey pizza shop even though it's a chain, it definitely contrasts against the Papa Johns or Pizza Huts where its mainly a carry-out only place. The pizza was good, buttery crust and bottom.
