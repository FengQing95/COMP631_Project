Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First off, deep dish pizza was never appealing to me.  Lou Malnati's is know for their Chicago style deep dish pizza.  We ordered a Large size deep dish that feeds about 4-5 people with 8 slices.  I could only eat 1 slice since I am not a fan of deep dish or sausage, which was the main topping.  We also added pepperoni which was and add on.  I felt the pizza was to cheesey and it wasn't like melted cheese it seems a bit hard.  The crunch of the crust was really good.  To be honest I don't even remember how the pizza had tasted.
