Little Goat Diner////This place is a cute breakfast spot but it is so noisy! I felt like I had to scream out every time I had to say something. I came here on a Saturday afternoon and it was about a 10 minute wait. Not bad! There were a lot of people waiting too. Found this place on yelp and decided to try due to its highly rated reviews.
