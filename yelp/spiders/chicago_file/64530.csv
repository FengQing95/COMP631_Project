Smoque BBQ////After reading several reviews, I was prepared for a long line and wait. And while I didn't relish the idea of waiting outside on the street in Chicago in January, for good BBQ it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. Turned out I had nothing to worry about. We walked in placed our order and than were sat almost immediately. About 15 minutes later, a line formed but even then people didn't seem to have an issue waiting a few minutes for a spot.
