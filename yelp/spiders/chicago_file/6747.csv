Art Institute of Chicago////Well, let's see.  Long lines to buy a ticket.  Long lines to check in your coat.  Security staff that appears to target White people.  And let's not talk about the bookstore.  My eye just happened to catch a book entitled Edwardian Opulence on the sales shelf (several copies, in fact) - now, I had just purchased it for near full price at another location as a gift.  An argument ensues with the barely literate cashier (who obviously wasn't hired on her merit)  who claimed the shelf wasn't a sale shelf.  I pulled every other book on the book case and each and every other book in the case was a sales book.  She almost reminded me of Mrs Tsaraev when she finally conceded that I was correct.  The $75.00 books were tucked away there because of an alleged lack of shelf space in the store.  Oh, she would attend to it though.  Five days later, at the end of my trip, there they were, on the sales shelf.  Same cashier too, who was laboriously trying to look up a title for a customer.  When she saw me, her eyes opened wide and she disappeared.  I think they have a new kid manager - the old folks are incensed and have an attitude and the new kids are obviously lacking discipline.  And if this is his hiring credo, then I couldn't ask for a better example of poor Chicago-styled management.  Anything related to patron services is a nightmare of petty mismanagement - and all for a magnificent entry fee which I will not pay again.
