Little Goat Diner////I have a group of girlfriends from college, with whom i participated on the mock trial team (shut up, I've embraced the nerditude) with whom I have brunch every few months. They're both still living in the city and far more city-savvy than I am, and for our last brunch, one of them insisted on Little Goat Diner. The other gal is celiac and saw they had a gluten free menu, and I had been dying to try one of Stephanie Izard's restaurants for ages, so we were all on board. I made a reservation for 9AM last Saturday morning and waited in eager anticipation of an amazing brunch.
