Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////EXCELLENT DEEP DISH! The setup was somewhat awkward when we walked in. It was a busy Friday night so we had to give our name to the hostess (who was not clearly identified) and then place our order at the counter before being seated. I realize this is necessary because deep dish pizza takes a while to cook and it's pointless to hold up a table with a long wait time. I just wish the system was directed better. We were seated within 40 minutes and served our pizza within 15 minutes of being seated. This place is touristy, but it's so yummy and a must when in Chicago! Order a small sausage deep dish for 2, but if VERY hungry order a medium! Great spot!
