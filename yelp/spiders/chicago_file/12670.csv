Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Excellent Chicago deep dish pizza but be prepared to wait 45 - 60 minutes on the weekend. There isn't much waiting so people are bumping in to you while you wait. They give you samples to hold you over so that helps. I like the classic with a Goose Island Matilda. I suggest sitting in the front or outside (weather permitting) since the back room can get quite noisy.
