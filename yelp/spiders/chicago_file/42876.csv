Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Delicious! For four adults, we ordered two different single bites (pintxos) per person, 8 tapas, and 2 portions of paella, and it was more than enough for us (had to pack up some of it)! Dishes came out one by one, in quick fashion. A new dish would come right when we just finished the previous one, which kept our taste buds active and our table uncluttered. Old plates were cleared quickly and there was a stack of clean tapas plates already on our table, so we could replenish them as needed. My faves were the deviled egg, garlic shrimp, short ribs and mashed potatoes, and spicy potatoes. I thought the paella could have been better. It was tasty, but the rice was a tad undercooked for my taste. We had to pack the rest of the paella up, and I thought it tasted better post-fact. The service was spot on, and the atmosphere was lively, warm and rustic. Would definitely come here again!
