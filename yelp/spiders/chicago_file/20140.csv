Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was a sweet place for my first venture into Chicago-style pizza in Chicago.  The wait wasn't terrible for a Thursday night and the salad and pizza was awesome.  I'd give them a five but the bar service was a bit off (and packed).  I think I was shorted $5 from the bar on a beer I got when we were waiting then one of the Goose Island IPAs tasted like a Miller lite.  I don't think either was intentional, the place was just slammed with business.
