Art Institute of Chicago////We wanted to check out the Obama Portraits, so we signed up for a spot on mobile. We were 200th in line or something, so we killed time by checking out everything. I wouldn't say I'm too much of an art museum person, but I did appreciate walking through the different galleries. It felt like time moved so quickly, because then my friend received a text message that we could now get in line for the Obama Portraits! I highly recommend checking them out while they're still there.
