The Purple Pig////Octopus with green beans, fingerling potatoes & salsa verde: The most tender octopus I've had. Seriously!!! Now I keep like I've been ripped off at other restaurants when they claimed their octopus was tender. The salsa verde was a bit oily but it went well with the green beans and potatoes.
