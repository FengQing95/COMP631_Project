Smoque BBQ////As I was walking home Wednesday morning hammered (cubs game, plus lots of post game drinking). I decided that I was probably going to be hung over when I woke up.  Perfect hangover food is bbq.  Food from this place is as perfect as it gets when you have a hangover.   Writing this review is making my eyes mist up.  I miss this place already.
