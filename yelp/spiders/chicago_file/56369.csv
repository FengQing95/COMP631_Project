Smoque BBQ////I would not recommend the brisket as it was dried out.  On my barbeque adventure through the Midwest, we have to admit that Smoque wasn't high on our list of places to check out.  But it fared pretty well when it compared to the best of St. Louis and Kansas City, which are towns that take pride in their BBQ.
