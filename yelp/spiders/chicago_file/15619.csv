Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My first experience with authentic chicago deep dish pizza.  I'm from CA so a good pizza is hard to find.  Our table consisted of 4 adults and 2 toddlers.  We ordered "The Lou" and "The Malnati Chicago Classic".  We ordered both LARGE sizes for both pizzas.  That was a bad idea! haha these pizzas are thick.  The Malnati Chicago Classic was the better pizza to me.  The sausage on top and tomato sauce was great.  The crust and rest of the pizza was really hard.  So hard that one of my friends cousins sitting at another table chipped the crown on her tooth and needed to see  a dentist the very next day!  The pizza was good but not as good as I expected.
