Little Goat Diner////Everything we tried from the menu (which we all split because we couldn't decide on just one thing), was amazing, and the service was great! We had the best time with our service (JP? I wish I remembered his name, because he rocked). After brunch we checked out the great rooftop bar, where the adorable spinning goat overlooked us sipping on our cocktails! Super cute place, with great food, service, and prices. Go here immediately!
