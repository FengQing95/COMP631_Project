Smoque BBQ////After my girlfriend saw Smoque on DDD, we basically craved ribs for the whole of last week. We eventually made it to Smoque on Friday, and I have to say I was a bit disappointed. We ended up getting the St. Louis ribs and also a separate order of brisket. Maybe it's what I like about ribs, but I found the ribs to be slightly dry, and the brisket a bit too tough. Maybe I'm just being harsh, but I like my ribs to fall off the bone. The sides were similarly disappointing. The mac n' cheese and slaw was blah and the cornbread similarly dry. The only good thing was probably the beans which were quite delicious. I also tasted some of the fries which I loved but only wish I ordered. The service was quick and friendly, it's only too bad that there are so many people I feel like I have to leave right after eating. Overall, it was a good experience, but nothing to brag about.
