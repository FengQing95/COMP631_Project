Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I ordered a special they were having which was a chicken pot pie that rested on top of fluffy mashed potatoes with savory sauce. I grew up eating chicken pot pies and this one exceeded my expectations. If this is available, order it!! The only complaint I have is that it desperately needed salt. My fianc√© ordered a steak which he really enjoyed. But I ended up having to use the herbed salt they provided for him on his plate for my pot pie.
