Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now, whenever I think of Chicago, I think of Lou Maltani's pizza. I was a doubter before, and I'm deeply sorry for that. I still don't think if the NYC vs. Chicago pizza debate will be settled, but one thing I do know for certain is that this pizza was AMAZING! I can't wait to be back!
