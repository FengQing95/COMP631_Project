Little Goat Diner////Today we got the crispy chicken sandy, whitefish tostadas and hash browns. Everything is crazy good (I didn't even have to ask for condiments with the sandy) but the HASHBROWNS are the best hashbrowns ever made, mayb. They are v stringy and cooked with some kind of mystery goat cheese that cooks down to make them both crispy and gooey, but you can't see it! Which is why I call it mystery cheese. Just try them they're great. And the butterscotch root beer float, obv.
