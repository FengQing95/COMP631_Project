Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////In the words of yelp "I'm a fan." I dined here last night with a group of four and it was a good experience overall. The menu is easy to navigate for first time guests, with options for those who want to play it safe as well as those with a more adventurous palate. Â Over all the food was pretty good and the service was okay.
