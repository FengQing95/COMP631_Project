Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I walked into Malnati's after the marathon and found a seat at the Bar and Lamar helped me choose the best pizza on the menu. Â Since it was just me I wasn't sure if the personal size pizza would do deep dish justice and Lamar guided me to go with a small size to get a true feeling for the pie, plus I could have left overs and make all the passengers on my flight jealous.
