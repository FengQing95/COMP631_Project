Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Now, the bad:  I have been to a ton of Lettuce Entertain You restaurants - anyone that lives in Chicago would be hard pressed to avoid them - and I am a huge fan.  One of the things I love about LEY restaurants is that even when the food isn't great, the service (in my experience) is almost always first rate.  I had one bad experience at Brasserie Jo, but everything else has been terrific.  Not Ba-Ba-Reeba.  At least not last Saturday.  We arrived at the restaurant twenty five minutes early, so I expected them to send us to the bar.  Instead, hostess number one asks us to "step around the corner".  We step around the corner, wait five minutes, and then hostess number two - with considerable attitude tells us that we will need to wait at the bar because we are too early.  Blah, don't need that attitude... but thanks.  So, we get to the bar... I order two glasses of red sangria - $13.  Seems steep, but ok.  I give the guy $15.  We then are called to our table by hostess number three (more attitude), and shown to a table on the patio.  We sit down, open the menus, and look at the drink list - red sangria is $5.50 a glass.  I wasn't overly impressed.  Then, our server arrives.  She doesn't appear to be interested in letting us experience the leisurely pace of dining that one would normally associate with an evening eating tapas, for when we place an order for two tapas she asks "Is that all?".   Our first tapas come, and we place an order for a spinach salad and paella. By now our sangria glasses are empty.  I certainly need another drink, but flagging her down proves to be a chore.  When we finally get her attention we order a half pitcher of red sangria.  Several minutes later (shortly before the salad tapas dish arrives) our "half" pitcher of sangria arrives.  When we finish the meal the bill tells the story -  she had brought a full pitcher.  Being overcharged for drinks isn't a big deal - we are only talking $8 total - but the constant attitude from the waitstaff and the complete indifference to our experience in the restaurant was really frustrating.    I am sure that we will go back to Ba-Ba-Reeba because we really do love the tapas and the sangria; hopefully the service will be back up to LEY 's high standards.
