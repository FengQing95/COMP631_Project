Smoque BBQ////They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.
