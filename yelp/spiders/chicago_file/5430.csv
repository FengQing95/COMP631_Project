The Purple Pig////We had the most scrumptious bites of gnocchi filled with cheese. Idk if we were biased bc we were starving and it was first warm bite of food, but I could have eaten a whole bowl of those bites. We then ordered two entrees, the esteemed milk braised pork shoulder and the tasty pork belly entree (forgot the name of it.. not the taste though!) and finished it all off with some of the best cheesecake I've ever had. Words cannot do the flavors justice, you'll just have to eat them for yourselves to find out the magic!
