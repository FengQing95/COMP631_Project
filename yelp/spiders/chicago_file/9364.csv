Art Institute of Chicago////Came here on a Monday with a friend to check out this new wing.  While neither of us are much for modernism, I did appreciate the addition of the new wing.  The architecture of the building itself is lovely--open, airy, light, a perfect canvas for the art within.  I also enjoyed some of the photography exhibits and the architecture gallery.
