Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After trying Giordanos & Lou Malnati's....I have to say that I prefer this one better. There is just something about that crust! There was a long wait when we came there so we placed an order for take out which took 40 min to be ready. I think you have to try it for yourself and decide. I still prefer my NYC thin crust.
