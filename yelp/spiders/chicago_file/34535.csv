Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Mocktail Report: On my most recent visit a very friendly female bartender made me an amazing drink of muddled citrus, grapefruit juice, ginger beer and crushed ice, topped with a mint sprig. It was beautiful and amazing. I also loved that the bartender took the time to make me something special and then describe what she had done. It felt very personal.
