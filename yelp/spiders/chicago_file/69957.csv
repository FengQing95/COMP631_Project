Little Goat Diner////I left this place really dissatisfied after having had the Goat Almighty 'burger'. I'm curious to know if anyone else had the same off-putting taste I had after having tried this burger. There was just something off about the taste and the only way to describe the flavor is 'chemically altered'. Why does this burger have to be so complicated to begin with? A simple burger, cooked perfectly with the best ingredients would be miles ahead of the zombie like goat almighty burger. No human is going to try and eat this thing with both hands at once so the only option is to take everything apart and eat the ingredients individually. Why would you add those onion ring ontop? Just put them on the side and focus on patty, cheese, bun and veg. There were way too many things going on and was especially ruined by the grey, sickened looking, chewy as sin, 'braised beef' that was slopped on top of the goat patty. Â This burger contains "goat burger, braised beef, yucatan pork, pickled jalapenos, piri piri, onion rings and cheddar." No sides come with this burger either and at a cost of $20, I'd advise you to save your cash and skip this one.
