Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When in Chicago... had to try the deep dish. Different but good. Butter crust was thin and crunchy biscuit dough style. Pleasantly surprised the deep dish crust was Thin and crunchy and not thick with doughy bread. Got giardiniera added to Lous pie and no complaints. Worth a try.
