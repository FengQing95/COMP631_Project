Little Goat Diner////My note on a perfect brunch:  Start with a spicy Bloody Mary and wait happily for their fantastic Shrimp & Cheesy Grits.  If shrimp or grits aren't your thing, adventure into what is otherwise known as "Yum" and formally called Okonomiyaki.  If I told you what it was, it wouldn't be an adventure and it is one well worth taking!
