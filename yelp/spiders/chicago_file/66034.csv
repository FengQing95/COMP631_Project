Smoque BBQ////We have ordered carry out from here several times and it is seriously delicious in every way!  Last night I got the half chicken, Mac and cheese, slaw, chili and a corn muffin and I ate it all.  The chicken melts in your mouth, is moist, perfectly seasoned and smoked.  They give a sauce but it doesn't even need it, but the sauce is outstanding.  The Mac and cheese was the baked kind but was still creamy without the clumping that sometimes happens when it is baked to long or dried out.  The slaw was excellent with a nice kick of vinegar and spice and the corn muffin was really really awesome, nice and moist and a good density.  Such an amazing, solid meal with really good consistency every single time!  Amazing!
