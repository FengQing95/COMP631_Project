Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I really enjoyed the ambiance and decor, though. Despite the fact that it was 10 am and super bright outside, it was on the dimmer side inside the restaurant with strings of lights strung up in the ceiling so it felt very quaint and intimate despite the larger space. I can see this being a great date spot.
