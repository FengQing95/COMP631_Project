Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So, again, its good, but its not pizza.  This is what you get if your pizza was bloated, or perhaps if your pizza was allergic to bees and got stung, or nuts and was served with sausage cooked in peanut oil.  It deserves its own name and its own category.  But please, for the love of all that is good and holy in the world, stop calling it pizza and stop comparing it to NY.
