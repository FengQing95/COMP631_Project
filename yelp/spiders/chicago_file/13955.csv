Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What an experience! The deep dish pizza was one of the best pizza I have eatten. The toping is very fresh & juicy. Spicy buffallo wings is also very yummy & juicy. We end our meal with the choc chips pizza.. It's warm with icecream & fresh cream topping. Definitely worth coming back for.
