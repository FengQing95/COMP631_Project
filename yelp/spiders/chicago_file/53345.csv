Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went as a family to celebrate the last day of Christmas break. My family and I loved the food and atmosphere. The waiter was great and was very attentive with us. He even noticed I was given the wrong drink before I even realized it. Great place, great food!! We will visit again!!
