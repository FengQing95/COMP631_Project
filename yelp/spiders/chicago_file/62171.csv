Smoque BBQ////The staff here is nice, but the lines are long. They work at a breakneck speed, but it's a popular place and there isn't any room to stand to wait for your order. Menu choices are few, and the price is high. All in all, I would recommend it. For those that travel from other cities to try this, are you crazy? It's good if you're in the neighborhood.
