The Purple Pig////This might've been my favorite meal I had in Chicago, and it was totally spur of the moment (my favorite)! I really can't recommend this place more, even the service was top notch. During the time my friend was catching his breath outside from the richness of the marrow and pork shoulder, a server came by and refolded his napkin perfectly. The little things definitely still matter!
