Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For dessert, our Yelp check-in gave us two complimentary on the house. We went for the Banana and Ice Cream, as well as their Flan. Both dishes brought us down back to earth from a very tasty meal. Note that the banana is covered with nuts so be aware for those that have any nut allergies.
