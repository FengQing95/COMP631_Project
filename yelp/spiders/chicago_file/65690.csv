Smoque BBQ////We decided to go with a full rack of baby back ribs and pulled pork. The ribs were cooked to perfection. Im mad i didn't get a full rack of ribs just for myself it was so-amazing. The pulled pork was also good, but no comparisons to the ribs. A full rack comes with coleslaw and 2 sides. We went with the baked beans with burnt ends, which i had much better, but was still good and a side of fries.
