Art Institute of Chicago////The problem is that it's impossible to find your way around.  Even getting out can be tricky, depending on what wing you're in.  The maps in the visitor guide do not particularly help.  The staff - security guards?  docents?  I don't know - try to help, but giving directions around the place is so complicated that it's hard to understand where and why to go.
