Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I think I ordered some garlic bread as an appetizer. The garlic bread was incredible and left me almost. I room for my pizza. I ordered a plain cheese personal deep dish. I was able to take it back to my hotel and finish it there. It was definitely very rich and well made. It had a lot of cheese so I don't think that there is a need to order extra cheese.
