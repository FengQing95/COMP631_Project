Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Chicago Cut was my favorite steak until I had the 16 oz. bone-in filet at Bavette's.  Coupled with the garlic mashed potatoes and butternut squash sides, you easily have the best meal in the entire city of Chicago.  Calling it phenomenal was an understatement.  Can't wait to go back here again...just make your reservations a month or so in advance.  Tough to get in to .
