Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Waiting for about 10 minutes we were brought our first item, Lou's Bruschetta with fresh chopped tomato and basil tossed with olive oil and served with homemade garlic toast.  Excellent and crisp Italian toast with a mild although notably clean tasting olive oil and subtle use of garlic was matched well by the impressively fresh tomatoes and aromatic basil.  While it wasn't listed, I detected a bit of rosemary in the dish that added additional complexity.  At less than $5 the portion was generous and the quality excellent.
