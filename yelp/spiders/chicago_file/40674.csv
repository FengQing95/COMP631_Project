Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is one of my top ten places to go in Chicago. I have not had a tapas plate there yet that I have not enjoyed. My favorites on the menu are the baked goat cheese, scallops, and patatas bravas. They make a pretty tasty beef empanada too. I ALWAYS order their sangria, but have to admit that the red is better than the white, and if I'm in the mood for a sweeter one, I'll go with the passion fruit sangria. The bulls eye desserts during the summer are amazing... Yes, it can be loud in there and sometimes my voice is a little scratchy after dinner from it, and yes, you always need to make a reservation, but doesn't that show how much people enjoy going there?! It's always busy, but rightfully so with such tasty food. Â One of these days I'll get there to watch the flamenco dancers...
