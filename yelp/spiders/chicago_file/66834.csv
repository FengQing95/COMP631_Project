Little Goat Diner////After an hour wait, my fiancee and I were ready to try this infamous eatery. We ordered the Korean burger and the bull's eye french toast. The waitress recommended that we order medium for the burger -- which we did. Unfortunately, it was well done instead. The sauce on the burger was good however we did not like the cabbage. Overall, the burger was very messy to eat and did not live up to our expectations.
