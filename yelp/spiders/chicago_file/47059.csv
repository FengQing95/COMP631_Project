Smoque BBQ////This review is not food based but for their customer service.  A few months back, I turned the office onto Smoque and we regularly place pickup orders.  This past week we ordered lunch, when I got back to the office I put all the orders together and noticed we were short 4 coleslaw's.  No big deal but my boss said to call and let them know for the next time we did.  So being a good little worker I called and talked to a gentlemen who took my order and informed him of the situation.  He apologized and said he'd credit my debit card (the whole $4 bucks) and send me a gift card for the omission.  2 days later I open up my mail and see that Smoque sent me a $25 gift card!!  Just wanted to say thanks and that you have a customer for life!!
