Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I had requested to be on the waitlist through Yelp so I would not have to wait to get a table as I had a flight to catch. Really wanted to try this place since I came to visit Chicago based on the Yelp reviews. Although Yelp told me my table was ready I still had to wait the normal wait time at the restaurant. Are you serious! What was the point of requesting a table in the first place. Regardless, I let that go. During the wait I decided to go use the restroom and during that time my table was called. The waitress started leading my husband and I outside although I had SPECIFICALLY made sure to request a table inside. When I asked why I was being seating outside, they said that I was not present when the table was called inside (this literally all happened between the five mins). I told them I was using the restroom and she basically said "we don't care." They did not ask if we were ok with being seated outside and just decided to give us the table outside. They could have given the outside table to the people that took our table inside. No apologies, nothing. I was so excited to try this place out but now that has all gone down through the drain due to their HIGHLY UNSATISFACTORY service. My mood is off and it's ruined the food. BIG FAT THUMBS DOWN.
