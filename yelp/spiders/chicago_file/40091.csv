Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our steaks were cooked perfectly and beautifully charred.  Flavor wise, it wasn't missing a thing, BUT the dry aged ribeye didn't have the juiciness  and tenderness he was expecting. He even noticed an off putting smell and couldn't finish it.  In hindsight, we should have inquired on the dry aged.  Ultimately, dry or wet aged is really a matter of preference.  We were far to full to order dessert, but I made sure the Chocolate cream pie slice went home with me.  My only regret?  That I didn't order two.  This dark, almost black slice was pure decadence. The dark chocolate flavor was incredibly intense. The texture; velvety & sublime. All sitting on a oreo crust.  If there's one thing I'll remember about our dinner, it's the pie.  Pie and ambiance.  And then food. But first pie.
