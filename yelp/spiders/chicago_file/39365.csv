Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For a nice restaurant where the average tab was a little over  $100 per person I found the level of service to be very disappointing.   The food was great (everyone in my party ordered steaks which were terrific).  I'm not sure if it was because we were sat in the bar area or we just had a bad waiter but that's why I rated the restaurant so low.  For the amount that they charge I would expect a much higher level of service.
