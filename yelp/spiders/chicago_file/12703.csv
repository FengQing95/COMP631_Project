Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Can't speak to long waits or service as we ordered delivery which took about an hour, which we expected. For family of four including 2 bottomless teenage boys, we ordered a medium Lou's and large pepperoni and individual side salad for around $60 including delivery and tip.  After eating our fill, we had a large pizza and half a salad left over.  The crust is buttery good and probably a billion calories but delicious.  I don't usually like sausage but the Lou's special was really good.  If getting it delivered, they will suggest to deliver it uncut to avoid sogginess.  Good idea as there is lots of tomato liquid on top.
