Art Institute of Chicago////We entered the museum on the north side, which faces Millenium Park. This entry point was also helpful in quickly getting us to the spaces we wanted to visit. The building is huge, so if you plan on doing Modern European first I'd recommend entering in the modern wing. Admission was $25/person. There was no line for tickets (lucky us!). As you enter the modern wing you have the opportunity to check your coat ($1/item for non-members and worth it, in my opinion) and get an audio guide ($7 for non-members) and a museum map (free) - all on the right hand side of the atrium.
