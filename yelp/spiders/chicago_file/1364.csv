Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Great breakfast spot near Millennium Park.  I had the Apple Carmel Pancakes which were heavy, sweet, and delicious.  My wife had the Southern Benedict with the sausage and gravy.  Absolutely delicious.  Get there early on a Sunday unless you want to wait an hour for a table.  Also, you will not go away hungry.
