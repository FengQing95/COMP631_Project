Smoque BBQ////SOO I was super excited to try this place out and I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. The brisket was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I had a smile on my face the entire time, it was so juicy and delicious...I only wish I had a bigger appetite so I could eat more. Definitely recommend checking this place out if you're in the area. I actually ended up going to the one that's in the food hall and it was such a cute lunch spot!
