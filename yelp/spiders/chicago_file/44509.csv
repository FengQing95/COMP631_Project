Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If I'm looking for a knock-my-socks off meal, I'm not going here. It's a fun palce. A grown-up Ed Debevicks (sp?) if you will. I was a little annoyed with them because I made reservations through Open Table last week for my cousin's birthday and I included in the notes that it was a birthday and to please bring out cake after the meal.
