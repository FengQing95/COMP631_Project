Little Goat Diner////I came here a few years ago, and left feeling nauseas and ended up throwing up multiple times later in the day. I thought maybe it was just what I ordered, or something else I had that day. But I went back yesterday with a friend of mine, and we, again, both left feeling sick to our stomachs. Don't get me wrong, the coffee is GREAT! But the food caused my friend and I both to throw up a gross amount. I would not recommend.
