Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////it has been well over a week since I have spoken with the district manager. When I spoke with him I told him I was willing to take store credit. I did this because it seemed as if it would take forever to resolve my issue. I was told that they would send me a gift card in the mail in the sum of $200. It's been way over a week and I have received nothing.. So for the record nothing has been resolved. It seems as if the ball has been dropped again!
