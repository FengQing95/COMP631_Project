Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A half-hour later, we were seated upstairs in a windowless dining room along with 30 or so other diners. It's not the best ambiance, but the service and the food make up for it. I was expecting our pizza to be ready by the time we were seated, but we had to wait an additional 20-25 minutes -- what was the point of placing an order? To prevent ourselves from becoming hangry, we requested a few appetizers.
