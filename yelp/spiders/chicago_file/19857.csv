Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The wait was one hour for two deep dish personal pizzas to-go. The crust is definitely different from Giordanos--crispy and more buttery. I personally prefer Giordano's though, but it depends what you prefer! I'd say go for the experience. Standing in line wasn't that bad because it created those great memories waiting with friends in the middle of torrential rain :)
