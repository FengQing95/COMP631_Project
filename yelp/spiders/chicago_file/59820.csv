Smoque BBQ////yum! this place was really great. my friend and i both had the sliced brisket platter and it was so so good. the brisket is tender and juicy and delicious. i have to take some points off for the sides though. the mac and cheese was pretty good, but kind of dry. it was tiny too. the other side i had was the brisket chili, which was nice and spicy but low on the brisket and high on the beans. it had a more watery consistency than i like in my chili and was just overwhelmed by beans. oh the fries were really good too! crispy and hot.
