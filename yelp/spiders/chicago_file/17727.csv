Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////True Chicago style pizza.  Loved the ambiance of the place and it's in a great location.  The creamy rice soup was delicious and of course the pizza, the butter crust is the best.  We went for lunch and only paid $9 so the prices are great too.  I would definitely recommend this place.
