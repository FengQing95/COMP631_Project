Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Very cool looking place and big.....wasnt very crowded and I later found out why. We sat down and had a really nice waitress and we immediately ordered our pizza and salad. We thought it would be 15 minutes or so not knowing deep dish. It was 35-40 minutes. I was starved by then.
