Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you go for the large, it takes about 30 to 40 minutes but if you go for the personal, it cuts the cooking time to more than half. I'd skip on an appetizer and wait for the dish because this is more than filling. I tried the plain cheese and the flakey buttery crust was just perfect, plus the cheese portion is modest allowing one to taste all the other fresh ingredients. If you really like it, you can pick up some from the freezer to take home. I was happy with it but would not substitute for a traditional pizza.
