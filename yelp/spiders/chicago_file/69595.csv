Little Goat Diner////Love the vibe in here. Beautiful bustling place mixed with people in business attire to hipsters. Service is fairly quick and the prices are reasonable, but it doesn't skimp on flavor and creativity. Me and the man friend went straight from the airport to here for lunch one hot summer day with all of our luggage and they were super chill about it. We got the fish tostadas and the french dip beef sandwich. All in all, the concepts were good, but I actually thought the fish tostadas were too greasy overall and I found the french dip sandwich too mushy. Regardless, I still enjoyed the meal overall and would recommend any visitors to check this place out.
