Art Institute of Chicago////Nth time in Chicago and I finally get to visit the Art Institute of Chicago on a lovely May Sunday. The lines to get tickets weren't too long at the Michigan Ave. entrance, and you're also able to get tickets from the Modern Wing. You can pay for the audioguide, or you can also download an AIC app for free that uses your phone's GPS to guide you through several tour options of the museum. We just took the "let's see as many of the popular masterpieces" tour, which went pretty well. Within a matter of minutes, we were able to navigate ourselves into the 2nd floor and the European Art before 1900 section. Our breaths were taken away when we arrived at the imposing "A Sunday on La Grande Jette" by Georges Seurat. It's much larger than I thought it would be, and the detail achieved by pointillism was astounding. Pass through a couple more fantastic impressionist artworks, and we find ourselves in a completely different art movement. We were at the Modern Wing, which was this gorgeous, wide, clean space with lots of light and room. After running through a couple more galleries, oohing and aahing at all the amazing pieces that this institute have curated, we left the museum feeling just a little bit more cultured, even if we were sophisticated people with battered feet.
