Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Fun Story Time!: Our server overheard us discussing the various old fashioneds we've tried around town and how the overall favorite still ended up being Sodikoff's version, except for their choice of ice. Oversized ice cubes are preferred as they melt much slower and don't dilute the drink. He seemed amused at our passion and informed us that their version of an oversized square ice cube was currently in production. Â A stainless steel device had already been manufactured and "R&D" is close to perfecting the clarity of it. He even sent out an ice prototype for us and it totally made our night. Man, I'm annoying myself talking about my preferences for ice.
