Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The deep dish pizza itself. OMG so good! The crust was really good and buttery, it was not overly saucy. Good flavor, everything worked together really well. It's different than your traditional pizza, but I really liked it! Definitely hefty, there's a lot of cheese, all of it was yummy. Loved the crust.
