Art Institute of Chicago////I think I may be one of the only people who just didn't care for the Art Institute even though I really like art. I thought the Art and Appetite display was awesome. I really was annoyed with the bad service throughout the museum-I witnessed a woman ask a question to an employee and immediately another employee approached that employee and said "ugh what did SHE want?" as if it isn't their job to point you in the right direction. We did have one employee approach us by the name of PEGGY and she was great. She made us laugh and she educated us about the art in the gallery we were in and was helpful and engaged us. I probably wouldn't come back here again though.
