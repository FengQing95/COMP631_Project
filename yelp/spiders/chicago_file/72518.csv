Little Goat Diner////I would like to put a spotlight on the "Fat Elvis" and also upload a photograph, as if I only describe it some of us would not believe it is true. So you get waffles with balls of peanut-butter, syrup, sliced bananas and tiny bacon specks-bits. I have not weighed it all, but as a rough estimate I guess that might be a 1000 calorie breakfast dish. You may think that can't be healthy, but if you eat apples and carrots til dinnertime you probably did yourself some good anyhow, because your soul had so much fun eating it and the psychology of food should NEVER be underestimated in questions of truly healthy nutrition. (If that does not convince: bananas contain plenty of potassium and pork is a great source of Â Vitamin B... so there: justified!)
