The Purple Pig////This was walking distance from our hotel so we decided to try it out since we were in the mood for pork. At first when we went in we were afraid we wouldn't get a table since it was so full and they told us at least a 2 hour wait but thankfully we were able to seat by the chefs corner. It was nice to see the magic of the food being made by the staff as they signaled and announced the orders in such a cool flow. The tuna tartar was the best i have ever tried in my life and I loved how it looked on its homemade circular chip. I had a pork belly which was delicious and so juicy full of flavors. My friend had the ribs and the fact that it came so easily right off the rib with the tenderness had me obsessed. I normally always have room for dessert so we decided to try the cheesecake with guava sorbet and the combination was perfect! I haven't had such a nice tart sorbet like this but we ate it all up. My group enjoyed every plate they ordered! I wish we could have gone a second time before leaving but this is definitely a must eat if you're ever in Chicago!
