Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Love this place. Service is always great, decor and restaurant vibe are always nice. Pizza is great, and I think their marinara sauce is top in the city. Wait time can get long, so go during off-peak times or call ahead. Can't go wrong picking this place for your first Chicago pizza experience.
