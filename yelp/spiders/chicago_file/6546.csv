The Purple Pig////Our bubbly server was Josie ("as in Josie and the Pussycats" she told us.  She explained that dishes are really meant to be shared amongst our group.  She recommended the broccoli, the pork belly, the beets with goat cheese and the cheese ravioli in a brown butter sauce.  All were solid choices - not life changing like Josie sold them as - but I would order all of them again.  The only thing we missed out on what the aforementioned tuna tartare.  But these four dishes were more than enough dinner for our group of four.
