Little Goat Diner////Undeterred by my muffin experience, I tried out the diner a couple days later on NYE morning, and there was no wait, which is a welcome change from Girl & the Goat.  I ordered the Fat Elvis waffles (without bacon syrup since I don't eat the swine), and it was awesome!  A very simple dish, but the waffle's perfect combination of chewiness and sweetness elevated the dish. The portion was huge too so I had half the next day for breakfast, and it was still really good.  Hubby had the biscuits and gravy, which he declared were the best he had ever had.  He's had a lot of B&Gs so that's saying something.  We also ordered the hash browns with goat cheese, and they were a bit too soggy and greasy for me.
