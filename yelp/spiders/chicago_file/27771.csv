Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My BF and I took his son who lives in CA to Lou's because he had been craving it!  When we arrived, we were told there was a 45-minute wait for the table but the stars must have been shining on us because we were seated within 5 minutes.  Service was friendly and upbeat.  The reason this experience got only 3 stars is that one member of the party ordered a GF pizza with toppings and no cheese due to allergy.
