Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So basically we stuck to the meat and potatoes which constitutes much of the menu space.  Great for sharing with groups, as per tapas' style, and well presented in a nice pace; once we finished a dish another was right in its place.  Overall, we ate WAY too much and were totally stuffed.  A friend got one of the bite-sized desserts (seriously, it was tiny), but I still could not have fit anything else in my stomach.
