The Purple Pig////Since pig is in the name, we tried the fried pig ears and the shoulder (pictured). The ears were awesome, but our favorite dish of the night was the prosciutto stuffed calamari -- just incredible. The shoulder was solid, but it was pretty standard fare, especially when compared to some of the other dishes. The scallops were tasty, and the cheesecake was great too. Some people might not like the tight quarters / communal seating, but the ambiance is awesome and the service is solid.
