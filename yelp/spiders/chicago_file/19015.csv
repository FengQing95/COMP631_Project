Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After a mere 55-minute wait, two seats opened up at the bar and we settled in and placed our pizza orders.  Drinks were delicious (though, there wasn't a wide variety to the available liquor list) and our pizzas came out of the kitchen in about 20minutes.  SUGGESTION : get the"Individual"-size pizza - mine (tomatoes + spinach + moz) was just the right size without over-stuffing myself.  The flavor : crust was DELISH, but the tomatoes kind of left me with a watery taste (I think it needed some basil / seasoning).
