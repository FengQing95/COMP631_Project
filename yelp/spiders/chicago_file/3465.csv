The Purple Pig////- Grilled broccoli $11- this is not your typical broccoli. It was saucy, well flavored, and had a nice bread crust layer. It was a nice veggie addition to our meal and one with very unique flavors that you don't normally associate with broccoli, but it works. Sadly, towards the end of the dish, I felt a bit heavy which isn't something I ever though I would associate with a green veggie. Compared to the other dishes, it wasn't my favorite dish, but wasn't a bad dish either 3/5.
