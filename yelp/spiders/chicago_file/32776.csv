Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Yep, this is what great French food is all about.  I think hands down the best French joint in Chicago.  The steaks are the star, as is often true of a great French place, but all the sides are particularly wonderful as well.  Do yourself a favor and get the frites while you are enjoying your pre-meal cocktail.  And for the love of god, have a pre-meal cocktail - their bartenders are top-notch!
