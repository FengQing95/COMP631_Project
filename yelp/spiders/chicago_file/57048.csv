Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Wonderfully flavored small bites. Ordered the seafood paella, buttermilk fried chicken and Peri-peri sauce (wonderfully delicious and well-balanced), and the beef empanada. Ordered pitchers of red and white sangrias and was left wanting. The sangria was lacking depth of flavor and balance between sweet and dry, tasted like diluted fruit juice. Service was reasonably timely, great ambience, and a generally pleasant dining experience.
