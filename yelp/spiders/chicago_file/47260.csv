Smoque BBQ////We arrived around 11:30 and the place was already starting to pick up.  So we scoured the board for the goody details we were about to order.  Now I have to say one thing really kicks off the experience is a very helpful and pleasant cashier/order taker.  This lady was extremely pleasant and answered all of our questions with a smile.
