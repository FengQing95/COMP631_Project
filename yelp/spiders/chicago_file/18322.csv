Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were seated upstairs.  It is pretty loud and they play only one or two songs over and over again.  The decor is non existent.  The waitress was very nice and attentive.  The house salad looked good, and had a variety of vegetables, but was pretty bland tasting.  We chose the "Lou" deep dish vegetarian pizza.  It was good and had a decent crust, but I've had better.  The price was very good; $22 for a medium that three people struggled to finish two slices each.  For me it didn't live up to the hype of best deep dish pizza, or at least I hope Chicago has better.  However, if you are looking for reasonably priced, good deep dish pizza, this works.
