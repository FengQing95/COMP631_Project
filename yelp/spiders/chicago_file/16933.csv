Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We actually thought the flavor was slightly better than South Loop; however, the pizza I order at 5:40--that was supposed to be ready at 6:25--wasn't ready until 6:50. My pizza orders usually take 35 minutes.  It's like a science.  Occasionally when they're busy and are running behind, they apologize, but it never takes longer than an additional five minutes.
