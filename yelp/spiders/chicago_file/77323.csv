Little Goat Diner////Little goat is a nice place to grab traditional breakfast fare with a bit of Stephanie izards touch.  It's kind of like having American breakfast with gastropub flare.  I've had their biscuit and gravy as well as a number of burgers and they have all been superb.  Highly recommended.
