Smoque BBQ////After hearing so much about this place in the media, etc. Our experience at this place was a BIG disappointment. The food quality is mediocre but you they charge you so much more.  The ribs are not as tender and flavorful as could be. The beef briskets are a bit dry.  This is one of the few bbq places that offer briskets.... not all bbq restaurants in norther IL sell beef brisket.  I do have to say the restaurant definitely had good PR going for them.
