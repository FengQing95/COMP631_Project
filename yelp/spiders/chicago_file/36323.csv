Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Southern Style Fried Chicken with Buttermilk Ranch and Crystal Hot Sauce:  Another dish made for sharing I realize it is a bit skewed to call a $17 plate of chicken a 'deal' when places like KFC can feed a family of four for half of that but in the world of fine dining this dish is a steal - 6 pieces of organic chicken double fried to a golden brown with crunchy coating giving way to juicy bird.  Lightly salted and paired with house ranch plus the same $1 bottle of Crystal you can pick up at Wal-Mart this was no-frills American cooking with top notch ingredients yielding a top notch dish, half of this also going home in a doggie bag.
