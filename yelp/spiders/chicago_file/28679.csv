Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Drove all the way from Dallas to Chicago just for this. Had a really high expectations because I've read and heard good things about Chicago pizza. When we got here, we reserved a table for 2 and pre-ordered medium Malnati Chicago Classic deep dish pizza. its good that we waited only for 20 minutes to be seated, but we still have to wait for 35 minutes for the pizza to come even though we have pre-ordered the pizza before. When the pizza came, the cheese was hard and not even half-melted. We told our server, Jacob, and he was not even trying to do anything about it. Nope. Not going back here again.
