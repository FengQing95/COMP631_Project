Smoque BBQ////Ultimately, barbecue is a combination of artistry and effort. Many barbecue shops end up lacking in one or the other. Smoque on the other hand is absolutely willing to put their artisan's love into their food. I went with a friend, and together we sampled the brisket, sausage, coleslaw, and mac and cheese. The sides were tasty, albeit not of the same quality as the barbecue. The brisket itself was absolutely fantastic though.
