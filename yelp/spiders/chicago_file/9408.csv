Art Institute of Chicago////This was a spontaneous visit.  My boyfriend and I decided to check this place out when we were visiting Chicago and were delightfully surprised with this visit. There were seriously so many things to see and do here that it was an all day event!   We first checked out the mini rooms downstairs, then somewhat followed the brochure they give you up front.  We saw all of the famous paintings and sculptures, and every piece of art you can think of.
