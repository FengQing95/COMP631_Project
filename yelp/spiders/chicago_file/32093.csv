Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Heard great things about Lou's when looking for the best deep dish pizza. This spot had better reviews than the one on Michigan, and indeed the pizza was fantastic. While waiting for the deep dish we tried the Minestrone soup, which was delicious. The pizza was incredible, and the ranch was bomb.
