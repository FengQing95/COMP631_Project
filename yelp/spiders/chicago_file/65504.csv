Smoque BBQ////I am from the south and 10/10 recommend Smoque to all! Their brisket is literally some of the best brisket I've ever had! Did I mention I was born in raised in the south and grew up eating the best of the best bbq?! Whether you dine in or pick up take out, the quality is always there. Staff members are very friendly and accommodating to kids. Best bbq in Chicago!
