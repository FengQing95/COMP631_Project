Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Yeah - it's that good.  Went on a Tuesday, arrived shortly after they opened and it was already PACKED.  The bavette's punch was delicious and unlike any other mixed drink i've ever had.  We got a dozen west and east coast oysters - which were all very small, but in my experience, smaller oysters tend to have more flavor, and these were some of the best i've had.  We split a half order of the wedge salad, and their signature bacon is not to be missed.  I actually thought the dressing was very original too.  We then had the dry aged bone in ribeye, and the bone in filet.  Go with dry aged, there's just no substitute, and it's so much better.  The fillet was good too, but pale in comparison.  We got the truffle mac, which was the best i've had in the city yet!  We also got the brussel sprouts, which were pretty okay, had a bit of a vinegary mustard taste to them that wasn't bad, just not what i was in the mood for.  And we got the chocolate pie and salted carmel ice cream for desert.  Do NOT forget to order desert!
