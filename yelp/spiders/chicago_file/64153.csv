Smoque BBQ////The atmosphere was like being in someone's garage. One wall held a huge chalk board with the menu. I didn't have to look far before deciding on a 1/2 slab of baby back ribs with 2 sides for about $14. I originally chose mac and cheese and coleslaw as my sides, but happily found out that the meal already came with slaw and so I ecstatically selected cornbread. Tears almost came to my eyes as I realized they served Coke. After being at multiple places in the city, I was beginning to think the entire state of Illinois only served Pepsi. But there is was, a self-serve fountain soda machine with Coke clearly written on the side.
