Smoque BBQ////Amazingly tender meat! Both the pulled pork and brisket are so melt in your mouth tender. Mac n cheese is good. I love that the Cole slaw is more like a salad, seems not to have mayo. I like the ambiance, not pretentious, friendly staff. Close to the best BBQ, but too far to go regularly.
