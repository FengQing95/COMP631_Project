Smoque BBQ////The mac and cheese was my downfall; I sneaked extra helpings after everyone vacated the conference room. I've traveled through the south extensively, eating from roadside vendors under corrugated steel shacks dishing out the best BBQ ever ... Smoque is the next best thing. The cole slaw has the perfect tangy kick without being too vinegary. Everything was so tasty I just called my husband and switched our date night from a pricey suburban restaurant to Smoque.
