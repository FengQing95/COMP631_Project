Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I got the classic pizza or something that has sausage and their "famous" butter crust in a personal size. It's a pretty reasonable prize at about $12. One of the best pizzas I've tasted flavor wise, not sure how they did it, but I was quite impressed. This place easily would have earned 5-stars but I felt they messed up either accidentally or intentionally. The pizza I received was warm, not hot. And by warm, I mean the cheese didn't have the melted or gooey effect I usually expect from a pizza place. Rather the cheese stretched a tiny bit before tearing. Unsure if this was how pizza was normally served in this style, I ate at Giordano's and they served the pizza much hotter than Lou's. Overall impressed with the flavor enough that I'll be back again, but hopefully the pizza will be much hotter and "fresher" tasting next time around.
