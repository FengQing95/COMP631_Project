Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This has to be the best food i've ever tasted.  Everything exceeded my expectations including the service.  After reviewing the menu online, I thought the selection seemed very limited, however the raving reviews prompted me to give it a shot.  Making a reservation was not so easy as they book out far in advance, but we managed to find a time that we could work with.  We were promptly seated and the waiter was more than happy to help us navigate the menu since this was our first time, offering recommendations and encouraging us to share the meal.  We ordered the baked goat cheese, the waldorf style salad, the prime bone in ribeye with broccoli and elote style corn, and finally the whiskey ice cream with chocolate sauce topping.  Everything was OUTSTANDING.  I will mention I am not a big steak or corn person, and do not enjoy the taste of whiskey, but those three things were my favorite.  Did I mention the corn?  You must have the corn!  My friend and I are constantly sending pictures we took of the food to each other and cannot wait to go back!  I must also mention this place allows you to BYOB (you can also purchase there) and has a tradition that if you BYOB, you must send a glass of your wine to another table.  It's a very cute gesture, especially when you're receiving!
