Little Goat Diner////Had my wife's baby shower there and we received unbelievable food, service and overall experience. Food wise, we went with the blueberry pancakes, corned beef hash, grilled cheeses, ham and cheese frittatas, cookies, veggie sandwiches and yogurt and granola. Each was slightly fancier than these basic descriptions but not overdone. There was no shortage of any dish despite 7 extra guests over the estimate.
