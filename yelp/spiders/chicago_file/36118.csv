Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We just had the most amazing meal at Bavette's Bar and Boeuf!!!  The wedge salad was divine, served with the most innovative dressing we have had in a long time and the slab bacon was beyond good.  The dry aged New York strip was perfectly seasoned and cooked and the mashed potatoes with roasted garlic and butter were out of this world!  Best we have EVER had!  Siaire was the most fabulous waiter ever, so personable and lovely!  I SUPER recommend this restaurant!  The jazz and ambiance make you feel like you are in a fab club and the food is beyond good!
