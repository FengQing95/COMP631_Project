Little Goat Diner////Brought some friends here that were in for out of town.  It was a Friday morning, and we had a reservation.  There were definitely a good amount of people waiting so were were happy that we made a reservation; our table was ready for us right away.  We started our meals out with a few cappuccinos and a cinnamon bun.  Regretting nothing both were to die for.  When you see this bun you are like whoa thats too much I made a mistake,, and then you taste it and you're like whoa no mistake this thing is DA BOMB!! Perfectly hard on the outside with delicious doughy inside is only made perfect with the not too sweet cream cheese icing.  Its perfect.  Making a choice on the menu is always hard because, duh you should want one of everything.  Finally I decided to go with the daily omelette special.  Oh-mah-gawd.  I feel bad because I don't 100% remember what all was in it, but long story short it was a sweet onion cream cheese filling with eggplant and tomatillo mixture with fried onions on top.  It was so good everyone at my table wanted to help me with it.  HINT: When Stephanie Izard has a special: TRY IT!! Also we got the fried potatoes with cheese, duh so good, so perfectly cooked.  I want to eat here everyday forever and ever: THE END.
