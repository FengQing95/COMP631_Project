Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A friend of mine John suggested that I try this restaurant and I said what the heck I'm always trying new things this is a very pleasant experience. When we entered the restaurant we were greeted by very friendly person and was given our seats the waiter was extremely friendly very helpful and explained every detail of any questions I had regarding their entrees that they serve being this is my first experience here. We decided to order about five or six different items off the menu and I must say the shrimp with garlic sauce was by far the best ! During the course of our meal a gentleman named Mark Sotelino and asked how things were doing . Which I thought was really great experience to see that later that I found out that he was the general manager and he took the time and consideration to make sure all his customers were 100% satisfied with the service here :-) . This is a restaurant that I would recommend to my friends and family and especially to someone who wants to take your girlfriend for a nice romantic dinner which I'm going to do some time in the near future with my girlfriend
