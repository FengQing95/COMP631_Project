The Purple Pig////Pork belly rillons - According to our server this was one of the more popular items. It was basically a plate of only 5 cubes of fatty pork covered in this thick, sweet glaze. They had a slightly crisp outside with a super fatty center that just melted in your mouth. The glaze kind of gave it that candied bacon vibe. I loved this dish, but I wish it wasn't so small. I needed more!
