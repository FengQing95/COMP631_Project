Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've had the spiced fried chicken, dry aged ribeye, lamb chops, garlic shrimp de jonghe, Brussels sprouts, truffle mac and cheese, and the wild mushrooms. All of them were delicious and I'd order them over and over again. You can't really go wrong with anything here but the best item on the menu is the dry aged ribeye cooked medium rare.
