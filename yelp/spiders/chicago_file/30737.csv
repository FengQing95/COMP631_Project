Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////An amazing choice for my first ever deep dish pizza. There is a reason Chicago natives recommend this place- it was SO freakin' good. I want to fly back just to have it again. We got the Lou Malnati's deep dish w/ mushrooms added. The cheese was perfectly gooey, the crust was buttery and perfectly crispy. I loooved the amount of sauce. We walked in the pouring rain from our hotel just to check it out & it was more than worth it!
