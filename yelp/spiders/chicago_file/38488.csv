Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was amazing. My boyfriend said the ribeye was the best steak he's ever had. I had a salad with apples and pecans, which was delicious and fresh. We tried to truffle mac and cheese, which was perfectly creamy and nicely browned on top. But, to me, the elote corn was the star. I've been searching all over Rhode Island trying to find something that comes close and it doesn't exist.
