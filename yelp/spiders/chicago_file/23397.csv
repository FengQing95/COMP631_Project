Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We visited around 12 pm on a Tuesday and it wasn't busy when we arrived but about 20 minutes in, it became very busy and loud. Our waitress was very nice and quick. We got the three cheese bread for our appetizer which was delicious! We ordered a small butter crust half pepperoni half cheese which we were quoted about 35-45 minutes for. I wouldn't recommend coming for deep dish if you're in a hurry as it takes quite a while to make. The pizza was just ok. I'm not a huge fan on sweet sauce and tons of cheese.
