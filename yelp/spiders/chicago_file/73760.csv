Little Goat Diner////Starting off with pastries and the oft praised fried mashed potatoes I was particularly taken by the muffin and the scone, both available in the bakery/bread shop next door and both a fine balance of sweet and savory with a great crumb and plenty of butter. Â Moving next to our primary plates, myself going savory for the first time in memory as the ladies each went sweet, I'll simply say that any chef willing to put brandade on a breakfast menu - particularly with pork belly and kimchi - has guts, and all my respect for making such diverse flavors work so well.
