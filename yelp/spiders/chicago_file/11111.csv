Art Institute of Chicago////SIZE: This museum is very, very large. Block off an entire day if you want to see everything. I had no prior knowledge about the museum and just rolled in with two hours to close. I had no idea about the size. Luckily, they have a very helpful front desk staff who was quick to point me to the "highlights" section that basically tells you what iconic pieces you should see if you only have an hour to look around.
