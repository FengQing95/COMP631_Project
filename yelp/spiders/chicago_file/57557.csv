Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is the kind of place where you bring people who are visiting you from out of town. That's how good it is. First of all, the ambience is really cool in there. The bar is beautiful, and the restaurant itself is architecturally pleasing and nicely lit. The hostesses all greeted us with warm inviting smiles, and then seated the three of us.
