Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came for an impromptu dinner and scoped out a spot at the bar. The duck and goat cheese terrine was fabulous and came with deliciously thick-cut and crusty bread. The steak frites were also tasty but not the best I've ever had. Expectations are high and execution fell a bit short. Service was wonderful though (with the bartender maintaining her cool almost effortlessly when confronted with a barrage of mansplaining/bravado from other patrons).
