Art Institute of Chicago////(Side note, I would note that the staff could have been more generous when it came to exiting... while we were getting ourselves ready to hit the blizzard weather outside we were being yelled at for standing in front of the door.  I guess now that we payed, there's no need to be nice?!... Staffs are not so friendly.  Oh and why is there even a donation box? We pay $ to get in...)
