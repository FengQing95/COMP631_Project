Art Institute of Chicago////What's not to love about the Art Institute, especially on a sunny cold Chicago afternoon. Went to see the New Contemporaries, which was terrific. That said, not a visit goes by when I don't try to find our stumble across some unexplored nook containing a visually stunning, informative educational treasure.
