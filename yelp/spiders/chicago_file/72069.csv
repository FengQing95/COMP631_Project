Little Goat Diner////The menu at Little Goat is so UNIQUE. I love going there for brunch. However, I try to go on a weekday because weekends always have a 1hr wait or longer. If you want to wait that long, it's ok because little goat is never disappointing but I always tend to go for a much calmer environment which is usually on the weekdays.
