Smoque BBQ////Food:  The food really makes this place (Note-  it's BYOB).  You can tell from the moment you walk in the door, the owners, cooks & cashiers are 100% focused on food.  I don't typically crave bbq, but I've started to now.  I sampled the pulled pork, chopped brisket, hotlink, ribs, coleslaw, mac n cheese, baked beans & cornbread - yummy!  The baked beans were a little heavy on the onion & the mac n cheese was more fluffy than creamy (from all the butter, I'm guessing) but all the flavors blended nicely.  The name was definitely the staple behind the meat flavor, but I had been hoping for a little more of a smokey crust to the meat.  There wasn't much of a crust, making me wonder if it'd been sitting for a while.  Maybe it's better during peak busy hours (I was there at 4:30pm on a Friday) but even without the crunch, I would go back - oh, and get the peach cobbler.
