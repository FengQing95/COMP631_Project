Smoque BBQ////Being from the south, I can definitely appreciate good BBQ when I have it. They have some pretty amazing pulled pork and their mac and cheese is amazing. As I type this now I am definitely getting a craving for it. The only draw back is the amount of people in there at the times that I have been. Regardless though, they have a very efficient system for seating people and it's a great place to get your BBQ fix. I'll definitely be back!
