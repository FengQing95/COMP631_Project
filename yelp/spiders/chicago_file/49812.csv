Smoque BBQ////I love a nice brisket (which was good) but, boy, I would not waste more time on this place, where long lines, childish boys, girls and trendies on an allowance stream out the doors.  My brisket was good, yes, but at what cost to wait forever, get it home, warm it up and serve it?  There was no room for anyone more to sit and even those lunchroom-style tables, where the trendies were already elbow-to-elbow, were ratty.
