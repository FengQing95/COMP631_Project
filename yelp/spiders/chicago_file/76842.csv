Little Goat Diner////Really a 3 1/2 but since we don't have half stars will give it 3. It was rare lunch date with the hubby we chose to meet here from our respective workplaces. Seated inside, I felt the service was kinda slow our server did mention it was busier than useual. I had the veggie sandwich and my husband had the goat burger. Their special seasonal cider which was lukewarm to cold at its best was not a good drink to order. Nothing very exciting on or off the menu to make me come back.
