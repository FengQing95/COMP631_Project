Art Institute of Chicago////It's a world-class art museum, one of the best in the world. The traveling exhibits are usually excellent, but the expansive collection is always worth a lengthy visit. Just wandering into a gallery and randomly coming across the original version of a painting you've seen copies of your whole life is pretty thrilling.
