Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////As for price...as tapas bars goes this place is SOOOOOO REASONABLE I couldn't believe it. Â It almost felt like they were underselling themselves but it was great for my wallet and my taste buds. I would highly recommend this place to anyone that wants good food and drinks with friends.
