Smoque BBQ////** PEACH COBBLER has somehow become a custom at a barbecue joint. It's tough to pull off. Peach season is 1O weeks long and even then, why fool with fresh because your customers are used to, and want, what you have been serving. I'm addicted to sugar so I have to have desert. My peach cobbler provided the strongest memories of Smoque. The line was backed out the door. I sort of stuck my head over the stainless steel into the cutting area of the kitchen. I shouldn't have done it, but I asked the cook if there was a way to get desert Â without going to the back of that line. In two seconds, he produced the peach cobbler and said to pay later. The peaches were a four. The warmth was an 8 and the crust was a shocking 1O. You'll never guess one of the ingredients of peach cobbler.
