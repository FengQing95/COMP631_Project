Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The last time we were there, we had a group of overly drunk frat boy types right next to us.. please, enjoy yourself, be loud and have fun. But don't be obnoxious and disrupt other parties around you. I had to eat my food and convince myself that it wasn't worth me walking over and pouring some Sangria on your drunk faces!
