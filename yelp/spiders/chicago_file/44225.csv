Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////That's why I was pretty shocked a couple of weeks ago when my family went for brunch on a Sunday morning. The service was still great, but the food was pretty mediocre. It seemed like the food had been cooked in a large batch earlier and was just kind of sitting around awhile. So a little dry, a little meh, just not as special as it usually all is. The dates wrapped in bacon, usually one of my favorites were small and the bacon was just rubbery. The chicken pinxto was sad and tasteless, so I drenched in in that spicy mayo.
