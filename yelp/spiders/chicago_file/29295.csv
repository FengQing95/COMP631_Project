Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Yum yum yum yum yum!!! I have to preface this by saying I'm not a fan of lots and lots of toppings on a pizza and I've never really had deep dish before - true deep dish but when in Chicago, you HAVE to try it and I was glad I did. Wow!  The pizza came out on a pie pan and they cut and serve you the first slice and I thought, the bottom of this crust must be so soggy cause look at all that liquid and grease but boy was I wrong.  Chicago deep dish is something else, especially here at Lou Malnati's.  The crust was crispy - we tried both the normal and the butter crust and couldn't really tell a difference.  The toppings were fantastic, especially when hot before the cheese congeals.  I love love loved the Malnati Chicago Classic - just the flavors of the cheese and meat was fantastic.  We also had to try the "Lou" while were were here and it was a little more soggy cause of the mushrooms and tomatoes and peppers but still good.  This was the vegetarian option and as good as it was, it couldn't beat the Malnati classic.  We ordered two smalls so we could try them both and it was more than enough for the 2 of us.  These babies are filling - so if they look small, it is very very deceiving.
