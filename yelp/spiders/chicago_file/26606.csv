Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Love the fact that this restaurant have you pre order the pizzas before you get a table as the pizza takes 30 minuets to cook. Waited about 15 minuets before getting seated but very good service and smoothly run. The thin crust cheese pizza was amazing as well as the calamari and bbq wings.
