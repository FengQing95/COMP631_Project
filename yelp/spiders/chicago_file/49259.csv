Smoque BBQ////The pulled pork sandwich is the best I've ever had. I rarely eat meat, so when I do it better be worth it! The pork is juicy and tender and the bbq sauce is sweet but comes with a kick. The portions are generous. Just a sandwich is a meal in itself. My boyfriend had the brisket sandwich and agreed that the meat was tender and flavorful. Â I also got a side of cornbread, which was made with whole corn kernels mixed in. It was delicious! I would definitely recommend going for an early dinner or lunch and sitting outside. This place gets packed on the weekends!
