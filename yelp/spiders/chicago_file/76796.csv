Little Goat Diner////The Macho Nachos were huge and perfect for sharing. The chips were thick and crunchy. The two types of cheese were melty and stringy. Every bite was sinfully good. The pulled pork was savory and juicy. The guacamole on top was creamy and seriously every bite left me wanting more.
