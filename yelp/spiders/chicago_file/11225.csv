Art Institute of Chicago////There are three floors with endless exhibits covering many eras, styles and cultures. It is a beautiful, clean white space that is easy to navigate through, even on a busy weekend. The 1st floor is the largest but there are ample pieces on both the 2nd and 3rd floors as well.
