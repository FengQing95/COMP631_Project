Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Arugula and beet salad was good. Short rib stroganof was excellent. Classic cut ribeye was cooked perfect (medium rare) but tough as hell. Seemed more like usda select sirloin rather than choice ribeye. Sent it back and they were nice about. Obviously not the server or cook's fault (unless it was sirloin). Cognac sazerac was a bit too licorice-y for my tastes. I'll stick with the traditional rye.
