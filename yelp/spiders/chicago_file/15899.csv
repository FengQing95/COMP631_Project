Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a deep dish sausage pizza.  Another reason to go a bit early is deep dish pizza's take a little longer to cook (approx. 40 mins).  The waitress was nice, she did not try to get us to order the largest portion of everything, but told us mediums would probably be enough for three, which it was.
