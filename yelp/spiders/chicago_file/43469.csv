Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We take our 8th grade students to Café Ba Ba Reeba for a luncheon and I personally adore their food so I called Café Ba Ba Reeba for help. I spoke to co-owner, Michael, and a catering associate, Allison, and they were professional, helpful and equally as excited about our students tasting tapas. They arranged to have the pieces cut, tooth picked, and packaged in containers so I could fit them over night in my fridge. They included the "special sauce" on the side and a tray to serve them on. Allison made sure that I refrigerated the tapas, but explained that they are served room temperature.
