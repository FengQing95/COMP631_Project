Art Institute of Chicago////I was disappointed that during my visit a couple of key pieces I wanted to view (American Gothic, for one) were being loaned out. That information should be prominently displayed in the website for prospective visitors. I wouldn't have minded coming back so much if the admission fee wasn't so high, $23!! Coming from New York where many cultural institutions are free or offer heavy discounts for many groups ( students, seniors, etc.) I was a bit outraged.
