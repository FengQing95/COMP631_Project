Smoque BBQ////I have a personal rule that I only give out five stars when a restaraunt does something better than I've ever experienced before (or at least damn close). Smoque met this criteria on with SEVERAL items! First of all, and most importantly, it was the BEST bbq ribs/pulled pork I'd ever had. Listen to me here, EVER! Next, Â it was the best Mac 'n Cheese I've eaten in my life, and this is coming from someone that considers himself quite the expert on the Mac 'n Cheese.
