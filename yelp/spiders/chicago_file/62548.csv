Smoque BBQ////The sides were delicious (such as potatoes, mac & cheese) and they complemented the meal nicely in the sense that they were small sides that while tasty, were not strong or big enough to take the spotlight off of the ribs. The ribs were to die for. Whatever house sauces they have there, whatever methods they use to cook, wherever they get their meats, cooks from - it ALL comes together to make the perfect storm for a volcano eruption of a meal here at Smoque BBQ. For a BBQ lover - this is a MUST SEE place. Not just because TV covered this place, but because it really is that good. Oh and did I mention it's BYOB? Bring some beer, red wine and/or Bourbon whiskey for during the meal. This could truly be a carnivorous man's fave place to eat.
