The Purple Pig////The food was delicious but slightly on the salty side. The pasta was chewy and had very nice texture. The octopus was minty and distinct. The pork shoulder was out favorite. It was meaty and large portion. The duck leg felt right off the bone except we found a vegetable tag in it. The host graciously took it off of our bill and offered us a new one.
