Art Institute of Chicago////youmustvisitwhileinChicago! Superb museum a cross between the Met and MOMA in NYC. The Modern Art wing here is simply breathtaking and I would have been happy just seeing that but NO there was also a fullscale impressionist and traditional paintings museum as well. VERY IMPRESSIVE. So after spending a very pleasant 2 hours as we were preparing to leave and go back to work (we had snuck out for a few hours to see the museum) I happened upon the miniatures room in the basement/lower level. A M A Z I N G Â - seriously took my breath away. I wish I had allowed more time as this exhibit was insanely detailed and unlike anything I had experienced (except for the dollhouse at the Science and Industry Museum, but this was that times 100). Chicagoans I hope you understand the gift this museum is. I didn't even get to go into my Ferris Bueller's Day off recreation, next time.
