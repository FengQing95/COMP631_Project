The Purple Pig////The place was incredible. I came in as a solo diner and sat down at a packed bar. The restaurant was slammed, especially for a weekday. Regardless of how busy it was, the service was still very good, even at a packed bar with swamped bartenders. I ate the Bavette Steak and English Muffin with Truffle Sausage and both were amazing. This place is easily one of my favorite places.
