Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Super busy on a Saturday evening but it was well worth the 45 minute wait! Restaurant allows you to place your order upon arrival so that it's basically ready when you're seated. Out server, Tina, was FANTASTIC!! We got the classic pizza and it was AMAZING! All in all it was a wonderful experience! Only wish I had More time to retune and request Tina... Even if I have to wait an hour!
