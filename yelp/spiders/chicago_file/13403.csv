Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Maybe I'm just an out of towner who doesn't know good pizza, but this just wasn't good.  The huge crowd outside totally made me think this pizza would be crazy good, but it was just meh.  I got the Chicago Classic and the three cheese bread.  You could tell the ingredients were fresh, but that's the only good thing I can say about the food.  I could have lived the rest of my life without trying Chicago's famous deep dish pizza and not felt like I missed out on anything.
