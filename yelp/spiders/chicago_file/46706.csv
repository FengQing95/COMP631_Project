Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////- Definitely save room for dessert. All chocoholics must try the dark chocolate crema, the rich chocolate and orange contrast is simply too good to share. I'm not a fan of the chocolate truffle cake since the kahlua makes it a bit too sweet for my liking, but if you prefer milk chocolate I've heard it's a must eat. Finally, if the mango sorbet is in season, then definitely try it. It's so fresh and refreshing, perfect for Chicago summers.
