Art Institute of Chicago////It's hard not to give a high quality art museum 5-stars. And this museum definitely deserves 5-stars. So, go, enjoy --- My low review score of 2-stars has to do with what I observed at 7:50 p.m. on a Thursday evening, July 7th. The museum normally closes at 5 p.m. everyday except on Thursdays, when it is open until 8 p.m. My boys, wife and I arrived at 6 p.m. and had just 2 hours to see all that we wanted to see. We were fairly successful. But, at 7:50 when we were about to enter the Greek/Roman antiquities which my younger son was very keen to see, we were told rudely by museum staff that the museum was closed and that we had to leave. We walked over to the other corridor for this section. Now, it was 7:52, and we tried to see a few of the antiquities on this corridor. Again, staff told us we had to leave because the museum was closed. I distracted the guard just long enough with questions about how this museum compares to the National Gallery of Art, so that my son could quickly race through and look at some of the Greek vases and other pieces. We than began our walk out of the museum. At 7:57, we observed what seemed like rush hour in Grand Central Station -- numerous museum guards materialized out of their various stations making a beeline for the Monroe Street exit door practically knocking us over at they made their way toward the exit. I stopped to ask a museum manager why we were being told the museum was closed 10-minutes before 8 p.m. She was apologetic but had no good explanation. My point is this -- if we pay to be in the museum until it closes and the time of closing is listed as 8 p.m., then we should be able to view the art until 8 p.m. If the museum actually closes at 7:50 p.m., then that time should be listed on the door so that we know we only have until 7:50 p.m. And if the guards are making a run for the door, either they need better management/supervision, more pay, more instruction on how not to offend patrons on their way out -- or maybe a different employee only exit. If this museum didn't have some of the best artwork in the world, I'd give my review of this esteemed museum only 1-star for poor management practices.
