Little Goat Diner////The waiter was pretty amazing considering the situation. he managed to frequently stopped by to ask if we needed anything else or gave ideas of other thngs we should try, without being too overwhelming. He told us on the Pork Smoothie, which was delicious and definitely worth a try.
