Little Goat Diner////Our waitress was very nice and helpful, and never had an issue with her at all. I didn't order any drinks, but we got the fried pickles and onions for appetizers. I am a huge fan of their fried pickles! I ended up getting a caesar salad. Their golden beets inside the salad was probably my favorite part.
