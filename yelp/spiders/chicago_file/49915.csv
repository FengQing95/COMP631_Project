Smoque BBQ////Awesome sides at this place!  Fantastic cole slaw and probably the best mac & cheese in Chicago.  My only complaint was I wish the sides were bigger!  The meat was just perfect.  Great sauce and the meat itself was nice & moist.  They also have really great trays to put your food on !  Love that !
