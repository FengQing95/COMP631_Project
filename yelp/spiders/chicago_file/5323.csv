The Purple Pig////Came recently with the BF on a Friday night around 5:30 pm. We probably waited around 20-30 minutes in total. They texted us when our table was ready, so we were able to spend the time walking around Michigan Ave. I remember when we came 3 years ago, we had to wait FOREVER. So the lesson is: come earlier if possible!
