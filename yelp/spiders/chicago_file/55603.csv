Smoque BBQ////We met another couple for dinner here and found the dry rub ribs tender and delicious. The default sauce, was a little disappointing compared to how well prepared & cooked the meat was - the sauce was trying too hard, but next time (!) I will explore sauce options, there were choices, but as this was my first time, I was curious to see what I would get.
