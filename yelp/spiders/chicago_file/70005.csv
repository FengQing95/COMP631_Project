Little Goat Diner////So interested in this place.  This was my second visit which is usually the true tale of a resturaunt.  Place holds up.  Like the dinner experience with the three fold plastic menu, nice job offering the great takes on the usual dinner experience, think Golden Apple but higher end food.  Elivis waffles are great but more like desert, I forgot the name of my sandwich but it's basically a pork cutlet with sarachi.  If you like pork cutlet this is a must have.  Makes most of the ones I have had look sad.  Perfectly cooked, soft and moist inside and perfectly crisp and breaded on the outside.  Would eat that too often if I lived in the West loop.  The back bar is cool but pretty small.  Good cocktails... had a nice one with Mezcal which seems to be on every bars menu now.  Well done cocktails so give them a shot.  Had a cumcuber and gin fiz that would be excellent in the summer.
