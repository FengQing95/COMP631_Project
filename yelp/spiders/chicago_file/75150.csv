Little Goat Diner////Thank you fellow Yelpers - you did not steer me wrong! My BF and I went to Little Goat for brunch a few weeks ago and we're sure glad we did. We arrived around 10:30am and only had to wait a few minutes before we were sat. I'd recommend getting there before 11am to avoid an hour wait.
