Little Goat Diner////3. If you're looking for a brunch spot that serves your traditional savory tooth when you're at the height of your hangover, I would go elsewhere. 90% of the brunch menu involves some sort of shellfish and/or kimchi (of which I am allergic, the latter do not care for), and when I was there, in need of a hearty brunch dish, I was sorely disappointed I couldn't find even a traditional eggs benny on the menu.
