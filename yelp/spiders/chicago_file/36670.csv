Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////But please, do not linger long in the lounge.  Proceed to your table and you'll have a classic steak house experience, only, well, sexier.  Like Maude's Liquor Bar, Bavette's sports an impressive raw bar selection, and I urge you to go as big as your table allows with oysters, jumbo shrimp. clams and mussels.  They are delicious.
