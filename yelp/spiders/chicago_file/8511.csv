Art Institute of Chicago////One part of the museum that continues to draw me back is the contemporary wing.  I'm not a huge modern art person since I think a lot of it looks like something a 10 year old could make up (although I love me some Rothko), but the space itself is light, airy, and spacious.  It's refreshing to see after walking through darker exhibits that have to protect older works.  Plus, they often have impromptu music performances in the great hall which is always a fun surprise.  AND they sell beer in the cafe of the contemporary wing!  Beer and art = great combo.
