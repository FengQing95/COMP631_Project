Art Institute of Chicago////My friend and I visited the Art Institute of Chicago primarily to see "Van Gogh's Bedrooms" currently on display. I give that exhibit 5 stars and wrote a full review on it if you're interested in details, but this review focuses on the rest of the museum, which we took an extra 90 minutes or so to explore after the exhibit.
