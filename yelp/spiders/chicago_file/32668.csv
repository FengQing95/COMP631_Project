Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Had a reservation on Saturday night, getting the table was smooth. Ordered Short Rib Stroganoff, Dry aged Steak, burger, and a bottle of steak wine. The steak is marvelous and melting in your mouth. However the service is disappointing. The waiter tried to take the plate while my daughter was still Â eating. Then the waiter brought the bill while we still have half bottle of wine, not mention that no one had come to refill the wine, and not even ask for order of desert or coffee. Even the steak is good, i will never return, not with the rude service. There are lots of steakhouse in town with better service.
