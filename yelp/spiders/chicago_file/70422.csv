Little Goat Diner////Little Goat manages to keep the avant garde, in your face bold and crazy approach to menu items that the original restaurant has while making the food a bit more approachable. I was tempted by the whitefish & harissa tostadas and the special beef heart gyro, but I ended up with the pork belly pancake which was quite literally one of the best lunch items I have ever consumed. Meaty, fatty pork belly beneath a crunchy asian slaw dressed with ginger and maple (but more ginger than maple). All over an absurdly crisp/tender flaky asian style pancake with a hoisin kick. I would make love to this dish over and over again.
