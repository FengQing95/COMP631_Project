Little Goat Diner////Ordered the Loco Moco burger and the Mezcalada Â (supposed to be serano infused pelligrosso reposado. elbuho mezcal. bloody mary mix. lime. citrus salt. lager). They were out of some of the ingredients so the waiter asked the bartender to improvise and the drink came out great; good spice and heat.
