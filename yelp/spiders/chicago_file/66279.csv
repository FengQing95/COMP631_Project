Little Goat Diner////Just Ok...I think it's a bit over-rated.  I think there's a bit of the Emperor's Clothes thing going on here...it's the new hot place and you'd better not knock it...I don't really think a lot of the dishes work - it seems it's a bit like the Portlandia skit "Put a Bird on It!' - got a lackluster dish?  Put kim-chi on it!
