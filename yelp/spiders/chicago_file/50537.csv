Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Yum!!  I enjoyed dinner here with a large group for dinner. We pretty much ordered at least 1 of everything on the menu and it was all delicious. The sangria was also a hit!!  I would recommend this place if you are nearby, just be sure to make a reservation as it can get busy come evening hours.
