Little Goat Diner////I ordered the corn beef hash and a side of bacon.  I was completely satisfied with the presentation, quality of the meat and overall freshness of the food!  I will be coming back for more.  My only regret was not stopping by the bakery next door and taking home a few hand made treats.
