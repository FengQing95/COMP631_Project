Little Goat Diner////This place is intense! I do not remember feeling so unhealthy after my Girl & the Goat meal... But, hey, sometimes you just gotta go all out, and this is the place to do it. I came with my boyfriend and ordered the veggie burger "American" style (cheddar, lettuce, tomato, special sauce, onion, brioche bun). He ordered the fried chicken with a biscuit and PQM bacon on the side (Can you tell how healthy he is?) We shared the mac and cheese to start and finished the meal with a slice of rhubarb pie a la mode. My boyfriend is crazy because when we first ordered he said, "You should get fries with your burger because it doesn't come with any." But I knew better and I told him to chill. I'm glad I stuck with my guns because food coma does not even begin to cover how you feel leaving this place... That said, wonderful service and this place is also very family friendly!
