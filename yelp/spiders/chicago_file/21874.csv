Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Fantastic!  Ordered the original deep dish and it was delicious!  They suggested an appetizer since it takes 30 minutes to cook the pizza.  I'm glad we did.  The garlic bread was good, but the marinara was amazing.  Next time we would order extra sauce on our pizza!  The staff was friendly and checked on us regularly.
