Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We went on a Monday night around 7 pm for dinner. When checking in w/ the host to place or name for a table, we were handed a menu to preorder our pizza since the wait time for a deep dish pizza can be quite long. However, we got seated almost immediately upstairs and placed our order then. We were given a wait time of 40 minutes for the pizza. Service was great overall. Our server constantly came to check on us to be sure we were doing ok throughout the wait time. Now that I have tried the classic, I would definitely consider coming back to try their other options (& their thin crust)!
