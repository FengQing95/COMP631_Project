Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago! I've tried the other establishments when I visited my sister and Lou Malnati's is by far my favorite.  The pizza isn't true deep dish by the look of the crust thickness but it's not thin crust.  The dough is yummy and the toppings are fresh. I had more slices than I expected but at the end of the day didn't feel uncomfortably full.
