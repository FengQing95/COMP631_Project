Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Very popular spot. 9:00 reservation - still packed! Enjoyed heading out from The Loop to explore a neighborhood. Started with chorizo wrapped dates - YES! Sangria (classic) YES! Paella was very well done - we had the mixto - pork confit and chicken thighs...delicious! They make their own bread in their very special oven - you can buy by the loaf, though it is complementary with your meal. We got out for under $100 and we're very pleased. Next visit I will do more tapas and perhaps try the pinxtos - they ALL look very good.
