Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't know guys...  it was good but it wasn't great.  I've been here a couple of time now and while I like the pizza, it takes forever to get it.  The menu is narrow and fairly generic and I just have a hard time getting excited about it.  There are better pizza places in Chicago and if you're only in town for a quick trip and want good Chicago Deep Dish, I preferred Giordano's.
