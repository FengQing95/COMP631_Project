Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visited this location on a Wednesday evening. Called ahead and made reservation for group. Provided order so we could be ahead of any wait. Showed up 15 minutes early for reservation.  Check-in and reviewed order with staff inside. We were not seated until 45 minutes past our reservation time.  Once seated provided ticket to server of order and ordered drinks.  Drink service was a disaster. Took multiple attempt to get water and rest of drinks. Salads arrived and we ate that. 45 minutes after we sat down the pizza arrived. Wait, thought we ordered ahead to speed thing along!  Spend just shy of three hours at this establishment. Food was okay but not worth that time commitment. Be warned you may be waiting longer than expected. YMMV.
