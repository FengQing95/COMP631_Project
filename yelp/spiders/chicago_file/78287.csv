Little Goat Diner////The tonkatsu was pretty mediocre and not really much to write home about but I think that's because the LOS DROWNED was SO DELICIOUS that it overshadowed everything else on the table, honestly. It was so juicy and so flavorful, very Stephanie Izard - punched me in the face with flavor. Really good. I wish I had it in front of my right now actually, because I'd eat it again.
