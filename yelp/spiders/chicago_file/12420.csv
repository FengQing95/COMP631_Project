Art Institute of Chicago////Way too much to see in one day , but my crew gave it our best shot! So glad we snagged tickets to the Monet and Chicago exhibit, it was our favorite part of the entire museum. Next time I need to find someone to be my tour guide because this place is MASSIVE and I don't want to miss anything. What a treat to be able to spend the weekend exploring a world class museum. Looking forward to the Obama portrait and Tiffany glass exhibits
