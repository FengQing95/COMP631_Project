Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first time eating Chicago Style pizza, and it was fantastic. Our waitress was Deborah, and she was one of the best waitresses I've ever had. Not an exaggeration. She was so friendly and helpful to someone in our group that couldn't have flour (she got the sausage crust). Deborah made the experience even better than it already was. I highly recommend if you're in the area!
