Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I asked my daughter in law to pick out a place where she would like to go and my son the vegetarian would not go.  Since my son was working the evening we went it worked out just fine for all.  I have her an unlimited budget which we managed to exceed.  Just kidding.  This is not for the light of wallet so if you want to spend some money and have one of the best steaks this is the place.
