Art Institute of Chicago////I love the Art Institute.  If you have even the remotest interest in art, you should consider becoming a member.  The Art Institute membership is, hands down, the best membership deal in the city.  They offer so much for you to do!  There have gallery talks, happy hours, social events, tours, dance performances, music performances, special viewing hours for exhibits, etc.  Every day there is something you can explore here, and as a member, it's super easy to do so.
