Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I think this might be one of the best restaurants in Chicago and I do not give great reviews easily. I actually dislike most restaurants that are rated high. I was at the Dearborn yesterday which gets a very high reviews and I was totally disappointed. I've been other places like Fat Rice and have been totally disappointed. Â The food was off the charts here and so was the service. Truly impeccable.
