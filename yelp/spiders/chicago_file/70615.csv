Little Goat Diner////I've gotta say: Everything that Stephanie Izard touches turns to gold. Why else would she have won the 4th season of Top Chef? I may be a little biased in this review because I have a friend that has a friend that is a very close friend of hers. So close, that when I went to Girl and the Goat for my 22nd birthday dinner, she sat down with my party and chatted with us for almost an hour. It was probably one of the most memorable birthdays I've ever had. Its not everyday you get to eat fried oysters with a celebrity chef that you admire.
