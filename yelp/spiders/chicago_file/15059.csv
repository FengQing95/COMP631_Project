Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have always been underwhelmed by Chicago pizza whenever I've had it, which is only to say that I'm really picky and particular about pizza sauce. That's really the only thing that I thought was lacking with Lou's, but honestly, I think that no spices actually might be Chicago-style... I suspected before and I'm pretty sure it's the case.
