The Purple Pig////I came here on a Thursday night around 7 and there was a ~45 minute wait for a party of 2. The place is very crowded and tight as most people have mentioned, but it makes sense because the place is very popular so I'd prefer that over an extra long wait. After I got the text notifying me of my table being ready, we were seated right away and our waiter was there quickly.
