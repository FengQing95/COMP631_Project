Art Institute of Chicago////Heck, I am not really an art expert and even I know how crazy these collection are. Where else can you find Picasso (10~15 paintings on display), Monets (about 25 paintings on display), Van Gogh (about 8 paintings on display), and other famous paintings all in one place? This is simply a must-visit destination in Chicago and give yourself at least 2~3 hours if you just want to quickly scan through most of the famous paintings because it will take you at least a day to explore and study every detail in the museum.
