Little Goat Diner////The bok choy salad was sweet and light, and the pork belly was tender and juicy. I only wish they had more pork belly, since it was so good. The scallion pancake that everything rested on tasted a bit weird. It was a bit too thick, so I didn't get the light, puffy consistency that I was expecting. There was also way too much salt in the pancake.
