Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Deep dish pizza is a must when you visit Chicago. My recommendations are the "Lou" or "The Classic." The crust is crispy yet the pizza is very thick which was a good contrast. The spinach cheese bread is also amazing. When ordering a salad, just be aware that a single salad could feed probably 3-4 people. The family size was huge and was good enough for our table of 12 people. The spaghetti was alright but nothing out of this world. Pizza is the way to go.
