Little Goat Diner////Also, this review is for the "diner" part of Little Goat. I use the quotes because I've never had to wait for an hour to be seated at a diner, nor have I ever seen the food items here at any other diner. Yes, diners are known for gargantuan menus, but Asian influences (banh mi, kim chi)? Not so common.
