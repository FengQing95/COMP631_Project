Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Definitely make reservations here - when we checked in for our 8:30 reservation, the wait was over two hours without one. Sangria (the red variety, at least) was strong, with maybe a bit too much brandy; the cava, on the other hand, was delicious and I could drink pitchers of it. The tapas here are good, but I think Emilio's are better, particularly the goat cheese and tomato sauce (my favorite) and the ham and cheese croquettes. The one major standout here is the short ribs, which come with the most amazing manchego cheese mashed potatoes.
