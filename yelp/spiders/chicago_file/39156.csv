Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm still thinking about the meal I had here. I have had Bavette's bookmarked for quite some time. Everyone raves about how great it is that I had to try it for myself. I wanted to go somewhere special for my boyfriend birthday and he wanted Bavettes. We made reservations about a month in advanced because this place is always packed! It was hard getting a reservation at an early time. We came in at around 9 and was asked to sit in the waiting area until our table is ready. The restaurant itself is beautiful. It's very dark and romantic. The waiting area had these comfy couches but we only waited for about 5 minutes.
