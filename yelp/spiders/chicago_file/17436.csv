Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Living in Chicago for a few months and trying to find the best of the best deep dish Chicago pizza. This review is in comparison with other deep dish pizza's I've had thus far. I can't pinpoint what it was about Lou Malnati's that made it not #1...the buttery-flaky curst was awesome but not as fluffy as I would have liked, the service was a little bit slow (be aware that right around 5pm it seems as though the entire city of Chicago is trying to come in for some pizza).
