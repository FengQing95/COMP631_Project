Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The first table at which we were seated was a bit small and in an area with heavy foot traffic, so we requested to move.  They were very accommodating and moved us to a booth which was great.  We started with the thick cut bacon, which in my opinion was an improvement over the bacons at other steakhouses due to the peppercorn enhanced flavor.  For an entree, the 10 oz filet with bearnaise was prepared perfectly; you could cut it with a butter knife.  Our sides were the truffle mac n cheese and the pommes frites, both of which were delicious.  We finished with the famous chocolate cream pie which definitely lived up to its reputation.
