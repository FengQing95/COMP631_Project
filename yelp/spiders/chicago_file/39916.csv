Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our dessert of chocolate cream pie was insanely good. The chocolate was rich and toned down by a cool light chocolate cream on top. From start to finish, this meal went above and beyond my (already high) expectations. I wouldn't think twice about making the 2 and a half hour trip to Chicago just to eat here again.
