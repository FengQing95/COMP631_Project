Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza is exceptional! This was my first time having deep dish and I had one slice of the Classic and the Lou. I liked veggie pizzas more so I enjoyed the Lou more. Why 3 stars? The service. They had SOOOOO many staff members and they all seemed unorganized. We had a party of 5 and for whatever reason the party of 4 for seated before us with no wait but we had to wait about 10 mins to get seated. We were all hangry (hungry and angry) so we ordered ahead of time in hope of having the pizza semi ready by the time we got seated. We sat down and our waitress was pretty inattentive. Our drinks went empty quite often and the table of 5 females that sat down after us had their pizzas before us. We waited about 50 mins from the time we ordered until we got our food. I would suggest coming here when you aren't super hungry because you'll be waiting a while! Too many staff members with too much confusion amongst them! There's no reason to have 3 bus boys cleaning one table or 5 hostess at the hostess stand.
