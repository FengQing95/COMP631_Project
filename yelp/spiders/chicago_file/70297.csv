Little Goat Diner////While I could probably live off of these bloody mary's alone, I thought it would probably be best to chase the vodka with some food, you know, since that's what we originally came for. This menu is certainly not for the faint of heart, or for that matter - those prone to heart attacks. The menu is ambitious, and delicious, but not necessarily nutritious. Fat Elvis waffles, breakfast spaghetti and bull's eye french toast (with crispy chicken) are just a few of the heavy hitters you'll find on the menu - so bring your appetite when you come to eat here. Sure, there are a few lighter and possibly healthier menu options... but let's be honest, that's not why you came here (it was for the bloody Mary).
