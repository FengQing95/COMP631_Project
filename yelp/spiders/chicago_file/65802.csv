Smoque BBQ////Inside it's a very low key space with the menu on the wall. When we walked in a guy welcomed us and gave us a paper menu. The girl talking orders was very nice and gave us recommendations on what to get. We decided to vibe with ribs and brisket with Mac and cheese and cornbread for sides.
