Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here for dinner and had an amazing experience. We had garlic shrimp, ham croquetas, Â brussels sprouts salad, hanger steak, grilled green peppers, stuffed mushrooms, spicy potatoes (and a few other things I can't remember). Everything tasted incredible, and the portions were perfect. It's easy to eat without being overly full, but if you want to be really full that is also very possible. We saw another table order paella and regretted not getting it after we saw it. They mix it at the table for you and it smelled really good.
