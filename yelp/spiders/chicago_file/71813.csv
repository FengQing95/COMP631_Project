Little Goat Diner////We had a brunch in the upstairs room at Little Goat for our family/close friends (22 people total) after our courthouse wedding.  Everything was wonderful!  We worked with Tiffany to plan the event and she made the process very easy.  She was responsive and helpful throughout our correspondence.  The space is beautiful and food was wonderful (and plentiful!).  The staff working the event were also truly amazing - they were courteous and helpful, and went out of their way to ensure everyone was comfortable and happy.  I would highly recommend this space for any private brunch or dinner!
