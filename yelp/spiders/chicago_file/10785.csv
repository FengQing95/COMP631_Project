Art Institute of Chicago////This is truly one of the greatest art museums I have been to. If you've seen an artist in a textbook, they have at least one piece represented here. That really isn't an exaggeration. The collection is laden with recognizable pieces, so it makes it accessible from the outset, and then you are drawn in by the lesser-known works.
