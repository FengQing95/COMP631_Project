Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The clincher? My husband cut his lip on a chipped beer class. It happens--it sucks, but whatever right?  We pointed it out to waitress and she promptly took it back with it being a  little over half full. She didn't bring him back a full beer!  Meaning: they had either re-poured his other beer into a new glass (um hello?) or only poured the new glass that full. I had to say something--really????? C'mon now.  Sorry, his lip is bleeding--don't insult us.
