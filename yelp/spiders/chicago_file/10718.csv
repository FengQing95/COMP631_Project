Art Institute of Chicago////Allocate several hours to truly explore the museum and to have enough time to visit the different exhibits. The bf and I got there around 11 and didnt leave until 2pm. I'll also say that even within that 4 hour time frame we really had to pick and chose what we wanted to see. Monet's water lilies series is here as well as several pieces from picasso and Dali.
