The Purple Pig////We sat at the end of the bar where all the food were coming out. We saw how chaotic the kitchen was, but a beautiful chaotic where they all worked in harmony to spit out great food in a matter of minutes. The young chefs also tried everything that came out to make sure taste is on point. It was like watching Hell's Kitchen but no yelling! We got the pork belly, roasted duck, octopus and a couple of drinks. The portion fit the price, so you won't be getting ripped off here or leaving hungry. The pork belly was nice and crispy and tender. Perfectly seasoned. The duck... good style of cooking duck- it was by no means dry at all. Plenty of meat and literally fell off the bone tender. I also LOVE the trout roe on the yogurt-like sauce...so good. And the last... octopus with green beans, potatoes and this lemon, basil oil- like a chimichurri, went so well with the charred octopus.
