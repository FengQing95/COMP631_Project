Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Thank you for taking the time to write a review, Susie! Sorry to hear you were disappointed with the pizza you received. We do spread a thin layer of sauce on top of our pizzas however, we always encourage our guests to order their pizza to their liking so if you would like extra sauce, you got it! We hope you'll give us another try the next time you are in town. Thanks again for your review.
