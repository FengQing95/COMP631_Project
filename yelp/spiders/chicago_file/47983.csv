Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I threw my boyfriend a surprise party last night and the entire experience from beginning to end was awesome! Ashley, the planner, made everything so easy and our room was beautiful (the Toledo room - great chandelier!) I picked out the menu beforehand and all 21 of our guests loved everything - the rioja short ribs, garlic shrimp and bacon wrapped dates were some of our favorites. We even got to play our own music in the room, which was a nice touch. Also, the servers were friendly and attentive - really everything was amazing
