Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My new policy is to give a business at least 3 times before I write a review.  I've been to Bavette's at least 6 times and have not been disappointed.  From wine and dinner at the bar to a nice table.  Its time to write.  The service is great and the food delicious.  The crab cake is one of the best I've had.  The trout Caesar salad is always a good choice if you want to eat light.  The beef Stroganoff  is outstanding.  The bread is not to be missed.  Great wine selection and craft cocktails made by bar tenders that know what they are doing.
