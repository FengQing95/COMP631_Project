The Purple Pig////The menu is designed to share and the plates are very reasonably priced, especially considering how delicious everything is! Every plate was something new and incredibly delicious. The gnocchi with neck bone gravy is most definitely the best gnocchi I have ever had in my life and will be something I never forget. The blackout cake was also a stand out for me. The food was quick to come but expertly paced from beginning to end. Definitely get a cheese selection (we had the cheese with Truffle- amazing).
