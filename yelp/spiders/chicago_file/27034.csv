Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////so good so filling, I was told east coasters dont typically like deep dish but this girl did. the crust, the flavor, yum so filling. I really wanted to compare to other deep dish faves in chicago but lou malnatis is as far as I got and I dont regret it. also I feel like im saying illuminati when pronouncing the name.
