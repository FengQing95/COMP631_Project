Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started with the Oysters and Shrimp de Jonge.  Oysters were fresh and sweet.  Tasty with Crystal hot sauce, a nice mignonette sauce, and cocktail sauce.  The shrimp were awesome in more of a marsala garlic sauce rather than your typical De Jonge.  Awesome Texas toast to soak up that sauce too!
