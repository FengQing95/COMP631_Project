Little Goat Diner////I would have given it 3 stars based strictly on the food -- which was fine, nothing great.  The 4 stars are because of the incredibly warm, friendly and efficient staff and service -- combined with a fun atmosphere and outdoor dining with some pretty views and people watching.  From the hostess to the server and everyone in between -- I was impressed, much more so than in fancier restaurants these days.  I will be back -- but I probably will pick something other  than the grilled cheese and the broccoli.
