Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We've ordered Lou's frozen pies on a couple of occasions and LOVED them.  Upon first arriving to town, this was our first stop.  We even called ahead to have our deep dish started so we wouldn't have a long wait.  We ordered a medium sausage, pepperoni, black olives and mushrooms and within 20 minutes it arrived.  I will say, it was quite "soupy".  Yes, I know the the juice is from the tomatoes, but even our frozen pizzas didn't have that consistency.  The flavor of the sausage was a little off for me.  We had talked about Lou's for months and months... and I think our pie was a bit of a let down.  We had planned to return before we left Chicago, but after having our pizza, decided against it.  I think had we ordered the personal size pizza, maybe we wouldn't have had such a "soupy" pie.  Our daughter ordered the spaghetti w/meatballs and it was really good.  The marinara sauce was fantastic, so was the homemade meatball.
