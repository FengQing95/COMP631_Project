Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After waiting about 20 minutes for a table, a couple left their seats at the bar and I immediately snagged them. The good news is that you can order food at the bar and get all the drinks you would ever want. Our bartender was super friendly and attentive. My wife had a glass of wine, I had a local craft beer, and we ordered a caesar salad to gnaw on while we waited for our pizza. The salad was excellent -- fresh and well-dressed.
