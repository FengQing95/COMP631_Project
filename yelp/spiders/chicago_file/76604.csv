Little Goat Diner////He liked his goat burger, however, said that there was nothing special about it and the burger was a bit salty. I had the lamb ribs and it was good. It fell right off the bone as I was hoping for. I am not too big on lamb (they didn't have the duck I wanted anymore!), but the vegetables and strawberries served with this dish married the flavors altogether very well.
