Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is one of the best pizza spots in chicago - if you know what to get. I find their standard pizzas to be mediocre at best, but if you go for their specialty pizzas - you can easily be blown away. "The Lou" is my favorite, and I would probably give them 5 stars for that pizza alone as it is my favorite pizza in all of Chicago that I have had.
