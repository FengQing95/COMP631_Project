Smoque BBQ////One small downside...and it's really only because, as my fiance says, I don't like people...they pack you in to these tables, and we were seated across from each other, but pretty much packed in like sardines with a people on either side. Â At first, I was a bit uncomfortable, as though I were eavesdropping on these other tables...but once the food came, I was so engrossed in the delicious meal, I hardly even noticed anyone else was even there.
