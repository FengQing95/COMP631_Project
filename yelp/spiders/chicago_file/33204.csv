Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I had high expectations given I'm a big fan of Gilt Bar.  This place had a different vibe but the part I wasn't impressed with was the food. There just wan't anything super inventive or creative about it.  Ordered honey apple salad, short rib stroganoff and the fried chicken.  I believe there's a way to make rich food satisfying without feeling like you're drinking a vat of fat and needless to say, that is what I got with the dishes I had.  Maybe I need to try it again but should I be in the area again, Gilt Bar would probably be my choice.
