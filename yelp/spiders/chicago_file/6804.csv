Art Institute of Chicago////I'll keep this review at three stars for the actual work but my experience at the Lichtenstein exhibit yesterday was completely marred by the slobby, rude patrons who were allowed to snap away, taking photos of every piece of work they could--and even the ones that were forbidden. Since when do museums allow the taking of photos at all??? It is SUCH a distraction to those of us who actually would like to VIEW the art and the peasants who engage in this behavior actually become angry if/when you walk by while they are taking their photo! It's bad enough that nearly everyone walks around like a zombie listening to their little audio tour and walking into others as they do it but now we have to contend also with overzealous, misplaced photo taking? At what point will the museum take steps to ensure that it doesn't become an amusement park? Because it's quickly becoming that. Between "kid stations" and audio tours and writing out how to view an exhibit, it has taken all of the joy out of forming one's own perspective on the art, being alone with the art and taking it in in silence. I am not an old person. I can't be the only younger person who feels this way! PLEASE AIC, stop this runaway train before it is too late. Stop the photo taking and boorish behavior of patrons!
