Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is an upper-mid scale tapas spot that retains a strong following a score of years after it opened. That's impressive. Seriously, that people would continue to want to dine here two decades after it was the hot spot on the Halsted strip in LP bespeaks something. What that is, I suppose is highly subjective but it will make a review nonetheless.
