Little Goat Diner////Moving on to the food: come hungry. Unlike most hipster/trendy-places, this place does not skimp on the food. I will note that the corned beef hash and eggs was very greasy, but that's how it should be! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. (I will say coffee for $4 is kind of insane, but you cannot NOT have coffee with breakfast so I had to get coffee anyway.)
