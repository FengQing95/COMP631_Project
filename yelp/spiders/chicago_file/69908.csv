Little Goat Diner////I had no idea what to expect with the "Kimchi, Eggs, Bacon, and Pancakes Asian Breakfast Tasty Thing". I was hoping that it wasn't all separate and the waiter explained to me when I was ordering that it was all combined in pancake batter. This was packed with flavor and every bite was a little bit of a surprise - you never knew which ingredients you were going to get and how much of each. It was topped with sprouts which made it taste very fresh.
