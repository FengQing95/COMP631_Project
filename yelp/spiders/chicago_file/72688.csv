Little Goat Diner////We were looking for a family friendly place in the city after the marathon to indulge, and Little Goat did not disappoint! The food was excellent. I had the Reuben, my mother had Los Drowned and my boys easily shared chicken tenders. We also had a side Very Lil Caesar, and it was delicious across the board. The meal - including iced tea and coke was barely $55 - well-priced for the city. Also the staff was attentive, and our waitress, Camille, was totally on top of it. We'll definitely come back!
