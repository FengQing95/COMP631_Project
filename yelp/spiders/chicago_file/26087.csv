Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting Chicago I was told to go to Lou Malnati's pizzeria to experience my very first official Chicago deep dish. And I have to say they did not disappoint. The crust was buttery and crispy. Sausage and garlic spinach topping was absolutely delightful , it went along very well with the very flavorful tomato sauce that goes on top. Their tomato sauce has so much flavor in it and it's not like drowned in the garlic flavor which I really don't mind. It's very savory yet not acidic but also not sweet sauce.. Hard to explain.. add to my big surprise, it was also good the following day just microwaved. Very shocked. I also rate pizza this way cuz I feel that there's always left over when getting a pie.. and I hate it when u get a good pie when it's hot but nasty once it cools off.. I never waste food.. lol..
