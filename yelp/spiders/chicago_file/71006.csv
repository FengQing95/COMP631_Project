Little Goat Diner////I love breakfast food, and I am huge fan of  Top Chef and I rooted for Stephanie Izard  the whole time. I like to find eateries that provide excellent food and if I can get it for a good price all the better. With that said, I am willing to a pay higher price for food if it exceeds my expectations. So, I figured since I was trying food creations from such an accomplished Chef I felt it was important to try something I would normally not try.
