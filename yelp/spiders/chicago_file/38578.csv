Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For the main course I ordered the dry aged ribeye while my date ordered the classic ribeye, both medium rare. They were cooked to perfection and had an incredible sear and fantastic marbeling. They were both served with the best bearnaise sauce we've ever had -- it was the perfect consistency and not too heavy, which is definitely tough to do with a bearnaise. I also ordered my steak with the bone marrow accompaniment which was definitely gratuitous and didn't add anything to the plate in my opinion. The prices for the quality and portion of the meat was comparable to any other great steak house just way tastier in my mind.
