Smoque BBQ////My friend was visiting from NYC and wanted to try this place because he saw it on tv. We went Saturday night and the line was so long that we had to leave. Looking at people eagerly waiting in line and seeing people thoroughly enjoying their food inside told us we had to come back to try this place. We went back Sunday late afternoon and the wait wasn't too bad. We ordered a pound of brisket and the rib combo. The briskets were moist, tender and melt in your mouth kind. I would definitely go back for the briskets. The St. Louis ribs were better than the baby backs.
