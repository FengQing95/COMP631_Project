Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Wanted to explore tapas options other than my favorite, I decided to give BabaReeba a try. First impression was pretty good! I started out with a free Pintxos platter (Yelp check-in offer), which had 6 little items. Loved the short rib stuffed pepper & chorizo-wrapped date. Also liked the stuffed mushrooms, shrimp in garlic oil. Only letdown was the lamb kebob, which I thought was a bit too gamey and tough. But overall a pleasant meal, so I'll be back to try more tapas!
