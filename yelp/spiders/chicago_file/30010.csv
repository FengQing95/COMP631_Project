Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Can I please say how the calamari appetizer is literally one of the best calamari I have ever had? When it was served on the table, I was not expecting much already because it looked too crispy and fried. But wow, the combination of the calamari with the house dipping sauce is AMAZING. The dipping sauce is not your typical tomato sauce. It's refreshing and it reminded me a little bit of a mignonette sauce used for raw oysters.
