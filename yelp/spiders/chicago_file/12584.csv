Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////  Malnati's pizza WAS one of the greats growing up in Chicago.  I think though they have changed and not for the better.  First, the crust.  It looks wonderful and appetizing, but really it's dry, lacks any flavor whatsoever, and nearly comes across as semi-stale.  It wasn't cooked thoroughly and had doughy spots, which is a common complaint.  Next, the sauce.  I always appreciated that Lou's does not drown the pizza in sauce like other deep dish pizzas.  But there is a quality downgrade here.  They obviously use  canned of stewed tomatoes.  Canned anything, for this price, makes me cringe.  The sausage I cannot complain about.  The cheese is a near perfect amount.  They overdid it on the garlic in my opinion. I shouldnt leave a pizza place feeling queezy from garlic overload.  Go to Gino's or even Ranalli's.
