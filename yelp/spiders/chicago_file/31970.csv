Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Nice staff.  Tried the Chicago Malnati pizza.  Very cheesy and just okay.  Crust was very buttery.  Interior was very nice with lots of seating options.  Easy half mile walk from The Drake Hotel.  Ended up giving my 3/4 pizza leftovers to homeless along walk back to hotel as wasn't my favorite.  Think I prefer Gino's East pizza better.  Granted for Chicago style pizza I've heard both Lou Malnati's and Gino's are very popular.  Even though it wasn't my favorite pizza it was a pleasant experience and would recommend trying a Chicago style pizza if in the area.
