Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A very good tapas experience.  It's a hugely busy place, but they've plenty of wait staff, and the place is much bigger than you'd imagine it would be from the outside (or even after you enter).  A short walk from the train stop and just a few stops out of the Loop, this place generates fun thru good food and drink, and I'll definitely go back when in Chicago again.
