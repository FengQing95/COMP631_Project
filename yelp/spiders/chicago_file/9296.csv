Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute was wonderful as always. The employees throughout polite and helpful. The art of course is incomparable. We saw the Gauguin exhibit and thoroughly enjoyed it. The Fast Pass really sped up our entry to the museum. All that said, I was crestfallen to discover that the courtyard cafe I visited in 2013 was no longer serving. You can buy food at the cafeteria (something for everybody including my 12 year old), and the salad greens were very fresh (I'm a salad snob) then sit out on the courtyard. Â But the fountain in the courtyard was dirty brown on the bottom (not last time, it was blue), and where were the ducks? They stole the show. AI, reopen the courtyard cafe and bring the ducks back! It was so charming and I told everyone about it. The cafeteria was fine but... not as decadent and memorable.
