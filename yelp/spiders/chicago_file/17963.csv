Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First, I was born and raised here in Chicago. I currently live in Florida but come back yearly for a visit. We ordered a pizza from here and must say in my opinion, this is one of the worse pizzas I have ever had in Chicago. Ordered the thin crust, it was like having pizza on a cracker. They put sooo little sausage on it, I could hardly see it. The cheese was also very little. Â It was almost like buying a .99 Totino's pizza except I paid $27 including delivery. They charged $3.75 for delivery, I called them up to eye if that went to the driver and was told NO. So on top of $27+ I gave the driver a $3 tip. Would I ever order from them again? NOOOOOOO!
