Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What an experience. It wasn't dinner. It was an experience from beginning to end. I have never had such good service in my life, first of all. Second, the food was sublime. At first, I thought that the place was going to be a rip off when I saw there was a $16.00 wedge salad on the menu. It was amazing. I could have just had that an our shrimp appetizer and be done with it. The steaks were cooked perfectly. The sides were just.that.good, especially the brussels sprouts roasted with parm cheese. We had chocolate cream pie for dessert and it was so rich after our big meal we had to take it home. Actually, we had to take home most of what we ate. Was it pricey? Yes. For the whole evening, dinner for two, with the bill, tax, tip, no booze, and valet it came out to about $300.00. But we ordered a lot of food and my husband got the most expensive steak on the menu. It was his birthday, what can I say? If you're looking to celebrate in style and have money to burn, you want Bavette's.
