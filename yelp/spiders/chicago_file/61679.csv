Smoque BBQ////Only complaint was the worker didn't know if the cornbread was sweet (made with sugar), I should have ordered it to find out. Brisket was amazing. Sausage was a single link for $4.50, was ok flavor. Great thick sauce. Would definitely come back. BBQ beans are pretty tangy, not my preference but still good. This is a fast casual restaurant, but the service was really good.
