Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went here for their famous Chicago pizza. The hostess said the wait would be 50 mins but it only took 20 mins. We preordered the pizza and waited about 20-30 minutes once we were seated for the food. The pizza was delicious- I would recommend getting a small and not an individual (leftovers are always good). They did mess up one order at our table but it was a small fix and they adjusted it on the bill. Definitely worth going to!
