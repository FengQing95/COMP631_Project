Little Goat Diner////This is place is awesome, stopped by for brunch with the family. The batter for the chicken tenders...man oh man are those chicken tenders so good! The braised beef (los drowned) was what I ordered and I'm coming back for more. Wife had the sloppy goat and it was just okay, but we enjoyed our visit.
