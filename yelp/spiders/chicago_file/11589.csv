Art Institute of Chicago////Ahh, I could go on and on about this place. But a couple of other things I wanted to point out- it currently houses the famous "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte" painting by Georges Seurat, and it's something you have to look at from far away to appreciate the whole picture, then up close to appreciate and be awestruck by the finer details that went into making the whole thing.
