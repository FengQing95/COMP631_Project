Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Overall everything was delicious and we had no complaints. One little thing was that we had to wait for the patio seating (it was a gorgeous day!) but it's reasonable because the patio seating is first come first serve. We got sangria at the bar while we waited. Their sangria is yummy according to my friend- and they were nice enough to make me a regular/virgin sangria. The waiter also gave me two birthday desserts for free, which was super nice of him. I plan on coming back and bringing some family with me!
