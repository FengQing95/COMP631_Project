Little Goat Diner////I settled on the Bulls Eye French Toast after my server recommended it. I had read good reviews of this dish, so I went for it. I wasn't as impressed as others seemed to be. I think the bread part was delicious. Yum. Egg cooked in each slice. But strawberries AND fried chicken? Â I wasn't such a fan of the combination of those two.
