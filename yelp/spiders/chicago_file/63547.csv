Smoque BBQ////If you want awesome BBQ on the north side this is your place. A little noisy (my parents found the noise troubling) but worth the trip none the less. Very casual--you wait in line to order your food, and will be seated after you order. It feels as much like a cafeteria as it does a restaurant, but the friendly and attentive staff keep everything moving smoothly.
