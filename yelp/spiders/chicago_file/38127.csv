Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We didn't BYOB. We tried their cocktails instead. The lion's tail was a hit but the Cognac sazerac was bit strong for me. Also something to note is that many of their appetizers come with a lot of bread... it could be Texas toast or house bread basket or some other grilled bread.
