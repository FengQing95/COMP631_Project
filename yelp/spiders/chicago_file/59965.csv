Smoque BBQ////Here's my issue. The smoke seemed fake. It tasted like they used smoked flavorings in their sauce rather than actually smoking the food. I could be wrong, but that is what it tasted like. Their website says otherwise of course, everything in this place is smoked and everything is smoked using varied woods depending on the dish (they expertly chose the right flavor combinations). I don't know, I've been in a few chili-cook-offs that had contestants with very apparent smoke-flavoring and that's what my meal here reminded me of.
