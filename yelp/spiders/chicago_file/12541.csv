Art Institute of Chicago////The place is huge and I would suggest allowing at least two to three hours to explore all three levels. We were lucky to have caught the presidential portraits before they were gone. There are a number of famous pieces housed in the museum. There are both stairs and elevators for you to go around. Art aficionado or not, you'll have a fun time.
