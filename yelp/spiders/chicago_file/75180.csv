Little Goat Diner////The food is tasty and the portion is very generous.  I end up taking half of my french toast to go in the end.  I think Chef Izard has done a great job distinguishing The Little Goat from the Girl & the Goat while maintaining the quality of each dish.  If you love brussels sprouts, I would not hesitate to recommend her brussels sprouts!  (I only wish she would also offer her cauliflowers and green beans here!)
