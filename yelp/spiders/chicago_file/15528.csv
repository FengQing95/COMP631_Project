Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizzas, once the pizza's arrived we were drooling just at the smell! After the server put the pizzas on the table she proceeded to cut slices for everyone, you could hear the crispy crust!! Made you want to stick your face directly into the pizza!! Once on my plate, I decided to fork and knife it for the first bite... oh soo good! top notch, one of the better deep dish pizza's I have had! Hearty, flavorful, and enough cheese but not too much to bring the whole pizza together. Lastly, the crust... it was divine, crispy, flaky, butter, and sooo darn good.. almost like a prefect pastry crust expect savory not sweet. Made you eat each slice all the way to the end! No left over crust here!! So the pizza's were oh soo good!! Therefore we decided to order a Choc. Chip cookie dessert pizza... that was great as well, the Choc. chip cookie crust was rich and gooy but soo good - good for 4 people.
