Smoque BBQ////I love this BBQ! We actually had them cater our wedding last year and it was PERFECT. We had brisket and pulled pork, macaroni and cheese, baked beans, salad and their amazing corn bread. Some people thought BBQ didn't go with our beautiful reception venue, but once they tasted how good Smoque tasted, they completely understood our choice.
