Little Goat Diner////Decor? You've heard about it. But can we talk about service? There was a little blip from the get-go with our large group reservation. But you wouldn't know it, since the staff kicked it into 3rd gear making our table happen out of thin air. And I had just enough time to grab a quick drink--perfect.
