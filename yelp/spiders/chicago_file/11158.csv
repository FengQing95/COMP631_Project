Art Institute of Chicago////Excellent! I wanted to cry tears of happiness as I walked through. This was one of the places we were most excited about visiting on our trip, plus it was rated #1 museum in the world on Trip Advisor, how cool. We made sure to be there before it opened so we arrived at 1010am and I ordered a drink from the busy Starbucks across the street to pass the time. A short line began to form ten minutes later and we joined. There are three lines: one for visitors, those with a fast pass, and members. We had purchased tickets when visiting the Sky Deck the previous day ($39 for entrance to both) and just needed to exchange our stub for a ticket. $1/item for checkin. They gave us a guide to the museum and we were easily able to navigate through the 4 floors and exhibits. The first level is split, so it's more like 5 floors.
