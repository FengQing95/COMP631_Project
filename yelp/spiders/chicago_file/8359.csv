Art Institute of Chicago////The first poor service that we received came from a woman at the entrance gate who was not only extremely rude and condescending, but physically pushed us back when we tried to get here attention (she was chatting with someone at the time). She was older, about 5'2, and had blondish curly hair about chin length. We were about to leave but then decided we'd already paid, we should stay. So we went to check our bags, only to find out that we'd have to throw away the very expensive leftovers that they contained. We then went to the ticket line for our refund, and when asked why, the gentleman (early to mid 20s, brown hair, 5'10 or so, some facial hair) rolled his eyes at us. I then reiterated that the woman was very rude to us, and where she was located, and he sarcastically replied "yup, i'm sure she was. i'm so sure" and watched us as we left, rolling his eyes again.
