Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's is my favorite Chicago deep dish. I like Gino's a lot, too, and it is indeed more like a pie, but the crust at Lou's is unbeatable. Buttery, just a bit crispy, but not dead and thick and chewy like Giordano's. This is the kind of pizza where you actually want to eat the crust--it's not just some handle for you to work with (not that I would ever pick up deep dish with my hands). And the sauce is so well-balanced and well-seasoned and the cheese is so good. As far as toppings go, their sausage is amazing, so I nearly always get the Chicago Classic. I've had the Lou before as well, and each time I've had it I've only thought that I was wasting stomach space that could be filled by the Chicago Classic. I understand the need for a good vegetarian option, and it is good, but the sausage is unearthly in its deliciousness.
