Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I will give it a 4 because I really like the food. The service was a little slow but to be fair it was very busy for a week night. I enjoyed the Sangria but the food is really where it's at. They have a tapas for everyone, I particularly enjoyed the stuffed mushrooms and the scallops with saffron. The scallops were perfectly cooked and not fishy at all.
