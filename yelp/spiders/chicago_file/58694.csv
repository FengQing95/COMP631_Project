Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was the first Tapas restaurant I went to and I loved it all!! The food was delicious. My friend and I ordered several tapas and a sangria pitcher (so so good!). The potatoes were addicting- don't leave without trying these. And I couldn't get enough of the spicy tomato aioli sauce. I strongly recommend this place and can't wait to go back and try more tapas!
