Art Institute of Chicago////Within this building, a Beaux-Arts structure built in 1893, you'll find three levels filled with treasures covering more than five thousand years of artistic expression. A tour of the massive collection, which includes some of the finest art ever produced, is like a quick trip around the world, because the galleries here feature a vast array of works from Europe, Asia, Africa, the ancient Americas, and our own U.S. of A. Renowned, immediately recognized pieces by Georges Seurat, Vincent van Gogh, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Edward Hopper, Georgia O'Keefe, and Grant Wood share space with ancient Chinese bronzes, Olmec statuary, African wood carvings, Japanese screens, Marc Chagall stained-glass, and Frank Lloyd Wright windows. Free, regularly scheduled events include 30-Minute Masterpiece of the Week, a quick but detailed look at one parttcular work of art, in-depth discussions about temporary installations, thematic walking tours, and evening lectures. A program called Voices brings historical figures in art history to life through actors who portray the celebrated individuals, basing their performances on personal letters, private papers, and biographies. International Â classical and jazz musicians, as well as ballet, modern, and ethnic dancers, frequently appear in conjunction with special exhibitions. The Kraft Education Center is an ideal way for parents to introduce their children to paintings and sculpture via hands-on activities. The informal, cafeteria-style Court Cafe and the more upscale Garden Restaurant will satisfy your hunger while you nurture your soul and intellect. Tourists should set aside at least one full day to explore all the Institute has to offer; lucky locals can visit often, and hopefully do.
