Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I love a good steak as much as the next carnivore, but I can't eat much of it, so I ordered the 6 oz petite duchess filet.  It was the perfect portion for me and cooked medium-well to my liking.  I also ordered the bone marrow, which was good but not necessary.  Bavette's serves up a little tin of their special steak salt - you cannot miss this salt on your steak!
