Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place gets real busy.  We ordered the classic deep dish pizza.  I came to Chicago for the deep dish and this was the first place we came to.  I was unfortunately underwhelmed.  I recently had deep dish for the first time in SF and it was basically on par with that pizza pie.  Not that I didn't enjoy it but I guess I was expecting more from Chicago deep dish.
