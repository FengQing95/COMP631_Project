Art Institute of Chicago////What a brilliant way to introduce entire families to great works of art - because after playing this game a few times - every player knew every painting in the MASTERPIECE game by heart. From Kansas to Alaska to Maine; from Hawaii to Texas to Virginia - hundreds of thousands of Americans of all stations and levels of education knew these works of art on-sight, whether they had been to the Art Institute or not.
