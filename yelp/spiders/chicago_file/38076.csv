Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Let's see: In sum, I like the venue, I like the location, we always get great servers, I like the pacing (never too rushed), I like the cocktails (solid bartending), and I was very appreciative of the fact that they gave us a 4-top table, but at this price point I probably won't go back unless I'm on an expense account, and so we're thinking of cancelling the reservation for my upcoming birthday bash in favor of one of the other, probably better options.
