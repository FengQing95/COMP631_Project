Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we arrived for dinner, you betcha there was a lovely wait. People were crowded everywhere; from the waiting area inside, to the bar, and even outside on the streets. I don't want to know how everyone huddles together when the whether is extremely cold but I was glad I wasn't there to witness it. We put in our order for our stuff crust pizza which is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED while we waited. Remember, it takes a good half an hour for it to come out so if you order it at the table, you're only wasting valuable time.
