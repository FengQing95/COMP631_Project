Little Goat Diner////My boyfriend and I stopped in on Friday around 5:40 p.m. and were seated right away. We've tried to get a table on a few other occasions, but the wait has always been long. Seems we found the right time to go! There were a few open tables when we arrived. But before long, it was totally crowded.
