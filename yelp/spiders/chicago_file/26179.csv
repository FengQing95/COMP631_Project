Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were seated quickly and our waiter was very friendly. We ordered our pizza and beers, and our waiter warned us that the pizzas are made to order and do take some time. I think our wait was close to an hour, but I amused myself with editing photos from our Chicago exploring that morning. However, I would consider the fact that Lou's would not be a good lunch option for those working close by as it can take some time.
