The Purple Pig////Came across this place on Yelp and saw it had many reviews and the name was pretty cute so we decided to come for dinner. Our friend said this place was good but quite pricey but we still wanted to give it a try. There were plenty of seating outside and inside. So we chose to sit inside.
