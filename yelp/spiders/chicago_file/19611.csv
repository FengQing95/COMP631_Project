Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Overall great pizza, fantastic wings, and a phenomenal atmosphere with excellent service. Be prepared to wait like 30-45 for your pizza to get ready, but man when it gets there- totally worth it. If that feels like a long wait, I would highly encourage you to order the wings.
