Little Goat Diner////This is my second time and I loved it just as much as the first. First time was brunch, second time was dinner. Portions are generous and depending on the dish can even be shared by two. Â You must not leave without having dessert! It's worth saving room for and can't leave without it! Highly recommend making reservations as it is always consistently full.
