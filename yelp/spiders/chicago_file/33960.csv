Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The "on duty" manager came to talk to me and try to justify why they needed my CC up front none of which I believe. I paid my bill and tipped the bartender as I was not looking for anything for free - just respect. I walked out and went to RPM where I was treated with respect and had a great meal. Very disappointed. Save your money over rated!!
