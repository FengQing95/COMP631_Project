Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a medium "Malnati Chicago Classic," well enough for the four of us. It was a very basic pizza, came with just tomato sauce and their sausage. We had to add mushroom, spinach and pepperoni. I have to say, the only thing amazing was their sausage. It was very well seasoned, literally that was the only thing all of us ate and we didn't need the pepperoni.
