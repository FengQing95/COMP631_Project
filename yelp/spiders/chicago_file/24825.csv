Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Unfortunately, they seem to know that too. The servers can be quite slow - even when the restaurant is quiet. It's usually pretty busy, but the servers seem to really be stuck in one gear no matter how the night is going. Lou's has also decided to up the prices of their pizza from what I can gather, which is a shame. It's starting to become more of a special occasion restaurant than my usual pizza joint.
