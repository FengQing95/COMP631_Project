Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I stopped by for Brunch this weekend, and the wait was very long. I've never been here before, so I didn't know it was so popular. I ordered a Venetian Skillet with pancakes. The rest of my friends ordered a corn beef hash skillet, garden skillet, and veggie omelette. My Venetian Skillet was above average, but nothing too special. I really liked the corn beef hash skillet, and the rest of the items were also above average. I would give it a 3.5 stars for the skillets, but the pancake bumped their overall score to a 4. The pancake was delicious!!
