Little Goat Diner////Came here on a Sunday and boy was it packed! Be prepared to wait an hour or so but it is well worth the wait! I got the Los Drowned which is like a roast beef sandwich but with braised beef. They kick it up a notch with pickled peppers and onions which in my opinion made the sandwich as great as it was. Let's also not forget to mention the bread! It was still so crisp and crunchy even after it was doused in au jus! Definitely a must try!
