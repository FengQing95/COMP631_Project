Smoque BBQ////Always got bad tips or old dry ribs. I went 3 different times of the day on different days. Thinking the first time it was dry and old because they were sitting almost closing time. Then got it in the afternoon when they opens a till bad and them the late afternoon and still got the same stuff dry and old. Not koo. Got a new place for them Ribs
