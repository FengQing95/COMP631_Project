Little Goat Diner////While visiting Chicago, we decided to take the advice from family to try out the place. We arrived for brunch and was told it would be a 30-45 minutes wait for my boyfriend and I. We were okay waiting. We waited over an hour and during this time we kept seeing plenty of people who arrived after us get seated. When we finally spoke to the hostess, she asked if we were okay getting sat at the bar. At this point we were tired of waiting and just hungry so we agreed. Once we were sat in the corner, we waited an additional 30 minutes before we were even acknowledged or even given water by any of the staff. I was ready to walk away but my boyfriend insisted on waiting. Once we finally had our order in, our food arrived in about 10 minutes. We sat there watching all the food runners who were obviously doing an amazing job. I was just extremely disappointed and displeased with the staff and service. The menu items were also so random. Â Masa chips, Paratha burrito? It was not worth the wait or our time.
