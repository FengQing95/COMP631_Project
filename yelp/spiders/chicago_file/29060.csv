Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Oh the pizza!!!! We had the sausage pizza and lemme tell you... I can usually do damage on pizza, averaging 4-5 slices. However, this pizza... after two slices I was stuffed and couldn't move. It felt like each pizza slice weighed about a pound of yumminess. They certainly aren't stingy with the sausage. Instead of sprinkling morsels of sausage, it's like a a blanket of meaty goodness cooked to perfection. Also, as most people commented, the butter crust... Ridiculously good. It was so buttery, crispy and not greasy what so ever. I could just sit there and eat the crust... All day.
