The Purple Pig////They definitely lived up to the hype after all these years and I was super happy with all the menu items we ordered. My favorite dish was the crispy pig ears with kale. It was like having elevated Chicharr√≥n with crispy kale. The pickled banana peppers added the proper amount of acidity and the yolk from the fried egg soaked up all the flavors perfectly.
