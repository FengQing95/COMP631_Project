Art Institute of Chicago////Beautiful art museum with so much to see! We chose the Art Institute as a part of our city pass and to our surprise an audio guide was included with our admission! With our city pass we didn't have to wait in line and I'm glad we got there right after they opened because when we left a couple of hours later the line was out the door to get in! Highlights for me were Picasso's Guitarist, Seuret's Jardin, and the Thorne miniature rooms. I also enjoyed seeing the Chagall windows, Hopper's Nighthawks and Whistler's Mother. Unfortunately American Gothic was on loan to another museum so we didn't get to see it. Plan your visit ahead of time because the museum is very large and different buildings all connected on the first floor so if you miss something you may find yourself walking extra. The visitor guide has a nice list of art to see in an hour if you're pressed for time and also shows you where all of the restrooms and elevators/staircases are. The audio guide was very informative and easy to use! Also, if you lose something just ask a guard and they can radio to the entrances to see if someone turned it in. I had lost my scarf and was able to retrieve it thanks to the helpful staff. Unfortunately not all staff were as helpful. I asked a lady who looked like a volunteer at the information desk where the restroom was and she seemed off put that I didn't know the answer. She actually scoffed at me and then pointed in a vague direction for me to go find it myself. Skip the info desk and ask the guards in black vests instead! They are much nicer!
