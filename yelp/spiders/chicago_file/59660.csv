Smoque BBQ////The best straight up BBQ in the city, with a decent edge over Smoke Daddy's. We get Smoque catered at work once a month, and I've been to the actual establishment twice. The mac and cheese is the best...ever...anywhere. Man do I wish it was good for me. The BBQ beans and the cornbread are both excellent as well.
