Smoque BBQ////So I've been coming since it opened and have NEVER had a bad experience.  Service is quite speedy, despite the long lines, friendly; and the sweet tea (yes, sweet tea), mac n' cheese (just the right amount of sharpness), fries (crispy and not oily) and peach cobbler (sweet/tart) is incredible.  Even the cole slaw has merits all it's own (mostly vinegar with some sweetness and mustard seed for an additional note).
