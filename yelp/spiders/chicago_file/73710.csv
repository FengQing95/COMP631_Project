Little Goat Diner////Unfortunately, I just didn't feel that way. I ordered the "This Little Pig Went to China." I thought certain elements of the meal were really good, and others weren't. I was disappointed. We ended up stopping next door at the bakery where I got a Mexican chocolate scone, which was very good, to erase the food memory.
