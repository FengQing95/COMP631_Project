Smoque BBQ////I'm naturally pretty skeptical when it comes to BBQ places north of the Mason-Dixon line. More often than not you're paying a ton of money for mediocre food that merely serves as a reminder of what sort of thing you could be eating, if only you weren't in the midwest. So, when friends suggested we go to dinner at Smoque, managed expectations seemed to be appropriate.
