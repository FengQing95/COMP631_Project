Art Institute of Chicago////Wonderful place to come and spend the day. Three different levels of art and all different kinds and they even have groups come in that can be guided through the exhibits. There were a lot of people who worked there that were very knowledgeable about where exhibits were located and how to give directions as well. It is always nice to have helpful and gracious staff on hand to help visitors maneuver the maps. There were a lot of pamphlets and things available to explain what it was that we were looking at as well as an opportunity to check your bag and your jacket at the entrance. It was also one of the cheaper Chicago experiences which was nice.
