Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Had wild berry for brunch last weekend! There were many options I decided on the veggie burger and side salad with some sort of honey lime dressing all was delicious! Hubby ate the corned hash. Really liked it. We also ordered a side of lemon cream cheese French toast( something Like that) it was amazing and I usually don't even like French toast! Good portions super cheap good service! Definitely great brunch spot.
