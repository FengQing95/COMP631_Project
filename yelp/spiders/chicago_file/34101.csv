Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We didn't have a full meal here, but everyone around us told us their food was fantastic. We stopped while waiting to attend a party. The bartender was unbelievably friendly. We had great tasting drinks and a dozen oysters. Six from the west coast and six from the east. They were super tasty. The atmosphere of this restaurant and bar was unbelievable. It was filled with classy furnishings and rich dark wood. The clientele was diverse from people wearing suits to jeans and sweatshirts. We will be going back before we leave Chicago.
