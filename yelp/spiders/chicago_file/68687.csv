Little Goat Diner////I've tried the bull's eye french toast (eggs . crispy chicken . sweet onion brioche . bbq maple syrup) which was incredible, a special omelet which was a Mexican style and so good that I was forced to continue eating until I was borderline sick, and the honey yogurt and house granola which was also delicious, but there are so many good things on this menu, it seems like a better idea to order one of the more unique options.
