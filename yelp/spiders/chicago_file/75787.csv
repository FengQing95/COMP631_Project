Little Goat Diner////Little Goat also has a nice cocktail menu. I started with their spicy coconut drink which was ok, but Â my second drink, Eastwood's Ride, kicked major ass. It's their spin on a Moscow Mule. Usually I don't get excited about vodka drinks, but I would suggest seeking this one out.
