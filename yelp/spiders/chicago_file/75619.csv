Little Goat Diner////Brunch was crowded, even early, but they take brunch reservations so if you're able to do a little pre-planning, you should be good.  We all enjoyed everything we tried.  I kind of forgot everything everyone else got because my eyes were on the prize.  The prize being the bullseye french toast.  Imagine my surprise when I cut into that baby, forgetting that egg was on the description.  A hidden egg inside my french toast and fried chicken!  Awesome.  The coffee is great and the bloody mary was fine by me.
