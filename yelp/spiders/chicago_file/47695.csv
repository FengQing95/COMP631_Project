Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great place for tapas! We got the waffle with nutella and bananas along with the spicy potatoes from their brunch menu which was great! I also got the mozzarella and tomatoe/corn/avacado tapa from their regular vegetarian menu, this was okay, tasted like a caprese salad but it wasnt anything special! My husband had the chicken thighs which were really good! But he thought the steak was ok, wouldnt re-order it! Good place to check out!
