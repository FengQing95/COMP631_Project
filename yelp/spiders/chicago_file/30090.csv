Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The wait was expected to be half an hour and usually the small pizza is cut up into four pieces but since we were three people, they asked if we wanted it cut into six pieces instead. I didn't have much expectations for deep dish pizza. I had expected it to be similar to lasagna instead of pizza but I was wrong. The thickness was only about an inch deep and it came in its own personal pan but our server helped served each piece on our plate.
