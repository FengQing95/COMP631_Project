Smoque BBQ////Just slightly overrated. We've eaten here a few times when we're in the area, but it's never blown our doors in. If you're a BBQ connoisseur, lower your expectations and it may be ok. We LOVE BBQ and eat a lot in places like the Carolinas and Memphis, so we've been spoiled. Our search continues for excellent BBQ in Chicago.
