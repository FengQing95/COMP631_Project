Little Goat Diner////I had been to G and the Goat and found the food to be so oversalted that it was nearly inedible. Sadly, my experience there was twinned at the Little Goat. The decor of the restaurant is adorable, and the boisterous diner vibe is nicely conducive to meeting up with your pals. So I was hopeful. I ordered the root vegetables and boo boo baise. The vegetables were cold and seasonless, and the boo baise while a nicely generous portion was so oversalted that I ate trepidatiously. My friend ordered the tempura mashed potatoes which were just ok though I admired the weirdness of trying to fry a mashed potato. Another friend ordered the Japanese pork item--and was surprised to find it unattractively sandwiched within white bread. I tried it and the pork was chewy and...salty. At some point I began to feel ill...I don't know if it was the salt, the quality of the mussels (which on first gulp tasted "off" to me and I only ate one), but later in the night I was ill. I actually had to leave early because the smell of salt and grease and bad acoustics were making me feel worse. I have to say, I think Chef Izard's personality from watching her seems very warm and full of great energy, but I have never felt that translated into her food. I think the biggest perpetrator is the SALT but also the presentation of the food...just slopped onto the plate with no real artform. I later explained to another friend why the experiences at these restaurants turned me off, and he offered Avec as a great example of a small plates restaurant that uses interesting meats and combinations but it's always artful, beautifully prepared and presented and you feel really connected to what you're eating. I can't connect to food when it is so doused in salt.
