Little Goat Diner////From outside, this diner looks standard, but the asian influenced casual diner fare is anything but.   My girlfriend had the "little piggy went to china" and our friend had some "asian breakfast thing."  Throughout the meal, I found myself not believing my tastebuds -- flavors that I would have never dreamed of putting together (blackberry and chorizo, fried spaghetti and coffee) were revelations.
