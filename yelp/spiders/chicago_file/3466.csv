The Purple Pig////- Crispy pig ears $13 - now this dish was surprisingly delicious. When my husband ordered it, I was honestly very apprehensive because who eats pig ears? It sounds kind of gross, but I was pleasantly surprised as I fought him for the very last bites. It had a sunnyside egg on top of crispy fried pig ears tossed with these perfectly pickled cherry peppers which added great flavor to the dish. I loved the contrast of the crispy pig ears to the peppers, it was like magic in my mouth with every bite. The only downside of this dish was that the kale was on the more oily side and was not edible by itself because it was soaked in oil. Overall, this was an almost perfect dish 4/5.
