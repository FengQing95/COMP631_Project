Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Let me start off by saying that I was pleasantly surprised with the whole experience I had with this restaurant. I was given the task of picking a restaurant with good drinks by my date. Luckily, I thought ahead and chose one with not only good drinks but good food as well. This place did not disappoint. First off, I was able to make a reservation for two with ease. When we got there it was packed with people for a Sunday night which shocked me even more at how simple it was to make a reservation. When we first arrived, it did not take long to be seated once we walked in the door. I came prepared to eat, and the food had exceeded my expectations. I'm also not big on sangria but it came highly recommended. Needless to say, before I knew it we finished off a pitcher between the two of us. I was expecting a typical "Lincoln park" experience but it definitely held its own with their food and drink menu. I would definitely recommend this place and look forward to returning.
