Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am 100% with Lauren H. on this one.  Personally, I don't see the fascination.  I'm not fond of the pizza and the pasta I had at the Naperville location was terrible.  Pizza is like sex, when it's good it's great - when it's bad, it's still kinda good.  That's the only reason for my second star.
