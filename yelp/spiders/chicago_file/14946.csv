Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The personal size portion pizza is larger than I can handle in one sitting - so ended up taking some to go. With my only other deep dish pizza experience being Little Star in San Francisco, I'd say the Lou Malnati's version was very tasty and more traditional than what i know.
