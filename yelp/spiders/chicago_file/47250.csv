Smoque BBQ////I went into Smoque today with the highest of expectations, which is an attitude that usually ends up biting me in the ass.  (Lower expectations generally equal a better overall experience in my book.)  Color me impressed!  Boy did this place blow me away.  Beef Brisket so good I could weep... slow cooked and so tender that I did not require a knife for any portion of it.  We also tried the pulled pork.  Again, this stuff was so tender and delicious it just melted in my mouth.  The BBQ Beans were some of the best I have ever tasted, with lots of onion and bacon that just made them heavenly.  The mac and cheese was delicious, creamy, cheesy, with a great bread crumb crust baked on top. And, as crazy as this may sound... possibly the best french fries I have ever eaten.  A side of fries comes in a large brown paper bag and as much as you think you won't be able to finish them - you'll devour every last one of these crispy, salty, heavenly fries.  The sauce at Smoque is excellent as well - somewhere between a vinegary Carolina style sauce and a sweet smoky Kansas City sauce.  Perfect for dipping the fries into, I might add.  All of this at prices so reasonable you'll s**t a brick.  A full brisket dinner with two sides and coleslaw for under ten bucks.  I have never had better barbecue in the city of Chicago and can think of only one place in the whole country to rival this place (that would be Slow's BBQ in Detroit in case you're wondering.)  If you haven't been here yet and you love BBQ... Go now!  My #1 pick for BBQ in the city and #2 in the country. Just remember, they're closed on Mondays kids - which is usually a sign of a good restaurant in my book.  If a restaurant isn't open seven days a week, it usually means there is someone there that gives a damn at all times and has to close to get a day off.  And if you don't like crowds, be sure to go at off peak hours like I did.  This place is small, so I'm sure this place gets a bit uncomfortable if crowded.  (((As an added note... I visited this place again last week and it was even better than the first time.  Seriously the best BBQ in Chicago, hands down!!!)))
