Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Anyhow, we got two orders of steak frites, an order of brussel sprouts and order of mushrooms. At the waiter's speedy recommendation, I got the dry aged steak, medium. UGH the steak was such a disappointment. Just bland. Maybe it was an off-night for them, but keeping mind it was a $70 steak - it felt like something I could have picked up for $15 at whole foods. Not good.
