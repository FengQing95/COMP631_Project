Art Institute of Chicago////Just like NYC's Met, you can get very lost in here.  There's a mega-ton of great work on display and a layout that boggles the mind.  As an example of the diversity, my final hour was spent on the lowest level viewing Photography, the Thorne Miniature Rooms collection (68 miniature rooms), and a vast Paperweight collection (the oddities apparently make it to the lower level).
