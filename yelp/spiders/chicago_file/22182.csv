Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered the Malnati's Chicago Classkc which had sausage, extra cheese and sun ripped tomatoes.. I thought the taste was great, but not happy with the lack of depth it had. It wasn't really deep, I believe a New York Sicilian pizza was deeper. Nevertheless the crust was buttery and crispy and no burnt edges like other places I've seen on Yelp. I ordered the tiramisu. It was a little watery but tasted pretty good.
