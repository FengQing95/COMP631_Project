Little Goat Diner////INCREDIBLE FOOD!! The Elvis Waffles are a must and such a treat. The Pulled Pork sandwich was so delicious and I will for sure order again. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was so insane hot (and loud) both me and the hubs felt like we were going to have a meltdown sesh if we didn't get out asap.... Which meant we ended up canceling our dessert order which I'm sure would have been amazing.
