Art Institute of Chicago////You'll probably find some paintings here that you recognize because you've seen them before in books or photos. I like that in an art museum...I'm happy to look at things I'm not familiar with, but I want to have some 'oh wow - that's the real deal' moments too. Â They have some ancient art - which I always enjoy; and some modern art that I just don't get (a roll of red carpet?? a blank white canvas??) But for me the real showstopper at this place is their collection of impressionist paintings (and yowza do they have a collection). Seeing all their Monets together was amazing. If you've never understood what all the fuss is about, wait until you see these paintings in person. Totally worth a visit just for that.
