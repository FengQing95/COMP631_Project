Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My first steak, a Chicago cut rib eye, ordered rare, had so much connective tissue I discarded most of the first half , while only having 2 bites. the meat I had was very good, but the quality was not acceptable. I, for the first time in my life sent a steak back. The waitress told me, "I shouldn't have ordered it medium", to which I replied "it was ordered rare and is clearly rare". She then replied, "oh yes I remember I did tell them rare, you need to order it more than rare to help soften the fat." I replied, "i have no problem with a little fat on my meat but a third of the steak is connective tissue and a third is fat". I can't chew through connective tissue. She then told me I should have ordered a filet. Really, a filet? Filet is for people that think they like steak. I then had to wait while she consulted with the chef to return my steak. I was brought a delmonico to replace it and ended up paying an additional 10$. Oh thanks. Awesome deal. Thank god I had the 75 day dry aged steak at David Burkes for lunch or my trip to Chicago would have been wasted food wise. Btw, the delmonico I had was very moist and tasty, but overall I didn't get a good feeling on quality on that either.
