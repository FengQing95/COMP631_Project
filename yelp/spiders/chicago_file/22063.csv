Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we lived on the corner of Illinois and Orleans, years ago, we used to walk here regularly. In the summer time, we enjoyed huge salads, ordered a few brew-skis, and our favorite deep dish pizza (sausage). The crust is crispy, never burned with a buttery and meritorious flavor! The dough is made from scratch daily, so you can taste the quality and freshness at first bite. Also, a crispy exterior creates an almost irresistible situation. The toppings are endless and the tastefully satisfying plum tomato sauce makes for the ultimate amalgamation. For some of us, it is a matter of personal preference or taste as to "which" place in the City has the BEST 5-star or 10-star Chicago deep dish pizza. It's the bite you always look forward to and multiplied to serve you ubiquitous satisfaction. This is exactly what Lou Malnati's does time and time again!
