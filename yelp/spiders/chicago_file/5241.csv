The Purple Pig////Then arrived what might be the most surprising course of the entire meal... the Grilled Broccoli. Â Recommended immediately by our server when prompted, it was, quite simply, one of the most life-changing experiences I've ever had with a vegetable. In fact, it might have ruined broccoli for me forever if I have to have broccoli prepared any other way. It was warm, slightly charred, slightly drizzled in an unbelievable Anchovie Vinagrette, and topped with what were clearly some type of magic breadcrumbs for texture. It was, simply, unforgettable. My only regret was that it came out very early near the same time as the Whipped Feta and it took every ounce of discipline to not devour the entire plate before the main courses arrived, so it was near room temperature by that time.
