Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Once we sat, the salads showed up first, and about 20 minutes later, the pizza came. We had the classic sausage and the pepperoni, and the sausage was by far my favorite. A gigantic wheel of solid sausage was surrounded by cheese on all sides, and had a crust that was far crunchier than I expected. I did cut the first few slices knife and fork style, but the rest I was able to pick and eat like normal.
