Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were in Chicago for a short trip. All weekend we just ate at places near the hotel. We decided we wanted to look for a great meal. Wow did we find it! Best Filet I've ever had.  Service was great.  Staff extremely friendly and helpful.  Loved the atmosphere.  I really wish we had a restaurant like this in Boston!
