Little Goat Diner////This is not Girl & the Goat, but it is yummy. I had the shrimp and grits because I have celiacs disease. Girl and the Goat has way more gluten-free options than this place. They did not even have a gluten-free dessert, except boozy shakes and coffees. My chai-biscus cocktail was good, just a little too Sweet. Will try again when I return to Chicago and see if I change my mind.
