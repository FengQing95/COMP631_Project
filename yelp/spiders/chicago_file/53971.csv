Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My first experience with Tapas in Chicago! The food was wonderful. We got about 6 plates for 2 people which was a little much, so had to take some home as leftovers. As a vegetarian, I did struggle a bit to find food I could eat but was still able to eat most of the dishes we got. Great food and sangria, will definitely come again.
