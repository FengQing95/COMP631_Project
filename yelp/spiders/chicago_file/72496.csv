Little Goat Diner////I like this place more than its famous sister restaurant, the Girl and the Goat. The food at Little Goat is creative and delicious, but also accessible.  It elevates home cooked food like sloppy joes and breakfast dished to distinct flavor profiles. I am working my way through the menu and have not had a weak dish yet.  The Korean kimchee burger is particularly good- it is a buttery burger but balanced by the tangy pickled cabbage. Their homemade hot sauce is great.
