Art Institute of Chicago////Admission: $25 for out-of-state general admission (free re-entry), $19 for students & seniors (65 and up), additional $7 for audio guide. For some reason, my audio guide wouldn't play and I had to walk back to the kiosk and exchanged for a different one (lesson - always test the audio guide and make sure it works properly).
