Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've read all over about this restaurant and the consensus is that the side dishes are nothing short of perfection at Bavette's.  The reviews were all spot, we had the elote, if you enjoy corn you must order this dish.  The corn was cooked perfectly, and had such depth of flavor.  Not traditional flavors you might expect at a steakhouse or french restaurant but nothing about this restaurant is what you'd expect.  All good things.
