Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Babette's dropped the ball on this one, big time. This was was with out a doubt the worst dinning experience I have ever had in Chicago. Despite good food, the entire staff failed to address the glaring issues that occurred during our night out. Midway through our meal, the music shuts off and the restaurant fills with smoke, not a light smoke but a heavy steak smog. Our steaks arrived, 45 mins after our appetizers, sans sides. Out waiter, John, asked us to "be patient" while he simply failed to assure us or accommodate our needs, instead offering us a table red wine on the house instead of the original wine we had specifically selected for our steaks. To be honest it was insulting. They tried to compensate with flat cheap sparking wine. I am truly insulted that I was even offered the check. I left the restaurant distraught and having my whole outfit foully smelling of a dirty kitchen. This was definitely a health violation for allowing patrons to stay inside the restaurant after the smoke let loose. Too little to late was done to assure my party of all inconveniences we endured. Will never return again.
