Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Decor, as with all the Sodikoff joints, adds to the hedonistic element; in this case, transporting you to a 1920s era steakhouse (upstairs) or to Rudyard Kipling's basement (downstairs, though this was a bit whimsical for my personal taste, and involved the always kitschy fake books). We ate upstairs, and I felt like Nuchy Thompson. Service is attentive but not in your face. What's not to love?
