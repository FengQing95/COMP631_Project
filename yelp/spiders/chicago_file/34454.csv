Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Joined a couple of friends for dinner here last night. The restaurant was very accommodating in adding me to the reservation at the last minute (granted, it was a Monday night so it wasn't very busy). The service was great, the server's suggestions were very helpful. Something I ordered wasn't very good at all, and the server and manager were apologetic and didn't charge us for it. My friends' steak was amazing, as was our chocolate dessert.
