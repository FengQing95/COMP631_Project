Smoque BBQ////Brisket... oh brisket... more. Need more brisket. Damn sitting not at Smoque and thinking of the brisket. The PERFECT brisket. It melts into the bun, and melts in your mouth. Such amazing flavor all around from the bit of flour baked goodness of the bun to the salty/sweet/briskety flavor of the meat and smoke. I almost cried when the sandwich was gone.
