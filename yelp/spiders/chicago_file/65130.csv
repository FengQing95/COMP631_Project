Smoque BBQ////One final, and in my opinion really Â important comment, they take food allergies very seriously! My sister who has a very serious case of celiac disease and lactose allergy was able to eat here safely and without a trip to the ER. Al thank you for all the careful treatment. I look forward to visiting the next time I am in town!
