Little Goat Diner////It's fine. Neat area of town, obviously. I've just never been impressed by the food. It's always semi-cold and not particularly tasty. Interesting concepts that are just that... interesting; not altogether worthwhile. I want to like it, because #westloop but I always scrunch my nose when I think of it.
