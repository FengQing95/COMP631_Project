Little Goat Diner////Executive Summary: Overall I found the service and friendly atmosphere to be as outstanding as at Girl and the Goat. I couldn't have been more satisfied.  The food and cocktails were good, just not amazing. We tried the Fat Elvis Waffles, Shrimp & Grits,&  Corn Beef & Hash. Now, I had CRAZY HIGH expectations from my experiences at Girl & the Goat, so this might be unfair, but I wasn't wowed by anything, which I anticipated from amazing dining experiences  at Girl & the Goat.  It was all good, just nothing to write home about.  Because of the great service and atmosphere, however, I would definitely give it another try and also return to try the dinner/lunch menu.
