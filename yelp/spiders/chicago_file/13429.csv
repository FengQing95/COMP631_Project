Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came her with a girlfriend of mine. We ordered some bread appetizer that I didn't really care for. The pizza was good though. We ordered The "Lou" which is fresh spinach, mushrooms and sliced tomatoes covered with a blend of mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese. Oh my god! The veggies on it were so fresh and I can taste that.
