Smoque BBQ////The portions at Smoque are generous, almost to a fault. I usually order from the children's menu, opting for a mini brisket sandwich (both chopped and sliced are great) & fries and a side of crunchy cole slaw. I'm sated, but not overfull and it makes a weekday lunch at Smoque more affordable. If a giant portion of meat is not your thing, the salad -- with or without smoked chicken (unavailable otherwise) -- is pretty tasty. I've tried about 85% of their menu and it's all great. My husband likes the ribs and baked beans and my oldest child digs the pulled pork sandwiches. I do not like the mayonnaise-y cole slaw served in most restaurants, but I love Smoque's vinegar-and-honey version.
