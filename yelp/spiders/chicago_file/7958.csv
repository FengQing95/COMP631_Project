Art Institute of Chicago////Yes, I love you, AIC. The only reason I dropped our membership a couple of years ago was because you changed the definition of a "Family" membership from 4 tickets to 2 adults and 2 kids. That REALLY pissed me off. My partner and I do not HAVE kids - we use the other 2 tickets to take our widowed moms. So, you lost me, yet you continued to call me and badger me to rejoin and every time I said "Shove it! Restore the 4 adult tickets to the Family Membership!"
