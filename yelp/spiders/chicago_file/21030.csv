Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You can tell when a place uses fresh ingredients and it's evident once you take the first bite. The cheese tastes like authentic real cheese and the sauce is delicious. The crust has a crunch to it as it should and the pepperoni was sliced thicker and more tastier than other places. You can expect great attentive service and is a good lunch spot.
