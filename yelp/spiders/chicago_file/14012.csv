Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There are somethings you have to do when in Chicago, and deep dish is one of them.  Our wait was around 45 minutes on a Thursday night, but they do allow you to pre-order (the pizza takes 35 minutes min) so it's not that bad of a deal.  Our server was friendly, the salad delicious, and the pizza was great.  Definitely a place I'd take folks to again.
