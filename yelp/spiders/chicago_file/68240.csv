Little Goat Diner////Having some time on my hands I decided to bike from uptown to Little Goat to grab some lunch. I was sure there was going to be a wait in the diner so I decided to just head into the bread shop and save the diner for a day where I had more time. Let's just say I cannot wait to wait for a table there.
