Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I took a party of five good friends to Lou's and ordered a large stuffed pepperoni (1/2) and sausage (1/2) pizza, in addition to a medium "Lou's" / supreme pizza, mozzarella sticks and wings. We were seated upstairs and service this time around was prompt and great. We never needed to look around for a server and refills were prompt. Food was served piping hot (as it should be), with cheese thick and elastic, crust was better than I had previously remembered. Everyone enjoyed the food and atmosphere. This second trip leads me to believe the service the first time around was simply a fluke. Would gladly return.
