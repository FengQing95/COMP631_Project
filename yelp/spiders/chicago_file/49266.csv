Smoque BBQ////That being said, Smoque's ribs taste incredibly smoked. Like, in all my rib days, I've never experienced that kind of a pronounced smoked flavor before. It's incredibly intense, and wonderful. However, aside from the smokiness, the meat itself isn't very flavorful. To it's credit, it was incredibly moist, tender and everything properly cooked ribs should be, it just... its flavor needs something extra.
