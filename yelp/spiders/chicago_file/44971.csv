Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So despite several prior mediocre meals at this place I decided to give it another try for brunch. Sadly, as much as I really really want to like this place, it just isn't good. I mean come on, how hard is it to do brunch? Omelets, pancakes, bacon - I mean is that really so difficult? Apparently, it is for this place. Everyone's omelets just weren't right. One had way too much chorizo, another one was missing half of the promised ingredients.  And then the service was terrible. The waitress had no clue what ingredients were in what dishes and didn't bother to ask the chef when we had questions. She never came to check on us and was just generally oblivious. The only redeeming thing about this brunch was the French toast with berries, which was great.  I definitely do not plan on returning here any time soon.  I swear the atmosphere is the only thing this place has going for it.
