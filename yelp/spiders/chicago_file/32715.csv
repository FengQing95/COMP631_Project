Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I don't often write Yelp reviews, but I felt this was necessary. My girlfriend and I went to Bavettes last night and had an exceptional time!  We had an 8pm reservation and arrived a little early. They checked us in and invited us to wait at the bar. The bartender, while looking quite young, made one of the tastiest Old Fashioned's I have ever had. At about 8:20, we were told by the hostess that the people at our table had paid but we're not yet leaving.  That is obnoxious but no fault of the restaurant. About ten minutes later, a gentleman a I believe was the manager, approached us. He apologized again for the wait and offered to pay for our cocktails at the bar. Completely unnecessary, but very appreciated by us. It shows that the management is aware of what is happening in their restaurant and also cares about the satisfaction of it's customers. We were seated and our waiter, Joel, was extremely professional and friendly. We ordered oysters, bone marrow, the dry-aged ribeye and the filet. Everything was out of this world!  Steaks were cooked perfectly and needed not even a pinch of the seasoning mix they bring to your table. Wish we had room for desert, but we will be back. If you are looking for a steakhouse that truly feels like Chicago, this is a must try.
