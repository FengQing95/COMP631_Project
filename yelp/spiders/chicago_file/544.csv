Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The wait is - a wait. BUT if you plan accordingly and send someone ahead of time to get a table, the rest don't have to suffer :) . The food is so rich.. the signature Berry Bliss Waffle is amazing and the other specials are insane as well. You cannot go wrong. It's not the MOST gluten free friendly, and it's definitely not vegan friendly, but it is worth breaking the diet.
