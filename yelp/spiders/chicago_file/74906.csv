Little Goat Diner////Very casual, laid back diner. I'm a big fan of this place for multiple reasons. When it came to getting reservations, it was fairly easy and quick through Open Table. If you don't book ahead and depending on the day, you'll have to wait 30-45 minutes. Saturday and Sunday brunch crowd is obviously more busy.
