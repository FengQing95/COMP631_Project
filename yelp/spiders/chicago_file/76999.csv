Little Goat Diner////-- probably the best of the dishes we had & i was really surprised. it was more sweet than savory. the brioche did not taste like onion nor did the syrup taste like bbq. it just tastes like a brioche bread with an egg in the middle (like eggs in a basket) topped with chicken, syrup, & strawberries.
