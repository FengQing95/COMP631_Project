Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My favorite tapas place in town! I think what sets it above the rest is the amazing service. Additional pluses are the delicious sangria and plates! I highly recommend the bacon wrapped dates, patatas bravas, goat cheese in tomato sauce, and the shrimp with garlic and olive oil.
