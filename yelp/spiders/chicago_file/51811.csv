Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My family and I really enjoyed the whole dining experience.  The place is huge which I didn't realize from the outside.  We loved the small plates and between the 4 of us we were able to sample many different foods, including some we'd never tasted before.  The food was great.  The service was good.  I would come back and bring others.   I enjoyed the casual atmosphere and how we could keep ordering small plates and add more as we went along.  Everyone found something to love.
