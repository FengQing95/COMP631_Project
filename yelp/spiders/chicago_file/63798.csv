Smoque BBQ////I've known about this place since it opened and unfourtunetly it's ever-rising popularity keeps me from going as often as I'd like.  It's not uncommon for them to be be out of pork and/or ribs some days shortly after lunchtime.  The only 'real' authentic southern BBQ I've had in the Midwest and there isn't much more I can say that hasn't already been said.
