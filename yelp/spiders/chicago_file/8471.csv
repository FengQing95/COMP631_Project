Art Institute of Chicago////Granted, I am partial to the Impressionists and their use of light, but I love how art can open your eyes.  Case in point: the Modern Wing.  Light, airy, and showcasing all sorts of artistic expression, it's a can't miss in this museum.  Whether you "get" the art behind a projection of a man tapping around a box to the beat of a metronome or of Jackson Pollack's abstract expressionistic paint spatters, you understand that it means something...to the artist or to you.
