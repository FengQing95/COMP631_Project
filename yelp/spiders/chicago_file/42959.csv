Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I planned my office's holiday party and made a reservation at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba for 12 people.  I worked with Alison and she was great!  I made small changes in the weeks before the event, and even a few right up until the day before and she was very accommodating and easy to work with.  When we got to the restaurant, we were seated even though the whole group had not shown up yet.  The server, Carl, was on top of his game!  Because of the planning Alison and I had done beforehand, he knew we had a few people in the group that needed Gluten Free options, and he was very good about making sure they knew which items were GF-friendly.  I had previously set the menu with Alison, and the tapas were brought out with perfect timing so that we always had something to much on.  I can't stress enough that this is a great place for a work event.  The food and atmosphere are great!  Thank you so much, Alison & Carl!
