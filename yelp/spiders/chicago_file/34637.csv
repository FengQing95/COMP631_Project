Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Oh la la! Dark, sexy, rustic intimate ambiance. Gents, this is the steakhouse to take your ladies to, as it is a curious blend of feminine and masculine elements in its decor and ambiance. Trust me, they will love it. You cannot go wrong here. There's enough variety on the menu to choose from, with just about something for almost everyone. Hard to be a vegan or vegetarian in a steakhouse, but here the sides could be customized for you and the Mixed Greens salad my dining companion had was huge. I had the baked Crab Cake. It was huge and 100% blue crab meat, no fillers or binders, just tasty delicious scrumptious crab meat. We each had the 6oz. Filet and it was cooked perfectly. We shared the Baked Sweet Potato and the Brussels Sprouts, which were both excellent. I got a side of diced bacon and sour cream garnished with chives for my baked sweet potato and that made it very tasty indeed. Dessert was a no brainer as we both went for the Chocolate Cream pie. It was so rich and decadent that I couldn't finish it. To be fair, it was a large slice, so sharing shouldn't be out the question, if that's an option for you. French press coffee is always a treat and a great cup of java. Service was friendly, but professional at the same time. Do make sure your party shows up around the same time as they will not seat you until the entire party has arrived. Happily, there are two sofas and a few chairs to sink into or, if you prefer, plenty of bar seating between the street level and downstairs. Cannot believe I waited so long to come here. Don't make that same mistake.
