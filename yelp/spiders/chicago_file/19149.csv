Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We've been to both the one in Lincoln Park and the one in River North.  The dining experience is always lovely.  There's something about this place that is homey, but maybe, it's because we've dined here for the last 20 years.  The pizzas are never disappointing.  My favorite experience though is my order of 6 frozen pizzas that I had shipped to Hawaii as a gift for a Coast Guard friend who was stationed there.  The pizzas arrived on time, still frozen, and we joined them for dinner upon arrival.  They heated up wonderfully and was just as good as in the restaurant.  Makes an impressive gift indeed!
