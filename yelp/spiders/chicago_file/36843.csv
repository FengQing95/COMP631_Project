Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were told that there would be a 2 hour wait which was no problem. We sat right inside the door at the full service lounge and enjoyed a bottle of wine while we waited. As time went on, my boyfriend continuously checked with the host to ensure we were still on the wait list. After almost 3 hours, our server finally sent the manager our way to see if we needed anything. We were told that the host had texted us that our table was ready 20 minutes prior and since we didn't come to the front, they assumed we left. Not only did we not receive a text, we were seated immediately inside the door and had checked multiple times to ensure we were still on the list. Considering Bavette's tries to be personal and come find their diners when their table is ready, don't you think they would've seen us still sitting in the same place we'd been sitting in for 3 hours?
