Smoque BBQ////I eat BBQ everywhere I go and this is one of the top-5 best BBQ joints I've ever eaten at. Lately, only Kansas City Joe's in KC had better and they are about as good as it gets in the world. Try the brisket (sliced) and beans at Smoque, you won't be disappointed. If you don't like a vinegary slaw, you might skip that, but it isn't bad. The only downside is that the restaurant is kind of off the beaten path and both times that we've been there, we ended up driving for a while and parking quite a bit away. It is very close to the "Irving Park" metro stop and I'd recommend that instead of driving.
