Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////it is VERY crowded, VERY loud, tables are on top of each other, so the ambiance isn't great, and i'm all about the ambiance. i've heard horror stories about having to wait even if you have a reservation, tho that wasn't the case for our group of 4, dinner at 8pm on a thursday...
