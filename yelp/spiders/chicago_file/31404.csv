Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's to me is one of Chicago's staple pizzerias. It has an original taste and stands out almond Chicago's other pizza options. It also tastes somewhat healthier and more so on the organic side although it isn't advertised as such--could be because of its consistently fresh ingredients! 10/10 would recommend if you're visiting the city and in the mood for deep dish.
