Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went Sunday night to celebrate my nephew's engagement.  Never been before.  The food and service was outstanding. We ordered very expensive champagne and it was served ice cold - lovely.  Appetizers crab cake, shrimp and fois gras were cooked perfectly.  We brought our own vintage pinot noir which they opened with no corkage fee, just shared a glass.  We were 4 and all had the filet mignon that didn't need a knife to eat.  Had the corn and the garlic potatoes which were fantastic.  Would definitely recommend.
