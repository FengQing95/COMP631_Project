Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were stuck in Chicago due to the storm so decided to go to downtown and try out the famous deep dish pizza. We got 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 lou special. I gotta say it was much better than expectation. The pizza has a nice crunch layer at the bottom, soft in the middle and juicy on the top!
