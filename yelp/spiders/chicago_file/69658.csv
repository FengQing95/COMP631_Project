Little Goat Diner////After visiting Girl and the Goat I figured I would try Little Goat.  I had heard great things, but maybe the hype set my expectations too high.  The food was incredibly greasy - and I understand that it's a diner, but still.  The portions are VERY GENEROUS (which was a good thing).  I honestly felt a little sick after we left because I was so full of food and grease.
