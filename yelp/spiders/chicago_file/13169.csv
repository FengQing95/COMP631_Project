Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Many miles were traveled, many miles were run to surpass the guilt and the cheese that makes Chicago style pizza. The pizza was less mediocre. We ordered the 'butter' crust, definitely a miss. The crust was buttery but didn't hold up well. The sauce was watery and the toppings weren't anything special. The service was great and that scored this pizzeria a couple stars. But the pizza wasn't great, wasn't good was barely OK. Giordano's is worth the wait and the calories, skip this one.
