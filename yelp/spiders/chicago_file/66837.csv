Little Goat Diner////I have dined here on three different occasions and I must say I have had a fabulous experience. I am a culinary aficionado and I love checking out various new eateries in Chicago. What I would recommend is the Parantha Burrito which was very fresh and flavorful. If you are a meat eater I recommend adding some bacon as well. I have tried the Goat burger and BBQ pulled pork sandwich and I must say it's absolutely delicious. I haven't paid much attention to their beverage selections but I will on my next visit. It is slightly expensive but well worth the experience and great food.
