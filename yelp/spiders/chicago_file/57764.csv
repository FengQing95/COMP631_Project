Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went here for Father's Day and it was the perfect celebration spot. Our waiter was extremely clear with the menu and very hospitable. Their sangria is to die for! We had their daily special (mango) and it was absolutely delicious. The food was out of this world. We had a few tapas while we waited for our paella (the paella takes about 30-45 minutes so order as soon as possible - it's worth the wait!) and while everything was fantastic, I can't rave enough about their bacon wrapped dates. It was the perfect blend of sweet and salty. Even after all the food we ordered, I HAD to get a second order of the dates. I could eat those all day if I could.
