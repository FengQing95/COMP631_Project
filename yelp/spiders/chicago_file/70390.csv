Little Goat Diner////Had lunch there a couple of weeks ago with a friend, have been meaning to write a review for a while. What can I say, great ambiance, good energy and buzz - even for lunch time in the middle of the week. I had their crab sandwich, which was on special, and it was mouthwatering delicious. The bun was almost like a crisp donut. I know they have this signature goat chili - I felt it was too vinegary and a bit sweeter than I like. Good, but not what i'd go back for. I would go back there for their brunch menu.
