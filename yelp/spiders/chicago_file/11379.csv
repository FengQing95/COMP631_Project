Art Institute of Chicago////It is large and confusing with lots of stairs, levels, and rooms. That is part of the fun. Get lost in here enjoying the art and finding that special piece that calls out to you. I have been here many times and still enjoy every visit. There are also extensive programs and events with docent tours and everything else, including a cafe and gift shop. Take advantage of the coat and bag check to avoid carrying your wet or bulky stuff around.
