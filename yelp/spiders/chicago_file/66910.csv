Little Goat Diner////What a disappointment. I love Stephanie I., her successes and her creativity, but I saw none of it here. Hostess was in a booth away from the door and eventually came to seat us at a table with 2 dirty water glasses, where she removed my 4 year old's silverware. He needs silverware. Â We ordered for 4 of us and his milk came after one of us finished our breakfast. Waitress infamous with muffin selection. We were then told they were out of the muffin he ordered. My blueberry scone had fennel. Lots and lots of fennel. I hate fennel, and would have appreciated a warning. Food come out in 5 waves. Corned beef way too salty, but at least they let me sit for a long time with an empty water glass. Bathrooms were clean. I'm so sad.
