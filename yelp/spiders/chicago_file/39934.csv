Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place has excellent service and ambience. Unfortunately our bone in rib eye was pretty poor quality and it was 70$. For the price non of the food really wowed me or my partner. Maybe it was an off night in the kitchen. I'll try again once someone losses a bet and has to buy me dinner.
