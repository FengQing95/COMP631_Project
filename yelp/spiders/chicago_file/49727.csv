Smoque BBQ////I've been to Smoque 3 times.  Every time I have gone, thankfully lines are not too bad. I had the half ribs with French fries and mac and cheese and also the colesalaw. The mac and cheese is super yummy, and the coleslaw was actually pretty good.  Let me tell you I don't care for coleslaw anywhere but here its definitely yummy! I really like trying new places but my boyfriend is very reluctant to try new things(he's from Ecuador) so when I told him to come with me to eat ribs. Since I had already been there once, and he finally agreed I was super excited. He had the same thing I had the first time I went and oddly he said it was really good and now every time we go out to eat he actually says let's go eat smoque ribs!
