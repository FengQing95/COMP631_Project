Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Imagine my disappointment when I cut into it and it took more effort than I expected. I thought maybe it was just because the knife was not serrated. My first bite? A little chewy, almost hard. Not juicy. Definitely not tender. This steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and it was almost dry. I don't get it. You can see in the picture that the meat doesn't look juicy at all. I didn't really care for the bernaise sauce. Based on the reviews I'm wondering if my steak was a fluke but I honestly can't imagine giving it another shot. I should have asked the server if my steak was the norm.
