Little Goat Diner////So incredibly disappointed. Have been wanting to try this place for so long. Service could not have been worse. So very rude!  Other tables were having to get their own silverware. We had to go in and order our own drinks. The waitress was not even mortified that customers were having to serve themselves.  Came here for a celebration lunch.  Leaving now to find somewhere else with better service for cocktails and dessert.  Expected so much more from this place.
