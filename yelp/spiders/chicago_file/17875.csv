Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////honestly, deep dish pizza is a little hyped up.  as a fan of neapolitan pizza, i can't say i was completely in love with lou malnati's, but i will bump up the rating for their salad, service and ambiance.  i also can't say if this is the chicago's best since i didn't care to try other deep dish pizza places after having my first bite here.
