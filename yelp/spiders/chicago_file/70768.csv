Little Goat Diner////Split 1/2 each of the BBQ Pork sandwich and the scallion pancake pork belly sandwich and each were inventive, interesting and delicious.  They both combined sweet, savory with textures and neither were the same from the first bite to the last.  Delicious.  I wished each had a little more pork and that would really be my only comment.  The BBQ pork sandwich had a little too much bread to filling for my liking.  I will be back to try more.  It's a terrific menu with great service and a fun vibe.
