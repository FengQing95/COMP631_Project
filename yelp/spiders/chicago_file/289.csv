Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The food was brought to us quickly and it all looked delicious except for one thing: my eggs were raw. The majority of the whites were completely translucent and running off the eggs onto my plate. We notified the waitress and she just said that the eggs were meant to look like that. I didn't want to get food poisoning and asked her if there was anyway I could get them more cooked and told her that overeasy would be okay. She took the plate back, and two minutes later, came back with my eggs. I was happy with the service except for the fact that my eggs were still raw. It looked like it spent a whole five seconds on the flat top, and although the yolk was runny, so were the whites. I was tired of asking for more cooked eggs and decided to just stick with them. Moving on, the berry bliss pancakes were beautiful and delicious! I'm not a fan of pancakes, but I really did enjoy these ones. Yelp does not lie, try them and you will not be disappointed! My boyfriend thought that the cinnamon roll pancakes were just average. He wished that they had put glaze between the pancakes because the drizzle on top was not enough for the stack of five or six pancakes he got with his order.
