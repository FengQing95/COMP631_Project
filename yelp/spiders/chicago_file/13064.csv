Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I love carbs and cheese... and this is my heaven in pizzeria-dom. During my last trip to Chicago, I was COLD and HUNGRY. NOT exactly a good combination for anyone who's within griping distance from me. But thankfully Lou Malnati's saved the day! Their cornmeal crust is SO dang good with the spinach and cheese just oozing out of the loaf. The pizza are B-O-M-B... with crusts that are just gooey good and string-y cheese that you have to eat like spaghetti with a fork. I also love the vibe of this place... very proud Chicagan. LOVES IT!
