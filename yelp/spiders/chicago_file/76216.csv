Little Goat Diner////Well... this makes me full just to post this picture. This chef has multiple restaurants in the city - all of them are VERY good. This is obviously over the top when it comes to burgers but for what it's worth, the quality of all various pieces of this burger was great. And no... I didnt finish. Yes, I got close but then started feeling dizzy!
