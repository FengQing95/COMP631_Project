Smoque BBQ////But what really bugs about the no BBQ sauce readily available is the inconvenience of stopping mid-meal to get up and get more, most likely having to wait for whoever may be ordering at the counter at the time to finish.  All the while my delicious meats get cold.  Additionally, it appears they have two types of BBQ sauce but I have no idea if I was served the Original or the Spicy.  I would have liked to try both, but in the end tried....?????  No idea.
