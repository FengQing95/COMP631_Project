The Purple Pig////The purple pig is one of the most pleasant restaurants I've ever visited. There's a standing area where you can stand and eat or wait for a table. I waited about 1.5-2hrs for my table (it's a very intimate seating area). The service was so amazing and the workers really cared about what you chose and gave excellent advice. I picked two items from the menu and the chef picked a favorite of his.
