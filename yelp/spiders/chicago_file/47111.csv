Smoque BBQ////Love the sides.  Baked beans and coleslaw especially are super good.  Just the right additional flavors to go with the pork.  The baby back ribs were a little disappointing---good flavor but really really really really dry.    Had better luck with the pulled pork, which was delicious.  The place is obviously popular and it is amazing that people manage to get in there at all given the paucity of parking.  It is extremely noisy and there is absolutely no privacy.  Long tables at which people are seated.  I would say get the takeout and skip the baby back ribs in favor of other pork choices.
