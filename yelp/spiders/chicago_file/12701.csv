Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Awful, bland, expensive, junk pizza. I wouldn't eat this stuff for free. Was looking for some late night pizza and a native chicagoan recommended Lou Malnati's. I honestly think this is the worst pizza I've ever had. The crust was almost slimy, there was way way too much cheese and the sauce/ingredients were bland. Don't know what the big deal is, I'd rather flush $30 down the toilet.
