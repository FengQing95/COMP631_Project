Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The servers were extremely helpful and knew the menu inside & out. They were able to give great suggestions. Because the restaurant serves tapas, our group of 10 split into 2 groups of 5 when we ordered- to make for easier sharing. They do have a few vegetarian/vegan options on the menu- I had the moroccan chickpea stew which was so delicious.
