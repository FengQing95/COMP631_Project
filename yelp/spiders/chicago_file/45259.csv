Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We were seated and ordered quickly as we had already browsed the menu at home.  The plates came fast and furious.  Waiters seemed to be flying by tables on zip lines, dropping off plates barely fitting in descriptions of the food.  Our waiter came frequently enough, though a bit less often as the meal wore on.
