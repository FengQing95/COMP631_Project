Smoque BBQ////I think I would be an idiot if I said their BBQ wasn't that good. It's good, we all know this. Could the experience be better? Hell yes....if I rated this place 3 stars, I would be adminiting that their BBQ is just OK, which it isnt. It's better than OK. 4 stars means I'm a fan... but is waiting in a long-ass line, lining up with the other sardines for your food, grabbing your prison platter of BBQ and sqautting at a small table all worth it? Some people may say yes, depending on the 'Que. Personally, I don't think it's worth all of the fuss. Next time I visit, I will be ordering to go!
