Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Those, my friends, are the words of a very, very, very sorry young man who totally underestimated the girth, weight, volume...cheese, of a Deep Dish from the Windy City! There was some discussion about which spot was the place to experience the Deep Dish on our way down, however our concierge from the Sax Hotel convinced us that Lou's was the place to go, and once we considered our options she handed us a slip for a complimentary Bruschetta. Awesome, but I soon learned unnecessary!
