Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The vibe here is very chill, I love it. It's a great place to work (there's free wifi) when they're less busy but when it's packed, it gets very loud and the wait can be very long! As per usual at a tapas bar, the portions are pretty small here and it can be very easy to rack up a big bill, so don't come in too hungry if you're not prepared to pay with your wallet!
