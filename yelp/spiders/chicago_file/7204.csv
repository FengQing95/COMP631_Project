Art Institute of Chicago////This is a great museum. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I am spoiled with free museums in DC, and it's not free admission, but it was still worth the $18 fee. We checked out the Lichtenstein exhibit, which was a great exhibit and sort of fun to walk through. It was interesting walking through the exhibit to see his progression as an artist. I also really enjoyed checking out the European Painting and Sculpture area where their most famous work was George Seurat's "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte" - so intricate and beautiful, and I had no idea he also painted this beautiful border around it! It was also pretty "trippy", as my friend described, to look at the miniature rooms/doll houses. If you take a picture of them up close, it looks like a full size room...oh the joy of perspectives! It was pretty neat for a quick walk through!
