Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My only problem with my Malnati Chicago Classic was the sausage. You have the option of getting the sausage crumbled (common with most sausage on pizza) or a sausage patty on the pizza. I decided to try the sausage patty, and it ended up being my only mistake with this meal. For whatever reason, the texture wasn't nearly as good on the sausage as it typically is when you get sausage crumbled on a pizza. This was only thing that keep my pizza from being the complete package.
