Little Goat Diner////Good with a couple comments.  Food is unique and tasted great.  Coffee tasted great.  Having said that if you are not into unique ways of having a breakfast dish, skip it.  For example,  waffles - but with peanut butter butter and bacon bits.  But they make it work because it tasted good.  Lastly, the place is loud, it was hard to hear people at the other end of our table.
