Little Goat Diner////I came here with a friend from out of town and we both loved this place. We had previously gone to Girl and the Goat and wanted to try out Little Goat Diner for brunch. Thankfully when we arrived on a weekday there was no line and plenty of seats. There were a lot of good options on the menu. The food was very good and savory. Our waiter was also very good. Overall a great experience!
