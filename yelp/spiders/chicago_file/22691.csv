Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friend and I split a small Malnati Chicago Classic. I was surprised at how lasagna-like the pizza was. Though I appreciated the freshness of the vine-ripened tomato sauce, the pie was really heavy on the cheese and sausage. I wish there could have been another component to brighten up the pie and to make it less heavy.
