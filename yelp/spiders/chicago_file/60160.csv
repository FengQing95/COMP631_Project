Smoque BBQ////The place is a dive, you'd drive by and miss it unless your windows were down and you smelled the smoke.  It was packed, so you know people are coming back.  We might try it again and order the chicken.  But in my humble opinion, while I enjoy a good smokey flavor to my BBQ, I also want to taste the food.  Ribs were a fail on that account.  But I enjoyed the hell out of my pork sandwich so, it's like it evens out.
