Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ate a Small Malnati Chicago Classic ($15.45) and I could only put down 2 of the four slices. Overall it was a good pie, however, it was a bit overpowering with garlic. My favorite thing about the pizza was the sausage with every bite. I like the way the sausage was spread over the entire pizza, that part of the experience was amazing.
