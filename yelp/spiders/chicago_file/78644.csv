Little Goat Diner////Ali, we're so glad that you ventured in our direction and that we were able to accommodate you! It means so much to us that we were a must visit while you were in Chicago and that even though you'd already eaten, you found the space for a meal with us. It's great to hear that your server lead you in the right direction and that your meal was one to remember. We're thrilled that you plan to return to Little Goat and we'll look forward to serving you all your heart desires at your next visit!
