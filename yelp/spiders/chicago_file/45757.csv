Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The restaurant was packed when we arrived at 7:30 pm on a Saturday night. Our wait time was 1 hour. We had a pitcher of the classic white sangria while we waited at the bar. We were lucky enough to eventually get four seats in a row there and they were swooped up so fast when our party was called that the people replacing them hindered my party from getting out of the bar area! Prime real estate, I guess. The sangria was good. I was surprised that it came from a tap and that the fruit is added to the pitcher later. I thought the whole purpose was to let the fruit infuse the wine and vice versa? Oh well, still yummy.
