Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I went here for a late dinner. It was our first time.  We order a bone in which was highly recommended and it was perfect. Best steak I've had in the city to date. The drinks were great and the service was awesome.  The atmosphere is very cool. They styled the restaurant perfectly. I will even say that when we were at the bar there was a very drunk patron who kept bumping into my husband and the bartender stepped in the ask he move over so that was impressive.  I highly recommend this place.
