Art Institute of Chicago////During our walk through I absolutely could not believe I was seeing art I had only seen referenced in movies or online. The gorgeously flowing Dagas pieces, 'The Bedroom' by Van Gough, and my personal favorite 'Bridge Over a Pond of Water Lilies' by Monet - a picture I had a print of as a child and would copy over and over again.
