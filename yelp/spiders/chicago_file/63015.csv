Smoque BBQ////When we got to Smoque, it smelled really good. You could smell the meat and the smoke and it made us hungrier. We decided to go family style and share everything. We got the sliced beef brisket platter with Mac & Cheese and BBQ Beans, the Rib Combo (Half Baby Back/Half St. Louis) with Brisket Chili and Cornbread, we added a Texas Sausage, and for dessert we got both the Peach Cobbler and Bread Pudding. Coleslaw was included in every platter.
