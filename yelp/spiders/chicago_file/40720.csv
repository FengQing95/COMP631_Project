Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is awesome! I had heard great things about CBBR from clients of mine, and finally got a chance to check it out for myself tonight. Everything is small portioned so that you can order all different things and share them all. My husband and I had the goat cheese appetizers and the mushroom rice ones that were really good, especially if you're a goat cheese lover like me. For our tapas, we had bacon wrapped dates, calamari, goat cheese in tomato sauce, skewered chicken and chorizo sausage, and short ribs with mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious! The beef was so tender that you could cut it with your fork. We also had a banana, carmel type tapas for dessert that was amazing! The place is really nice inside and our server was great. He explained everything we needed to know about tapas style dining and gave great recommendations. I also had a glass of one of the many different types of sangrias that they offer. I only wish I didn't have work in the morning so I could have tried all of them. Oh well, next time :-)
