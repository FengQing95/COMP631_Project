Little Goat Diner////My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It's been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it'll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another "must have." We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions.
