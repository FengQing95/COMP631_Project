Little Goat Diner////I want to like this place because the menu is so inviting to me, but I just can't. I've been here a few times and the food has consistently been so salty to the point of being inedible. Admittedly, I do have a low tolerance for salt. However, the atmosphere is cute, menu is fun, and service is good...just needs to tone down on the salt.
