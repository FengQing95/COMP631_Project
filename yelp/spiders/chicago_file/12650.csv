Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm giving this 4 stars for my husband. This is his favorite of the three Chicago style pizzas we've had: Gino's East, Pizzeria Uno, and Lou Malnati's. For me, it was my least favorite of the three, but it is still good. I prefer my crust buttery and flaky, and this was drier and more cracker-like, which is fine if that's what you like. There is also a strong tomato flavor which turned me off a bit (and again, my husband liked the flavor). But it is good--I'd recommend trying them all and seeing where you stand. It's fun!
