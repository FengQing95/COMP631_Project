Little Goat Diner////Visited Little Goat for lunch with a group of coworkers and had such a nice time! The space was beautiful and bright, and the servers were attentive as soon as we sat down. We started with some appetizers, which were the highlights of the meal in my opinion - goat chili fries and tempura mashed potatoes (technically a side, but still good as a starter). It took some willpower to look past the all-day breakfast, but I went with the BBQ pork sandwich. The slaw was nice and crunchy and the pork tender. We ordered the smoked fries as a side too. Yum. In general, the portions were huge, so nearly everyone left with to-go bags. I want to come back to explore the menu and make room for some desserts - saving a star for that visit.
