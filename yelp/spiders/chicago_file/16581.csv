Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'll also have to admit that Lou's wasn't always my favorite pan pizza.  The thing about Lou's pizza is that the crust is very crispy.  It took a while for me to warm up to it... hundreds of pizzas later :-)  I actually liked Due's pizza a little better for a while because of the crust.  Though many know that Uno's, Due's and Malnati's have the same bloodline.  Strange that someone might say that this isn't real pan pizza when this is actually the original Chicago pan pizza.  Thick dough never has and never will have anything to do with authentic Chicago-style pan pizza.  In fact, if you call it "dough," whether you're talking about thin crust or pan, you're not talking about Chicago pizza.  In Chicago, it's called a "crust;" for good reason.
