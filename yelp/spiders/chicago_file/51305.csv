Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our waiter brought us a complimentary chocolate tarte slice because it was our first visit.  Overall the brisk but super friendly service and the tasty dishes were really great.  Value wise they hit the sweet spot, every dish is fairly priced for the portion.  This is a perfect date spot as the tapas are ideal for two.  Do yourself a favor and take your significant other here.
