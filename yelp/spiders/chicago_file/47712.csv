Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Last week, I messed up my reservation and made it for the following day and was SO sad. They were completely booked but still tried their best to be accommodating. They sat all 6 of us at the bar and then gave us an awesome table when it was ready. It didn't go unnoticed. This is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.
