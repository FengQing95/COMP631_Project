Little Goat Diner////Went to Little Goat with my sister before the Black Hawks game. After eating at the Girl and the Goat across the street I was expecting a similar concept. I was quite surprised when we entered and it was a old style dinner with a twist. The service here was very friendly. While they didn't have any open tables we were able to be seated right away at the counter. We didn't make a reservation so was great to be able to get right in. The decor is 50's dinner down to the awesome 50's style wall paper and cool old school booths and counter top seating. The menu has everything from your Normal Burger all the way to a Goat Almighty topped with goat meat and Braised beef. Wanting to be adventurous I decided to try the Los Downed. While waiting at the counter we could see everyone's orders come up. All I could think was wow the portions here are massive. This place knows how to feed you. When my Sandwich came it was massive. This place didn't skimp at all. The hogie bread was loaded with tender braised beef. The Peppers and Onions were a nice addition of flavor and were not over done. The butterkase cheese also added a ton of flavor. The way all the ingredients blended together really made this sandwich stand out.. Only downside is it was messy but this was to be expected given its massive size. Would go back in a heart beat although I will have to give one of the burgers a try next time because they looked great!!!
