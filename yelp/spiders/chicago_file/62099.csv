Smoque BBQ////However, when my small portion of pulled pork showed up, lightly dressed in a vinegary sauce that I just wasn't quite a fan off, I was a little saddened. I had some of my girlfriend's chopped brisket and liked it, but was still let down. The mac and cheese arrived in a baby cupcake tin with a cheese sauce that was quite separated and gritty. I then relied on the brisket chili, which should have had a rich barbeque flavor, to be the home run to save the game. However, the dominant flavor was tomato with a tenuous barbeque-ish undertone.
