Smoque BBQ////People flock to Smoque BBQ in Irving Park for a good reason - pretty darn good BBQ. Luckily I've got myself an early lunch snack. Half slab of St Louis ribs was quite tasty but the peach cobbler was heavenly. They must have added a dose of magic to it and I almost had to lick the foil cup to get every last piece. Staff is super friendly and will assign you a table as well.
