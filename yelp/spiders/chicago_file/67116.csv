Little Goat Diner////A souped up Spanish omelet, a different but dry fig and pepper scone and the average cup of Joe from a very above average looking bakery is the basis of this review... But as first impressions go, I was disappointed with the more accessible but less impressive of the two Izard establishments on Randolph.
