Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Food was amazing! While my friend described his previous experience here as mediocre, he too enjoyed this dinner so it likely depends on what dishes you choose to order. As a group of four, we ordered 6 different tapas along with the pork paella and also tried a few yummy tapas desserts. My favorites were definitely the bacon-wrapped dates, the short rib, and the goat cheese in tomato sauce. My friends also enjoyed the pumpkin empanada dish. The pork paella was also quite fantastic too - it contained pork belly, sausage, and pork chops. The desserts were also very delicious, with my favorite being the dark choclate crema in orange marmalade. We especially enjoyed mixing and matching the various sauces that came with the ones we ordered. To add on top, it was a lovely dimmed atmosphere lit with candles. Overall, a very wonderful experience.
