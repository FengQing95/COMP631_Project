Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Entrees were the Steak Tartare, which the person said was the best she's had anywhere in Chicago.  Then one Steak Frites, again winning very high marks.  I had the 10 oz. Filet, Peppercorn, which was cooked to perfection for me (rare) and the peppercorn crust was nice, crispy, flavorful, and worth the small upcharge!
