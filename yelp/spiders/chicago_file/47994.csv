Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our first round was: bacon wrapped dates, fried calamari with jalapeno aioli, baked goat cheese in tomato sauce, and the beef medallions with potato chips. The bacon wrapped dates had SUCH great flavor! All bacon-y from the first bite, but the finish was with the deep sweetness of the date. It's a great flavor combo. The jalapeno aioli was absolutely wonderful with the calamari. It had a nice heat to it, which I would expect! The beef medallions were succulent and had a little bit of bleu cheese on them, but not too much, so it wasn't overpowering. The potato chips were fine, but I'm not a plain potato chip person. The goat cheese came with some crostinis to spread it on and they were perfectly crisp without being too hard to bite into.
