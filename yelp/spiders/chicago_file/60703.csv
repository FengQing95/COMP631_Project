Smoque BBQ////We tried the baby back ribs, brisket, fries, and baked beans. He had their Mac and Cheese, too (I've got a dairy allergy, so none of that for me). Everything was awesome. The ribs had those pink smoke rings in them and the meat was super tender (I don't generally eat pork, but made an exception here), all the sides were delicious, and I liked that the coleslaw was vinegar-based rather than slathered with mayo. I wish the barbecue sauce was slightly spicier, but I just like things that burn my mouth!
