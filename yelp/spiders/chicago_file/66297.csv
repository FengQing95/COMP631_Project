Little Goat Diner////Sunday brunch is crowded but good.  We showed up at 9:00 am at it was packed, loud and there was a wait!  So come even earlier.  I came in with high expectation and they were met and exceeded. The coffee was constant , the service was friendly and fast and the food was delic!  I had the parathas burrito with scrambled eggs vs sunny side and a side of hash browns.   The burrito was EXCELLENT!  The portion is huge, so it can be shared.  The hash browns were slap your mama good, the perfect of balance of crisp with gooey-ness.  Well done!  My buddy had the chocolate pancakes and with a side of bacon. She said the chocolate was so balanced that it made the pancakes exceptional.  The bacon was thick and lightly crisp so you can enjoy the juicy flavor according to her.  So this a major thumbs up.  Make this part of your brunch repertoire.  I plan to return on a week day when it is less crowded so I can try their lunch menu.
