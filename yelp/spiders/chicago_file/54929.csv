Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Frantically flipping through both sides of the menu we didn't know what to order since what we wanted wasn't on their menu. The night before, we compiled a list of numbers we wanted to order ahead of time. We were given a lunch and brunch menu, but all the numbers we chose weren't on there. Where's #41 - anchovies and #43 - the fried green peppers?!?! Rest assured our awesome server, Tim said anything goes if it's online. Now why in the world would they hide these delectable dishes? I'm sorry if anchovies and hot peppers offend you. Maybe that's why those numbers are invisible during lunch/brunch hours.
