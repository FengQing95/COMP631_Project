Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Not only were the pancakes delectable but the link sausage, bacon and eggs were cooked to perfection. The service was amazing! So basically what I'm saying is if you are in the Chicago area or are visting you NEED to stop by this place. I am seriously considering making a trip back to Chicago just to go here again (as soon as I get enough $$ for a flight lol). Great job Wildberry!
