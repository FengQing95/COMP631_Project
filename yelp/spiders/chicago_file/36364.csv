Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My second visits with my parents, so I was bit nervous if I can meet their expectations or not... but it turns out to be another astonishing experience! We ordered garlic shrimp as an appetizer, and tried beef stroganoff, steak frites, Rib-eye and filet mignon with wine from two mountains winery as well, and all these met my mom and dad's high standards! Thank you for making a wonderful mother's day :) :)
