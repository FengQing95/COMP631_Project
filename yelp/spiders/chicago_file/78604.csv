Little Goat Diner////Called a couple days before to see if I could make a reservation for outdoor dining. Although they are accepting reservations, outdoor dining is first come first serve only. Apparently rooftop dining is not open at this time. Decided to try my luck without a reservation and hope it wasn't as crowded people said it was a couple months ago.
