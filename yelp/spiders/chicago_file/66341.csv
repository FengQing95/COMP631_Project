Little Goat Diner////Oh me oh my! We were seated immediately at 10:00am on a Saturday, which is a GREAT start to brunch!  The place has fantastic ambience, and there was clearly plenty of thought and creative energy put into the design and flow here.  But about the food... I'd heard a few people say 'well, it's ok' or 'weeelllll, the portions are ok', but I quickly found the truth is that Little Goat serves huge, fresh-out-the-oven plates of awesomeness without fail.  The menu is easy to navigate, and there are plenty of options for both the breakfast/brunch traditionalist and for those more adventurous souls.  Our first round of bloody marys were exceptional, and just strong enough to leave me considering whether I actually needed another, and the spicing was spot on.  Our food portions from the brunch menu were fairly large.  What really hooked me was the foods' synergy.  My kimchi delicious breakfast thing looked great on the menu, smelled great on my plate, but the taste was otherworldly when all of the ingredients came together in one bite.  Without drinks, you could eat here for around $25.  But come on, it's brunch!
