Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Anytime a special event in my life occurs,  Bavette's is where I want to celebrate it at.   The space is stunning!   It has a speakeasy feel to it without being pretentious.  We started off with the seafood tower which was excellent!!!   The lobster claws were my favorite.   Juicy, sweet and succulent!  For my main,  the dry aged rib-eye was out of this world.  It was so tender that I was able to cut it with just a fork, and also perfectly seasoned.   Our waiter was knowledgeable from our cocktails to our dessert.   It's THE Chicago steakhouse of my dreams.   Thank you so much for existing in my city!
