Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////However, after dining at Ba Ba Reeba for a third time last night, I have come to agree with the masses... BBR certainly does have some tasty dishes! Maybe I was ordering all the wrong things before, because this time around I was impressed. I've never had braised lamb in Spain (and maybe I'm just not classy enough to eat at a place serving lamb), but that braised lamb sure was delish!
