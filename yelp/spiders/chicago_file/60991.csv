Smoque BBQ////Love this place!  I had the sliced brisket platter. With beans and coleslaw.  First of all the brisket was so tender you can cut it in half with a plastic fork with ease.  The smoke flavor was on par with some of the best BBQ I've had.  The beans were good, nothing to rave about.   The coleslaw was excellent. It was so fresh and crisp.  Nothing like the soggy stuff that  most restaurants try to pass off.  The place itself is just a simple layout. You go there for the food and nothing else.  It's a little off the beaten path.  Parking sucks.  So you want to either take a cab or bike it.
