Smoque BBQ////The only real let-down was the sauce. A cloying, citrusy mess. Like a mix between OJ concentrate and molasses. The meat was good enough that I enjoyed all of it without sauce, but I was surprised by the sauce. Seemed like they were trying to do something unique instead of just making a quality complement to the meat.
