Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////...And the verdict? Zachary's wins. At least for me. The pizza at Lou's was OOOOOOKAY. For someone who's used to getting tomato filled deep dish pizzas... These cheese filled ones were a bit bland... But I wonder if something was wrong with my taste buds? Because I couldn't really taste the heaps of red pepper flakes I put on top... Maybe it was the FANTASTIC salad that masked the pizza... Man was that salad good... Mushrooms, olives, baaaaacccoooon, tomatos... YUMMY YUMMY dressing... WOW...
