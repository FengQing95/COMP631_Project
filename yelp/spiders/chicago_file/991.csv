Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I know, I know, "Wildberry is great!".  Yeah, not so much.  I've tried to like this place.  I been there twice, the 1st time there was a hair in my eggs and the hash browns were covered in greasy onions when I asked for grilled. Do they comp'd the meal and have me gift certificate for a future visit. I went today, got one of their skillets and asked for NO onions. I get back to the office, excited to have what I hope will be a yummy breakfast, and it's full of onions. UGH!. I called they said, "Sorry. Do you wanna bring it back?". I waited about 30 minutes for my food in the first place, only for it to be wrong, twice. So nope, I won't ever be back. So disappointed.
