Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've dined here quite a few times, and I really don't have anything negative to say.  Food is outstanding and sangria is very enjoyable! Love the atmosphere and vibe, can get pretty loud inside. If it is a nice day, I highly recommend sitting in the front patio (there are only two tables out there so I would call ahead and reserve).  I always order the cheese stuffed dates, meatballs and bruschetta crostini thing. Servers are always outstanding. Hostesses can be a little standoffish sometimes but it is probably a pretty stressful job handling/seating the number of people they do. If there is a long wait I recommend hanging out at the bar and ordering a pitcher of sangria (mango is my fave).
