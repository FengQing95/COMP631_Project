Little Goat Diner////We were hungry and seemingly wandering without a clear destination when the daughter said, "Let's go to Little Goat!" Now, this was a little unclear to the parents who are not from Chicago. In fact, it could have been a reference to a possible pet choice as she has recently been talking about acquiring a furry companion for her apartment. Actually, she was talking about a really fun diner in the West Loop. We apparently arrived at a perfect time as we were seated right away. The menu includes many exciting options. We ordered the Bahn Mi Burger, the Patty Melt, the Grilled Cheese, and the Everything is Everything Crumpets. We had the bahn mi burger with the veggie patty. It was accompanied by a wonderful pickled veggie slaw, orange mayo, mint and cilantro on a fluffy brioche bun. This was really tasty and filling. Our patty melt with a beef patty included carmelized onions, special sauce, pickles, american cheese on house rye. This was a melt in your mouth treat! The grilled cheese was excellent and was made up of gjetost (Norwegian cheese with a sweet carmelly tang - very yummy), cheddar, ham, apple-tomato relish on house made bacon gouda bread. This was so good. The combination was unique and very tasty. Finally, the everything is everything crumpets were very good. The light and toasty crumpets were paired with lox, fried egg salad, tzatziki cream cheese and pickles. Really enjoyable. We had a great time at Little Goat Diner. The service was very helpful and attentive. The dishes we enjoyed were unique Â combinations of ingredients and were delicious. Next time we are in Chicago visiting the daughter we will have to try some of the other items on their tempting menu.
