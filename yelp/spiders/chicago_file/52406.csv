Smoque BBQ////Thumbs up, dirty sticky finger nails and all. Certainly not a fancy highfalutin steak place that has ribs, only possibly pretentious staff and owners behind the counter placing your POS on scrap yard friendly cafeteria trays. Anyway, you can at least sit down wearing your filthy grubs instead of rushing home or gobbling it up in the car. The prices are on par with the take out places, the supposed standard when getting sincere Q. Northsider, well maybe there's one in Evanston that's barely worth avoiding the southern comfort road trip. Don't be suckered into the allure of the take out being more authentic, unless you are more into the soulful Zen of white bread and fries soaking in the sauce routine. Instead of wasting your time and depleting your gas tank, take a load off and taste a couple of Popeye sized sides with your smoked protein. BYOB, maybe you might prefer that 40 oz. bottle without the brown paper bag you've grown accustomed to.
