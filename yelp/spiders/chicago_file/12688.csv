Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Here's the deal, the 'za was great (not as good as Manhattan) but don't expect any special treatment just because you're a customer. The wait was moderate -- shorter than they said, but hey, it was a Tuesday night, what do you want? We pre-ordered which meant the food came a few minutes after we got our table, big frickin deal, right! A couple of us came in a few minutes after the family was seated...takin' care of some business, you know, and we never got our soda until I went up to the bar and said, "Hey, where's my freakin' soda?". Â By the time they brought the soda we needed more water. The hostess/manager/whatever said she would bring waters right away. Never saw them! If the food wasn't so freakin' good this place would be closed in a month. Ciao!
