Art Institute of Chicago////Wow, I was thoroughly impressed with this place. I did not expect it to be as grand and beautiful as it was. The Art Institute of Chicago has a world class art collection. It is literally a labyrinth of art with every kind of art you can imagine, from photography, pre-historic artifacts, knight's armor, ancient Japanese pottery, antique "doll houses" that mimic interiors of houses in different countries throughout different periods of time, and more. They have an incredible collection of impressionist and surrealist art. I was in awe throughout my whole experience. These things don't exist in Miami :-(. I felt like a kid in a candy shop, but I'm also an avid art lover. My favorite part was just seeing all the classic antique furniture, the Dali's, Picasso's, Van Gough's, Leger's, Manet's... Take me back! I love how it is just a walk away from Millennium Park. Great for a day-date!
