Little Goat Diner////You will not be disappointed with the food!  Everything is great, creative and flavorful.  I much prefer breakfast there but their diner menu of sammiches isn't bad.  You will need to be adventurous though...they use lots of non-traditional meats and cheeses.  So far my hands  down favorite is the Bull's Eye French Toast.  The pasta and clams is also a good one.  I wouldn't write home about the Rueben but could see how someone else might love it.  The smoked fries saved the day for me.
