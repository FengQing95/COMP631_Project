Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////** Update: I received a message here on yelp (See reply below to my review) from a manager at Lou Malnatis, in regards to my situation and this review, to fill out a survey and that I'd be contacted by the management team, in regards to the issue we had. I filled it out and completed the entire survey/ questionnaire, and that was almost a month ago. No one has contacted me, nothing has been done. It almost seems as if the reply on here was a way of them covering for my terrible experience and trying to appease only as a facade for anyone reading my review. Therefore, I stand by my previous claim that customer service needs some SERIOUS help! It's not right that companies with high volume of sales can get away with things like this and be unscathed by rightfully unhappy customers.**
