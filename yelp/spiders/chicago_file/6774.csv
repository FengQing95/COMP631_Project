Art Institute of Chicago////Obviously the Art Institute has a great reputation for its collection of masterpieces and diverse art. I wanted to add my experience here as an educator. When I first became a teacher I heard that they offered free admission to us, so I took the train down to take advantage. I had also heard that they had some free materials for teachers so I thought I'd check that out too. I showed my teacher id and they let me in without the standard "donation" (which I believe is almost twenty dollars now). They directed me downstairs to a room that was filled with probably thousands of lesson plans and ideas for teaching art or incorporating it into other areas. I am not an art teacher, I'm an elementary school teacher, but I went to town with taking advantage of the abundance of materials offered to us. There was a WONDERFUL young woman who worked in that room and helped us with sorting through the materials and making copies of ANYthing we wanted. I was so impressed and so grateful for how much they were giving to us teachers. To have a whole room and staff member dedicated to this was amazing. A few of us teachers stayed in there for hours, collecting as much material as we could. I left with stacks of copied art lessons/information that I can incorporate into my everyday lesson plans (which is important today with art being cut in many schools). I encourage all educators to visit the museum to take advantage of this wonderful resource.
