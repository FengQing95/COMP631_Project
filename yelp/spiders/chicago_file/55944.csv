Smoque BBQ////Amazing BBQ!  The girlfriend and I had the brisket, sausage links, baby back ribs, mac & cheese(best I've ever had), baked beans and fries.  ALL were excellent!  Place is not cheap, but portions are fair and the "treat yourself to kick ass BBQ every once in a while" experience is worth it.
