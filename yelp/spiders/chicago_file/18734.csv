Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the lunch special, and some appetizers and was very disappointed. We ordered the combo platter and everything was good except the pickles. They tasted like a plain cucumber breaded and fried. The calamari Â and ranch dressing was amazing!!! The pizza was ok, we were told after we ordered the lunch special(personal pizza) that they are made ahead and frozen and that's exactly what it tasted like. Maybe we should have ordered one and had it made fresh.
