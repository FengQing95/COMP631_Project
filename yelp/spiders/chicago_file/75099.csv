Little Goat Diner////Phenominal food! The apple tomato soup was refreshing and bursting with flavor. Mac N Cheese was second to none, creamy with a light crunch on top! The Chick Pea salad was also unique and the Harissa vinaigrette was tangy, slightly spicy deliciousness!!! Definitely a must try when in Chicago!!! Stephanie Izard does not disappoint.
