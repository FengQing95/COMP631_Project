Art Institute of Chicago////- A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte was beautiful because of how big it was but the funniest part was on the opposite side of the wall, there seems to be a small version of this with slightly different characters also by Seurat. It's kind of funny because the small version almost seems like his practice round before he drew the real thing.
