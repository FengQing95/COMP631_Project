Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is one of my most favorite place to eat in Chicago but the reservation people maybe should learn something called courtesy in the restaurant business. I called tonight to make a reservation and it was fully booked only had 10pm available I told her politely that I'd take it and if there is any cancellation if they could let me know, but she said in a not so friendly voice that they are probably more busier than me ??? ... I understand it's a busy place but high class customer service is expected by patrons no more no less . #PhoneEtiquette
