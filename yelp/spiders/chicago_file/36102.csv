Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Everything was far too rich, buttery, and salty, including the sides and steak. They cooked mine incorrectly twice. For the price I'd hope they could find medium rare accurately. Good atmosphere, service was ok, but again the steaks and sides are far too rich and salty. Certainly no need for the added side of bechamel sauce.
