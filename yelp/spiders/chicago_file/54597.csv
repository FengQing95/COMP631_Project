Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We tried the eggs Benedict, shrimp and grits, potatoes and onion pancake, one of the waffles and Spanish rice. All of it was good- nonetheless thing mind blowing though. I like the idea of getting to try a lot of different things but some times it's a little weird. For example, sharing an eggs Benedict 4 ways is not easy.
