The Purple Pig////I leaned on Yelp to tell me what to order and it did not disappoint! I ordered the bone marrow, octopus, milk braised pork shoulder, and crispy pig ears. The bone marrow was ginormous but it was the best bone marrow either one of us had ever tried. We needed more bread to finish the bone marrow! It was so simple but so delicious. Everything was just so equally delicious and unique in it's own way. The octopus was the best we ever had also. It wasn't tough or chewy at all. The milk braised pork shoulder was so tender that we were only given a spoon to cut through it. The crispy pig ears were nicely fried and was packed with flavor.
