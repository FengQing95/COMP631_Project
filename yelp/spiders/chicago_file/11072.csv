Art Institute of Chicago////Tip - Coat check on Michigan ave can have really long lines, do yourself a favor and coat check at the modern wing entrance just south of Millennium Park. We were able to check in and out with little wait or hassle. Coat check is $1 per piece and well worth not having to lug your stuff around during the colder months.
