Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Holy crap does this place get packed on the weekends. You'd think they would know that and maybe provide a little more waiting room. It's great they have an Intelligentsia coffee bar, but right by the door? There's no room for me to even order or wait for my coffee. Food is decent. Kinda hard to screw up breakfast food.
