Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I sat at the bar with other customers, by themselves like me for the most part, and the girl behind the bar was the least personable considering she is in a customer oriented job. She just did her job of serving the drinks and food with hardly no interactions with customers. I stayed there for one hour and she relentlessly chat up her colleague server or bartender without even bothering.
