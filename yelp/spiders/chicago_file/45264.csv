Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First off, I have to mention the drink experience: The make-your-own bloody marry drew my attention, but I decided to go for a glass of rose. Needles to say, my husband said he had never seen me finish a glass of wine quicker before! He had the raspberry sangria, which I has a sip of, and it was DELICIOUS.
