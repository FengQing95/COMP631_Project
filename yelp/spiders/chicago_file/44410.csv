Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The first time I went to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba was probably a good three years ago. It was my first tapas experience and I did not enjoyed it. I didin't know what to ordered and our server wasn't very helpful at all. I have never gone back since then but a friend, convinced me to go back and try it again and I did. I went there for Xmas eve dinner with some of my close friends and this time I loved it. We ordered the creamy garlic potatoes, it was really good. We also ordered the Scallop that was delished and a few couple more. Even the Pomegranate Sangria was amazing! I enjoyed all of them, the service was great as well. However, I wasn't quite liking the deserts, except the Mango Sorbet but you can't really go wrong with that.
