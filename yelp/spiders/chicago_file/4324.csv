The Purple Pig////This place was so absolutely delicious. Best lunch I've had in the foreseeable past. The service was impeccable and never wanted for anything. Great wine selection. Delicious food. Pork blade steak with sobrasado and arugula salad was delicious, but the pork belly and tenderloin with a ginger glaze, carrots, and beets was my absolute favorite. The chef showed insane skill with the tenderness and perfection of each bite.
