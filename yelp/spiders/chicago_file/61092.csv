Smoque BBQ////I had the sliced brisket sandwich and it was delicious. Tender, flavorful, loved every bite. I have to give credit to Aidan L. for the discovery, but the spicy rib sauce was incredible and trumped their regular BBQ sauce by a million. Definitely head up to the counter to ask for a container of this! I also loved the vinegar based coleslaw and the mac n' cheese. Serving sizes of the sides aren't overwhelmingly large, but it's definitely enough food to get you full. The boyfriend really enjoyed his pulled pork/brisket combo with fries. We also shared a little side of cornbread which was very tasty. Overall, in addition to the thousands of reviews already posted for Smoque, I would go during the week and absolutely order brisket and mac n' cheese, ensuring you pick up a side of the spicy rib sauce.
