Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Went there around 6:45 and people were already eating there. I tried the fresh berry pancakes -- you can get 3 or 5 in a stack, and the 3 was just right. It's medium sized pancake, not the small dollar sized pancake.  The waitstaff was very friendly, and will ask you if it's the first time.  The sausages were good, although nothing out of the ordinary. Coffee was good, and I probably got a fresh batch.  Easy walk from the hotels that are in the New East Side.
