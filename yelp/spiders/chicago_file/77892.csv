Little Goat Diner////Ya girl can eat. And so, when I go out, I look for a solid price with a good plate. I can safely, and happily, say that this place lives up to that. While you might be hesitant about the pricing at first, what you get for them makes it a solid deal. They got some pretty interesting flavor combos going on, and their presentation is beautiful--for other dishes; there's only so much elegance you can get for a pile of fried chicken, after all.
