Little Goat Diner////They have an interesting concept, lots of unique dishes you won't see at other restaurants. I had the bull's eye french toast which was great, my wife had the spaghetti and clams which was pretty good. Little goat latte was flavorful but kinda heavy. Pork and toffee shake was a bit expensive but worth trying. Our waiter was very courteous and attentive. The wait can get pretty long so plan ahead, especially on weekends.
