Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I ordered French Toast Brioche and it was very good. My boyfriend ordered a chicken panini with fries and they gave him a small handful of fries. Why be stingy with potatoes?? The hostess also told us our wait would be 30 minutes and it ended up being over an hour. I wouldn't have minded waiting an hour, but please be more accurate with your wait times. I'm also pretty sure that the larger groups got seated before I did (I had a party of 2). Overall, this place is pricey, the food is only okay, and the wait times are not worth it for me. The restaurant is okay, but nothing spectacular.
