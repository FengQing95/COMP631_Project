Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I went here with my fianc√© for a special occasion and upon making a reservation I requested a secluded booth or table, if available. When we arrived we were lead downstairs and seated in a totally private booth in the corner. It was so dark on the lower level but I absolutely loved that about Bavette's. It was only illuminated by subtle lights and candles.
