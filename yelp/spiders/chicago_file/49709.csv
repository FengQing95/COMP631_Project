Smoque BBQ////Absolutely Amazing.  My boyfriend, his father, and I went here last night after hearing that the one and only Guy Fieri had gone here on his show, DDD.  Every single thing we had was good.  My favorites were the mac-n-cheese, fries, and Brisket.  I am such a big fan of the carmelization of BBQed foods, and this place has it down to a science.  Truly a great BBQ spot.  Do not be scared of a long line it goes really fast, and they work really hard to find you a seat!
