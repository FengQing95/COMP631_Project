Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There was a wait of about one hour on a Friday night even to place a carryout order (!), so we walked down Wells to The Pepper Canister for some friendly pints and Irish whiskey. I took my order, a personal pan Chicago Classic for $8.95--easily enough for two meals--back to the hotel. It was none the worse for wear, and in fact the second half was excellent the next day.
