Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Made a reservation last min, was seated right away. Sangria was very good, maybe ordered too much but we drank it. Enjoyed all he food we ordered, no complaints on the food. The food comes out randomly which kind of works but you fill up on one dish and then the next one comes. Enjoyed dining here.
