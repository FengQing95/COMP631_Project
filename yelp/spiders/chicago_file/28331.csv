Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's been a few years since I've been to Gino's and Giordano's but I appreciated that Lou Malnati allows you to put an order in while you wait to be seated. It definitely made the wait less longer since we already waited about half an hour for a spot during a mid-Saturday afternoon. I'd definitely recommend and return to Lou Malnati's!
