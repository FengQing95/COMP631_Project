Smoque BBQ////Yum! This is one of my favorite BBQ places in the city. Beats LillyQ and Q hands down. First the meat is great even w/o the sauce. But the sauce is an added bonus--sweet and a tad hot! The sides are great, too. We usually opt for the mac and cheese, beans, and corn bread. It's a bit of a hike from downtown but worth the drive.
