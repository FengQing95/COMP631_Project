Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the sausage pie with onions, peppers, sliced tomatoes, garlic, and spinach.  It was very good, surprisingly.  I can't say that it is actually pizza.  It is more of a casserole or lasagna type of thing.  The crust was more of a pie crust than a doughy pizza crust.  The toppings were very tasty and of high quality.
