Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I could rave about each item on the menu that we tried, but I will focus on the most amazing cut of steak I think I have ever tasted in my life.The Chicago cut Rib-Eye was so phenomenal, I do not think t can be topped. Not only was the service superb, every item we ordered was amazing. I'd like to think that I am pretty well versed in restaurants and I am going to venture out and say this is by far the best meal I have ever had in my humble 33 years.
