Little Goat Diner////Of course, being full, somehow, didn't stop me from ordering dessert...I mean...two desserts...heh. I ended up getting the french silk pie, which is basically the most perfect chocolate pudding in the most perfect crust, topped with crunchy chocolate somethings and served with a giant dollop of whipped cream on the side. I'm not even that big of a chocolate fan, but this. I could eat this every day. (Thank God I don't live there, so I actually cannot eat this every day).
