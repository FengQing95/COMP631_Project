Smoque BBQ////ok let's talk portion control. I can overeat with the best of you slobs. . .Smoque's sandwiches are plenty big, even if you're one of those carb haters that scrapes the meat off. It comes with a "small" fry that has about 2 potatoes' worth in a grease lovin mini grocery bag and a fistful of slaw. I am not into slaw; I ate this slaw. It's crispy and fresh and has no mayo. Nice celery seed flavor to it though. The owner told me they add fresh dressing to the cabbage every 20 minutes. So kimche it's not. Thank god.
