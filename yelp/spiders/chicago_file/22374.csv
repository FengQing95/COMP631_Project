Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Well, we hit up Lou Malnati's as our last meal in Chicago before heading home to Las Vegas. Of course, we wanted to partake of some of that famous Chicago-style deep-dish pizza. So, we hit up Lou's based on the heavy recommendation of our river tour guide. Not gonna lie, we were kind of disappointed, and we are not picky eaters. We had to wait about 40 minutes for our pizza to bake--totally normal for deep dish pizza, which is fine-- but it just wasn't the amazing pizza we were hoping for. It was just kind of, bleh. The salad we had as an appetizer was very much the same. So, we left kind of bummed. A Giordano's just opened up here in Vegas, so I'm looking forward to giving that a try. There are tons of other options for deep dish pizza in Chicago, so I'd probably try one of those before giving Lou Malnati's a shot.
