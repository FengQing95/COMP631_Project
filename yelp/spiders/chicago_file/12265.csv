Art Institute of Chicago////I was most looking forward to seeing the Monet, Renoir and Degas Collections, they are my favorite Impressionists, Monet especially. We were surprised at how many famous paintings were all housed under the same incredible roof. There were quite a few Picasso pieces, Vincent van Gogh Gauguin, Mary Cassatt, CÃ©zanne, Grant Wood, Georgia O' Keefe and many, many, more.
