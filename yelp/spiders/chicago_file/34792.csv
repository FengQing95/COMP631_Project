Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great dark jazzy atmosphere.  My partner's bone in filet was one of the best steaks I've ever tasted and the macaroni and cheese was terrifically rich with the requisite crispy edges. Unfortunately my $35 piece of halibut was way overcooked. Our waiter was the guy with the beard who views himself as a comedian and his job as a vehicle for his performance.  This means the experience is all about him....he even engaged the couple sitting next to us in a good deal of cursing. I found him and his shtick annoying. A super pricey restaurant like this needs old fashioned waiters who give excellent service and melt into the background. This dude needs to head over to Second City where he belongs. Probably wouldn't return to this place.
