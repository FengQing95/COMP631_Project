Art Institute of Chicago////The free visitor guide points out the most famous paintings in the museum with which most people are familiar, def use that as a guide for what to see. I absolutely LOVED the Leichtenstein exhibit. I've seen some of this work in media before, but it was amazing to see in person. Throw in some Picasso, Van Gogh, and many other famous paintings (American Gothic, Nighthawks), and it's a great place to spend an afternoon.
