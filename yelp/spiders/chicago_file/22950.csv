Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Having a wife from Illinois I know all about Lou's and other Chicago pizza places. Here in Texas where we live we do not have Lou Malnati's and on a recent trip to Illinois I had two requirements while visiting: 1.we visit and eat Lou Malnati's 2. We visit and eat Garret's popcorn. We did both along with many other places and I am glad we did. As far as I am concerned Lou's is not only the best Chicago style pizza they are absolutely the best pizza in the United States. I do have Lou's shipped every now and then and that is also amazing but when in town it is a great place to visit. The food, atmosphere and service were all top notch!
