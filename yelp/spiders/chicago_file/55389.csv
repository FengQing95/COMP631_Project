Smoque BBQ////Ok, sure... it's more fun to get BBQ in a little run down place on the side of an old dirt road run by an old man or woman with smoke-stained hands... yes. I agree. Chicago has had a few greats that fit this category too (.. the original Hecky's on Greenbay, Leon's on the south side... Oh Edith! We miss you so!). Smoque is not this. It doesn't have that cinematic, "I've come across something nobody else knows about" thing. They won't cast Wilford Brimley or Bill Cobbs to play the owner in the movie about this place. But really, who cares? For me its about how the food tastes... period. I don't require the foreplay... just fork over the smokey meats please.
