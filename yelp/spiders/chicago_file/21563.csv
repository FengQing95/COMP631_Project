Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////it would sacrilege to not have deep dish pizza visiting chicago.  pretty good!  the caesar salad was delicious.  the pizza--i liked how the crust was not super greasy.  i think the sausage could have had a little more seasoning, but for those being health conscious this is not necessarily a bad thing.
