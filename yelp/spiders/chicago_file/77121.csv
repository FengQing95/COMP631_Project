Little Goat Diner////Definitely make a reservation. We sat outside on a Monday holiday afternoon. The service was great. I didn't try any of the fancier drink options but enjoyed a glass of wine. The food here is outstanding. I highly recommend the Little Piggy goes to China. It is seriously unlike anything I've ever ordered before - such a unique, incredibllu delicious breakfast/brunch option.
