Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So after my pizza high I hit a low again because the waitress was no where to be found and we told  her before we got the pizza we wanted the dessert cookie. S we wait again. Glad we had good convo while waiting. We get another waitress to  put  in our order. When it arrived  it was  perfect. The best cookie  that  has ever graced my palate. I was full and I wanted to  order another one. So I  have to return to chi town for some more. Great  place  just  wished the service was  better. EAT UP!!!
