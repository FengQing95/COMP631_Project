Art Institute of Chicago////As the afternoon got late, we stopped in a cheerful cafe for coffee and a sweet. They have good seating throughout so you can rest or focus on something amazing. I was very fascinated with the sculpture rooms and the paintings are beyond words. Leda and Zeus as a swan....oh, I wanted to feel the swan but I don't want to ever get in trouble.
