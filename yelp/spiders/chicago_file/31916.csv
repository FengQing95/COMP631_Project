Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So wanted to try Lou's on my trip, and after our architecture boat tour, we came here on Sunday around noon. I appreciate you can place your order, and they text you with updates for your wait. We didn't wait as long as they said (30 minutes) but given a bar top table right next to the door, so it was really chilly everytime the door opened and closed.
