Little Goat Diner////Came here for brunch with my gf and a couple of other good friends and wow it was amazing. My friends got there early to put their names in so I only had to wait about 10 minutes while they waited close to 40-50 minutes (yayyyy friends :D ) on to the food though. I got the breakfast asian pork kimchi pancake thingy, my gf got the barade and kimchi and pork with biscuits, my other friends got the corned beef hash with eggs, the tonkatsu sandwich, and the super chocolately pancakes. The pancake thingy was absolutely delicious. Super fluffy with lots of kimchi and egg and pork belly with lots of scallions and mung bean sprouts on top. There was a type of fish sauce that came with it but I was happy without it, not because it wasn't good but because the pancakes were just really tasty. Everyone else was extremely happy with their food considering we were all quiet for the first 10 minutes after getting our food.
