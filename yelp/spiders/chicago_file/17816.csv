Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Being a new transplant to Chicago I am certainly not the one to even pretend to be any sort of authority on Chicago-style pizza, but this place came highly recommended to us and certainly lived up to the raves from those who recommended it. Â We went on a Wed around 8PM and were able to get metered parking right out front and get a seat with no waiting.
