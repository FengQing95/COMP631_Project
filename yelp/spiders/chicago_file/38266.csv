Bavette's Bar & Boeuf//// I definitely won't be in a Hurry to go back for dinner, but will definitely go back for cocktails, because you can bring your own btl of wine or bubbly, with NO corkage fee, they just ask that you share a taste w/1 other guest in the restaurant. And the appetizers were quite good. Again, the ambiance I really loved & such an intimate setting.
