Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza came cold after 1.5 hour of wait time. Restaurant said it'd be worth the wait because the pizza would come so fresh, so I expect it should at least come hot? Also, poor, poor customer service. Sat down for a good 20 min before anyone came to ask us if we want anything to drink. If they ask you to pre-order during the 1.5 hour wait time, no need. It doesn't make a difference at all. You still won't get any food until 35 minutes after you sit down. Servers are unresponsive. Food definitely didn't worth the wait and poor, poor service. Avoid.
