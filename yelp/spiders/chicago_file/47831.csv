Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The only thing that stood out was the dates wrapped in bacon - but let's be honest, everything wrapped in bacon is amazing. The sangria - I had about 4-5 glasses and didn't even have a buzz. Did they forget to put the alcohol in? It was my birthday, I wanted a buzz. Kind of disappointing. I've had way better Sangria.
