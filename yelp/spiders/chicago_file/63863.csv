Smoque BBQ////Dry, no smoke ring, and lacking in flavor.  How can you serve smoked brisket without a smoke ring?! Without the fatty parts this brisket would be inedible as the texture and dryness of the meat was comparable to that of canned tuna.  Did I also mention that this was completely lacking in flavor?  Easily the biggest disappointment of all the meats.
