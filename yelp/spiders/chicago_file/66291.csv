Little Goat Diner////My boyfriend and I stopped in at Little Goat on a Wednesday night around 7:00 and were seated immediately.  In fact, the very kind host even accommodated our request for one of the two-person booths along the back wall - thank you! We were a bit overwhelmed by the many delicious-sounding options on the expansive menu, but eventually settled on our order.  Our waitress was adorable and very well-informed about the menu, giving suggestions when asked and adding interesting tidbits about what we were ordering.  I settled on the BBQ pork sammich (enormous!), while my boyfriend went for the chicken Cordon Bleu.  We also split an order of the fried pickles and onion rings.  Across the board, the food was excellent, with each dish offering a unique interpretation on a classic diner item - often in the form of an unexpected hint of a new flavor.  Drink options were great too - I was overjoyed to find my beloved Cheerwine on the menu, and our waitress kindly brought over samples for my boyfriend to try when he couldn't decide between two beer options.  We finished the night with a "Peppermint Mattie" sundae, which tasted exactly like a Thin Mint Girl Scout cookie with a little kick incorporated in the chocolate gelato! Overall, we both thoroughly enjoyed our experience - from the playful ambiance (90s radio hits and roadtrip-style sing-along music) to the thoughtful beverage options, to the delicious and hilariously-named fare, Little Goat delivers.  We'll definitely be back for breakfast soon!
