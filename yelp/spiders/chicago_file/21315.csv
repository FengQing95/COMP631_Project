Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm not a huge fan of deep dish pizza.  However when choosing a deep dish, Lou Malnati's is THE ONLY choice.  I think what makes them particularly unique is a cornmeal crust which adds a lot of texture and natural sweetness, not to mention a crunch and flavor that isn't as bland as a straight flour crust.
