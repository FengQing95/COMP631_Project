The Purple Pig////What is meant to be, will be, and the Purple Pig was meant to be! First we stopped by Friday night and the 45m wait was not conducive to our touristy artsy fartsy plans for the evening. How foolish of me not to realize this was THE place to dine, so no we did not not have resys or even the slightest idea of the wait time. However, as the stars would have it, we were able to walk in for an early dinner on Saturday and be seated right away.
