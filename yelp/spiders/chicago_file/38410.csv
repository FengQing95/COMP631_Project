Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I went back here for the third time last night and this place is still hands down my favorite restaurant. This time my boyfriend and I ordered the meatloaf, bone-in filet mignon, truffle mac and cheese, pommes frites, brussell sprouts, baked potato, and chocolate cream pie. Oh my GOD, we were so satisfied and stuffed at the end of it all.
