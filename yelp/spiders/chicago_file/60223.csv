Smoque BBQ////I'm a business traveler, so over the years I've been able to eat at many of the famous (and not so famous) BBQ establishments in the US.  Here is what I know:  Just because its famous, doesn't mean its good (duh); and a "hole in the wall" BBQ does not always insure you will have BBQ heaven on your plate.  Something else: most places have a specialty - the ribs, pulled pork, brisket or perhaps even a side; beans, corn bread, etc., while the balance of the menu is only so-so.  Regional tastes dictate different preparation methods, but come down to sweet, sour, hot, mild, salty, peppery an/or various combinations thereof.
