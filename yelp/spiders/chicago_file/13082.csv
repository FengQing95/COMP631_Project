Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Simply the best deep dish pizza in Chicago hands down.  Not the best pizza in the world, country, or even county - just the best deep dish pizza in Chicagoland.  I like mine with the butter crust, but who wouldn't?  I think of the pizza as more of a casserole than a pie as it is so thick and rich.  Other items on the menu of note are the Malnati's Salad which like all of their salads are huge, enough for two or three to split.  I like to order delivery since the dining room has little to be desired for ambiance and generally has a vast amount of children dining in.
