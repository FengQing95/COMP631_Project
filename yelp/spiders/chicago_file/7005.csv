Art Institute of Chicago////Pretty extensive art museum.  Smaller scale than the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC, but that makes it good because you can't get lost here 2-3 times like you can at the Met.   I like art, though I'm not especially educated in art or art history, but I do appreciate art in its expression and aesthetics, and this museum has a little bit of everything for everyone's aesthetics.
