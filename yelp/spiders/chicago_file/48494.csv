Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place, it's Â one of my favorite restaurants and also the best Tapas restaurant I have ever been to. You wouldn't think the same items at different tapas restaurants would be so different .. but it is very noticeable to me, that this place just does everything a notch better. You definitely need a reservation though. Even though the place is huge, it is always packed.
