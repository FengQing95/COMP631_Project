Art Institute of Chicago////First off I have to say I love art. If you are an art lover then this is the place to be. There are beautiful paintings that spark conversation from a multitude of people. From the iconic lions at the entrance to the beautiful garden next door with a beautiful fountain there are many great sights. The modern wing is just a gorgeous set up and the historical paintings are breath taking. I personally love the Greek and roman history exhibit they have located right next to the modern wing. However, my favorite exhibit is the tiny rooms. They are a true insight into life during the time period they are suppose to exemplify. They are a must see at the Art Institute of Chicago.
