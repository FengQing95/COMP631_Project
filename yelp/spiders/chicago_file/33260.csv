Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The atmosphere if very classic and classy, lots of wood and mirrors and Â plush booths to sit at. I've had the prime rib sandwich , kinda pricey at $21 but hey, its a special night out and the aus jus is off the chain. The steak frites are also a good option. All of the appetizers I've tried are very delicious. The drink menu is concentrated on classics and the execute them perfected. Service was great. Big fan of Bavette's.
