Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Imagine a plethora of designers and architects taking over Chicago for an insane party called NeoCon.  Imagine trying to find lunch anywhere near the merchandise mart.  Imagine being in heels and realizing that you'll be hiking your ass somewhere b/c you're in Chicago and it is absolutely necessary that you eat deep dish pizza.
