Little Goat Diner////I've been here twice for brunch and tried a variety of things. They are all pretty delicious, but don't have a lot of lighter options IMO. I enjoy the food a lot but then feel kind of greasy and heavy afterwards. It's not too hard to make a reservation, so it's highly recommended that you make one! There are always lots of people milling about waiting to get seated. The servers have been pleasant and attentive too.
