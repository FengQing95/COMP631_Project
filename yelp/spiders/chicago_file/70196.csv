Little Goat Diner////I visited this place this past weekend with 3 youth kids and my family.  I enjoyed the shrimp cocktail however I wouldn't recommend them for children.  My young ones didn't like the noodles that they are fried in even though they normally love fried shrimp.  They were big and plump large shrimp and the cocktail sauce was tangy w/ just the right amount of spice.
