Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As recommended by a few Chicago natives and locals, we went to see for ourselves if it was everything it was hyped out to be. On our first visit, we ordered the "Chicago Classic" - which basically is sausage, extra extra cheese, and their signature tomato sauce. And when i say sausage, I don't mean sausage as in carry out pizza sausage... you know, little turd pieces of sausage scattered across the whole pizza?.. well, no no no no no.. none of that here at Lou's. Here at Lou's, I mean sausage as in a whole freaking slab of sausage (lean sausage may I add) covering every square inch, every square centimeter on the pizza!! The "Chicago Classic was so good, so meaty, so cheesy, and oooohhh the crust, Oh so buttery!! We also ordered "The Lou" which has some veggies on it such as spinach, tomatoes, and shrooms. That was good also but, hey I'm a meat kinda guy so I prefer the Classic Chicago!
