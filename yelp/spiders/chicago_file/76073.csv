Little Goat Diner////Overall, I was impressed with Chef Izard's upscale diner. The menu is large, but considering the long hours it's open and the impressive crowds it pulls in, there's plenty to satiate a wide variety of appetites. The pork belly pancake is certainly a winner and has me salivating for my next trip back to Chicago. Girl & the Goat is now a must for me.
