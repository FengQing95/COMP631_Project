Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great deep dish pizza! Â We were quoted a wait time of 40 minutes but somehow got a table within 10 minutes! Not going to complain but maybe keep that in mind if they quote a long wait time? We wanted to get some chicago deep dish and knew that deep dish usually takes a while to cook, which we were expecting. Love the fact that our server checked back with us periodically while we were waiting for our pizzas since most places i've gone to for deep dish pretty much ignores us during the time our pizzas bake! I had "the lou" pizza which was delicious! My friend had the pepperoni which was good too, so if you're just looking for a simple pizza, can't go wrong here! you must also get their cookie or brownie dessert! Both are delicious!!
