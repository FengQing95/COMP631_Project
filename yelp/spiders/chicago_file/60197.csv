Smoque BBQ////My family headed outside to wait for my brother to bring the car around because of the rain.  The owner happened to walk outside to tell us we could wait inside, if we wanted to.  We ended up standing around the front talking about the restaurant and how the business runs.  He also explained how Smoque ended up with an article in the New York Times and the reason behind the umbrellas.
