Art Institute of Chicago////If you're a huge art geek like me, you will definitely enjoy this.  This was part of the City Pack that we bought (which I highly recommend) and it lets you in through the "fast pass" line so you don't have to wait in line!  We were also given an audio tour guide contraption which dangles around your neck and all you have to do is press in numbers that corresponds to the art.  It's pretty useful but some of the commentary are sooo awful (like the Jackson Pollock one... I felt like that commentary was specifically aimed for young children).
