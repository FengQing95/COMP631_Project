Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Incredible!! The wait was pretty long for a Wednesday night (1 hour and 15 mins) you can pre order which cuts down on the typical 40 min wait for cooking which is nice. We had a salad they recommended and it was FABULOUS, we also order a Medium Sausage and Medium "Lou" they were great too! We didn't get our food as quick as I expected (we preordered) but the manager was amazing and got it out within minutes! Some of the best service I've ever had! It has a great name for a reason - food and service. Come here!! You won't regret it!
