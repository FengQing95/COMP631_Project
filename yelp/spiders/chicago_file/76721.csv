Little Goat Diner////We were excited to try out Little Goat Diner after a enjoying a great meal at the Girl and the Goat. We waited for 30 minutes on a Sunday night for an indoor seating - it is possible to make reservations, although it's not a long wait. I may have expected too much from the Little Goat, expecting it to be more of a twist on diner food. But I felt like the food I had there was very much like diner food and not much more :( We had the fries with cheese and goat chili ($12) and the "Patty Melt" with the veggie patty ($14). The fries and goat chili were good, but it didn't blow my mind. Then, the patty melt was so anti-climatic, it was literally a sandwich with a piece of cheese, the veggie burger patty and some onions inside. The veggie burger didn't taste anything special and the whole "Patty Melt" felt like something I could have slapped together at home in 3 minutes.
