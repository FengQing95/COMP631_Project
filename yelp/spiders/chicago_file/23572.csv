Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Well, that "little disc" turned out to be quite delicious!  I loved their signature Buttercrust™--so buttery and tasty!!  That was probably the most delicious crust I've ever eaten in my life.  And the sausage was a gigantic layer that covered the entire surface of my pizza--not little chunks sprinkled throughout.
