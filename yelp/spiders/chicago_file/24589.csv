Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have tried other Chicago pizzas when I'm on vacation at the tourist places like Gino's or Pizzeria Uno/Due, but this place beat them all!  The crust is a butter crust, which really comes through and balances the acidity of the tomato sauce. We ordered the meat lover's pizza, which was loaded with meat. It as if  someone rolled out their italian sausage so it covered the entire pizza. The delivery came faster than they told us.
