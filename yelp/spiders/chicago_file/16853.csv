Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Next time, I'm going to get the Lou and add hot giardinara which I didn't add this time because I didn't want to mask the taste of the sauce. And, I will ask them to cook it well done. One notable thing that I really like about this place is that they are very open to you customizing the pizza the way you like it and that makes me happy. I like additions and things.
