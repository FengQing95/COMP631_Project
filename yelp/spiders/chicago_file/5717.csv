The Purple Pig////While some dishes were better than others, I enjoyed every dish here and appreciated how experimental and unique they were, but with the flavors all complementing each other well. This is not just any old tapas place, but a destination I would recommend for any Chicago foodie looking to expand past steakhouses or Italian food. Looking forward to coming back and trying more dishes!
