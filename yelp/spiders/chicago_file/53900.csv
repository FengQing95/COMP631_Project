Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We've been here a couple times for brunch and both times it was great! I would recommend 4-5 tapas per two or three people. We got the French toast, goat cheese, Mac and cheese with bacon and a poached egg, spicy potatoes and meatballs. Everything we had was great and the service was spectacular.
