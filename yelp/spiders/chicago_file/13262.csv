Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I love the waiting game in Chicago once seated your pizza always takes 30 minutes atleast to arrive (and damn rightfully so if it's authentic) Â You watch as Pizzas go by and your stomach starts grumbling, you wish you would have ordered an appetizer and gnaw on your straw, fingernails the table... Then the moment arrives and you are in Pizza bliss (you don't get this feeling in NYC and I've been everywhere to be had there my friends)
