Little Goat Diner////Don't let the sometimes odd ingredients scare you away from trying things, I had the Ruben with Kimchi and it was excellent. We had no problem getting a seat at the counter but there did seem to be a wait for groups of 4 or larger. The portion sizes seem to be inconsistent which is my only complaint, at first I was concerned since I saw things coming out of the kitchen that seemed quite large but for my Reuben it was smaller than I was expecting. Still I will be back to try other combos since the Kimchi blended so well with my sandwich.
