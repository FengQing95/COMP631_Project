Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is usually pretty busy, and I normally call ahead to check the wait or make a reservation, but this last time, we went on a spur-of-the-moment type deal.  The host said it'd be a "short" wait, and by short, they indicated that it'd be under 5 minutes.  Well... it was more like an hour.  I wasn't super annoyed: I wasn't in a hurry for anything that night, and we might've just had terrible timing as it looked like a huge influx of two-tops were just recently taken.  I politely asked the host twice during our wait when our table would be up, so they knew we were waiting.  Finally, I think they just felt bad because they gave us a four-top (only 2 people in my party).  Also, to make up for it, they comped us a whole pitcher of sangria AND gave us THREE desserts!  Ok, that made up for the wait, and I left the server a fat tip (which would've gone to the sangria alone anyway).
