Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time in Chicago and everyone from friends to my uber driver were telling me to try this place if I wanted a good deep-dish pizza. Now I'm completely basic when it comes to pizza preferences so I will say coming to this place did not turn me into a deep dish fanatic but I definitely enjoyed my meal. There was a ridiculous wait but they allow you to order your food while waiting for a table. I was able to get my table pretty quickly because I was solo dolo. My pie consisted of half of the Chicago Classic & half of The Lou (only way I could do this is if I ordered the size up from the personal). Both were so good but definitely couldn't finish it so I took it back to my hotel for the next day (tasted better than the day before).
