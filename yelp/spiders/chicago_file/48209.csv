Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my top places in the city.  Great for groups (helped me organize a surprise party!), girls' nights out, date night, celebrating any occasion... or really any time/just because.  I love their sangria and every plate that I have had is just mouth-watering.  I can't wait to go back.
