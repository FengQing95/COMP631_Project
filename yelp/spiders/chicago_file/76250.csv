Little Goat Diner////After a disheartening flight to Chicago, a desire to eat my feelings led to Randolph St. It was very late, but Au Cheval still had an hour wait, so we ventured into Little Goat. Our sleepy host promptly guided us to a table near the back of the restaurant where I had a good view of the kitchen staff, all of whom were wearing either bandannas or hats. No worries of sweaty food here. The menu is in a true diner style with a laminated triptych. I was mainly interested in the breakfast section, which is served all day, and decided to order Biscuits and Gravy along with French Toast.
