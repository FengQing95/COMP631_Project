Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is incredible. I think we got 10 dishes and literally every single one was great. The place is huge and they do a nice job of spacing the tables out so you don't feel to close to anyone. Our servers were super friendly and very attentive. Cannot say enough nice things about the food. The best we've had in Chicago by far! I could literally eat 30 of the chorizo wrapped dates. Highly recommend!
