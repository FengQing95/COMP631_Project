Little Goat Diner////Our food was delicious - we had the machos nachos (took 3/4 of it home - large portion), the cheese sauce used was excellent. Also, I had the bulls-eye french toast which was excellent (mine came with strawberries which is not noted on the menu for those that can't do berries) and my mom had the blue plate special - which she really enjoyed. Â We did get a better finger sundae - mostly just to try the chocolate covered cheez-it's. All of our food was excellent and we brought a good amount home.
