Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here a few time and this place is always busy. The food is served tapas style. It's very good but a little over priced in my opinion. Get the potatoes with the spicy mayo sauce. I'm not sure what they're called. The red sangria is my favorite too. A great place to take your family from out of town.
