Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Don't be fooled by the gimmicks, the food is outstanding.  I would go here over Cafe Iberico, any day.  Its authenticity is questionable, but the flavors, care, and preparation that go into each tapas is top notch.  Again, the sangrias aren't exactly authentic, but are delicious and a great addition to the meal.  Good quality, a bit pricey (but justified), great patio for the summer time...the only complaints are that it could be a cleaner, service could be tightened up a bit, and the waits can be off-putting on a busy night.
