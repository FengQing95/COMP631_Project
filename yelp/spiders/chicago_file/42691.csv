Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Always a great choice for large group parties, birthdays, and events. Such a fun ambiance, prices are decent, and the food is consistently good. Paella is an absolute must. I'm a vegetarian and I always find enough to eat - would recommend the veg paella, Brussels sprout salad, baked goat cheese, and stuffed mushrooms. The almond caramel bar for desert is also delicious.
