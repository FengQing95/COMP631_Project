Art Institute of Chicago////Great museum.  Compared to the MET in NYC, I have to give 4 stars.  However, there is a lot of iconic art (American Gothic, Afternoon in the Park, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, and lots of Georgia O'Keefe) in this museum that really makes the visit worth it.  We wanted to visit a few places in the short weekend we were in Chicago so we only spent about two and a half hours in the museum and only got to see about half of it.  It is definitely an all day thing if you want the full experience.  But the staff is helpful and knowledgeable.  They can tell you where specific things are located or if they are traveling to other exhibits so you don't go searching for something you can't find.  I specifically really loved the Chagall Windows!
