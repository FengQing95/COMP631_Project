Smoque BBQ////Let me begin by saying.....I live on the westside of Chicago.  There are several places with excellent BBQ ribs on my side of town, but I've heard rave reviews about Smoque so my husband and we decided to stop in when we were in the area over the holidays.  I hate to say that I was sorely disappointed.  We ordered Baby Backs and St. Louis ribs.  They were not to our liking.  Although very tender,  I was not crazy about the taste.  I didn't get that "smoqued" flavor I crave from the grill.  What happened to that?  This is another place I can mark off my list.....I tried it.
