Little Goat Diner////We happened to get sat right at the pass (where the food goes from kitchen to table) and we not only got to see almost every dish on the menu pass by (I have never gotten so hungry waiting for MY food before), but we got to see the kitchen in action. It was like watching a cooking show on the Food Network, but live. Watching the kitchen peeps hustle and flow was almost as enjoyable as the phenomenal Los Drowned Sandwich we ordered. It was a french dip sandwich at it's core, but Stephanie Izzard-ded to a new level (what the HELL do they put in that au jus!?) - undeniably the best french dip I've ever eaten and in the running for my Top 5 Sandwiches of All Time.
