Little Goat Diner////On day 2 of our Chicago visit we landed at the Little Goat diner for brunch and it certainly did not disappoint.  I ordered this little pig goes to China and can I just say that I'm still craving it a day later!!!  Every dish we had was top notch a by far the best food we had in Chicago.  Everyone must check this eatery out ASAP!
