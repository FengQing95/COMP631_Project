Little Goat Diner////THE HOLY GRAIL. I love this place and the waitresses/hostess!!! (if you are reading this, you guys are amazing) very thoughtful and attentive. I live in NYC and I hope and pray they'll open up a Little Goat in NYC. I'd go there 8 out of 7 days. Their blueberry pancakes, TO DIE FOR. but my all time fave is the Presley waffle... if you love peanut butter and waffles... get it. They have the best hash browns also! AND DRUM ROLLS!!!! THEY HAVE BARISTA SPECIALS!!!! Get yourself a cup of coffee, ask about the Barista's special... they NEVER fail to lift my spirit!
