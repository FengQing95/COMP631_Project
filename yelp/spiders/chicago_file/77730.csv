Little Goat Diner////This was a mistake. I don't even like dark chocolate. The pile of 3 large pancakes had chunks of dark chocolate chips and malt balls, which made it slightly crunchy. The pancakes were dry though, but too sweet for me to want to add syrup. I will not add butter because that's just more dark chocolate that I already don't like. Maybe someone who loves dark chocolate would dislike it less than me. Â This was a mistake for us.
