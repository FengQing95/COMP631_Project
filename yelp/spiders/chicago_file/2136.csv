The Purple Pig////I have wanted to go here for a long time and finally had the opportunity to visit.  They do not take reservations, so I would have been nervous about making a business lunch here if I was pressed for time and did not know when I can be seated or served at all.  However, I got there a bit before noon and had no trouble of being seated right away.  The food and drinks were spectacular.   The highlight of the meat was a roasted glazed duck that sent us over the moon.  My friend, who thought she did not like duck, loved it too.  This is a great casual lunch place or an after work place if you like great food and can stand the thought of not having a reservation. If you have to wait, it is worth it.
