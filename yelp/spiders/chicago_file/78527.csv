Little Goat Diner////My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered "The Little Piggy Went to China." Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I'm very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn't hesitate to order this dish again.
