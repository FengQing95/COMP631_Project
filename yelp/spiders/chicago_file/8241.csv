Art Institute of Chicago////I just had my wedding at the Art Institute of Chicago and it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life.  We had the whole museum to ourselves after hours on a Saturday night in March. The staff there treats you and your guests like royalty.  Everyone is so professional and accommodating.
