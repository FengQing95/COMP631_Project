Art Institute of Chicago////had a GREAT time milling through. first of all, they changed their free hours from tuesdays 5-closing to thursdays AND fridays, 5-closing. i think this is a summer thing, but either free day is good with me. regular admission is $12 for adults, $7 for senior citizens and Â students.
