Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////To begin, I loveeee pizza and I was very excited to try Chicago's classic deep dish pizza from Lou Malnati's. All of my friends from the city are obsessed with this place so I knew I had to try it. After venturing around Mag Mile and RiverNorth, I came across Lou Malnati's on a cold, windy day and knew it was finally time to try it.
