Little Goat Diner////The food was well prepared and truly enjoyed by everyone.  Loved the Fat Elvis Waffles - great change from the norm.  Hash browns, Spiced Apple pancakes, and Chocolate Chip pancakes were shared and ravished by all.  Highly recommend the Little Goat Coffee.  Our server, Joan, was attentive by not obtrusive, making good suggestions and very helpful to our (and the kids) needs.  The other staff worked well in concert.
