Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Love the atmosphere, location and restaurant itself! My kind of pizza joint. The deep dish takes 45 minutes to cook so order ASAP and put in some appetizers to avoid getting hangry. The pizza was delicious! Dough was a little flavorless and "doughy" but I loved the sauce, and the cheese was extremely fresh. I got the classic, I wish the sausage wasn't a full patty size, it made the pizza fall apart after each bite. I actually prefer it in smaller bits. And the sausage was really there for texture not necessarily flavor. But I still enjoyed the pizza for a deep dish.
