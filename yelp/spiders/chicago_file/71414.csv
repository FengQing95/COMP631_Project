Little Goat Diner////My boyfriend got the burger and he liked it enough that there was none left to take home. My dad got the sloppy joe but he had them put it on the bread-of-the-day which was something with peppers in it. He loved it. My step mom had another sandwich (I can't remember which one) and she said it was great. I picked the tuna melt. It was a hot mess. It also reeked havoc with my plumbing. I couldn't taste the bread which is a shame because I assume it was baked there and probably awesome. The tuna was nothing special and had this cheese sauce over it that resembled welsh rarebit. Then you had a frisee salad with beans and eggs. It was just too much! It didn't even look appealing.
