Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tapas we ok.  I was not impressed. The potatoes I had  reminded me of BBQ Jays (the taste).  I also did not like the mushrooms stuffed with sour cream. The mushrooms were mushy.  The waitress was super nice though.  I would go back to have a sangria, and maybe try something else.
