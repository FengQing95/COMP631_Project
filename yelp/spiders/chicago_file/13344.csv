Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't know what to say about this place that hasn't been said before.  It was great, and I would have to put it above Uno in my opinion and that is all it is, one persons opinion.  The pizza didn't have an strange oily taste us southerners are not used to.  It was cheesy.....a huge plus and my wife did not like deep dish and now she is a lover of the pie.  That is saying a lot.  Good job Lou, good job.  Only critique is the place isn't bigger, but that's Chicago so noted
