Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The ambiance here is lively, dark, and great for a date or nice dinner with a group! We tried 8 tapas for a group of 4 and the seafood paella. All of the tapas were great, especially the fried peri peri chicken thighs. Most tapas come with 1-3 servings, so it's good to order a spread so that everyone gets enough to eat! The paella is quite large and was perfect at the end of our tapas. The sangria full-sized pitcher was anything but small, which was also much appreciated!
