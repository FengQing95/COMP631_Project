Smoque BBQ////  Four friends  got together for wine and BBQ on Friday-The boys picked up the food. It was a Friday after all, and that means some time to mellow, chill, and enjoy laughter with friends. After splitting a few bottles of wine, i was not feeling too hungry yet, I still needed some liquid hydration both with and without alcohol.  BAD CHOICE!! I should have eaten the second it arrived!!  By the time I got done indulging, and got around to eating, my portion was gone!!!
