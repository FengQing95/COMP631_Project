Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered the bacon wrapped dates, beef tenderloin with blue cheese, brussel sprout salad and seared sea scallops. The bacon wrapped dates tasted like they had a maple glaze on them and were absolutely delicious. The tenderloin and blue cheese melted in your mouth and was really rich and flavorful. The brussel sprout salad was alright, nothing very exciting. I wouldn't reccomend that if you are considering it. The seared scallops were very good and sat on a bed of acorn squash puree.
