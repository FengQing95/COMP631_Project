Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went to cafe ba ba reeba while visiting Chicago and someone recommended it to us. All we can say is wow!! This place does get very busy so I would suggest going early. We were able to find a seat at the bar and our bartender was phenomenal. We started with the chorizo date and oh my gosh this was so good. We also got a deviled egg to start. Next we got potatoes with tomato aioli and these were also so good. We then ordered octopus and #61 on the menu. We loved the octopus but were disappointed with #61, it was more of a charcuterie board which we weren't expecting and it took a very long time for it to come out even though nothing was cooked on it. Overall this place is absolutely amazing, we wish there was one back home for us to go to.
