Smoque BBQ////The ribs were probably 3-1/2 stars.  Pretty good flavor and a nice rub.  They were not intensely smoky although they are very dark.  This is how dark my ribs at home looked when I did not realize how hot my smoker was running.  I have since fixed that problem.  I suspect they are smoking all of their meat too hot because it is all really black but not exceptionally smoky.  The ribs on this occasion also were a little overdone.  You can see a lot of white bone in the photos that you should not see.  I'm sure there is day to day and rack to rack variability but this kept my appraisal short of four stars or better.  Certainly they are worth trying again.
