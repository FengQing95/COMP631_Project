Little Goat Diner////Coming from Southwest China, I actually have a pretty good handle on what Szechuan food is supposed to taste like, and Little Goat hit the nail on the head with this one. Coupled with the biscuits and the sunny side egg, this dish was interesting and complex both taste-wise and texture-wise. The strawberries kind of threw me off though. I didn't really understand their purpose but I ate them anyway and tried not to question their existence.
