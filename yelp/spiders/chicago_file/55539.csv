Smoque BBQ////I love this place!  It's an adventure to just stand in the long line to get in.  Everyone is in a good mood and you meet people from all of the suburbs who have made their trek into the city just to eat here.  The food is worth the wait.  Every bite is amazing.  We always order extra to take home for the next couple of days!
