Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We started with a pitcher for Cava Sangria between 3 people. It was basically the perfect amount. About 3 drinks per person. It was fruity and delicious. We got Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Spinach & Manchego-Stuffed Mushrooms, Serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo & manchego platter, and Grilled Octopus with mojo verde, potatoes, olives, migas. Everything was delicious and quite filling even tho they were small plates. I like how they indicate the popular items in red on the menu. For dessert, we got Caramelized Banana, Chocolate Truffle Cake, and Butterscotch Custard. Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything here especially the popular (red) items.
