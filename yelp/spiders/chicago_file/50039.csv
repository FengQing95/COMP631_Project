Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba has become a go-to spot for me over the past year and a half! Delicious food, nice atmosphere, and the place is huge so I can always get a reservation. I recommend for both dinner and brunch. Get the classic red sangria and stick to tapas-- the paella is fine but not my favorite. They also have good happy hour deals and a DePaul discount.
