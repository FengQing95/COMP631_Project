The Purple Pig////Pig's Ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried egg: My GF and I loved this dish. I could eat those pig ears every day for the rest of my life! The crispy kale was also very good. The pickled cherry peppers give it a nice acidic and spicy kick and that amazing egg yolk just coated everything to make the dish rich, creamy, flavorful, spicy, crispy and acidic. SO GOOD.
