The Purple Pig////We got a cheese board with jam and crackers, ricotta gnocchi (they were able to make a tomato based vegetarian sauce from scratch), and potato smashed which is accompanied by an amazing yogurt dipping sauce. Â It's a small place that does not take reservations. It has a fun vibe and great bites and drinks!
