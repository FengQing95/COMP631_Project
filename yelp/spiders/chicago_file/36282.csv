Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The second issue I will not accept any blame for...the steak was flat-out cooked rare, pink all the way through (not simply in the center how medium-rare is supposed to be). Perhaps I should have expected this since when I stressed to the bartender that I wanted it cooked "medium-rare plus," I pretty much got the "yeah, okay, whatever" treatment parents get from their teenage daughters when they advise them not to talk to boys or play the music too loudly when driving. As with the gimlet, I took a couple bites, pushed it aside and asked for my check. I wanted to order the chocolate pie (which I know is great from previous trips to Gilt Bar), but was in such a foul mood that I passed on it (went and got it next door instead).
