Little Goat Diner////Without a doubt one of my favorite brunch places ever. As one would expect from one of Stephanie Izard's brainchildren, you won't find the dishes here anywhere else. Ingredients you would've never expected to go together are harmoniously combined to form dishes that are nothing less than exquisite.
