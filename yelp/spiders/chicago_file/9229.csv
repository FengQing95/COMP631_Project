Art Institute of Chicago////I've loved this place since I was 10 years old. I'm not sure most kids that age or younger would have the patience to stay longer. I love Van Gogh and many other artists too and think, instead of traveling across the world, that this was a great day trip choice to see some popular and intriguing artwork. I definitely recommend!
