Little Goat Diner////Seriously, the Bulls Eye French Toast is so good that half the time I go to Little Goat I don't even look at the menu because I know I'm going to order it anyways. When I have been able to look past the french toast, other favorites of mine are the pork belly pancake and the patty melt. I've also had some yummy salads in the summertime but it looks like they change that a little more seasonally.
