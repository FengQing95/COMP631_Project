Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I ordered the small wedge salad along with the spicy fried chicken.  The wedge salad was sooo delish.  If I'd known the bacon was good as it was, I would have asked for an additional one.  They provide a bottle of hot sauce with the fried chicken so you can put as much as you want on it.  No complaints at all on this dish.
