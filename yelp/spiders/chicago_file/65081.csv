Smoque BBQ////We've been meaning to try Smoque for quite a while... sorry to say that we weren't really impressed. Overall the meat lacked smoke flavor and was pretty dry. Our party tried ribs, chicken, pulled pork and brisket. None had much smoke. Brisket was really dry and didn't have much flavor. The ribs were probably the best of the bunch. The sides, on the other hand, were all good - chili and coleslaw were especially good. Sorry to say we won't be back - still searching for good bbq in Chicago....
