Art Institute of Chicago////A must-see for first-timers to Chicago. Reserve a full day as there is so much to see and you will need to pace yourself. The museum's collections of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and American paintings are simply impressive. There are more than thirty paintings by Monet as well as a collection by Renoir. Of course, we had to see Grant Wood's "American Gothic" painting! Being a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright, it was nice to see furniture pieces designed by him throughout the museum. The building itself is impressive especially the entrance on Michigan Avenue with the two iconic bronze lion statues.
