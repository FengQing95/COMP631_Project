Little Goat Diner////My wait time on Sunday afternoon is 45 minute. They have this high-tech system where they will text you if your table is ready. They have 2 sections one for dining and one for a bar. I ordered Bull's Eye French Toast and it turned out too sweet for me. My bf doesn't like the atmosphere of the restaurant since it was too crowded, loud and we got seated at the big table sharing our space with others. I have no problem with that but wish I could get a better seat. I might like it if I live around there it could be my regular spot but since I came here to see what the hive is all about I don't see anything much.
