The Purple Pig////Probably one of the more upscale places I wouldn't have imagined going to. I came across this place a few days before my friend and I took our trip to Chicago. It ended up becoming one of her friend's recommendations for must try places. So, one nigh we decided to just go for it since we were in the area. The wait time for a table of two was about an hour. To kill some time, we ended up walking around before indulging. We got seated promptly and the atmosphere was dimmed, but made it feel like a very lively outting- in. The waitress let me sample 3-4 different types of wine just to figure out my preference and she was more than accommodating in helping me select the right one.
