Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Overall verdict: Lou's can make some good pizza, and the namesake is there for a reason. As for the Chicago classic, if you want a meat based pizza I'd stick with just a regular pepperoni or sausage deep dish because the ratios will be a bit more favorable. Unless you're willing to say cheese.
