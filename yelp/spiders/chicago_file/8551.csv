Art Institute of Chicago////While I was visiting, the curator was working with their staff to add to a Van Gogh installation which occupies its own room, just beside the Toulouse Lautrec exhibit (which is impressive & extensive). It was interesting to watch a bit of the process and handling of these masterpieces; they only roped off the room - not close it.
