Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was excellent and very filling. The bread was a really great sourdough with a crunchy crust and warm insides served with softened butter. We then had the crab cake, which was excellent (especially the sauce that it came with). As for entrees I had the lamb chops while my mother had the bone-in prime rib and we both shared a loaded baked potato. Â The food was very good quality and quite filling but luckily there was still room for desert, an incredibly rich and cream chocolate cream pie.
