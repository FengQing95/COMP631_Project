Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have family in from Ireland and I brought them to Ba-Ba-Reeba last night for dinner. We were a group of 6 and were very comfortably seated. I'm telling you, none of them have stopped talking about the ambiance, the service (thank you, Tim... very knowledgeable, attentive and friendly), and especially the FOOD!
