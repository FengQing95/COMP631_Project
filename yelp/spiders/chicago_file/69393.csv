Little Goat Diner////I dined here because my wife and daughter had heard about it. Overall I was not at all impressed. No one found any of the dishes to be above average. I had the fried chicken which came with 3 pieces and cole slaw. $14.00 give me a break!! Service was very good, food was average, but over priced. Ambiance was nothing special. I typically would give a restaurant a second try. However, I don't see them lowering prices or improving the food, so I won't be back.
