Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Both times we got the Malnati pizza. The first time we got a large, with only 3 people. That was a mistake. It was 8 pieces and we could only do 2 pieces each because of how dense and heavy one piece is. It's like eating a stuffed cheesy pie with sausage goodness. The crust isn't thick at all, it's the perfect thickness with the perfect amount of buttery crispness. I still prefer thin crust, but I know when something is good and I'll give credit when credit is due. If you have 3 people, a medium will be 2 slices each. Go for that.
