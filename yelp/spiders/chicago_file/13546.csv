Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Loved the crust. If they could combine their crust with Pequod's fresh toppings - omgosh. The wait can be long, but you can grab a drink and wait outside until they call you. They also allow you to order ahead of time so you don't have to wait too long for you food to come out once you are finally seated (takes about 30 minutes to make the pizza). We ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic - my family couldn't stop raving about it the entire trip (and we are NY, thin crust type of foodies!).
