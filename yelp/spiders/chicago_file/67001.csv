Little Goat Diner////Food was great, most of the staff was great, but our waiter was TERRIBLE. It was a busy morning, but he was completely checked out, forgetting to put in orders and bringing out single plates of food at random intervals. In all, after getting to our table and ordering right away, breakfast took nearly 2hr with the last (forgotten) plate coming out as we asked for the check -- seemed like every table around us was having the same experience..
