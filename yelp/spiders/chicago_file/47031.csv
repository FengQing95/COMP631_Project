Smoque BBQ////Hands down best BBQ in Chicago. I frequent Smoque on a weekly basis and always get the pulled pork sandwich with fries and a side of the mac n cheese. All of the sides are great and the sliced brisket sandwich is also excellent. I know a few people who've had the ribs and said they were the best.
