Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came to Bavette's with a group of 6 after having eaten at both Maude's and Gilt Bar.  The interior reminded me of both; a trendy place to have a great meal with an old school atmosphere.  Our waiter was not only helpful and honest, but clearly enthusiastic about his job, and more importantly, the food.  As per his recommendation, I went with the pork chop, which was perfectly cooked, succulent, and had a mild lemon and herb flavor.  I was able to try their signature bone-in filet, which rivals that of Mastro's.  The side dishes were all great, especially the chile lime corn, but do not be expecting massive sides like most steak houses.  The crabcake was also great as were all of the salads.  The oysters were some of the cleanest, best done I have had in the city.  For me, the desserts were nothing too special, although pretty good.  Perhaps overall a bit overpriced.  Of the three, however, Maude's is my favorite.
