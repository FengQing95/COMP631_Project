Smoque BBQ////The peach cobbler was in a different league altogether, however. My wife is a big cobbler person, and she was ga-ga. I thought the crust, while not your typical cobbler crust, was better than anything I have ever put in my mouth as part of a cobbler, and the peach stuff tasted like fresh peaches (a little tart, not too mushy); cannot ask for much more in this arena (unless it would be to make it cherry cobbler - if they had cherry cobbler to compare to the peach, I would move in...).
