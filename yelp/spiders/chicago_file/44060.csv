Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Also,  AWESOME place to hold private parties.... I cannot stress this enough.  We had the back left room...  (though the back right room was more intimate, our group was too large for it)  But still, the planner for that place was great.  Great food/drink packages and I don't think there was even a facilities charge.  Our guests left buzzing about the super fun night of great food and drinks.
