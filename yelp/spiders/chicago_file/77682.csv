Little Goat Diner////Smoked Pork and Toffee Crunch Shake (To-Go): One of those sweet/salty desserts. It was a very addicting, decadent vanilla shake. It would have been better had we eaten it with a spoon for how thick it was. They only had regular-sized drinking straws which were unable to take up the toffee bits so we were left with a mound of the delicious toffee at the end which would have tasted better had it been mixed in.
