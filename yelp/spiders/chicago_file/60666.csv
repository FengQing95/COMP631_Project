Smoque BBQ////I've never been a Brisket eater, but every time I've went I had to get it ( which sucks because I really wanna try their ribs, but get trapped ordering the Brisket!) and I love BBQ sauce! I swear I'd eat an Elephants asshole if it was slathered in BBQ sauce,but this Brisket is so good it seems a crime to cover up the taste with sauce.
