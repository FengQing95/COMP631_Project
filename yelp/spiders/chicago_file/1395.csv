Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Their coffee is delicious - I think I've mostly stuck to the lattes, but they're good quality espresso drinks and I appreciate that! The food has been hit or miss: the eggs benedict were not great and I'd pass if I were you.. their normal breakfast fare (eggs, hashbrowns and bacon) is really good.. their omelets are so-so (although portion sizes are huge).. and one time I had the buffalo chicken salad which was phenomenal!
