Little Goat Diner////- Portion sizes varied a lot so within our large party, we ended up sharing. The chocolate chip pancakes and Bull's Eye french toast items were huge, little piggy went to china was average, and the okonomiyaki was tiny.. A well-run restaurant would not have inconsistencies with the portion sizes if they are priced relatively similar
