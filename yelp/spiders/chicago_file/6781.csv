Art Institute of Chicago////I had to hop in here late on morning after a long night of drinking throughout the city.  I was pretty bombed when I tried to buy a ticket but the guy said it was twelve bucks!  To see some old paintings I think I said but then remembered that I had hid a twenty in my left shoe. I asked him if any other suckers waste their money on this shit but he didn't hear me since he didn't respond.  I looked for a good place to have a vomit and found a nice row of bathrooms near some children's room.  Then I decided to find some famous paintings since I was feeling better after several heaves in and out of the toilet.
