Little Goat Diner////We're smiling hearing that Jonny made you feel like a regular in a small neighborhood diner! He'll be delighted to hear that feedback, and we're very pleased that you thoroughly enjoyed This Little Piggy Went To China. The Little Goat team is always happy to serve someone who has an appreciation for big flavors, and we hope to see you again soon for brunch, Barbara!
