Little Goat Diner////We tried to brush off the mishap and focus on the food. I ordered the omelette of the day which had crab rangoon, and wonton. Others in my party ordered a breakfast burrito and the french toast. For appetizers, we got the brussel sprouts and the garlic mashed potatoes. We asked for gravy with our mashed potatoes, which never came.
