Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was with a friend, and we started off with a single order of bruschetta. It was fucking delicious... fresh tomatoes, cheese, basil on tasty toasted bread. Yes, I was biased because it was the first real Chicago thing I'd eaten since arriving the night before, but the freshness of it is undeniable. Sadly, it did take up more room than I anticipated. So when we got to the Maltani Chicago Classic pizza, we were already slightly full.
