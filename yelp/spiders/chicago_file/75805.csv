Little Goat Diner////If you're like me, and it's too late, and you're in Chicago and you didn't plan your meals at all then you should definitely pop into Little Goat Diner. The idea behind Little Goat Diner was to allow the growing bakery program from Girl & The Goat to flourish and offer patrons seeking a taste of Izard an easier and more accessible option.
