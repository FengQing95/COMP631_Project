Smoque BBQ////First time my Hubby and I went to Chi-town and He insisted we head to Smoque after watching that feature on TripleD. I am SO glad we went... We took the blue line all the way to Irving Park. HANDS DOWN... Best BBQ ever!!!!! What we ordered: St. Louis Ribs, Baby Back Ribs, Coleslaw (came with ribs), fries, Mac&Cheese, Beans, and corn bread!!!
