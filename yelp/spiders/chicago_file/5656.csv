The Purple Pig////The Crispy Pig's Ears, on the other hand, intrigued me initially, but I found this dish to be disappointing. (First off... they were not purple as one might expect per the restaurant name!!) While all the pieces of both pig's ears and kale were crispy, the overall dish tasted flat (just like fried oily crispy stuff), with only the pickled chili peppers adding any dimension to the flavor profile. The pig's ears were cut so thin and were breaded so heavily that I felt like I was merely eating strips of fried dough. The portion was decent, but the lack of substance made me feel it wasn't worth the $15.
