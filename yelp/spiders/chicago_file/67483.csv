Little Goat Diner////Food was very tasty, EXCELLENT service (Camille), and the atmosphere was aces. My boyfriend had the nachos as an entree; this I would NOT recommend, they are far too rich for one person to eat alone. DELICIOUS, but he felt kind of sick when it was over. I had the chickpea salad-amazing; not a healthy option really with its fritters and fried onions but I who is going there for a healthy dinner. Finally the brussel sprouts are a must have. Please, do yourself a favor; so tangy, and crispy...mmmmmmmm! Overall, my review is great vibe and rich food with excellent service. Oh I almost forgot about the turtle pie. Quite possibly the best desert I have ever had.
