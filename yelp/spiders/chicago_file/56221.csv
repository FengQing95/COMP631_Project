Smoque BBQ////I had the beef brisket platter with mac & cheese and cornbread. My husband had the pulled pork platter with baked beans and cornbread. Everything was delicious. Even the coleslaw was good, although I prefer the creamy variety (this is more vinegar based). We shared the peach cobbler for dessert which was out of this world. I'd come back here just for the dessert alone.
