Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Anyway, I had met up with some friends locally and this was the spot they chose. These guys are fabulous - I can't tell you how fantastic everything was, from the gimlet at the bar, to the appetizers, efficient and accommodating service, flexibility of my ordering and dining style, nailing my black-n-blue (very rare cold center with crust) steak, along with the ambience and decor. The vibe here is speakeasy combined with male oriented steakhouse elegance, with a touch of everyday casual dining attached with servers who rock.
