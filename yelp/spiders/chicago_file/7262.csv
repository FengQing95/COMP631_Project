Art Institute of Chicago////I live in the suburbs of Chicago and a friend and I decided to make a trip to the city to visit the Art Institute. It was a colder day and we had to wait outside in a very long line to get in the door. After we finally got in we waited some more to get to the ticket counter. Once we got to the counter, the young, snippy early 20-something girl asked if I had any food in the shopping bag I was carrying. I said "yes" as I had a sealed shut bag of popcorn. She barked back very rudely "We'll, we can't let you in with food."  When I turned around to see the coat check/locker area, she was quick to bark once again "...and you can't check it either!!  You'll either have to eat it here or throw it out".  Uh, it was a big bag of Garrett's popcorn honey!  I will not be throwing that away!!!
