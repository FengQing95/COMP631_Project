Little Goat Diner////Dishes are quite big here, so don't do like we did and order 3 things to share, it's just way way too much.  My hubby loved his Goat Melt, and I loved my Korean Bi Bim Bop on cauliflower rice, and washed it down with a Bloody Mary.  I think we both ate half our dishes and were stuffed, but yet our 3rd item came out lol.  Jessica G. insisted I order the crumpets, but luckily I had forgotten, no way we would have had room!
