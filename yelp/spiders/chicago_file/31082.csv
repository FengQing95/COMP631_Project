Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first time in Chicago and I had to try traditional deep dish pizza! Everyone I talked to said this was the place to go. There are multiple locations throughout the city. It was very good! The wait was 30 minutes at 1 PM - we went to get a drink at a bar next door and they texted us when our table was ready. I gave them 4 stars because of the service. Our waitress only came up to us twice - once to take our order and once to bring us our drinks and we never saw her again. Other than that it was an overall good experience!
