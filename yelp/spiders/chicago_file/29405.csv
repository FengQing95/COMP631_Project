Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have had this pizza when I lived in Chi town and it was mediocre at best.  Just had an order of it shipped to my home in the Pacific Northwest as a gift from my brother and am reminded of just how mediocre it really is.  I had no idea when I lived in Chicago why this was considered good pizza.  Must not be any real competition is all I can assume.  To be honest I did also have the beef and pepper sandwich.  It was pretty damned good.
