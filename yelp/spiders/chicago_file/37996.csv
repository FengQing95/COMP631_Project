Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We arrived at 9pm and used valet. We were seated right away, but were not able to order our food until about 9:30pm. No stars taken off for this though. I was having a good time w/ my husband that I hardly even noticed how long we had waited. Wanted to point it out anyway though, since this would definitely bother others. Once we ordered our food, however, I was blown away. The quality of the steaks, as well as the mashed potatoes, bone marrow, and even the chocolate cream pie for dessert was MIND BLOWING!
