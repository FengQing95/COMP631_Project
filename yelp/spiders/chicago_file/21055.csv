Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The very long wait was well worth it. I've never had pizza like this before, and i'm not sure I will again, until I visit Chicago next. I appreciated them having NBA on the TV too, although it was a date night, my wife knew an important game was on and didn't mind my odd glance at the TV here or there.
