The Purple Pig////We arrived at the Purple Pig at slightly before 2 on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was full (which, to me, is always a great sign early afternoon). We put our name on the waiting list and sat down outside. We had barely sat when a very helpful server (Alexander) offered us cocktails. Of course we obliged. Both of our choices were expertly crafted. We were off to a good start.
