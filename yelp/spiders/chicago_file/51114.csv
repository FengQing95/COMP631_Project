Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love this place so much! There are so many great tapas options to choose from. Perfect for sharing because the portions are small so you get to try a bunch of different things. The food was delicious and so was the sangria. Staff was friendly and attentive. I will definitely be returning soon!
