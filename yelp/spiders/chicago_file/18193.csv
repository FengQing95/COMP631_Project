Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So we were told that this was a great place for pizza. I don't get it because it was not very good at all. Our crust was under cooked and the pizza came out of the crust kind of like it was not even cooked. We talked to the waiter and we were told that is how they come. Try it yourself, but its not for me.
