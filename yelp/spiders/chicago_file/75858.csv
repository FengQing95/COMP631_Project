Little Goat Diner////Upon being served, the dish looked and smell divine. It truly was a feast for my nose and my eyes. The first few bites were amazing -- powerful punches of sweet, salty, and richness. After a few bites, I felt beyond overwhelmed from the dish, questioning myself if I could even finish the dish. I tried to wash down this feeling with the caramel cider but that too became too much for me to handle. Downing a glass of water, all my senses were on overload. I had to stop and just push the dish away. I forced a few more bites just because I waited too long to just walk away with most left on my plate.
