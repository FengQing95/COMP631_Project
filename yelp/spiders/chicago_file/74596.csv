Little Goat Diner////Very pretty dining room and very hospitable staff. But the food was very disappointing. Going in with no expectations, the food was nothing to smile about. I had a bite of the Reuben, scallion pancake pork belly, goat chili, crumpets, crab dip and more. Everything was very salty.
