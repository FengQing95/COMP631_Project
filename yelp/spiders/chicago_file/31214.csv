Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When in Chicago, you try the deep dish pizza. We came around 7pm and only had about a 15min wait outside. I heard Chicago likes there's pies extra saucy tomatoey ( I don't) so I pleaded with the waiter to do "light" sauce and even through they didn't want to make any changes he complied and I'm so glad cause it still had too much for my taste BUT it was very tasty and filling! Wow! It's unlike any pizza I have had before. Very fresh and pieish but worth it to try! I can see why they have so many locations now. Glad we skipped appetizers, we splurged and got a medium Malnati's Chicago Classic for two people and had a ton still leftover. (Could have went with a small like the menu suggested - but we were hungry ) Lesson learned and glad we tried some authentic Chicago Deep Dish
