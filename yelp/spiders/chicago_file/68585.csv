Little Goat Diner////Food off the menu is A La Carte and can become pricey in no time. I ordered the reuben sandwich and smoke fries. This selection was $18.00 without a drink. Although I'm fine at this price, I was surprised by the very 'lame' plated food presentation... the small sandwich cut in half on an oval plate without any type of professionalism or tiny garnish (like a parsley spring). It seemed unfinished. The flavor of the sandwich was awesome and complex. However, for me the overall experience (beyond just the food) helps me to better access & evaluate. Oh! Almost forgot to mention the odd timing for serving the food. While I ordered the sandwich and fries as my entree, the fries arrived at the table in a bowl 10 minutes before the sandwich. In my opinion this is a complete failure in any dining experience. I was 80 percent finished with the fries before the sandwich arrived.
