Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was able to try the veggie deep dish and the meat one, and I thought both were pretty good! Most of my party preferred the meat deep dish, but I silently preferred the veggie one. It was on the soggier side, which actually made it easier for me to eat than the drier sausage one. The thin layer of sausage in the deep dish pizza versus it being randomly stuffed throughout was also a great touch.
