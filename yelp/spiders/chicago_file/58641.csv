Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn't remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!
