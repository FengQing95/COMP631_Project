Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Again, not the hugest fan of deep dish but I thought Lou's ranked way higher than Giordano's. First of all, the bottom crust wasn't all soggy and wet. We shared a medium salad and split a Lou's deluxe small and that seemed plenty for 2 (unless you want to feel completely "gotta unzip/unbutton" stuffed, then do go ahead and order more). I expected chunks of sausage in the deluxe but be forewarned, the bottoms is covered with like a patty of sausage! Kinda grossed me out at the end but I think it'd be heaven for sausage lovers.
