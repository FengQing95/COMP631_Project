Little Goat Diner////Made reservations for 2 on a Monday evening and was seated promptly. We got the Hot Crab Dip, Chicken Pot Pie, Scallops, and Lemon Buttermilk Cake. Everything was phenomenal. The first dunk of the ritz bitz crackers into the smothering hot crab dip was everything we wanted and more. Our server came by with another cup of crackers and brought more upon request. It was so creamy, cheesy and had so much CRAB! The Chicken Pot Pie and Scallops were both perfectly cooked and had great presentation. The Lemon Buttermilk Cake on their special menu...was to die for. It was the perfect blend of lemon, butter, and whipped cream. The house whipped cream was fluffy and light. Every crumb of the cake was gone when we finished.
