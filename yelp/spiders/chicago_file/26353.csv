Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////THE BEST PIZZA EVER!!!  We had an awesome deep dish one night, and went back the next night for an equally awesome thin crust.  The deep dish pizzas take nearly an hour to make, so they have you order your as you check in.  Smart!! We didn't have their dessert pizza, which I understand is some sort of chocolate chip cookie and I'm told not to be missed. Oh well, next time!
