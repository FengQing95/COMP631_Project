Little Goat Diner////ANYHOW, My review stands between a 4 and a 5 star rating. I got the corn beef hash while in town for the day with my family. My family also ordered the cinnamon bun at the end to share which was delish. The group was kind of large and I can't remember what everyone got but we all enjoyed it. We sat outside with our 10 month old and our dog. The waiter was extremely efficient and nice. They brought water for my dog and we had 0 issues with them. I would come back if I lived in town.
