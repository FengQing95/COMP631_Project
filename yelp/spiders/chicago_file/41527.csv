Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My girlfriend and I went on a date here, and it was absolutely best tapas I ever had and great food in general.  The sangria was delicious as well.  The environment was very cozy and warm, although it can be a bit loud.  We were seated in a corner, which made the atmosphere very enjoyable and still somewhat private.  We will definitely be going back.
