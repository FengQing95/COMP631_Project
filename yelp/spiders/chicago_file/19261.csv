Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Oh my gosh! If you are looking for a good place to get deep dish pizza this is the place! On the day I came here the soup of the day was the chicken vegetable and it was without a doubt the best soup that I have ever had. The service is amazing and our waiter was really great Â He was on top of everything was super nice to us. As for the pizza itself, it had a thinner crust than most deep dish pizzas I've had but this was by far my favorite. If you are planning on eating in be prepared for a wait but that is the only thing that you really need to know.
