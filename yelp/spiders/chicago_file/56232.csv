Smoque BBQ////WOW!  As far as BBQ goes, Smoque has it covered.  What a fantastic lunch to have.  I stopped in over the weekend to check it out as I had been wanting to ever since I saw it on "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives".  I came in with my GF and I decided to try the pulled pork, with a side of beans, then we also ordered a small order of fries and a large mac n cheese.
