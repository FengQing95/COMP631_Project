Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've never had Chicago deep dish before, and during my trip to Chicago to visit my sister, she and I went to Lou Malnati's for a late lunch one Saturday afternoon.  It was fairly empty and we were seated immediately.  We were not too hungry so we didn't want to order anything huge.  Our server was very friendly and kept calling me "brother" for some reason.  We thought that was kind of funny.
