Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had higher expectation for this place since it has high rating and lots of our friends had recommended this place. The wait is long but while you wait, you can order your food and they said that they'll time it so by the time you sit down, your pizza should get to you. However this was not the case. I waited an hour to be seated and another 30 mins to get the food.
