The Purple Pig////Finally got to try this place out. Went on a Saturday afternoon expecting a long wait but was seated within 10 minutes. Our waiter came right away to greet us and offer something to drink. He was very knowledgeable when it came to wine and made sure it was a good pairing with the entres that we wanted to get.
