Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The patatas bravas was ok. The patatas con alioli was a little under boiled for the potatoes... The hanging beef and chicken were way too overcooked... The chicken and chorizo paella was actually very good. Well flavored. The citrus seared salmon was very good. You can hardly go wrong with salmon though.. If you do you should really reconsider being in the restaurant business..
