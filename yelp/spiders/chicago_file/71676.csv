Little Goat Diner////The food was really unique and we enjoyed looking at he menu items.  We were told a thirty five minute wait and that was pretty much on target.   The food did come out quickly but they were a bit behind on the fries.    We all enjoyed our meals and only one of finished the meal (but it took her m awhile).  Was really closer to a 4.5 but we can't rate 1/2 stars.
