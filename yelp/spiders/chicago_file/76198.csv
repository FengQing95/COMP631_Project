Little Goat Diner////So he continued his night with a cup of water, and a sad Caesar salad. He ate it slowly while taking long trips to the bathroom, maybe to escape the awkwardness. I think the saddest part was the dad though. The effort was endless but he wasn't getting anywhere. He offered up anything and everything for that kid. "We can hop on the train and see where it takes us! Or go see a movie and stay up late." He said, filled with energy and excitement. But he just wanted to go home after desert. For desert, he ordered a strawberry float, which he received a harsh "Nope, we're out of our sodas." From the waiter. The little joy that had filled the kids face from the idea of desert, had all drained away. He ordered something, ate it, then slouched out behind his dad. So overall, the Okonomiyaki that my mom ordered was amazing, she couldn't get enough of it and my blueberry pancakes were delicious, also the service was great, but I did leave feeling sad and pitiful. 3 Stars.
