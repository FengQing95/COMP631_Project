Little Goat Diner////My husband had the bahn mi burger with a goat patty.  He loved it.  I couldn't get any more descriptive words from him then that.  I can tell you, though, that it was served with pickled veggie slaw, orange mayo, mint, cilantro and served on a bolillo - a better than average bun.
