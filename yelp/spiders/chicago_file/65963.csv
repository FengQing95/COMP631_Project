Smoque BBQ////It's always good when you find a place that does such a good job with the brisket that you can eat it without BBQ sauce! The brisket was good but honestly, my favorite thing was the baked beans! Really great Smokey flavor with good size pieces of meat in the beans. I was glad they had an outdoor dining area. It's nice to be able to sit outside, even if it's not really a beautiful area to look at.
