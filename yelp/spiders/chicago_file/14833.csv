Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////In terms of deep dish, Im not sure it was my favorite, but it was certainly very good. I loved the freshness of their tomato sauce, but I thought the butter crust (tm) could use just a dash of salt to balance the buttery richness out. The sausage on the pizza is a favorite of many, but I didn't love the way its done here. Instead of being bits of sausage throughout, this is more one huge disc of sausage that covers the whole pizza. That is my fault in ordering it though, and will try a different variation next time I am back. The spinach mix was lovely though and added a lot of flavor to our pizza. Oh, and if you order a family sized salad, its huge. We were laughing because it took the entire table up, but the sweet dressing they make is really good!
