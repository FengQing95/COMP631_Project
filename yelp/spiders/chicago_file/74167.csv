Little Goat Diner////We walked in around 5ish and noticed a few open tables and booths.  We opted for a booth, and our server was there almost immediately with menus.  After going over their offerings, I settled on the Sloppy Goat with a side of Not Chinese Broccoli, while my buddy got the Fish Tostadas with a side of Goat Chili Cheese Fries.
