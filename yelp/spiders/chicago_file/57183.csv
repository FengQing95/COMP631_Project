Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////They are great with groups and it's a fun, lively place with a great vibe.  There are mirrored walls, wooden decor and mason jar candles on the tables.  Our server was 110% kind and although we had to crank our heads a few times when it got busy to try to catch her attention, I can see how people really love this place.  It's hard not to!
