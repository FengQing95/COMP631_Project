Little Goat Diner////This is my 4th experience at a Top Chef-owned restaurant. Each has been similar -- dishes sound, look, and smell exceptional but the actual taste is overpowering. It's difficult to eat beyond a few bites -- perhaps an old habit from their Top Chef experiences where judges only taste a bite or two, not the entire dish.
