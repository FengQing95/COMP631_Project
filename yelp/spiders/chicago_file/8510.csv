Art Institute of Chicago////That being said, paying admission to the Art Institute is so worth the money (plus, if you plan ahead, you can usually get some sort of deal...when I was there last, it was two for one for all Bank of America customers).  I could spend days in this place...there is so much to see!  Last time I was there, I was lucky enough to see the Chagall America Windows which are truly beautiful and a must-see for all art lovers.
