Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Came here on a Wednesday morning and was sited right away.  I Ordered the los altos Benedict and was surprised when the waiter came back with my food literally in less than 5 minutes!  It was a bit on the spicy side but I love spicy food so I really liked it.  I got t with a side of hash brown and it was perfectly made...with a little crisp on the outside.  Overall, the food and service was great.
