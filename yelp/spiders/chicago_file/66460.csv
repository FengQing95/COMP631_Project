Little Goat Diner////Had such a great time at this diner! Was expecting a wait, but I was immediately seated as soon as I walked in the door. LOVED their specialty coffees made with goat milk. The fat Elvis waffles got two thumbs up in my book! This place is already on my list of places to visit next time I am in the Windy City!
