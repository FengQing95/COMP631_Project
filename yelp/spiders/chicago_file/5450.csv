The Purple Pig////Five stars for the food, 4 stars for the service and 2 stars for ambiance. We came on a Sunday evening around 5:30 and it took 45 minutes to get a table for 3. We're seated in the patio and at a big communal table. We're seated close to other guests and barely have any elbow room. The noise level is very high in the restaurant. It's very loud and it's not a place to have a nice quiet dinner and chat.
