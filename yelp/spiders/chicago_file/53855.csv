Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Pretty much every time I go to CBBR, I start with the same two dishes. Dates wrapped in bacon and tomato sauce with goat cheese. Yes, I admit, both dishes are incredibly simple, but both are delicious and staples of tapas food. The dates and bacon are heavenly. The goat cheese and tomato sauce is fine, not the best, but i think it's just one of those you have to try.
