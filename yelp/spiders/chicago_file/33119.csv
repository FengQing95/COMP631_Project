Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This was one of the best food experiences I've had in a while.  Everything about this place is 5 stars - food, service and ambiance.  The upstairs is reminiscent of an early 20th century French bistro, complete with rich, dark wood and mood lighting.   Downstairs is like a parlor or old mansion library, without the books.  Deep booths and romantic 2-tops.
