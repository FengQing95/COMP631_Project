Smoque BBQ////We pulled in here on our way out of Chicago.  Arrived at 11:30 a.m. and went right to the counter to order.  Got very busy soon after.  Very friendly staff.  Quite the assembly line pumping out the orders.  Nice ambience.  Lots of outdoor seating.  Got the sliced brisket platter with two sides, mac n cheese and fries.  They throw in coleslaw as well.  Added a quarter slab of St. Louis ribs for an extra $5.  The brisket was incredible.  Great smoke, great bark, super tender.  The ribs were very good but a little chewy, not as tender.  The mac n cheese was excellent, cheesy with a nice crust.  The fries were delicious and a generous portion.  The coleslaw was different, like just cabbage dressed lightly with vinegar.  Refreshing but not my favorite.
