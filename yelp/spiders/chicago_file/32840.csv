Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Was there with a friend to sit at the bar and have dinner on a Friday night.  Ambiance was great, food & wine were amazing, but I have to say that the hostess was incredibly condescending and unfriendly when we entered and exited.  Not sure what impression the restaurant wants to make to customers but kind of ruined our experience.
