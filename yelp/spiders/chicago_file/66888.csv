Little Goat Diner////I ordered the veggie burger patty melt. The burger was great and had chunks of mushrooms in it, a real veggie burger! I had hoped a patty melt came with Swiss cheese but that was my only complaint. It was a build your own burger idea and I really liked that, although I think most of the options were better suited towards goat and beef burgers. The fries were spectacular! My boyfriend had the corned beef hash, and although it was a simple dish he said it was delicious. I'd definitely go back the next time in town.
