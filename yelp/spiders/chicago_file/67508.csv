Little Goat Diner////I absolutely love the West Loop and all it has to offer. Little Goat especially has a casual feel and more affordable meals, but is worth every penny. While I am sure all of the menu items are delicious, I simply cannot go there without ordering the fish tostadas. They have amazing flavor and are filling. My husband, who prefers meat on the average day, usually regrets not ordering the fish tostadas and has now jumped on my bandwagon. In general I think that Little Goat is a great place to take visitors in Chicago because it is in a cool area but is more affordable and has great options.
