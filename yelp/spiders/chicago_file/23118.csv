Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you eat nowhere else during your stay in Chicago, eat at Lou Malnati's!  The reputation of this place speaks for itself.  This restaurant certainly lived up to its reputation.  Several friends had told me to visit this restaurant while in Chicago and I am so, so, so happy that I did.  Hands down the BEST Chicago-style pizza that I've ever had, and one of the top 5 best pizzas I've eaten ever.  WOW.
