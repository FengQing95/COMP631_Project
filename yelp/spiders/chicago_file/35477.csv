Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For accompaniments, we had the mashed potatoes and the elote-style corn.  Both dishes were good, but also both very rich.  On the one hand, they stood up to all the other richness on the table, but maybe just put things too far over the top.  Maybe I just need to put a little more thought into balance when ordering dinner next time!
