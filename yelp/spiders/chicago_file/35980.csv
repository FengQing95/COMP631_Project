Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////A Chicago favorite! Unbelievable drinks, food, and dessert. The speakeasy ambiance is unique and fun. It feels like a secret club! You don't have to love whiskey to love this place. My fianc√© is a big old fashioned fan and these are his favorite. But there are plenty of amazing non-whiskey drinks too.
