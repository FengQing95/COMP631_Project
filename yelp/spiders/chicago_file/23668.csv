Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We eat here every time we are in the Windy City! It's our favorite spot for buttery deep dish and their "crustless" pizza which is made of sausage instead of gluten! Yum...My hubby gets the deep dish with sausage and pepperoni, butter crust. I get the personal pan crustless pizza with spinach and mushrooms. So goood!!!
