Little Goat Diner////I love this place.  I would never come here on a weekend because it's totally cray-cray, but I'll come during the week for lunch.  The first time I went I got the Reuben and tempura mashed potatoes and my hubby got the fat elvis. They are all yummy!  The second time I got the bulls eye french toast (AWESOME!), my daugher got the kids mac and cheese (good), and my husband got the Tonkatsu and smoked Fries (both were just ok).
