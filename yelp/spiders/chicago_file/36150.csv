Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We came back the following night for dinner, and really had an amazing experience. The bartender, Dean, was making perfect drinks. My wife had the beef stroganoff and I had the filet. We also shared some baked goat cheese and some brussel sprouts. Everything was wonderful! This is going to be a go-to place for me every time we visit Chicago. They've definitely earned their 5 stars for me!
