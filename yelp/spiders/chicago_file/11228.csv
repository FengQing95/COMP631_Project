Art Institute of Chicago////It's such the privilege to live in the great Chicago area because we are so close to Art Institute! Although I'm coming from BFA background and now studying art education graduate degree, I'd like to recommend this place 1000 times to anybody, because this is a museum that always gives you surprises and inspiration, yet it's a cozy place to spend your day with.
