Smoque BBQ////What happened here ??? 5 pm Friday evening and the place was empty. Sliced brisket was so dry it crumbled when stabbed with a fork. All the food was barely warm. Pulled pork sandwich was on the skimpy side. I am afraid they are using inferior cuts of meat or pre cooked? The brisket seemed processed and not a fresh cut of meat. Don't change a great thing !!!! Never minded paying their high prices but I was not thrilled tonight. The couple next to us threw away most of their food saying it was not good at all and absolutely cold. An hour later at 6 pm, the Â place was still empty. There is usually a line out the door by now. Bring back the quality.
