Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Best steak I've had in Chicago. Often when I order steak cooked blue I get it more rare or sometimes even mid rare and I have to send it back. Not here! They nailed my 10 oz filet. Got the maitre' d butter which was awesome and roasted garlic. I smelled like garlic for 3 days but WORTH IT. Would pass on the wild mushroom "add on" next time I go back as they were extremely salty and a bit rubbery. The Brussels sprouts were fantastic as well.
