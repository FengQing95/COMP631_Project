Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Oh wait, the pizza! It arrived... Meatlovers, Vegetarian and a classic Pepperoni. I gotta tell you guys, here in Canada we are ripped off. Any meat pizza I had in Chicago with sausage in it tasted like they just made it the same day and they definitely don't skimp out on it. Everything down to the sauce and the dough had me wishing I had longer to stay just so I could eat here again.
