Smoque BBQ////I also sampled the pulled pork (very subpar), the St. Louis style ribs (not bad, but not great) which had a really strong smoky flavor, but it just didn't jive with my taste buds I s'pose. The baby back ribs were a big let down. Kinda tough, not all that tender, and they needed quite a bit of sauce.
