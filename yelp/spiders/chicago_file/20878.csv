Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I went to visit Chicago for the first time last weekend for my BFF's bachelorette and I was bombarded by recommmendations to this place. Now I know why. It was my first time eating a deep dish pizza. We ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic and The "Lou" i liked the "Lou" but i loved the Classic! so much flavor and pizza to the bite. Two slices and I was so full. we also had the calamari for an appetizer. It was very well cooked. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here. the service was good and the food was great.
