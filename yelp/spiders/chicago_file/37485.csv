Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Dry Aged Bone In Ribeye: 6/10, ordered medium + for no blood and light pink and ended up receiving it a lot more red than I had wanted, asked for it to be a little more done and of course it came back too done and chewy. This was my biggest disappointment seeing as this was the main course but I was so full from the apps that I wasn't in complete distraught over it. Brought it home and ate two days later, it was fine I suppose.
