Little Goat Diner////This plate is the same concept as chicken and waffles--sweet and savory. The syrup is a must try because it was so different than regular syrup. I was trying to figure out what it was because it tasted so familiar! So it's pretty much bbq sauce and maple syrup! I was done with this plate after a few bites as well since the sweetness was good enough for me
