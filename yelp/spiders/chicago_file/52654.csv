Smoque BBQ////I love this place!  I take the L from O'hare just to go here when I am on travel.  The only thing missing is microbrews on tap.  You can go down the street to the 7 eleven, and score some beers that they let you BYOB,  and then put on ice for you!  It would get a five star if they poured some hops from a tap!
