Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Let me start by saying my party wasn't the easiest to deal with..some of my friends couldn't decide if they were coming or not so the size of our party kept bouncing between 6 and 7. Fair enough, they can be frustrated, I've hosted and worked in the industry long enough to get that. But the host was out right rude. Wouldn't give us a quote time even though we witnessed her give quote times to every other group. Tip: it's a quote time, it doesn't have to be 100% accurate. Just kept telling us we'll have to wait with an extremely smug tone.
