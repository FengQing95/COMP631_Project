Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Berry bliss pancakes... Thank me later. Your taste buds will climax, you might need a shower after. Seasonal omelette with chicken sausage and gruyere was also sinfully good. I also got a strawberry banana smoothie which had way too much syrup/sweetener, I prefer straight up fresh fruit and fruit juice. I'll skip the smoothie next time. -1 for the smoothie but 6/5 for the pancakes. Now I need a smoke.
