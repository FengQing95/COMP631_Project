Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was my second time at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba and it did not disappoint! I highly recommend their happy hour. It is from 4-6pm daily and it includes a wide selection of their tapas at great prices. It also has the sangria pitchers on it which is arguably the best part. I brought my boyfriend who lived in Spain for a few months and although he was skeptical at first, he was very impressed with how authentic the food and sangria tasted. If you come in for happy hour you do have to sit by the bar which is a bit darker and not as cute. The dining room is a lot brighter and the decor is very nice. Overall, recommend trying this place!
