Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The atmosphere is charming and interesting.  Kind of a cross between a hacienda and carnival tent.  It looks like exactly what you think it should with a name like Cafe-Ba-Ba-Reeba.  Meals can get a bit expensive there with a large group and a varied taste palette, but the experience in my book is well worth it.
