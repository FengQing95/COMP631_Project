The Purple Pig////The taste is just OK I think, and all the dishes we ordered are very oily. We ordered 3 small dishes first, thinking about ordering more after we finished these. The smoked pig tongue is very salty, I had to drink a lot of water afterwards. Then, there came the famous pig's ear. It is deep fried and you cannot tell that is pig ear. It is oily and tastes just like fried noodle strips. Then the broccoli, it is flavorful at first bite, but again super oily and the sauce is very strong and salty that you won't want to eat it anymore.
