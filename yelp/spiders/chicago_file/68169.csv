Little Goat Diner////My buddy told me there was a coffee bar next door that had fresh baked bread for sale and asked if I was interested in taking a look.  I declined because the snow was coming down and I needed a nap.  I was wedged into my booth and after releasing myself from it's grip I waddled to my car with one hand on the wheel and one hand on mah belly.  I was stuffed!!  And quite pleased.
