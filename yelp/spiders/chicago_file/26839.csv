Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered take-out so I can't speak to the restaurant itself, but we showed up 30 mins after we had scheduled our pizza to be done due to some parking snafus and they had kept the pizza in the warmer for us so it was still warm, full of melty cheese, and delicious. And the staff was lovely for the short pickup interaction. Get the butter crust for sure or else have regret that you didn't get the best of the best. I love deep dish and this beats out the other two big name deep dish places in Chicago for sure. But try them all and judge for yourself!
