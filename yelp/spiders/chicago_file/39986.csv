Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It's been almost a year since we visited but can't wait to be able to do so again. The atmosphere, service, and food were all fantastic. When we showed up with our 2 year old we weren't sure if we would get pushed to the side or not but were pleasantly surprised. We dined down stairs and had a wonderful steak, lamb chops, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes. For dessert we got some lemon meringue pie and it came out with a sparkler on it, my wife and I were confused how they knew we were celebrating our anniversary and the waitress said "I thought it would be fun for her" (our daughter). It is the little things that make a good place a great place. We have told many people they should check this place out and will continue to do so.
