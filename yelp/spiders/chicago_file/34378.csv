Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was fantastic; some of the best we've tasted at any restaurant.  We got the meatloaf and fried chicken.  The fried chicken is the best I've ever had and the meat loaf although didn't knock my socks off was still great. All the sides are a must; very amazing.  We love the restaurant setting; very speakeasy bar like.  It was packed for dinner.  The prices were fair and not outrageous for the quality of the food.  Will go back again when in Chicago.
