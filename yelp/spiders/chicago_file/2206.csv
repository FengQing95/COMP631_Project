The Purple Pig////The best way to describe Purple Pig is a smaller and somewhat cheaper version of Girl & the Goat. You have to be a bit adventurous if you plan on dining here otherwise this restaurant is really not for you. The menu here is a bit exotic and as the waitress put it the name of the game is to try as many little plates as possible until you are filled up.
