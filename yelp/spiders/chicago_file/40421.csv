Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Part 1a - The aforementioned Butcher's Cut Bone Marrow. I'm not sure  how this metaphor or analogy or or whatever we want to call it will flow, but here goes.  If there is a correlation to be drawn with how bad something probably is *for* you with how good it actually is, this is it.  Health-wise, the very nature of Bone Marrow is akin to smoking cigarrette's. It just can't be good for you but we do it so rarely, caution shall be thrown to the wind!
