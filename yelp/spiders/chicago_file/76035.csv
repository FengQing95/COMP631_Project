Little Goat Diner////Slam the lager like Bad Santa. Order another round. Slow your stride after the first beer but still keep up a slightly uncomfortable pace. This should continue for some time until it's clear you've overstayed your watering hole welcome. Is someone in your party sleeping face down on the table? Deep-chest hiccups? Are other patrons taking notice of your slurring babble? Good, it's time.
