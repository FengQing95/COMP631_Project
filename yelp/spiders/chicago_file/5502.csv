The Purple Pig////While yes, I am sure many of the people who dine here are from out of town, that doesn't make their food any less amazing! I was blown away by their extensive menu and the dishes we got. We arrived about 10 minutes before opening on a Wednesday, and there were already people gathering. The space is beautifully lit and I loved their rustic French decor. We ordered the smoked pork tongue (my favorite), crispy pig's ear, lamb's rib, and the caviar & ice cream. Nothing disappointed.
