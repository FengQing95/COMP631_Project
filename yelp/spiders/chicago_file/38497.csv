Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came here on a visit to Chicago. Decor and ambiance are excellent and in-line with what you would expect from a timeless steakhouse. The waitstaff were all excellent and engaging. Started off the meal with the bone marrow appetizer and would highly recommend. All aspects of the meal were amazing.
