Little Goat Diner////Hash browns are shredded potatoes with a LITTLE oil to grill it with not dripping with oil. was it the goat cheese mixed in? I don't know I didn't see any goat cheese in it, unless that little speck I saw wasn't just too much salt after all. Besides why would goat cheese ever taste good mixed into hash browns? I'm glad they screwed up that part or I'd be calibrating my pacemaker right now it was oily enough without the cheese.
