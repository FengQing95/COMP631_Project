Little Goat Diner////A very casual diner that has an American "eat breakfast all day" feel to it. And that's basically what the menu is. It serves breakfast all day BUT with a very interesting twist to all the dishes. One that caught my eye that I want to try is breakfast spaghetti with crab and shrimp (and served with an omelette I believe). Sounded great if I had a heavier appetite!!
