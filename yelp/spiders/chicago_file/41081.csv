Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago, though it can be PACKED at times.  I love the bacon wrapped dates and the spicy patatas bravas, you can never miss with those two.  Their sangria is good and worth ordering, but probably not the best you'll find in the city.  The service has always been impeccable and the food is so well timed, you're never wondering where it is, or overwhelmed with too many plates at the table.  Go with someone who knows what to order and you'll be very pleased with your meal.
