Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There's a lot of hype around this place so had pretty high expectations but the food was average and the service was below par. The food ranged from good to inedible. The goat cheese baked in tomato juice was the best and dessert was good too. The lamb skewers were gross and seriously inedible and they were marked as a popular dish on the menu. Not sure if it was an off day or what. The server forgot to enter 3/6 of our tapas dishes in originally. Won't be back.
