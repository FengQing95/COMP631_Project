Little Goat Diner////As for the sandwiches, some menu items have a "wow" factor for their originality, but a lot of them are actually quite in line with what you'd expect at a diner, like a turkey club or a burger, but elevated to another level due to carefully sourced, quality ingredients being expertly handled.  Didn't try any breakfast items but LOVE that they are served all day.  Again, they really have a handle on what diners want.
