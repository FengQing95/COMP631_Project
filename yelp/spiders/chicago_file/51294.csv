Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////While we're on the subject of burnt food, let's talk about my croquetas, which upon arriving at the table I thought looked a little dark.  But before tasting them I gave them the benefit of the doubt and assumed that it was overcooked which it was.  How obviously burnt food makes it past the line cook, expediter, and runner to the table, shows a pretty blatant lack of care and concern when it comes to the quality of the food.  It's not like I couldn't have waited on a refire, there was plenty of food at the table already and the only reason I didn't send it back is because I was already food.
