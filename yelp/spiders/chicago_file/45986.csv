Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a great and dependable place for tapas. I find the prices to be fair, the service accomodating and it's a great place for groups. There's something to be said for a place that instantly conjures up images of dates wrapped in bacon...last night I tried the scallops with cous cous for the first time and a pork tapas that had just the right amount of spice. While I have been to Spain and eaten patatas bravas Â more times than I can remember, it's the sauce here that I always return to.
