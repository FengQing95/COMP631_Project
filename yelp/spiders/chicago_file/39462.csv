Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The service was good. The décor was like a speakeasy or an old French restaurant - a very large bar, some red leather booths, and some plain wooden tables  with wooden chairs. They played recorded jazz, which we both like.  Unfortunately, like so many hip downtown restaurants, it was unbearable loud. Ironically, after I payed the bill, our waitress asked how everything went.  I said very good except for how loud the music was. She leaned over and said "What?". I cracked up.
