The Purple Pig////*Used to be good place* to chill and enjoy the food in Chicago. My last visit turned out to be the last time I will go to this place. 1/2 of the pork shoulder that I ordered is almost rare. I told the server and she instantly responded that it is perfectly cooked. I then asked her if you would have it at the stage. She said no way. Eating raw pork is very dangerous.
