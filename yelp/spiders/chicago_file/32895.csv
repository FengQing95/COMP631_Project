Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great food. Worst service... Almost ever. Long gaps without server checking in, taking orders, etc. Waited twenty minutes for a dessert menu then another 15 for the server to come back to the table. At that point we were beyond ready to go. We were disappointed since we were celebrating our anniversary and the two tables next to us received celebratory desserts with a fun sparkler. Server was terrible in general... Unattentive, brash and just came off as rude. We thought it just might have been us but then another table nearby had to physically grab the server to get his attention after waiting to get their check. Otherwise, the steaks, drinks and sides were awesome but bad service really ruins a good meal.
