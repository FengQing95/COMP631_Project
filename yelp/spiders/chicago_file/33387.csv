Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I felt like I was in a scene from the Great Gatsby when I walked it. Velvet couches, chandeliers, dim lights, and really well dressed bartenders. To start they give you this really amazing, warm, homemade bread. WAY BETTER THAN OLIVE GARDENS!!!!! I ordered the $72 steak. Does that make me cool?????????? No, to justify this, I ate Wonder bread with mayo for lunch AND it was my birthday!!! Lets just say it was the most tender, rich, steak I have ever had. I forgot if I had dessert, but i bet it would be better than Olive Gardens.
