Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is my first chicago deep dish so really have nothing to compare it to. Ordered pick up. There was about a one hour time difference between when I ordered and the soonest I could pick it up. When I showed up it was pretty seamless. Told them I was there to pick up and they had my pizza within 5 minutes. They first just gave me the pizza in a box, but when I asked for a paper plate they gave me Parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper, which if you want to put on your pizza definitely ask for (I put it on and it was great).
