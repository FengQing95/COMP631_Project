Art Institute of Chicago////I really enjoyed so many of the paintings, including those from lesser known artists.  But seeing American Gothic, Nighthawks, and A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of la Grande Jatte was unreal.  They are just as amazing as you expect them to be.  Truly staggering.  Also notable...the many Monets, Van Goghs, Picassos, and Rodins.
