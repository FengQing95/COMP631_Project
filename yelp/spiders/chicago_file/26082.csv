Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////According to all our research on Yelp, Lou's seemed like a clear choice when trying our first Chicago deep dish! Lou's was roll your eyes backwards good. I enjoy Patxi's back home in the Bay Area, but Lou's takes the crown here. There crust is so good! Buttery, crispy, and you can taste the freshness of all the ingredients that run through the pizza. We got the Malnati's Chicago Classic Pizza and added extra pepperoni on top. The aroma from the pizza when it hit our table instantly told us this was going to be one of the best deep dishes we've had. It definitely did not disappoint. The crust of the pizza was so buttery, paired with a huge chunk of sausage in every bite. Be careful with what size you order here because deep dishes are no joke, we went with a medium and still had two slices leftover. Â Aside from the pizza, we got an order of the Calamari Frites which is always a solid appetizer, no complaints.
