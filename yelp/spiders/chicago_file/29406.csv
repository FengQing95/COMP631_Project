Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now when I think Chicago I think deep dish pizza. I have tried a number of deep dish pizza places, and this is THE place that I think it well worth the wait. After hearing from a number of Yelpers and locals, I was really excited to try this place. Coming in on a Friday night at 7pm, there was a good 45 minute wait for a party of 4.
