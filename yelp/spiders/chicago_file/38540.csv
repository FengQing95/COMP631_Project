Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Walked in and sat in at the bar downstairs. Started with the Tokyo old fashion. As always the meal was amazing; had the dry aged, bone in New York strip with brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. Finished with an espresso martini. All of that being said, the best part of the meal was, our bartender, Michael D., had us do a bone marrow luge with the 10 yr Taylor Fladgate port. Upscale place with a fun atmosphere thanks to Michael D. and his creativity. If you ever come and sit at the downstairs bar while Michael D is working, order the bone marrow just to do the luge...it's a once in a lifetime experience.
