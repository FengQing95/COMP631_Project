Smoque BBQ////Really good brisket and pulled pork! The mac 'n cheese is SO good - so are the fries! The BBQ sauce they use is really tasty. My boyfriend likes their cornbread - I think it's just okay. Personally, I'm not a fan of their ribs and the line can get kind of long. Sandwiches come with cole slaw and one side, platters come with cole slaw and two sides. If you're like me and you're not a fan of cole slaw, ask and they'll let you swap it out for a different side! Love, love love the food and this place!
