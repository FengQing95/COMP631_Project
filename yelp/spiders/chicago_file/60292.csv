Smoque BBQ////Word of mouth, yelp reviews, passing by, aromas, etc. I HAD TO TRY THIS PLACE. We arrived and parking was plentiful and luckily got a spot in their parking lot. Arrive early because when they run out of ribs, you will be pissed. They line was almost out the door and we squeezed in and to my surprise, the manning behind the counter was moving like a well oiled machine. Employees had a line assembly thing going and the line was moving. We ordered the Pulled pork, and both the St. Louis and baby back ribs. On the side we chose, mac and cheese and coleslaw. It was communal style seating and hosts help accommodate us.
