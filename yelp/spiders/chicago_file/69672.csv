Little Goat Diner////We were given a booth that was very tight.  A very low, thin partition separated our booth from the one next to us, which had the effect of being at a communal table.  The place was packed with customers mostly in their 20s and 30s, many of whom were accompanied by very small children.  Chairs and highchairs were squeezed in at the ends of many of the booths and tables that limited the aisles spaces considerably and created obstacle courses for the patrons and the service staff.  The noise level was extremely high and the atmosphere was frenetic.
