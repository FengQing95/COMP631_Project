Smoque BBQ////When I first walked up I was surprised to see a line of about seven people ahead of me.  Once inside I saw that there were seating for about 40, and the place was packed.  Didn't wait too long.  I got a deliciously tender pork sandwich.  And don't forget the dipping sauce...unbelievable.  I have never and probably will never taste such sweetness.  Thick, seasoned fries take you over the top - forcing you to loosen the belt a bit.
