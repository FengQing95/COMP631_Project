Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our stuffed mushroom tapas was STONE COLD when we got it and we sent it back. She provided no apology and didn't know what to do with our mushrooms that we had already cut into. She stared at the plate of mushrooms like they were alive and said, "Ohmigod, that's so weird!" It's not weird, Honey; we ordered it 1/2 hour ago and it's been sitting up at the pass waiting for someone to bring it to us. Hot food eventually gets cold.
