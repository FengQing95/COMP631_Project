Art Institute of Chicago////Absolutely amazing. I wish I had more time to see everything, so make sure you come early. I had such a great time. I don't know if the audio commentary are worth it ($7). Very few exhibits have the added feature, and the few that did, half of it was interesting and half of it was not too different from what is written on the side of the artwork. I don't think I would get it next time.
