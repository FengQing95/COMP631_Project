Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We ordered the huge 42 day dry aged bone in ribeye (medium rare) to share as well as the truffle mac&cheese and mashed potatoes. The sides were the stars of the night. DELICIOUS; highly recommend. The steak was good but not great. It came out luke warm and therefore got cold very quickly. It was also very fatty.
