Smoque BBQ////* Yes, it is a little bit of zoo and they might run out of what you want to eat.  Either call ahead or be ready to play it by ear.  I wouldn't want to eat in on a crowded night.  It's too bad they don't deliver, although it would likely take forever.  Not terribly difficult to get to but there's not much else to do in that neighborhood except get back on the El or in a cab if you can find one.
