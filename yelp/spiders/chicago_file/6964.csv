Art Institute of Chicago////Oh woe is me.  I was so excited to see the Modern and Impressionist wings and they were still under construction!  A little bit of the impressionist stuff is out, but most of it is hidden behind closed doors and that was beyond disappointing for me.  I only had to pay student admission ($7) so that made it better.  Don't skip the miniature rooms down on the lower level - they are highly entertaining.  I also really enjoyed the photography exhibit, especially the Boogeyman and Sinking Ship.
