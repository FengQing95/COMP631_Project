The Purple Pig////The food was O-U-T-S-T-A-N-D-I-N-G and lived up to the hype. The presentation of the food was well executed and I admired the food runner explaining the appropriate ways to eat our multiple dishes. Everything came out beautifully timed and we never felt rushed through our dining experience. We had the Crispy Pig Ears, Grilled Broccoli, Roasted Bone Marrow, Greek Sausage, and Pork Shoulder.
