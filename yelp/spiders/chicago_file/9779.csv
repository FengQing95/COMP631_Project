Art Institute of Chicago////This museum is huge!! They got everything on lock and every room had several surprises. My favorite would have to be the miniature room because that caught me off guard. Also, the 2nd floor cafe and contemporary section was fun. I highly recommend everyone to go here because it's definitely worth it.
