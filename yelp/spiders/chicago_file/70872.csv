Little Goat Diner////Staff was friendly, service wasn't bad (we didn't get anything quickly, but the wait staff were attentive, especially with those water refills), and the decor is charming. Â It's very loud inside, but you will be too busy stuffing your mouth with food to be able to talk or need to hear anyone talking to you.
