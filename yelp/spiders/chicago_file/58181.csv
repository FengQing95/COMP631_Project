Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Name a restaurant that has better sangria or spicy potatoes. It doesn't exist. I've had Cafe Ba-Ba-Rebba take out twice since mid-March. The quality and consistency here are always so high. The flavors from the take out make me want to wait in line and be one of the first people in when they reopen their doors.
