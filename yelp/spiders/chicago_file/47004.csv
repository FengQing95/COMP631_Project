Smoque BBQ////I was very anxious to try out this place so two of us stopped by on a Saturday night. The line was out the door which I expected given the excellent reviews found here. I ordered the brisket platter plus a sampler of St. Louis ribs and chose baked beans and french fries for the sides. All their entrees and sandwiches come with a side of coleslaw. Though I love peach cobbler, I had the bread pudding for dessert .The cobbler portion size was child size. The brisket is the best I have every tasted; tender and full of flavor. The St. Louis ribs were just okay. They were not as tender or juicy as I would have expected from here. The barbeque sauce is passable but nothing special. The baked beans were okay but better when I added some brown sugar to my leftovers the next day. The fries are fresh cut and plentiful. I paid an additional $.30 to upgrade my "free" coleslaw to a large. Sorry I did that because it wasn't very good. It had too much of a vinegar flavor and wasn't wet enough for me. However, I added coleslaw dressing to my leftovers the next day and the flavor was much improved. The bread pudding was simply delicious. The restaurant is a dumpy kind of place. It is very small, has paint chipping/peeling from the wall, and offers only communal seating. A good size person or a physically challenged individual would have difficulty maneuvering around the restaurant. The staff I interacted was all friendly and accommodating. Surely with all the business this place gets, as well as the prices they charge; they can afford to expand, relocate or rehab their restaurant. Cons: not enough inside space; communal tables; peach cobbler portion too small; pricey. Pros: BYOB, except on patio; free refills on soft drinks.
