Smoque BBQ////It had been a 5 for me, and i was a weekly regular, but then I started getting painfully dry St. Louis ribs. I course-corrected. I made it my Sunday brunch-of-choice, getting there when they opened the doors on Sunday mornings, and usually focusing on those St. Louis ribs, but sometimes on the sliced brisket. This worked for a while, but inconsistently.
