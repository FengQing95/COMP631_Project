Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////When we were finally seated our waiter asked who's birthday it was, I uncomfortably said it was mine and this was after the host that checked us in asked the same question.  I feel like if this question is going to be asked to the diners face, it should only be asked once because it makes for another awkward situation.  My husband and I ordered the smoked trout caesar salad, classic ribeye, and pommes frites to share.  The salad and steak were great but the fries were underfried so just blah.  We finished our meal with a delicious piece of lemon meringue pie but as the table next to ours who was also celebrating a birthday received a candle and special presentation, ours was delivered with hastiness and no mention of my birthday.  I just feel that if you're going to ask who's birthday it is, the least you can do is make an effort with the dessert, especially if others are receiving special treatment!
