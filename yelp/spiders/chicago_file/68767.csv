Little Goat Diner////This place is to die for. Maybe we were starving or maybe tired of too long wait hours in every other restaurant, but the food was mind blowing. The macho nachos are too heavy to be an appetizer. I had the Fat club 'Sammich' (Sandwich) which was really good, the batter on the fried chicken was also amazing. And if you take a to-go box, you will notice the quality of the to-go box. Its a good place to eat in every sense.
