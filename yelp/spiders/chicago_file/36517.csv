Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came here for late night drinks on the lower level. When asked if we could get a table for to we were told that the open tables were reserved. This sparked further questions which the server stated he couldn't answer but would speak to the manager. The server went upstairs but clearly didn't speak to anyone as we watched him. When we confronted the manager she apologized and wrote down her email address for next time we wanted to come back. The email was not her personal email as stated. Instead it was the regular email for the restaurant. We continued to have drinks at the downstairs bar and talk until the couch was available. We moved and stayed there till close and were the last two patrons there. Needless to say the same tables we were told that were reserved were still empty.
