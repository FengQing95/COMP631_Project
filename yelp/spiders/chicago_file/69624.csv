Little Goat Diner////Luckily for us, after 10 minutes of standing at the bar, three seats opened up which we took immediately. We found out that the full menu is served at the bar - WAHOO! So, we didn't have to end up waiting long at all. I ordered the pork belly pancake - amazingness. We also ordered the warm crab dip which I am obsessed with and want to eat it every day of my life.
