Smoque BBQ////My friend Candice took me here, and all I can say is wow!!! Best BBQ ever!! The price cannot be beat, the place is busy as can be and they turn out food very quickly. I definitely enjoyed it and cannot wait to be back. The Peach Cobbler is amazing, the Macaroni is heaven, and the Brisket... is the way to go.
