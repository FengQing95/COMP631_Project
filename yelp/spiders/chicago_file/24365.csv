Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////To be clear, I love Lou's pizza and in the multiple times I've been there over the past decade, the pizza and service has been second to none. However, on our visit today, we were let down. We're a family of seven (7) so we can be tricky. Which is why I call ahead. I did that with Lou's multiple times tonight as it was a family birthday. I was consistently told not to worry and no need to add our names to the list. We walked the two blocks told there was no wait and BAM -- either seated at two separate tables or a one-hour wait. We took the separate tables as we had seven hungry kids. We asked the servers if we could turn the angled tables so they lined up a bit (like one big table) but with requisite space between. They said no. We were greeted by our server and told we were in two separate sections and would have to be served separately. The hostess came up and told us if we weren't happy we could go downstairs and wait an hour. We decided to deal with it as, again, it was a family members birthday. We roved back and forth between tables and made it work. The service was sub par to say the least. Again, the best pizza in Chicago but inflexible wait staff (how hard would it have been to move the tables?) and may not be a great fit for big families or big parties. At least not this location.
