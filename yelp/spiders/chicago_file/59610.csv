Smoque BBQ////The food at Smoque is EXCELLENT.  I understand that the long lines, somewhat cramped (when crowded) confines, and the potential for running out of key menu items have the potential to detract from the overall experience (these are the only reasons I'm rating less than 5 stars).  However, food-wise, it's easy to see that all of the negative/mediocre reviews have been written by folks who are either inexperienced in BBQ (particularly the smoked kind) or hold a grudge against the place because of its popularity in the media, and were just looking for some aspect of the restaurant's service or aesthetics to rail against.
