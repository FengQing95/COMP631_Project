Smoque BBQ////I tries this place in 2016 and I loved it. Never went back because I forgot the bame and its location, one day I was dricing back and saw it. I literally parked the car (parking is not great) and there is usually a line, but its all worth it. The food is delicious, meat of the ribs is super tasty. Corn bread is my favorite there.
