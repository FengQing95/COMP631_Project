Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had dinner - three of us, ordered Malanti Classic Deep dish, it was pretty good, but not as much as it was hyped. The service was good. The creamy cheese and jalapeno soup was really good. Loved it. Dessert - brownie sundae was good too :). Also please get more choices, I mean there was nothing besides sausage,pepperoni and cheese. Where is the chicken ? :|
