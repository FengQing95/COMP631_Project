Smoque BBQ////Saddened, disappointed, but still going to go back for another try.  My chicken was VERY PINK inside, which made my godmother shy away from eating it.  When I called the restaurant to complain, they assured me that it was smoked for 2 hours, low and slow, and that it was customary for it to have that pink hue....The manager apologized and said that he would reimburse me for the chicken, but that transaction it yet to be completed and it's well over 2 months
