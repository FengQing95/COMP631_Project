Little Goat Diner////I ultimately chose the brandade and although I wasn't sure I was going to like it (house made biscuit topped with pork belly, fried eggs, kale, kimchi and pickled peppers with a very saucy brandade) I pretty much had my mind blown after the first bite. I would HIGHLY recommend this dish although it's definitely not for the faint of heart. The biscuit was AMAZING. I would possibly kill for that recipe... the pork belly was a nice thick cut, tender inside and crispy outside, good flavor and just salty enough. I can only assume that the kimchi was housemade and it was just right, not too spicy, not too salty, not too pungent. The kale was a nice touch, I don't remember it being in the menu description but I was certainly not disappointed to see it on my plate. Pickled peppers again a nice counterpoint to the rich brandade. The BRANDADE though... oh my. I've had brandade several times at several different places and it kinda just always the same, it's salt cod, potatoes, butter, etc but the brandade here at Little goat was delicious unlike any I've had before. Not sure if there was secret extra ingredients or if it was just better prepared or even just that it went so well with everything on the plate but I thoroughly enjoyed it.
