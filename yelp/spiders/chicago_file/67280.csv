Little Goat Diner////YUMMMMMMMMMMM. Yes, I could sum this review up with that one word, but I wont! We went here last night and we each ordered something different to share. In order of my faves - I had the Fish Tostados, my friend had the Reuben and my other friend got the Goat Sloppy Joe. The fish was perfectly cooked and I liked the slaw on top. The rueben was perfectly salty and everything just worked so well together. The goat sloppy was good, just not my fave. We also shared an order of the french fries and those were OMG delicious. They smoke them before they fry them and you can really taste that smokiness. There is no question in my mind that I will be returning!
