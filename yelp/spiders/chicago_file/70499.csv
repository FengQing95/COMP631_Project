Little Goat Diner////I ended up regretting my order, but only because I'm an idiot who didn't understand that the Fried Pickle Pita would, in fact, be covered in a gigantic mound of fried pickles. The description mentioned nothing about fried pickles, but it WAS named after them, so I thought at the most there would be a few thrown in. Alas, it was a mountain. I conquered Mt. Fried Pickle with a Few Onion Rings for Good Measure. By the time it was able to be eaten like a sandwich I was entirely full. But it was a delicious attempt at any rate.
