For a piece of such prominence, I was expecting it to be encased in glass, have two dedicated security guards and face a five-deep crowd of visitors. Yet, there was no glass, no guards, no crowd. It was blended in with other pieces and just sitting on the wall where you could get close enough to touch it. I was surprised by how many people just strolled by without taking much notice.
