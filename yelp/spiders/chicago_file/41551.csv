Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Glorious. Nice dudes working there. Great little first date kind of place. Best tapas in Lincoln Park, and I actually knew some of the wine on their list... which is surprising, because I'm a dumb ass when it comes to wines. The only thing I don't get is why they close so early on the weekends.
