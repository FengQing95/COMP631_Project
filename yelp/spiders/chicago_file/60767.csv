Smoque BBQ////Both the brisket and the pulled pork were so tender and smokey, they come with sauce on the side. A thinner, less sweet type of sauce. Eh, i like the thick, sweet goopy stuff - but this was still tasty. I'm not a huge fans of beans, but these were fantastic with huge chunks of meat in them. Everybody seems to love the mac & cheese and it does not disappoint. The cornbread, fries and peach cobbler were good, although the cornbread was a little dry.
