Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cute little place serving Spanish style tapas. The serrano ham and the burratta are great, and so is everything else, but the surprise winner for me was the brussel sprout salad. Shaved, raw brussel sprouts with manchego cheese, dried berries, and a nice vinaigrette...yum! Good place for groups, but definitely make a reservation.
