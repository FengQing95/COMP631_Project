Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered seafood paella, $17/serving. It tasted badly, smelling like a lot of preservatives in the mussels and squid. The rice is half cooked. I also ordered some tapas, they are just alright, kind of salty. The only tasty one is their seared Spanish sausages-txistorra. In total, I spent approximately $100. Expensive meal for two with horrible taste! Not recommended.
