Smoque BBQ////Fine ribs, fine pulled pork, fine brisket, great sides. The food remains great, long after the place has been discovered.   it's crowded, sure, but the staff handles crowds well.  Many are the imitators on the north side; this is what they wish they were.  BYOB permitted... but fergawdsakes people, it's BBQ.  If you're gonna BYOB, bring beer.  Not wine.  Not cocktails.  Not wine coolers.  Beer.  Beer.
