Smoque BBQ////Smoque is good but not amazing.  I found d the ribs to be over seasoned with rub and sauce while the brisket is excellent.   BBQ sauce and beans were fantastic but the sausage link was just ok...I guess location pays off for being "zagat rated" because Big Eds BBQ in Waukegan is pretty close to smoque In terms of taste and quality.
