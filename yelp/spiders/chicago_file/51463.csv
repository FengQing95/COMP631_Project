Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ba Ba.. Best Tapas in Chicago! After living in Spain, I would say these was the best Tapas meal that I ever experienced. I am not the biggest fan of taps but how can you not love ordering and trying almost everything on the menu wish dishes coming to your table every 5 minutes. Combine the mass amounts of food with Sangria, and your result is a lot of happy customers on a Friday night! Dare me to say it but Cafe Ba Ba Reba might fall in my Top-10 list of favorite Chicago restaurants.
