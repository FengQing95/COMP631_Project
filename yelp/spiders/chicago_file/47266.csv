Smoque BBQ////Also nice: they were totally cool with letting us put out on the buffet an enormous kale salad for the vegetarians, and helping another friend decorate the buffet table with flowers, and with letting us bring in our own eco-friendly disposables and talking us through exactly what we'd need on that front. Â In doing a walk-through with us (at their suggestion and no extra cost- again, great!) Peggy spotted a couple of things we had missed not even related to the Smoque buffet, so that was really helpful. They were also really gracious with my family and with us telling them the day before that our brothers would be coordinating payment etc at the end of the night- no problem, they rolled with everything. They made it all a breeze for us, we can't wait to come home to Chicago and eat at Smoque again. Thank you all so very much for helping make our wedding everything we hoped it would be and more!
