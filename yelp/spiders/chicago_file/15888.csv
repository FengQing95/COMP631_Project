Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////On one of my business trips to Chi-town, I was pointed toward's Lou's for some authentic Chicago deep dish pizza.  The location I tried is in the River North area of town, just a few blocks from the Westin.  This particular time, Derek was with me, we celebrated his birthday on this trip.  Lots of fun in Chicago, one of my favorite cities.
