The Purple Pig////I'll start with the drinks. They were crafted so well and they were delicious. Frankly we had too many, but I blame them for making them so good. The octopus was outstanding. Definitely try it. The flavor was unbelievable. The duck was crispy, juicy, and sweet. I can't wait to go back.
