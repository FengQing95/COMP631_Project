Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here on a medication I couldn't drink on so I missed out on the Sangria everyone is raving about! Some of the dishes were amazing and others were blah. Also, dinner here can get a bit pricey. Sangrias are $7-8 a glass and without drinks, my boyfriend and my bill came out about $60. The sausage platter was yummy with a garlic mayo to dip the sausage pieces in. The roasted green peppers with salt were not good at all. They had no flavor... the salt could not even save them from their bitter taste. And they were cooked whole... meaning seeds inside still. The breaded goat cheese is to die for. the spicy roasted potatoes are also a favorite of mine. We had other dishes but they were not too memorable... which says a lot. To finish off our mean we had the dessert flight. The blueberry sorbet, and their creme dish were amazing but the rest were sub-par...
