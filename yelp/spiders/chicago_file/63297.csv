Smoque BBQ////OUTSTANDING!!  Went there for the first time and was welcomed by Carlos who explained the menu, gave recommendations, told me what the special was and assisted me with seating. What a great employee!  For me, service is just as important as good food and Smoque has them both. The brisket was tender and flavorful. I loved the Mac and cheese but thought as a side it should have been bigger. The cole slaw is a vinegar base instead of a cream base so not to my liking but was fresh. And you can't go wrong with fresh cut fries. They have no parking and the place is small so be prepared to wait a long time for lunch or dinner. I came at 2:00 and was fine. I highly recommend and will return.
