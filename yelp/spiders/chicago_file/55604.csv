Smoque BBQ////The sides (corn bread, (vinegar) slaw & peach cobbler) were just "OK", by comparison. The corn bread was tasty without applying butter, but nothing to write home about. The Peach Cobbler was OK, but I think that I was in the mood because reflecting back (1 hour ago), there wasn't anything that really stood out. I'm not a big fan of vinegar slaw, in general, that being said, this was well prepared, good proportions of pepper, cabbage & vinegar (I ate it all).
