Smoque BBQ////The chicken was terrible! The sausage was not even close to what BBQ should be. I would have rather had a BBQ chicken Hot Pocket! Â The sides were decent but that's not what makes a restaurant good. I'm not a food snob or a BBQ snob but this was some of the worst BBQ I've ever had. The smokey flavor tasted like it was sprayed on like people spray on tans. I'm sure they're nice people but the food was super disappointing.
