Smoque BBQ////HOLY MOTHER OF ALL THINGS HOLY this place is frickin' delicious. I love going there with a six pack and a friend and gorging on brisket (by far, my favorite). The last time I was there, they weren't serving the St. Louis ribs which was a good move in my book. I had them one time and they were kinda tough and not horribly flavorful. The brisket though... .oh, the brisket. If I could fall in love with a piece of meat I would drop mad L-bombs on that brisket.
