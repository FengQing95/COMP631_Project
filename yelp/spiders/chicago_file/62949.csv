Smoque BBQ////Smoque is always spot on. I always order the pulled pork sandwich with extra (delicious) bbq sauce on the side.  I love the sides because they're the perfect size for 1.  The mac and cheese and corn bread are delicious and personal sized.  The french fries are enough to share with one other person.  The peach cobbler for dessert is really good as well.  It's great because they allow you to pay for it then if you ask one of the guys working there, they'll bring it out for you hot and fresh when you're ready to have it!
