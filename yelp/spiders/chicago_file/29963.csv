Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Preferred the Lou's Pizza over the classic but both were delicious. Place was packed and the pizza takes about 45 minutes to cook. It was my first time eating a deep dish and was absolutely amazing!! Highly recommend! Also each is slice is super filling so when ordering def downsize what you're originally thinking. We had a medium half and half and left with so much pizza. Totally stuffed.
