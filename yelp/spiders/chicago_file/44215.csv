Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Made a reservation for 8:30 and the restaurant was extremely packed when we arrived; however, we only waited five minutes before our table was ready. Our waitress was extremely attentive and helpful as we looked over the menu. As I was dining with a very hungry man, we Â (really, he) ended up ordering A LOT. Truthfully, the only disappointment was the pomegranate sangria. It was light in color, which I don't normally associate with pomegranate) and watered-down by all of the ice. We ended up having their orange mojito later which was pretty delicious.
