Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Hmmmm, I found the food strangely average during my dinner here. Maybe an off night? Everything was good, but for some reason the place doesn't stand out among the restaurants I visited while in Chicago for a long weekend (though I ate some amaaaazing food that weekend so perhaps my standards were a bit high). And I love tapas, so not sure what went wrong!
