Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas are good to get a fresh start. We chose the house favorite, two are a little more for two persons because neither of us finished the rice after that. But the food was great and the atmosphere was fantastic. This is the most popular restaurant around Lincoln Park. So if you are around, I will recommend this restaurant.
