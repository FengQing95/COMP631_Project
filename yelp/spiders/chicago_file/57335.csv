Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was there during happy hour and hadn't yet looked at the specials. I told the bartender we wanted a pitcher of sangria and he asked which kind, classic or other. I asked what the difference was and he simply said, "the other {I forget what it was called} is better." Turns out, the "other" was also twice the price!! Because only the classic was part of the happy hour special.
