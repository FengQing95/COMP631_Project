Little Goat Diner////I'm not usually one for shrimp cocktail, but this was pretty fantastic -- the shrimp were wrapped in a crispy fried pastry shell, and then served with a lettuce wrap and sauce. I would never have thought to order them but they were probably my favorite thing we had. The sandwiches were solid as well, and the smoked fries were delicious as well.
