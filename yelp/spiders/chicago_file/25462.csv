Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When I pictured a Chicago deep dish pizza, this place delivered. A bustling hole in the wall with a long wait. An awesome feature of this restaurant is that you order your pizza before you sit down. This way, they have more tables available and you don't have to wait very long to finally taste some deep dish.
