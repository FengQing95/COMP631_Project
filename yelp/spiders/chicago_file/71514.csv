Little Goat Diner////We went to this place several years ago and loved it but this trip was a huge disappointment. The machos nachos were delicious, but everything else was not. First, our server was not good. She had a bit of an attitude, never checked on us and didn't refill our iced tea unless we tracked her down and asked for one. Even more disappointing were our entrees. The French toast would have been good but it was drenched in syrup (ask for syrup on the side). The los drowned was below average. There was too much going with it, and the flavors didn't really work. Plus, there was more fat than beef. The BLTA was ok. The bacon was good but there was too much mayonnaise, and the bacon got lost in the other toppings, plus there wasn't enough bacon. The mashed potatoes were weird. We didn't care for it. That said, the hash browns were good. Overall, a real disappointment.
