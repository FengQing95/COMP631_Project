Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was tasty and served quickly. The server did little to make us feel welcomed. I expected to have plenty of social distancing in their indoor/outdoor patio area and tables may have been at least six feet apart but it was very full and it made me so concerned that I did not have a pleasant experience. It didn't feel like air was circulating very well and large tables had so many people that it made it too noisy to have any kind of conversation--which also say something about the distance between tables. This was my first visit to this restaurant and likely to be my last.
