Little Goat Diner////I like coming to this diner. Has rooftop seating in the summer.  Drinks are good.  I like that you can get breakfast all day. I like the pulled pork sandwich and have also enjoyed the Mac and cheese. Appetizers ok but just think diner and you won't go wrong. Can sit at table but the counter is in too. Then you can see all the choices. I had pancakes my first time which were great
