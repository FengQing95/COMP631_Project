Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was super excited when I read the reviews about lou and wanted to give it a try during my visit last month to chicago. My party and I ordered a vegetarian deep dish pizza, we were eagerly waiting to have our first bite of the well reviewed deep dish, only to be disappointed. I have had my fair share of pizza all around the country and I would naturally expect the pizza to taste good, all of us at the table were very disappointed. The crust was unevenly cooked, marinara tasted bad, there wasn't enough marinara on the pizza nor enough cheese, too much crust and we had to order extra sides of marinara to be able to eat. Couldn't send the order back as we would have to wait another hour to be able to get our order. SO we just left disappointed. I would never go back if I ever visit chicago.
