Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We all shared the catalan tomato bread, which was my favorite.  It had vine ripened tomato spread on it with noticeable garlic flavor and a thin slice of what I think was Manchego cheese (?) on it.  Everything was so delicious and the flavors blended well together.  We also split the spicy potatoes with tomato aioli and that was really delicious too!  The potatoes were seasoned to perfection and the tomato aioli was a nice compliment to the potatoes.  I like when it's more tomatoey than mayo so it was perfect for me.  We also split the Moroccan chickpea stew.  It tasted authentically Moroccan to me with the mild raisins in there, it definitely brought me back to my trip earlier this year.
