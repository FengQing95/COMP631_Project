Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Spent 1k on dinner. Food overall was very good. However the service was Slowwwwwww. Asked to have the dessert to go as opposed to having it at the table (after 3hr dinner) still waiting for that dessert because left after waiting at least (30) more minutes for some one to bring the alleged fantastic chocolate cream pie. Very disappointed.
