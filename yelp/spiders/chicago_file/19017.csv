Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Service was great and the buttercrust was just as delicious as everyone had proclaimed it to be.  Sitting at the bar and watching the world series while I was served delicious things was also stellar.  If you're in the area and don't mind a line : GO HERE!  Even if it's to order take-away to binge on buttercrust in the privacy of your own home - I wouldn't judge (it's probably not a bad thing that they don't deliver to my neck of the woods!).  This spot is totally second-date-friendly (for the casual atmosphere, yummy food, and the price).
