The Purple Pig////Even on a rainy day this place is bustling and busy as ever! My boss took me here since it was my first time in the city. The restaurant is located at the side of the building Â in Downtown with both interior and outside seating. If you're looking to sit inside, you might have to get used to being packed at the same table with other parties.
