Smoque BBQ////Having sworn off pork and beef for a decade and a half, I probably should have not have come to Smoque w/ the expectations that I had.  (One can't help but to read reviews and then to generalize.)  In any case, I had the half chicken w/ the mac and cheese and fries.  The chicken was pretty average.  The BBQ sauce was pretty mediocre in my opinion.  The mac and cheese, which comes in a small foil tin, and fries were also fairly average.  I couldn't rave about the sides or the chicken or the sauce or the prices, putting this place a little under a 3 in my eyes.
