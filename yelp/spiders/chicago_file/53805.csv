Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Shared a pitcher of the mango sangria and pretty much every one of the chef recommended plates but, when we saw the table next to us get the paella we immediately regretted not trying it. The food was slightly overpriced for what we got but that is the way with tapas it seems. Every plate was well thought out and executed. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable so, no complaints there.
