Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza was great but when we left we over heard our server complaining loudly how we didn't tip her enough, when we were literally a couple of feet away from her. Our friend did accidentally tipped incorrectly by accident but the way she handled it was disrespectful and rude.
