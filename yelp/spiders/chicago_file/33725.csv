Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Phenomenal, exquisite, unbelievable -- every synonym at my disposal wouldn't be enough to underline just how extraordinary my meal here was.  My parents were in town visiting Chicago for the first time, so I'd made reservations here because I'd heard such good things; from the moment I walked in the door, my already high expectations were blown out of the water.  First off: this place is gorgeous.  The ambiance is a wonderful throwback to a steakhouse out of a Roaring Twenties noir-film, the kind of place that I imagine Fitzgerald and Hemingway would've eaten at.  The dim lighting, the candles, the perfectly dressed waitstaff and bartenders; all this and more work in concert to let you know that this restaurant is more than just a place to eat, it's here to make a bold statement about what a steakhouse can be.
