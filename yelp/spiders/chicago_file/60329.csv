Smoque BBQ////The price was perfect 12 bucks for all that food, coleslaw and a drink.  The place was very clean and the staff was very friendly.  I will say it gets crowded in there, but believe me the line could be down the block, in the blistering heat and I would wait like a little puppy ready to stuff my face.
