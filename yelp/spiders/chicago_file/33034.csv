Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is no different; it's at the top of my list of places to go for any number of occasions whether it be a date, group dinner (quiet enough to have intelligible conversations), or drinks w/small bites. Lovely decor and ambience, AWESOME servers, and best of all, amazing food! It's a Euro steakhouse also serves some excellent seafood, but let's focus on the red meat first; in my two visits, I've had the lamb chops and the bone-in ribeye. The lamb chops were some of the BEST I've ever had in my life; so succulent, juicy, tender, and flavorful, I tell everyone that THIS is the place to go for lambchops. My last visit was was the time I was able to try the massive bone-in ribeye; perfection. Big enough to share, although you won't want to, risking the loosening of the belt at the table routine that I'm sure many of you are no strangers to (and luckily the restaurant is dark enough to potentially hide if you're ninja enough). What more can I say? Bavette's delivers on its meat!
