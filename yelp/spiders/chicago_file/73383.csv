Little Goat Diner////We both went with ala carte grilled cheese; gouda, mont amore, guanciale (aka bacon I believe) and smoked tomato.  It was not a traditional grilled cheese by any means.  The guanciale and tomato were almost more present than the cheeses themselves and it was a pretty juicy sandwich as a result.  Delicious no doubt, I would order it again...it was just not what I envisioned before it was set in front of me.  The sandwich was plenty filling on it's own.
