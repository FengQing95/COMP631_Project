Art Institute of Chicago////We took our time with the exhibit then zipped through the rest of the museum, stopping here and there to admire famous works like "American Gothic," "Nighthawks," and "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte"; we gawked at what seemed like whole roomfuls of Monet and Renoir. The collection was vast and impressive, and we probably needed to allocate more time to do it any justice. Still, I felt properly enriched by our short visit, and I hope to come back to this museum some other leisurely trip to Chicago.
