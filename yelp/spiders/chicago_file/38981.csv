Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started off with some east coast oysters which were very creamy and tasty but not as briny as expected. We saved our appetites for the steak and had the NY Strip medium rare plus and the famed ribeye medium rare. Surprisingly the NY strip was better! I think they slightly overlooked the ribeye and it was more medium well cantor medium rare though the crust was excellent. Sides included the frites (thick cut double fried at least!) that were fantastic and Mac and cheese. The sides are actually huge so we were glad to order only two. Afterwards we were so full that we could not fit in dessert! Excellent meal, good service, great ambiance!
