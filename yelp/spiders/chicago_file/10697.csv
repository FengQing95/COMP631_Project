Art Institute of Chicago////The only criticism I have is the photography exhibit. In a time when there have been 150 plus years of photography and such powerful and meaningful ones, to descend into extreme political rhetoric is such a waste and far below the Museum's standard of excellence in the rest of the exhibits. It was disappointing that someone's political ax to grind and an ugly ax at that, would be given so much space. It's noteworthy that it had the smallest crowds. The lack of interest speaks volumes...if the Museum administration is listening.
