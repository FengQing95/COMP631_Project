Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////As far as the space, it was more than big enough, and I loved the lay-out. Our server was extremely personable, and did an excellent job keeping up with food, and allowed me to just enjoy hosting. They have different fixed plated options. We also paid an additional $100 to have a private make-shift bar with a private tender. It was totally the way to go!!! It allowed me to have a cash bar without it coming across as tacky. Also, the manager closed the check out with me, and took the time to explain the final number.
