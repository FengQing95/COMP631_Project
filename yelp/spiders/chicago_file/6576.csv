The Purple Pig////Service was very average. The waiter seemed rushed and wasn't very helpful (I was between a 3 and a 4, but the service rounded it down to a 3). All of the food is GOOD, but had some sort of drawback that kept it from achieving its full potential. That plus being really pricey makes this place a 3.
