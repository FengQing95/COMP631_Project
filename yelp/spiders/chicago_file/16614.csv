Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The décor at Lou's is best described as Sports Bar meets Pizzeria.  The subtle and modest atmosphere, that's greatly complemented by the ensemble of autograph jerseys that engulfs the walls of this establishment, aides in its theme.  Various notables ranging from a Bobby Knight autographed Red Sweater to a signed Larry Bird Celtics Jersey are on full display.  Needless to say, the sports fan will find this establishment hard to turn up.
