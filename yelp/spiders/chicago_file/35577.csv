Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////First, the good: James, the maitre d', was phenomenal.  My date has a bad back and I completely forgot to mention it with my reservation so they finagled their table assignments and were able to move us around to a seating area that would be comfortable for him. After we declined the first table we were waiting by the bar for a few moments and another hostess came to lead us to a second table. It had the same problem as the first and within moments James swooped in to the rescue and said he heard we were seated but wanted to make sure the seats were okay and found us a new table that was perfect.  He was phenomenal.
