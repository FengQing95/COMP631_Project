The Purple Pig////Vittles: Hands down: This is one of the best meals I have had. I tried the braised pork shoulder and it was absolutely divine. Rich, hearty, and flavorful, with the right accompaniment of veggies and, thanks to the server, a well pared wine. We also partook in the deep fried chocolate dessert. Amaaaaaazing!
