Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The restaurant itself was very busy. We wanted to be sat outside but had no luck. We were in the lower portion just next to the patio. Thank Â goodness there wasn't room outside! When we left, we walked through the patio and it smelled like wet socks out there! The humidity was high that day and tons of people moving around + food smell + enclosed patio = disaster.
