Smoque BBQ////I've been a fan of Smoque for years.  Their food is consistently wonderful, the people are nice, the restaurant is well kept (especially for a BBQ place).  They still have some of the best brisket in the area, but don't let that deter you from the pulled pork (or the ribs for that matter, but I feel the other two are better).  The sides are all fabulous, especial their mac and cheese and their baked beans.
