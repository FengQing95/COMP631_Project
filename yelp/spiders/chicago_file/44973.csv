Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Absolutely delicious! My boyfriend and I went on a Wednesday night around 9:00 and it was still a 20 minute wait. However, the hostess invited us to take a seat at the bar if we were able to find a seat, and there were plenty of open ones so we decided to just do that. I actually really enjoyed sitting at the bar--we were able to ask the bartender his opinion on a few things, and he was really helpful. We started with the Pintxos platter of small bites and EVERYTHING was delicious, especially the grilled shrimp and the goat cheese croqueta. Then we ordered a first round of tapas and again, everything was delicious. Â If you aren't familiar with what is on the menu, I would go for the red-font items--those are their specialties and you can pretty much count on it being a home run. We started off with the shrimp with garlic and olive oil (delish), the chicken and ham croquetas (delish), the beef tenderloin and blue cheese (delish), and the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce (SUPER delis). Like I said, it was just me and my boyfriend, but neither one of us had eaten much that day so we were still hungry and decided to order a couple more. We added on the meatballs with sherry tomato sauce and skewered chicken and chorizo and that was perfect. After that, we were two very, very happy people.
