Art Institute of Chicago////If you have never experienced The Art Institute of Chicago you are seriously missing out. Not only is the art inside amazing the architecture is incredible. I am a sucker for staircases and the stairs here are some of my favorites. Prior to the addition of the modern wing we spent 14 hours here to see the entire thing. I don't think this is necessary. You know what appeals to you and what your museum tolerance is. You can have a great time in just a few hours as well. The impressionists and the rotating photography exhibits are my personal favorites but I also really enjoy the collection of paper weights. I was disappointed by the modern wing and thought it looks just like an Apple store, its worth a quick peek but I think your time would be better spent in the other areas of the museum.
