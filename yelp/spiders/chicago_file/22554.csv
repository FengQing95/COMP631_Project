Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My girlfriend had never had deep dish pizza before so I wanted her to come try Lou's for her first time. We ordered the Chicago Classic with the butter crust. Â The sausage was nice with a good amount of fat and the tomatoes cut through the sausage with its perfect acidity. The balance was great. I do wish they had more varieties in their deep dish, we wanted a supreme style deep dish but you have the option to build your pie if you'd like. If you are in Chicago and have not tried deep dish then this is the place I would recommend.
