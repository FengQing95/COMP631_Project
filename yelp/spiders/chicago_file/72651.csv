Little Goat Diner////People on Yelp raved about the French toast so I was really looking forward to it, but unfortunately it ended up being really disappointing. It wasn't bad, but nothing was really special. It was just kind of burnt toast with an egg in the center, covered in fried chicken and strawberries. The chicken especially was nothing special. I could probably get better fried chicken at a fast food place. Overall it was pretty disappointing and not worth the $16 price.
