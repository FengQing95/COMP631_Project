Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Not great pizza. I didn't care for their pizza sauce at all. Tasted more like tomato sauce-- no spices and things. Super disappointed that I wasted a meal in Chicago on this pizza. The buffalo wings were really great. Oreat flavor. Should have just had a couple orders if those.
