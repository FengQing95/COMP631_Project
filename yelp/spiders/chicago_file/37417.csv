Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////If this pace isn't on your list of top steakhouses, you're missing out. It's a little tucked away as far as location goes, and certainly valet, it's very affordable as far as city parking goes. The whole experience from start to finish was fantastic. The waitstaff is what you would expect, impeccable, knowledgeable and suggests some different things. We changed it up and actually started with the thick cut bacon, which was salty, and a little sweet with a nice maple finish. The main course was a bone in filet for her and the 45 day dry aged bone in ribeye for me. I've never seen or heard of a bone in filet, but the added flavor was unrivaled from any other filet had. The bone in ribeye was melt in your mouth smooth, with excellent beefy flavor, a great char crust and fat melted throughout. The bone marrow side was an excellent accompaniment to the tremendous sourdough. The elote is a wonderful changeup from the typical steakhouse sides, with deep creamy flavor and a nice little kick of citrus. The truffle Mac and cheese was great as well. Not a single bad thing was had, and we look forward to coming back as soon as possible!
