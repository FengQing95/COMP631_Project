Little Goat Diner////One of my favorite diner experiences to date. Had a mimosa ci with a touch of Mezcal, chili, side of eggs, and smoked fries (sooooooo good) at 9pm. I really liked the atmosphere and the spot alone is great for a date. I can see how reservations are the best way to go but my cousin and I walked in at 8:45pm without a problem during the week. I recommend the Bulls Eye French Toast based on taste. The Not Chinese Broccoli was extremely dry and that's what kept me from giving the restaurant five stars. Otherwise it's a great dining option for a local or visitor to Chicago.
