Little Goat Diner////I am a huge brunch person so the fact that they serve breakfast all day already wins my heart to begin with. But on top of that, the food is fresh and downright delicious. I've had the Elvis waffles which is basically a banana + peanut butter (+bacon) paradise. Literally amazing. This past time I went, I tried to get a healthier option so went with the chick pea salad. Ate every bite I could fit in. And the portion was a generous size! This place is def a favorite after only 3 visits.
