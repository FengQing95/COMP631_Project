Little Goat Diner////The prices are WAY TOO MUCH for the food not to be excellent.  Everything is a la carte.  So that means for a sandwich and fries the total was 17 before taxes.  Unless the sandwich has lobster on it, this is just ridiculous.  I have been to many restaurants and paid a lot less for food that tastes so much better.
