Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Here is where I lost it. I already had crappy oysters and bone marrow, his beets were too thin for him, Â but then my wedge salad came. How can you screw that up? Bavette's can! The core of the wedge was so big and bitter. Throw it out when you have that much yellow core; and the dressing, the WORST. It tasted like watered down mayo, with a hint of ranch flavoring (I hate ranch) w/ some blue cheese crumbles. The steak was solid (it was $56) it better be.
