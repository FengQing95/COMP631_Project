Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When I came with one other person, we split a small size (serves 2) with half of their Classic and half "The Lou." We enjoyed the food and thought it was definitely good pizza, but for the size and $20 in addition to waiting 45 minutes for the pizza to come out, it probably isn't always the best option. I strongly suggest it for the experience but am not sure I would come back again.
