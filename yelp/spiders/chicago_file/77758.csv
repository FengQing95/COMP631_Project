Little Goat Diner////Last but not least, they have an entire menu for GLUTEN-FREE patrons. And THANK YOU--it was so amazing that they have that. I noticed that the prices were a little higher on the GF menu, but they stated that they do bake their own gf bread (which really is rare) so I'll give it to them.
