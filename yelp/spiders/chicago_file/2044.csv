Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////With every entree you get to upgrade to premium pancakes, I defiantly recommend this since they are substantial and delicious. The location cannot be beat, it's directly next to Millennium Park on Michigan Avenue. Be prepared to wait, wait and wait. The seating situation inside and outside needs to be worked on. When you sit inside it sounds like you're sitting in a children's cafeteria and outside they need more umbrella's.
