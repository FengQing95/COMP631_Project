Little Goat Diner////What is it called when a BLACK HOST OF LITTLE GOAT SHOWS BLATENT DISCRIMINATION TO TWO BROWN WELL TRAVELLED, EDUCATED AND ELOQUENT GIRLS FROM LONDON WHO ASK TO GET A TABLE FOR BRUNCH AND GET SAT IN THE KITCHEN CORNER IN THE DARK BEHIND A COLUMN WITH NO LIGHT TO SEE THEIR MENUS, LET ALONE EAT THE FOOD THEY WOULD HAVE GRACIOUSLY PAID FOR? I THOUGHT CHICAGO WASN'T A SMALL TOWN WITH SMALL TOWN MENTALITY? Turns out it's racist AF to brown people at Little Goat. BEWARE: & DONT EAT here.
