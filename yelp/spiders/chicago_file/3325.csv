The Purple Pig//// I've ever had. Sat at the bar and had dishes paired perfectly with wine. The staff and bar frequenters couldn't have been more friendly. The wine list is beyond extensive and expertly selected. Started with a crisp, white Chablis which paired deliciously with the insanely delectable calamari and chicken thigh kabob. Followed up with a Spanish red with the deviled egg and truffle assortment. Every single thing we ate was delicious and the atmosphere felt like a hole-in-the-wall gem that you alone discovered. We will be back every Chicago trip we take.
