Smoque BBQ////Sides are good, but remember the meat is the star. The cole slaw is dressed with a vinaigrette and is a light counterpoint to the rich smoky meat. The mac and cheese I wish came double sized--it is really good, a little smoky, and made with real cheese. The baked beans are a little too sweet for my taste, but my husband likes them because they are very smoky. We both love the peach cobbler. It has an interesting smoky taste as well, different from an oven baked version. It does make me wish they had ice cream in the menu, so i could put some on top.
