Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our waiter was excellent. Everything we ordered was from good to fantastic. The food highlights were the bacon wrapped dates and the beef with blue cheese. Even better was the sangria and free desserts for my birthday. The chocolate tres leches and caramelized bananas finished off the meal perfectly... and they are minis, so way less guilt inducing.
