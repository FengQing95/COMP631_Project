Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our waiter was helpful in suggesting how many dishes to order and how much sangria. We got three bottles of sangria and I was a HUGE fan of the blood orange and blackberry - all about the fruit ones! As for the food, we all ordered a couple of dishes and we're just blown away by how tasty everything was. Garlic shrimp, spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms, scallops and spicy potatoes were my top favorites.
