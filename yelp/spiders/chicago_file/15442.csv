Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The first time I ever tried Chicago pizza was here. I can truly say that I wasnt a huge fan of this place. Let me start with the positives: my boyfriend and I were seated promptly, the service was good, the chicken wings were really tasty as well as their calamari, every inch of the pizza was filled with topping, a lot of cheese, the sauce tasted really fresh. The negatives: the pizza dough was pretty bland, although the sauce tasted fresh it was pretty tasteless, the was only one bathroom stall given how big and busy this place is. In my opinion I thought the pizza was a little bland. There was way too much cheese for a bland pizza dough. I mean cheese is a good thing but not if the pizza tastes just completely tasteless. I'm not going to let this experience ruin my thoughts on Chicago style pizza. I just need to find a better place. Their appetizers were good and really tasty. The pizza took about 40 minutes to be served but I heard that is the average amount of time it takes everywhere. The price was decent. I probably wouldn't return to this place. I think if it's your first time trying Chicago style pizza you should definitely go somewhere else.
