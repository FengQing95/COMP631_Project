Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Super delicious deep dish that is more cheesy and satisfying than the ones we have back in SF.  The tomato sauce is tangy and sweet, and the cheese just oozes into your plate.  We got a small and a bruschetta (highly recommended) for the two of us, and ended up with about 1/4 as leftovers. Root beer was a great accompaniment.  Our server was friendly and fast.  We really enjoyed the meal.
