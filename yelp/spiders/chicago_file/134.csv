Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////On Saturdays & Sundays they get very crowded, each time I've gone has been seated shortly before 9. Every time I have been there all the seats are filled by 9-915ish, and by the time we leave there are a lot of people waiting. The food is worth the wait, but if you're impatient like I am get there before 9am and save yourself the wait.
