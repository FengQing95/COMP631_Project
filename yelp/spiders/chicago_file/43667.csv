Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////#51 Rioja Brazed Short Ribs, manchego mashed potatoes, seasonal vegetables $10 = this description is deceiving....the potatoes were not mashed... we received a spoon of runny whipped potatoes, 1 short rib and a slurry of veg puree.  The meat was a bit tough/chewy and all of it was bland.
