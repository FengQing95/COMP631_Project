Art Institute of Chicago////This place amazes me more and more each time I walk in. Everyone gets a chance to experience the best works of art from the world's most elite and famous artists of all time! It still boggles my mind that we get to stand in the same rooms that Monet, Raphael Sanzio, and even Leonardo Da vinci paintings hang in. That alone is an enormous and special honor that I hope everyone can come to appreciate.
