Art Institute of Chicago////Absolutely loved here! It's almost like Louvre, the number of great pieces is so big! Salvador Dali, Picasso, Paul CÃ©zanne, Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh, Pierre Renoir, Edgar Degas and so much more! Plus there are many free day for Illinois residents. Thanks so much for the great experience! I'll be back :)
