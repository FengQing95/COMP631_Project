Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our bill was only around forty five dollars because we did not order drinks and that in itself right from the start seemed to put Jose in a sour mood. Just because we were not going to have a massive high bill with a massive high tip. Â I have, many times in the past ordered drinks and I love your sangrias...however last night we were driving and could not drink and drive.
