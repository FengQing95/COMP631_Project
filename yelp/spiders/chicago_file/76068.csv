Little Goat Diner////On the other hand, you'd be hard pressed not to find me ordering this must-have dish. I appreciated that the Asian flavors weren't overtly in your face, but I found myself wondering how I wasn't indulging in an elevated Peking duck meal, supplanted with a crisp and hefty portion of pork belly. The gluttonous chew from the scallion pancake was on point and provided a nice textural contrast with the crisp bok choy slaw. The slaw which had just enough acidity to balance out the pork belly which was hidden beneath.
