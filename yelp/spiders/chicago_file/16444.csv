Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Fabulous dinner!!  Highly recommend!!! Our Bartender/Server, David was superb!! He recommended the perfect first try Chicago piazza and toppings. Deep dish Chicago w/Carbanero(?) The wine (Cab)  was great and beer recommendations were perfect to go with the pizza!!:-) Our BEST dinner so far on our trip to Chicago!!! We had a 30 min wait for seating but "swooped" onto two seats at the bar!!! Score:-)
