Little Goat Diner////During a weekend trip to Chicago, my boyfriend and I planned a special trip to Little Goat Diner. We were so excited to try it and we're not let down. We went on a weekday and didn't have a wait. The restaurant was very clean and the staff were all friendly and very attentive. I ordered the Fat Elvis Waffles and they were the stuff dreams are made of. I have been fantasizing about these waffles since the trip and can't wait to go back to Chicago and visit Little Goat Diner again.
