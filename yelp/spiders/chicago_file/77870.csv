Little Goat Diner////Little Goat was our best meal on our short trip to Chicago, making reservations ahead is a must! We didn't make ours til about 1 week out, which meant the only seating was 8:15am for our party of 5 (including our toddler). We arrived in Chicago after midnight so it was tough, but the staff was welcoming and the food didn't take long. Plus the large booths were comfy and great for a bouncy 2.75 year old ;-)
