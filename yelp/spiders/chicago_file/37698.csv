Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is the BEST steak house I have ever been to. I cannot get over how good my steak was and the overall experience. We were seated in the lower level and I loved how intimate and dimly lit it was. My husband and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and this was the perfect place to do so.
