Little Goat Diner////Was super excited to check out one of my favorite Top Chef's restaurants...sadly disappointed. Crab dip app tasted of minimal to no crab; ritz crackers better served on the side vs in the hot dip as they became soggy. I really enjoy chop chae, so chop chae burger it was, meh. Everything is ala carte, got a side of $9 Mac and cheese. Was it worth $9??? Eh, debatable. Highlight was the Reuben; Kim chi was a surprisingly pleasant addition. Reserved seats at the counter, was seated immediately before our reservation time. Service was forgettable. Was cool to watch the cooks/chefs in action, looked to be a well oiled machine. Too bad the food was not as I had hoped. But if you're ever in the Windy City, check it out for yourself and decide.
