The Purple Pig////Unfortunately the table we received was right next to the door so we had a lot of people walking by or standing next to our table waiting which was kind of awkward. The overhead heaters were also laughably weak. I could barely feel anything and was cold during my whole meal, which made it hard to enjoy. Granted I'm from SoCal but even our patio heaters are much stronger and we don't even need them most of the time. I think if you sat more towards the inner part of the patio it might have been a little warmer there. Or they could put down the plastic door flap that serves as the patio entrance, in order to keep more heat in. Because it was cold I also felt rushed to eat our food before it got cold. I think in the colder months waiting for indoor seating would definitely be worth it.
