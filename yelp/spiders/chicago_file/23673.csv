Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I wanted to know what all the hype over deep dish pizza was about and this place proved it. Sure, it took longer than an average pizza but well worth the wait! We got 2 personal sized pizzas (one Lou, which is the vegetable one, and the Malnatis Chicago Classic, which featured sausage) and both were perfect. Very simple stuff, but simply delicious and filling.
