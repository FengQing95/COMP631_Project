The Purple Pig////Recommended by Michael C I knew I had to hit up Purple Pig while I was in the windy city. We were hoping to go there for brunch but when we showed up there was a 2 hour wait. we decided to still put our name in and walk around a bit and come back when they texted. You have 10 minutes to return back once they text you.
