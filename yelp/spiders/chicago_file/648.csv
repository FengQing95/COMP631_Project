Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Disappointed. Everyone was ordering around us, and getting their food before us. Waiter never checked on us. We finally asked for our waiter. He never showed to redeem himself, but another did, who took great care of us. They also made an excuse for him that he had a lot of tables. Maybe he should find a slower paced profession. After being so hungry, you would've thought the food would've tasted even better. It was okay. Nothing to brag about, but it was hot cause we had skillets. The pancakes, again, nothing to brag about. I would never not leave a tip, but I would like to think they deserved it, cause it's not an easy profession.
