Little Goat Diner////Put in our name for a table, expressing a preference for outdoor seating. While we waited, went to the coffee bar- I had just a regular coffee, but it was excellent! Waited about 30-40 minutes for our table, which was fine (brunch is always so busy), and were seated to our outdoor table! best spot in the house for sure.
