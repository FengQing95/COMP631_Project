Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It seems that covid has put a strain on the supply and menu at cafe ba ba reeba due to the shut down. They have revised and shortened their menu, and unfortunately some of my favorite dishes have not survived. The server that we had was very attentive and personable. Food came out hot and fresh and in a timely manner. The negatives that stood out were the following 1: the busser took dishes that we were not finished with multiple times. One of which was the shrimp that comes in delicious garlic oil. We told the server and she got us more garlic oil-- score! Except the busser came and threw it away again, without asking! 2. No serving silverware was provided, so we were forced to use shared utensils to divide portions to each other (during a pandemic) 3. We had to repeatedly ask for fresh plates, and we were left with the same dirty silverware the entire time. Overall the ambiance was nice and service good. It was pretty busy for a Monday night, and so we were asked to leave because they were getting backed up, to be fair they do notify you that they have a time limit, but for customers that paid almost $400 dollars for dinner, it seems a little crass to ask them to leave
