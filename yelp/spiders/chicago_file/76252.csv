Little Goat Diner////Our meal was pretty simple, so it came out quickly. The biscuits and gravy were very good. The sausage within the gravy was not too salty and the two biscuits were firm and did not become soggy under the blanket of gravy. I was halfway through eating a biscuit, when our Bulls Eye French Toast arrived. I have a devastating sweet tooth, so the appearance of syrup drenched French toast with fresh strawberries pleased me. The French Toast was delicious and the bite-sized pieces of fried chicken strewn atop went surprisingly well with the sweetness of the bbq syrup. After this carbo-load, I felt pretty full, but pretty good and almost forgot all my worries. I would definitely come back and try more items and probably the French Toast again.
