Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////OMG. This place is AMAZING. I'm so glad I got to try this restaurant in the short 4 days I was visiting Chicago. I couldn't get a reservation at Alinea in time so this was my backup choice. And I'm so glad it worked out the way it did - Everything from the ambiance, to the service.. to the unbelievably drool worthy food is 5 stars. The restaurant is dimly lit with the whole Chicago bar vibe - burgundy leather booth tables and open kitchen. We brought our child to the restaurant, and my only gripe was that they did not have any booster seats to accommodate us as we were seated in a booth. Thus, I had to eat dinner with only one hand while the other was holding my child  from slipping out of the booth. Please do not leave this restaurant without ordering their bacon.. it is the best thing in life - thick cut, with a maple glaze on top.... I wish I left Chicago with a box of their bacon. As a starter, we tried the crab stuffed avocado salad. Pretty good, but I wouldn't mind trying a different salad next time. The 22oz dry aged bone in ribeye was  nothing short of Amazing. I loved that the sides of the meat had a nice char to the taste. The truffle mac and cheese was also delicious and a great complement to the steak. I ordered the special of the day which was a halibut for my child. The fish was very fresh, and my child loved it. We were celebrating our anniversary and the waiter brought out complimentary ice cream with a sparkler on top. It was a nice touch and ending to our dinner. I can't wait to go back to Chicago to dine here again. Definitely recommend coming here for dinner!
