Smoque BBQ////So, all in all, Smoque was just as the rating says, "A-OK". It's a good option for winter months when you don't want to BBQ yourself, and I prefer Smoque to other BBQ joints I've tried in the city. That being said, Smoque isn't putting Chicago on the map in terms of BBQ, but it will do in a pinch.
