Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////* Oysters. The menu offers 4 different kinds of oysters and we got 3 of each, so we could all try 1. There were 2 east coast and 2 west coast. I thought 1 of them was better than the rest, but in the end the place is dark so it's kinda hard to tell exactly how much lemon you squeeze on each oyster. And when it comes down to it, they're raw oysters. This is a dish that sort of goes on a pass/fail grade. This gets a pass.
