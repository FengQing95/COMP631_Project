Art Institute of Chicago////The AIC is the best art museum in America's heartland, bar none.  The collection is diverse but timelessly classic.  As other Yelpers have suggested, do not miss the Picasso.  There's a small gallery filled with some of the better Monets as well.  The sculpture is generally quite strong as well.  The museum is quite cavernous, so be prepared to get yourself wonderfully lost.  Check out the free days (when it is obviously really crowded) and the student discounts!
