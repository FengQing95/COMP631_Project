Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had the petite filet which was phenomenal specially with the sauce, my wife had it medium plus and I had it medium both were cooked exactly the way we like. They actually were very tender to the extent that they almost melted in our mouths Â but I would say it tastes different than the typical steak in other steakhouses.
