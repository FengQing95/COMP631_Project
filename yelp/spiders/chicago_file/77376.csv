Little Goat Diner////I have heard many great reviews about this diner so I was inclined to try it. I was recommended the biscuit and gravy which I thought was very filling, hearty and tasteful. My friend got the waffles and chicken. She let me try some of it. Midway through the meal, we noticed something crunchy, and it was egg shells. We assumed that egg shells were not part of the dish. I would have thought that this culinary mistake would be unheard of from a top chef winner's restaurant. Just carelessness and lack of attention to detail... Â disappointed...
