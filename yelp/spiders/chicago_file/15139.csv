Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was recommend this place by the waitress at Snicker's.  good call.  Not knowing what I was expecting.  Very clean and nice looking pizzeria. First real Chicago deep dish, like what I've seen on TV.  Very delicious and recommand over any other type of pizza.  I always knew I was going to love chicago style over NY, etc. If you're trying to watch what you eat, lol, well this place isn't for you, this is a hearty place to eat, monster slices of deep dish pizza. They do offer a thin crust pizza but event this a monster.
