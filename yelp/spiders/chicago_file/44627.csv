Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had zero issues with this place - the food was very good. I was with a group of 5 so I really don't even remember what we ordered. Definitely way too many tapas and a 2 serving order of the chicken paella (REALLY frickin' good) and a pitcher of sangria. Our server was pretty awesome too, and I loved how we could order a couple tapas at a time so to not get food overload by getting them all at once. The sangria was top notch too - I won the "who can refill her glass the most" contest. Hehe. Tapas are generally on the pricey side, but all said and done we split the bill evenly and I didn't feel ripped off at all! Unfortunately, I was only visiting Chicago so I can't really go back regularly, but I definitely recommend this place!
