Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The best way to summarize the Cafe Baba Reeba experience for us would be - energetic vibe, small plates but very affordable, great sangria and quick service. In my opinion thats a lot of good reasons to try this place. But if I were to rate the quality of food alone I wasnt really impressed. Except for the Brussel sprout salad which was great, everything else was just above average. If I were to give you 2 tips, they would be 1.Order atleast 3 plates per person in order to feel full and 2. Get the sangria pitcher.
