Smoque BBQ////The Baby Back ribs are incredible! And that chopped brisket sandwich was the sh#t! None of the sides disappointed, I think it is BYOB so next time I am bringing a Scrimshaw Pilsner with me. And the people were so nice and seem to really feel how the customer's where enjoying the BBQ. Awesome place and I can't recommend it enough for rub they use on those baby back ribs.
