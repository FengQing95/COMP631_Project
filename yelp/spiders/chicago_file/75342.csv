Little Goat Diner////I have only eaten here once, but had a solid experience and liked it enough to consider hosting a private event here. The staff for private events has been delightful to work with -- they're super attentive (respond quickly and accurately), and are willing to work with you to make the whole process easier -- from reviewing date options to coming in to tour the place. LGD has made our short list for our event and we're looking forward to hopefully working with them soon.
