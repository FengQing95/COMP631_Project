Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////DEEP DISH PIZZA: the pizza came out a little underdone.  I would have liked the dough to be more cooked, but it came out a little doughy and floury.  The menu does say you can request the pizza your way but I didn't know what standard was but if I knew it was undercooked pizza i would have requested it be well done dough.
