Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Yup, this is thee best deep dish pizza in the city, hands down. That buttery corn bread crust and the tangy tomato sauce hits the spot every time! If you're looking for a place to take out of towners, this is the spot!! I also love their frozen pizzas, they honestly taste just as good as eating it there!
