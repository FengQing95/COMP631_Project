Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Enter our server, Tonya, or was it Terry? Right off the bat she looked stressed. Was she overwhelmed with such a large group to tend to? Who knows. She made it clear that she was in a hurry and not in any position to be polite. My colleague is Vegan so we asked if they had Vegan options on the menu. No, the pizza is not vegan. We then asked about the bruschetta. Her reply, and I quote, "are you always this annoying, or is it just today?" My head exploded! Because I was with work colleagues I didn't snap. I wasn't the only one who kept mum. Tonya/Terry really didn't want to ask about the bread. In a tone that was forthright, yet polite, I requested that she ask the kitchen about the Bruschetta, just to be sure. She did. Anyway, the bruschetta wasn't vegan. I forget what my colleague ordered.
