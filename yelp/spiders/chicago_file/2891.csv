The Purple Pig////My husband and I sat at the bar for lunch and really enjoyed our food. We had the ham croquettes and the pork jowl.  The croquettes were delicious- extremely flavorful and lightly fried goodness. The pork jowl was melt in your mouth tasty and a perfect choice for brunch with that sunnyside up egg on top. Super yummy!  The one thing that disappointed me was the bartender that recommended a white wine which upon receiving our bill, was $27 per glass! We were shocked. All in all, a decent experience.
