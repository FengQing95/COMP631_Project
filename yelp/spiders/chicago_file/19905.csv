Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Five stars for restoring my faith in Chicago deep dish.  Get the Chicago Classic with butter crust, and add garlic.  The sausage they use is divine.  The butter crust is PERFECT.  The garlic on top made everything so much better.  It took a long time to get a table even at 9pm, but when we FINALLY made it inside and were seated, we were not disappointed by the food.  Thanks for making my last pizza in Chicago memorable!
