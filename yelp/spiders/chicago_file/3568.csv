The Purple Pig////Amazing meal. We waited for ~2 hours on a Friday night. But the food was worth it. I forget exactly what we ordered but I do remember the pork belly being the winner of the show. And the octopus was pretty amazing. Service is great and wine selection is good. Definitely will revisit when in town again.
