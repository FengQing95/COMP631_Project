Little Goat Diner////I've only been here for lunch a few times. All the sandwich options are generous portions- the turkey club is a safe but tasty sandwich (I always take half home). Everyone always likes their selected sandwiches, too. The chickpea salad is not your typical salad, and I appreciate that when I want a "lighter" lunch, but don't want to be hungry after. The falafels are amazing and flavorful.. my only mistake was putting too much of the dressing in (my fault, but it made the salad too citrusy). Can't wait to try the creole chicken sandwich next time!
