Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Lastly the food...... Can I say outstanding???? The bone marrow is perfect! We split the bone and ribeye steak! It was tender, tasty, flavorful, and cooked to perfection!  We also had the oysters! I wish I ordered more they were addicting! Lastly,  had the duck goat cheese as an appetizer and it was delicious!!
