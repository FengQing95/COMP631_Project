Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Oh my lord.. it was good.  Living in San Diego all of my life, I've never really had authentic deep dish pizza.  So visiting Chicago, binging on deep dish pizza was a must and I have to say my first ever experience was amazing.  We ordered a small pie which was perfect for a pair of extremely famished out-of-towners (and I wish places in San Diego offered that) with mushroom, spinach and pepperoni, that's the winning combo right there.
