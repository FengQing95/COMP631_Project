Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////- As for the food, mediocre. Granted, I was feeling a little ill that day and ordered something simple, which was fine. My dining companions both had the cinnamon spice pumpkin pancakes and felt they would have been better off at IHOP. Again, nothing wrong with the food... but to wait 45 minutes for a table for this food? Definitely not worth it.
