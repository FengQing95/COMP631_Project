Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pretty solid spot! While I think I still love NY pizza more, this was some delicious pizza. I came in on a Thursday afternoon and it was a little dead so grabbed a seat at the bar. The bartender was great, we talked for quite a bit and he gave me some solid Chicago tips and what to order there.
