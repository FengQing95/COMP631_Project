Art Institute of Chicago////The most popular attraction is the impressionist gallery, by far. Anyone who hasn't lived in a cave for their entire lives would know the artists here (Cezanne, Monet, Renoir, etc.) and be able to see numerous works by each. The gallery is also home to Seurat's A Sunday on La Grande Jatte, as well as many, many other famous pieces.
