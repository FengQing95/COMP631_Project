Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My least favorite aspect of the meal was the crust. And before you get all judgy let me say I had deep dish the day before and didn't need to have it two days in a row, so I did get the thin crust pizza, but it had no flavor in my opinion. I got the Lou on a thin crust, so I asked for their signature just without the deep dish. I thought at least the favor of the toppings would've been good but all I could taste was the cardboard of crust.
