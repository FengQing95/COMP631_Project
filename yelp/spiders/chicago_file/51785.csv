Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba quite a few times. Half off wine in Tuesday's is absolutely amazing (especially in the city). The goat cheese app here is to die for. The sangria is also top notch. I love the Spanish tapas idea and all the selections are nothing short of fantastic.
