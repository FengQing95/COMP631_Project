The Purple Pig////Amazing dining experience. Seating is first come first serve. I was solo on a work trip, and even on Valentine's Day, I did not have to wait for a table and was seated right away. Josie was my server. She was hospitable, well informed. She gave fantastic service and fantastic recommendations. I love tapas, but am often left wanting more. This WAS NOT the case here. Portions were extremely generous for the style. The only downside to this was I was hoping to taste several more things, but I was stuffed! I asked for a dry acidic white wine and Josie recommended the Albari√±o, which was fantastic. I am not capturing the full names of menu items, but I had the tongue, the artichoke, and the Spanish octopus. It's hard to choose a favorite, but I think it'd choose the tongue. Each dish has a rich flavor profile and was presented beautifully. The Purple Pig served as an excellent dining treat!
