The Purple Pig////I was eager to try the bone marrow (I love bone marrow).  Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations.  It was very rich, yet bland, (is that possible).  It was accompanied with some greasy toasted bread.  The marrow is greasy enough, why was the bread greasy?  In fairness, it probably would have been better, if we were a party of 4 or maybe 6.  It was too much for two people and became a burden to eat.
