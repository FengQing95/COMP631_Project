Little Goat Diner////This is one of my favorite places for brunch/breakfast.  The food is far from basic (e.g. hash browns with goat cheese in them) and some of the best coffee in town served here.  I love the goat branding throughout (clearly a marketing genius works here).  I love going here for special occasion breakfast/brunch events.
