Smoque BBQ////The long line outside the place tells you only one thing - good food. You just have to be patient enough in order to get it. I went there with three friends and everyone was happy except me. I found that there was too much paprika in the bbq sauce but my friends liked it so I think that I'm one of the few people who didn't find it exceptional.
