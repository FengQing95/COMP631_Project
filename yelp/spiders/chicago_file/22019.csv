Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Very slow service. The pizza was okay. I got a thin crust pepperoni. We were going to order a cookie thing for dessert and the waitress said to wait to order it because it takes less than 10 minutes. We ordered it later (per her suggestion) and she said "okay but it's going to take 20-25 minutes". When she brought the bill I gave her my card and didn't even look at it and told her we were in a hurry. She stopped at three other tables on the way to run my card and one table on the way back. I know that we were not her only table but she was taking forever with everything. We were the ones on the back burner.
