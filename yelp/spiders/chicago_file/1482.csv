Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I totally agree that this place lives up to the hype! My bf and I came here for brunch on a Saturday morning. We waited approximately 30 minutes for a table and it was well worth our time! The vanilla berry latte and honey toffee nut latte we had were amazing! We shared the signatura berry bliss pancake as well as the veggie omelette with hashbrown and they were both very delicious! Also, despite the busy traffic, service was satisfactory. Highly recommend this place!
