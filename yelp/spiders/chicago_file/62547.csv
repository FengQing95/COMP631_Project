Smoque BBQ////When it comes to a corner BBQ, well outside of downtown and in the true neighborhoods of Chi-Town - this place is as real as it gets. Being from Michigan, a BYOB spot like this in Chi Town is a real delight. You wouldn't believe the looks I got when me and my crew showed up here with full top shelf rack of bottles (Grey Goose, Black Label, Bacardi Rum, etc.) and boy did we forget about the liquor when we got the food. I got the 1/2 Slab STL ribs and 1/2 Slab Baby Back Ribs combo for about $20. BOY DID IT HIT THE SPOT. The meat was just plain divine - tender, juicy, fell right off the bones - drenched in sauces made in the heavens.
