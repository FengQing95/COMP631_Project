The Purple Pig////I was told that the wait would be unbelievably long, especially at peak times, but at nearly 6pm on a Friday they were able to seat two of us for dinner immediately. I wouldn't recommend trying to accommodate a large party here. Bottom Line: come here with a friend (but just one) and try the beets!
