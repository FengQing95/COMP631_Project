Little Goat Diner////This place was fantastic! Ended up here after the wait at Au Cheval was 2 hours. Was seated right away and our waitress was super friendly and helped us navigate the menu. Traditional diner that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner all day long. I orders the Reuben sandwich and the compadres I was with ordered the goat almighty burger and the bullseye French toast. We were all blown away by our meals. The quote "this burger is the best I've ever had in my life" was uttered several times.
