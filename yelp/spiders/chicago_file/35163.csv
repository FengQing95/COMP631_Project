Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came here for our first "good meal" out and double date for 2014. It was cold and snowy, but we had these reservations for months so I was excited.  It was packed and def a happening spot - nice décor and sexy lighting.  The tables are little too close together for my liking though.
