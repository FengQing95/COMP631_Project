Smoque BBQ////- Sliced brisket: juicy, tender and covered with excellent bark. I only needed my fork to cut it, but honestly, it was so tender a stiff breeze probably would have done the job. It's served with a thinner, somewhat tart sauce that balances the rich smokiness of the beef (no need to drown it in sauce, a little dab will do the job).
