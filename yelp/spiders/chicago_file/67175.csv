Little Goat Diner////I got the kimchi egg bacon asian thingy dish - it came with a crepe and a tangy sauce to dip the "thingy" in, some sprinkled scallions and it was just a mushy goodness.  I LOVED IT.  But you must love kimchi for you to like this dish - it's a korean marinated cabbage.  My husband got an all american burger - happy cow, with some veggies - he said it melted in his mouth ( Oh and it reminded him of In&Out burger in Cali - SOLD!).  We also got the fried pickles/onions appetizer - a MUST when you dine there.  And also smokey fries - meh, I don't know if we were just super full or the fries were just not anything super special or maybe our expectations were SO unbelievably high by the time fries came...not sure.
