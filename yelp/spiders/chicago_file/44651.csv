Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This time we had the Goat Cheese and Tomato sauce with bread was excellent as always.  The Meatballs with Sherry sauce were spicier than I remember, but really good.  The Beef Tenderloin with Blue Cheese was great, but only two pieces of meat seemed kind of chintzy for $11.  Last we had a Salmon special of the day that was also good.
