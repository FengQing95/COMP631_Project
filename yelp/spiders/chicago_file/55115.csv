Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Delicious dishes that may seem small at first but are quite filling. Definitely try the bacon wrapped dates and the flan if you're into flan that isn't just a sweet but has a nice dense texture. If you're travelling, the front desk allows you to keep luggage in their area. The place is decorated rusticly and is quite an appealing match with the surrounding condos and houses. Definitely worth the time and money as we were able to fill two stomachs for a little less than $30 before tip on a Sunday morning brunch.
