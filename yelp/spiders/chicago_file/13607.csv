Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////People will talk on and on about their stuffed pizza - which is great don't get me wrong - but I don't think the thin crust gets enough love.  It's a hangover recipe in a box and is basically my Sunday go to meal.  But that's not to discredit this place - I've gone many times and have never been disappointed.  A great representation of Chicago pizza.
