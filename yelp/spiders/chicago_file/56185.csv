Smoque BBQ////I ordered the half St. Louis ribs with mac and cheese and fries and he ordered the full baby back ribs with fries and mac and cheese. In a word, delicious. We have been talking about going here for months and the built up anticipation was definitely worth it! The ribs were meaty and practically fell of the bone. The sauce was tangy and great for dipping fries. The mac and cheese was amazing. I am kind of a snob when it comes to mac and cheese.  I can't stand the boxed stuff and this was far from that.  The portion for the mac and cheese was on the small side but I am not complaining.  Even with the half order, I still had lunch for Saturday.
