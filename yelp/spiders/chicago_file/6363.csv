The Purple Pig////A super popular joint so we had to try it. Cool ambiance, pretty hipster. I loved the roasted beets, so good! The squid ink pasta was bland for my taste. The cheesecake was huge! Can definitely share with 2-4 people depending how much you want to eat. It's different, it's made from goat cheese and you can taste it. I still don't know how I feel about it. Service was extremely fast. Their menu is meant to be shared, tapas style except the portions are pretty big. I'd come back.
