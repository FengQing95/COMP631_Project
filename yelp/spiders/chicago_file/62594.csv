Smoque BBQ////Now about the pork. The pulled pork is tasty and has a nice caramelized edge which is mixed in with the pulled meat. The sauces are more vinegary than sweet and tomatoey, which is how I like them. I usually don't eat the sweet thick sauces most places serve, but I will have the sharper sauces at Smoque. As for ribs, I prefer the St. Louis ribs because I think that cut has more flavor. These are not parboiled, fall off the bone ribs. These are smoked, gotta-tug-a-little ribs with a good dry rub and not too sweet. Good stuff, but not the sweet saucy stuff served at other places. Chicken is good, not dry, but I prefer beef and pork for BBQ.
