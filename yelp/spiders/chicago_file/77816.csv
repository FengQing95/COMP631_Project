Little Goat Diner////+ Shrimp, Pork Belly, Zucchini and Shrimpy Noodles - Aside from the tender, tasty pork belly, this was unpalatable. I was shocked by this horrible rendition of an Asian-inspired dish (would not have gotten it if it had said that on the menu) - the noodles and veggies were drowning in ginger and soy sauce. The shrimp was overcooked and the veggies were ruined by the overpowering sauce.
