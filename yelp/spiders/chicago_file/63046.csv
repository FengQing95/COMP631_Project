Smoque BBQ////A few things to note, I wish there were more BBQ sauce options. The meal came with just one. For a BBQ place that's kinda not too legit. Also, I felt a bit rushed when I was eating. The line was long, and the busboys were running around cleaning plates... I guess a better option is to take your yummy food goodness to go so you can eat at your own pace at home. I can't wait to come back.
