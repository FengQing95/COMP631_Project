Art Institute of Chicago////Beautiful art museum with a great art collection. Helpful staff in every room. There is so much to see so please dedicate at least 2-3 hrs and yet that was still not enough time for us. We grabbed a bite to eat prior to arriving but they do have a cute cafe and restaurant. Don't miss out on visiting. You will truly be amazed.
