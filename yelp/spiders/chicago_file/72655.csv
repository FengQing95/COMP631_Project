Little Goat Diner////Love this place!!! Every time I go here I am never disappointed. The wait can be long during brunch time on the weekends, and the customer service isn't the best, but overall I have always enjoyed my experience. Most recently I ordered the pork belly pancake. So delicious that I went back a couple weeks later to order it again... Actually writing this review about it is making me crave it...
