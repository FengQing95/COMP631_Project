Smoque BBQ////DAMN good slaw. I believe I am the slaw nazi because I am always critical of it, and I don't like vinegar based so much, but boy do they know what they are doing. Simple. One type of cabbage chopped not shredded like crazy, and some thinly sliced red onion. Little bit of pepper the slightly vinegary base, can't go wrong. Not drenched not too peppery. Only complaint was that I wanted MORE! 5/5
