Little Goat Diner////After sampling some of the Los Drowned, I felt a little let down by my choice: the Korean kilgus goat burger. I decided to try it because I thought the kick would be perfect for a bitingly cold day. Although I was not surprised by how well the meat was cooked, I was expecting a more well-rounded flavor. While I do enjoy kimchee, it simply overpowered this burger.
