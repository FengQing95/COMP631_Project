Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is the best steakhouse in Chicago with a romantic atmosphere. Anything you order is so delicious! The service is awesome. They got my order wrong, but they brought out the correct one in a short amount of time and they were SO nice about it. They have a new policy where you can only make reservations 30 days in advance. It's a good thing because I couldn't get in last year for my birthday. There is always a seat at the bar if the wait time is long.
