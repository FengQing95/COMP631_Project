Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was at Cafe Baba Reeba last week on a date.  Liked it so much I'm back for brunch.  Loved the brunch specials thanks to our server Patrick for his recommendations.  He was very knowledgeable and provided us with great service.  With that saying I told the manager how Patrick made our brunch experience an enjoyable one.  Food was made to perfection.  Portions were enough for my friend and I.  And the build your own Bloody Mary!!! Oh my that was fun how we can be creative by adding all the garnishes they provided.  Thanks again  but I just wish you can be in the west burbs :(
