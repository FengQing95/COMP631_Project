Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've been living in Chicago majority of my life and I have to say that Lou Malnati's is C+ pizza at best. It honestly depends on what you want, they are good for office parties and if you have a group that wants something fast and easy. My company orders from here whenever we have an event and they deliver fast and on-time. They just deliver C+ plus pizza really well. If you want mind blowing pizza keep looking but if your office is having a pizza party this place is Â an ok choice.
