Smoque BBQ////Order your food off the wall, pay, and wait for a table to open up, most likely next to some strangers, but that's ok!  Service is great.  The workers are super nice and helpful and make sure you have a table when your food comes up.  Everything we ordered was absolutely great.  I love bbq but usually am not a fan of pulled pork and brisket and the like because it's usually either too dry or too saucy, but it was excellent here.
