Little Goat Diner////This review is just for the Pork Belly Pancake ($12) - after reading all of the raving Yelp reviews for it I knew I had to order it.  I found the whole dish to be very greasy.  I know that pork belly is fatty, but it was an oily pancake with a piece of fat on top and some salad.  I don't think the flavors tasted special or blended particularly well, and the whole thing was just overwhelmed by grease.    Disappointing.
