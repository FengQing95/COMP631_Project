Art Institute of Chicago////The customer service was helpful.The information desk provided me with great help. But however this one young man who's working at the blue desk near the modern art section was the opposite. My wife and I split up after I went to the restroom. But unfortunately i ran out of battery. So I went to the young man working at the blue desk to ask him is I can use the phone in his station to call my wife. I asked him "may I use one of your phones to call my wife?" And he gave me an attitude and said "I'm not going allow you to use this phone". He answered me with a harsh attitude. I was shocked. So I went to the front desk to request to use a phone and this old gentleman who works at the front desk gave me his personal phone to call on. I thanked him so much for allowing me to use his phone. Shouts out to him
