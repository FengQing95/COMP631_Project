Little Goat Diner////So after hearing about Little Goat 100 times... my husband and I finally decided to see what this place was all about. They don't take reservations... so there was a bit of wait (20 mins) which is fine because they have a bar there for those who want to drink.. and they also take your number and text you when your tables ready... so you can walk outside if you want to.
