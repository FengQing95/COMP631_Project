Little Goat Diner////The waitress was welcoming, but in terms of helpfulness when I asked about her recommendations since it was our first time there, I didn't think she elaborated enough about their popular dishes or seasonal offers. That said, she did advise us to narrow down to about 3 choices, then she would be able to make further suggestion. So, that was a great alternative.
