Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Upon arriving at our table he gave us a quick rundown, and informed us that *****all of the pizzas take around 45 minutes to cook*****.   I don't think that's a problem, but it is certainly something you want to take into consideration.  We heard other servers ask if their patrons had called ahead, so this is probably a regular practice to avoid the extended cooking time.  We ordered a Malnati Salad, Three-Cheese Bread, and The Malnati Chicago Classic.
