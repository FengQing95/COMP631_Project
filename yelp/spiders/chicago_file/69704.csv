Little Goat Diner////The coffee bar and bread shop are perfect for stopping in to pick up a cup of Stumptown coffee (hands down the best brew in the neighborhood now) or loaf of bread to go, and they also have an assortment of goodies to poke through, from locally made honey and soap to fresh flowers. If you're waiting for a table and you can edge in a spot at the bar, it's worth it.
