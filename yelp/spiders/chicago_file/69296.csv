Little Goat Diner////My friend and I also opted to share the smoked BBQ french fries.  We had to send our first batch back, because we barely had any fries.  Just a massive pile of french fry crumbs.  The second batch was better, but I am not a fan of shoe string fries, and for that reason, these left me wanting for more.  I love hearty food, and there were just a few elements that fell short with this diner fare.
