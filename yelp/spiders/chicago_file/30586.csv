Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////To be fair I was one of a party of 13 arriving for a 9pm dinner reservation. I stress reservation, to point out that the purpose of scheduling one is to be prepared for guests. I digress. The restaurant was not ready. We hovered around the door for a few minutes, then escorted upstairs to two tables that would only accommodate a portion of our party. It wasn't until another table of two left that we were able to add our other three members to the group. Fine. No big deal.
