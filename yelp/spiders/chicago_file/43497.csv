Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The last time I came in, about a month ago, it was for my bachelorette party.  The sangria flowed, we ate to our heart's content, and the bill was reasonable (and I put it all on my lettuce entertain you frequent diner card- NICE).  Service was efficient and friendly.  We had a reservation so  we didn't have any wait time.  I'd recommend  the queso de cabra, tortilla, dates, croquetas- it's all quite good.
