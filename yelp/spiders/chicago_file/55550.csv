Smoque BBQ////I've eaten at the restaurant and had catering, both experiences were equally good in terms of the food which is a hard feat to pull off.  The ribs are outstanding, some of the best I've had in the city. The cornbread is also one of their better items.  The rest of the pulled meat items are tasty but if you lined them up against others in the city they wouldn't come out ahead, no differentiator. Really solid place but for the hype and the time you can find equal places for cheaper with no wait.
