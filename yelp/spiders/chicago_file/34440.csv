Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Dessert: Despite being stuffed, we couldn't help but try the Whiskey Ice Cream. Let's just say the portion size was more than generous. Extremely rich and delicious flavor that tasted like a mix between chocolate, carmel and Ovaltine (yes, the malted milk drink from your childhood). And I mean that in the best way possible. Absolutely necessary to try.
