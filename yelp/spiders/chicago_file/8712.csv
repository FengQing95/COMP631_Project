Art Institute of Chicago////The modern wing is absolutely beautiful.  I love modern architecture and looking down the main corridor of the modern wing reminded me of the warp core of the Enterprise from Original Trek except really bright and white and fantastic.  If you turn around, you get a view of Millennium park through these huge windows and it's just wonderful.
