Art Institute of Chicago////Kudos to museum for expanding further into different types of art, from contemporary to modern, etc. Maybe you are thinking, so what if they have famous paintings or old sculptures. But ask yourself where else can you see an original Seurat that's over Â a 100 yrs old within a foot away. Or stare endlessly into Picasso's The Old Guitarist and wonder what the heck was he thinking.
