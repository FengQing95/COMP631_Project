Smoque BBQ////My favorite bbq in Chicago. Brisket, St Louis and babyback ribs are amazing. Their rub and sauce combined with the tender meat is to die for. Sides are on the smaller side, but are also tasty. I'm a fan of the cornbread, mac and cheese and chili. It's byob, so take advantage of that. Come early because it gets packed during peak hours, or order take out!
