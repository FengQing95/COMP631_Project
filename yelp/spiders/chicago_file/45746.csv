Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There were 4 of us so we got a few different kinds of sangria. We got the white peach, regular red and blackberry. The blackberry was a little sweet for us but that didn't stop us from finishing all 3 half pitchers! And I like that you can get half pitchers to try different flavors. They even have seasonal flavors which I think is really cool.
