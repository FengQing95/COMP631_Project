Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Did I mention they allow BYOB? Yes it's an awesome policy: Bring your own bottle of wine and there is no corking fee as long as you share a glass with another table. We were smiling as our waiter presented a glass to a couple we met while waiting for our table. Everybody wins!
