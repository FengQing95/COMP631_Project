Smoque BBQ////I went in there on a Saturday night and man oh man was it packed. The line was all the way to the entrance. That definitely turned me off right away but holy shit the smell alone in that place and seeing everyone munch made me wanna stay. It took about 20 minutes total to get a table and start eating but it was definitely worth the wait. It was super chaotic in there but the staff was really good about getting people tables and cleaning up quickly after people were done.
