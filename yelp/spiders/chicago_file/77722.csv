Little Goat Diner////As a huge Top Chef fan, I was so excited to come here. I went for breakfast on a weekend, so there was a pretty long wait. I didn't mind too much because I expected it, but it's never fun to wait. They don't take reservations, so you have to be prepared for that. I got the Elvis waffles & they blew me away. It's not often that breakfast food really gets you, but holy crap was it good!
