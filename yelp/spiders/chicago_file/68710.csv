Little Goat Diner////The family decided to eat here before a Blackhawks game on a Friday. We'd made a reservation for 4:45 on opentable but it wasn't necessary at that time. We pulled up to the restaurant and parked in a no parking zone (totally misread the signs...we're suburbanites you know) but luckily didn't get a ticket or get towed.  Valet parking is $12 (I think).  It is a really cool, decent sized diner.  It has lots of light and the windows open when it's warmer. We were seated immediately and our server was at our table within 2 minutes.  They have a good beer list with a lot of local breweries. Our server was knowledgeable about beer and liked our choices.  After he took our drunk order we really started looking at the menu. It is a diverse and eclectic menu.  I decided to go with the shrimp and grits, our daughter ordered the sourdough pancakes, son ordered the blueberry pancakes and my hubby got something with kimchi, pancakes and other ingredients but I don't remember what it was.  Everything was good however I've had better shrimp and grits and my son thought there were way too many blueberries in his pancakes (there weren't, they were very good). Overall it was a fun experience with great service, good craft beer and some tasty food. It is a little pricey for a diner so be prepared.
