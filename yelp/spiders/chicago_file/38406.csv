Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As good as the food is, the Sodikoff experience pays equal parts tribute to the grandeur of dining, and Bavette's is no different. Note that coming by a reservation is about as difficult as not encountering a wait at Au Cheval. We managed to snag a 5:15-er, and within minutes of seating, the place was packed. Good luck there. If you can get it, though, you're treated to that rich mahogany fine dining experience without the pretension to back it up. One of the coolest things (of which we did not partake, preferring to stick to cocktails) about Bavette's is its hidden corkage fee. You can BYOB, with the only stipulation that you share a glass with another table. It's that kind of cool.
