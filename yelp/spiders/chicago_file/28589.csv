Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got the Lou. This is the first time I've had Lou's in about 15 years. I wanted to double check my latest opinion that Giordano's was better. Last time when I had Lou Malnati's the group ordered sausage and I wasn't a fan of the huge patty of sausage on the pizza. A bit too much for me. This time getting the Lou, which is all veggies I enjoyed it much more.
