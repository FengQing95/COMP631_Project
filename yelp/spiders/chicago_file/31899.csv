Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////- What brought this rating down was primarily the wait. Luckily we were sat rather early, but we were told it could be much longer. They also recommended that we order prior to being seated because it can take up to an hour! We were about to order but was then sat, and the food sadly did that that long.
