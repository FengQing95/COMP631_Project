Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////One of the musts when in Chicago is to have a traditional deep dish pizza. We asked around to everyone we met and they all recommended Lou Malnati's Pizzeria for real deep dish. We weren't disappointed, we ordered the "Malnati Chicago Classic" and it was simply delicious and I couldn't get enough of it. A must when you're visiting Chicago... My gut thanks god I don't live near one.
