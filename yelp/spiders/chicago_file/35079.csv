Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Just came home from Bavette's steakhouse in Chicago.  It was amazing.  I was thinking of you, you'd have loved it.  42 day dry aged bone-in ribeye perfectly cooked served with a spicy corn and the best creamed spinach.  But first we started with beef tongue that was so tender I cut mine with a butter knife...the meat gave no resistance but had great texture.  After the tongue we got shrimp and bone marrow.  You would have been very happy with this marrow and the shrimp were awesome.  Then came the steak and such.  My buddy and I sat at the bar (Joel the bartender was killer) and it was about as good as it gets.  Serious s*** bro.
