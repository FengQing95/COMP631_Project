Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Let's start with the vibe- there is a line to get in at 5pm on a Tuesday which means it must be good. Upon walking in we we able to snag a table by the bar with no reservations. Our waiter was a true rockstar. One of our guests has some food allergies and before we even ordered he asked if there were any allergies, preferences or favorites at the table.
