The Purple Pig////Don't get me wrong, the restaurant is super busy! We also had to wait 30 mins for a table for 2. However, we did find our service from our waitress really rushed, so fast that the menu and highlights were just blurted out. (The reason we decided 4/5). Maybe it was our particular waitress, who just wanted to accommodate guests really fast and have people go in and out? At one point we saw her bringing guests who were waiting outside to have them seated (mind you, there are 2 other hostess at the front). It was just odd towards the end of the meal as she didn't realize that we actually finished all 3 dishes by the time she came back to check in on us and asked how our first dish was?
