Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Here are the only adjustments I would make: 1) The Muzak/ Cool Jazz piped over the sound system is AWFUL. Here you've built this gorgeous new restaurant, it's furnishings are homey yet with a distinctly modern twist, and all of a sudden the Muzak makes me feel like I'm in an old folks home. It doesn't jive. Second, I was given enough hashbrowns for 3 people which is great if you love hasbrowns, but they could maybe ease up on the portions of potatoes- I felt guilty letting so much go to waste.
