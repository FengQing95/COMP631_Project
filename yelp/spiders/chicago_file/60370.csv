Smoque BBQ////Room for improvement?  The meat was cooked to perfection, but the sauce wasn't very memorable.  And like countless other bbq places, Smoque would do well to put some more effort into their bread/buns.  Some average bread won't spoil the meat here, but the right kind will make it divine.  Cooper's is a good example of a place that has embraced this concept.
