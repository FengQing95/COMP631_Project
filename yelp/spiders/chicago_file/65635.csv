Smoque BBQ////Just got our take out order and almost everyone's meal was delicious (the overall favorite was the chicken). My sliced brisket was super fatty, though, so I called to tell them it was a funky portion. I don't know what I expected, but I haven't had customer service this gracious and friendly in what feels like forever. I really appreciate Maria's kindness and told her we can't wait to come back again soon!
