Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had a team dinner here and the food and service was excellent! I had heard great things about the cuisine prior to coming so I had high expectations, and I'd say they solidly delivered. My coworkers were all pleased with their steaks, there was an abundance of delicious savory sides, and I was a fan of the salmon dish! Overall, the brussel sprouts were probably the best dish we ordered, as they were super flavorful without being too salty.
