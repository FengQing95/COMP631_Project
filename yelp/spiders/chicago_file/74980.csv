Little Goat Diner////We were visiting from California, a foodie friend had given us a list of restaurants to hit up. Little Goat was on the top of the list. Great atmosphere, def need reservations glad I made them. Somewhat Loud, hip dive-ish type place. Food is nothing short of spectacular. Everything sounded, looked and smelled. We loved our server Sarah great energy and genuine (she looked and spoke just like Emma Stone lol) I asked her what she liked and she was no help at all of course cause she confirmed that everything was amazing lol we went with the special Blue Plate salmon and my wife had pork belly with shrimp both on Sarah's recommendation. Absolutely delicious! Cooked to perfection! Will certainly be back again when we visit Chicago. Do yourself a favor and don't miss out!
