Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm not really into having a lot of vegetables on my pizza but I love the veggie pizza from here, they call it the Lou.  It comes in deep dish and thin crust.  Personally I think the thin crust is better.  The other pizzas are good too but the Lou thin crust is my favorite.  If you go you should try it.
