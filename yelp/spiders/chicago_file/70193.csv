Little Goat Diner////Finally got a reservation here. Definitely a brunch for people who are foodies. I ordered the Spiced apple and granola oatmeal, it was awful. Not visually appealing and the texture/flavors was totally off. Our server was not very helpful, going to this place for brunch is definitely more outside your average brunch place. Again If you're a "foodie" you fit in, but for those that aren't it would've been nice to have more help from the waiter when we asked questions.
