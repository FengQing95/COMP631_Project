Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////After a long day of traveling, I was ready for two things: a solid cocktail, and great food. Chicago has no shortage of excellent places to go, but the bavette has always been my favorite cut of meat, so I figured that was a sign. I wasn't disappointed. Excellent food (the meatloaf is dry-aged beef and pork shoulder, the mashed potatoes are divine, and the wild mushrooms and brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly), the cognac sazerac was lovely, and the wine list is impressive. I'd happily return to Bavette.
