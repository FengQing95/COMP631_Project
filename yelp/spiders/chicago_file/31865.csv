Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got in just before the true dinner rush (thank goodness).  We were able to order our pizzas from the hostess stand while we waited on our table.  Brilliant to minimize wait times on the pizza! We shared the Malnati salad while we waited on our pizzas.  It was delicious.  The veggies tasted fresh the contrast of salty salami and the bit of the gorgonzola dressing were a match made in heaven.  Our pizzas arrived shortly after we finished with our salad.  It was hot and melty and exactly what my tastebuds needed!  I ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic (Made with Lou's lean sausage, some extra mozzarella cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust) and added pepperoni, onions, and black olives.  It was the perfect combination!  The crust was flaky and truly buttery. It has the perfect amount of sauce and the additional toppings were just the right flavor combo.
