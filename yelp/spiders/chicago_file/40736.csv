Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////all the items we ordered were so delicious and flavorful.  i called for a reservation in the morning and was not able to get one for saturday evening so we went and sat in the bar area.  the service around the bar tables were very slow, but utlimately since the food was so excellent we were fine with the absent server.  definitely would go back.
