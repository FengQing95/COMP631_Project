Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The portions are HUGE...even though I got the fruit instead of the hash browns.  He finished his entire plate, half the pancakes, and one of my benedicts while I got through the other one and part of his omelette.  The chorizo on the benedict was amazing....everything was great and delicious ESPECIALLY the wildberry orange juice.  definitely recommend that.
