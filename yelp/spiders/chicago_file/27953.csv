Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////WHO doesn't put cheese on a pizza????? Wouldn't you have to specifically say no cheese? Isn't cheese on a pizza like peanut butter & jelly, milk & cookies, etc. Some things are just expected to go together? Who is this mystery person that doesn't get this elemental fact about a pizza?
