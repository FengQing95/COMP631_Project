Smoque BBQ////Another visit, another spectacular meal!  Arrived around 4 on Saturday.  A little early for dinner but this guarantees we will find parking in the lot in back and not encounter much of a line.  Having said that, the few times we have found a line, these guys manage the tables so well that by the time you order your food, your table is waiting.  As usual, Barry Sorkin was at 'his post' next to the order counter keeping an eye on things.  When he saw a customer carrying his tray back to the counter, he sprang into action to see what the issue was.  Within seconds he had returned the tray to the customer and appeared to have resolved the issue.  The two guys at the table next to us were impressed with our BYOB preparations.  Beer for my gf, wine for her father, and rum for my Coke.  They complimented us on our BYOB choices.   Thanks to other Yelpers, I asked Barry about the candied jalapenos and he was quick to oblige with the peppers and spicy sauce as well.  I'm hooked on the brisket sauce but I tried the spicy just the same.  It is a little thicker (tomato base) and has a little kick to it.  I'll stick with the regular brisket sauce.  The candied jalapenos were outstanding!!  Who would have thought that brisket and jalapenos would be a good match?  Wow!! But then, I like peppers on everything.  Hopefully the peppers will be a regular offering.   No need to look elsewhere in Chicago for brisket, this place is the real deal.
