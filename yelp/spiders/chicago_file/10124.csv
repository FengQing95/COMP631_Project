Art Institute of Chicago////I've longed to visit this museum for years, and the Magritte provided the perfect prompt. We were greeted by the amazing architecture (not to mention the lions) and helpful staff. This just set the perfect tone for a day of Magritte, everyone's favorite surrealist. The exhibit is truly mind-bendingly wonderful (and mind-bending in general). We all enjoyed the exhibit and the others moving through at the same time seemed to be just as gripped as we were.
