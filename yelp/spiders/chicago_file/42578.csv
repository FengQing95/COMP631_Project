Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba features a vast array of tapas and breaks them into categories including pintxos (bite sized tapas, kind of like a Spanish amuse bouche but harder to pronounce), vegetarian/cheese, seafood, beef/lamb, and chicken/pork. There are also a few nice paellas to choose from and housemade breads with dips (there is also complimentary basic bread service with olive oil) and of course desserts (there are full sized desserts of dessert pintxos). Sangria is quite popular here (available by the pitcher, half pitcher or glass and in traditional or flavored - there is even a Cava based Sangria); for those not fans of Sangria there is a decent list of reasonably priced Spanish wines (running as low as $28 per bottle and many selections under $50) as well as beer (including some on tap) and cocktails. Adding value there are often freebies you can redeem if you check in via Foursquare or Yelp.
