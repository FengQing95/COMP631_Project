Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Iberico seems a bit more authentic and it is also cheaper. However, if you live in Lincoln Park, Ba-Ba-Reeba is another good option. Get the bacon wrapped dates! They're delicious. They also have a lot of different sangria options here. I haven't had anything bad here and the service is generally pretty good, I just personally prefer Cafe Iberico.
