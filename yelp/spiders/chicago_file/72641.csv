Little Goat Diner////It was dinner time, several weeks after my first encounter with the little goat, but I still had their breakfast on the brain. So I ordered the Fat Elvis Waffles - I ate the entire dish, and walked out feeling like fat Elvis (a quite happy, fat Elvis, to boot). They were amazing - thick, crispy, and with plenty of luscious peanut butter butter to smear all over them. Topped with sliced banana and maple bacon syzurp. Positively delectable.
