Smoque BBQ////This place used to be a weekly stop for me and my family.  Im very displeased to have seen what i have because we loved their food so much however i can no longer subject my family to the sub par cleanliness smoques employees have.  When we were walking into the restaurant we witnessed one of there employees oht back with his hand inside his pants scratching himself.  He went so far as to inspect the underside of his fingernail after he was finished to see what it was he had picked off.  By the time it took me and my family to walk to the door and enter this employee had already assumed his position behind the counter and was handling meat.  He was the ONLY one there without gloves on, probably because he forgot but it was clear that he hadnt had enough time to wash his hands prior.  He was a very large heavy set man and when i pointed it out the employee at the register she apologized with a smile and thanked me for the info.  I do believe a supervisor overheard the convo but we left before anything was done, if they did anything.  This truly upsets me because this is probably  the best bbq in the city.
