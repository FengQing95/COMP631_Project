Smoque BBQ////Really, really good BBQ - probably some of the best if not the best I've had.  Flavorful and wonderful combo of moist yet smokey, sweet, and crisp on the edges - BBQ perfection is what I'd call this.  And their coleslaw is the best anywhere - crispy with a wonderfully sweet vinegar taste - yum!  I would have given them 5 stars but there is only so far you can go with BBQ food - that and the communal tables were a bit of a turn-off, but for BBQ this good - I'll be back for sure and I'll bring more friends next time !  If you are a fan of good traditional BBQ - you must try Smoque BBQ !
