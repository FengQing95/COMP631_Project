Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Then we ordered the Shortrib Stroganoff, Aged Bone In Ribeye with Roquefort, Creamed Spinach, and a Loaded Baked Potato. My favorite dish of the night was the shortrib stroganoff, only sad that there was no room in my stomach for another order. Shortrib was cooked perfectly, so tender, and the noodles were in a cream sauce that paired excquisitely with the juice/sauce from the shortribs. Best shortribs I have ever had! The Ribeye was cooked perfectly medium rare and had amazing flavor and crust. The creamed spinach might have been the most unhealthy creamed spinach ever prepared, but the most delicious with bleu cheese and caramelized onions. The baked potato had this thick-cut bacon that was awesome, and in the end just a good deconstructed baked potato.
