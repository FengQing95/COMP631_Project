Art Institute of Chicago////Anyhow, my 9-year old enjoyed looking at the pieces of art.  We purposely visited the Byzantine section since we had just studied this era last year (homeschooling) and I thought she would appreciate seeing some of the artifacts.  She couldn't remember anything but I at least did.  My 5-year old kept saying--this is boring and is there a kid's area.  We ended up staying about 3 hours and were not able to see even 1/2 the museum.  If we go again, need to leave the 5-year old at home.
