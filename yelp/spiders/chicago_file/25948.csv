Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Finally!  Deep dish pizza, I loved! Being a tourist and trying to find that pizza w legit reviews got me on a deep dish pizza hunt. I tried Giordano's first,  wasn't so impressed. Came here hoping this place wouldn't let me down... it sure did not! Enjoyed a glass of red to accompany my delicious pizza. The sausage spread at the bottom,  the flavors n sauce was in sync on  combination and the crust tied it perfectly together.  Shall be dreaming of this forever,  until next time Chicago!!!
