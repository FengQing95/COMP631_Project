Art Institute of Chicago////The docents were very pleasant and helpful with directing us to the exhibits we wanted to view. There was one lady who was rather unpleasant and condescending at one of the side entrances/exits/thoroughfares to the upstairs restaurant/sculpture garden. However, everyone else was extremely kind.
