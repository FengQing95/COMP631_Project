Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My girlfriend and I started with the Malnati's salad...she said it was one of the best she's tried and I highly agree. We also ordered the stuffed spinach bread to start, and it was equally incredible. The pizza was of course the main attraction, and it lived up to every high expectation. With a tall glass of soda, nothing in a long time has tasted so good. The Malnati Chicago Classic pizza is pure decadence...one slice was very filling.
