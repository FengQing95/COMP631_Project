Little Goat Diner////Little Goat Diner had both hit and miss.  The Bull's Eye French Toast was a hit.  I am not a big fan of sweet breakfast item in general, but the maple syrup on this dish wasn't overwhelming.  The chicken had nice exterior crunch.  The runny egg hidden inside was a nice touch.  Definitely one of the better French Toast dish I had in recent years.
