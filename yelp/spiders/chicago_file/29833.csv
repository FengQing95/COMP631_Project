Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza itself was pretty good. They're know for their butter crust which was the most interesting part. We got the Classic and it had sausage, pepperoni, cheese and lots of tomato sauce. Overall, it was crunchy on the edges, fluffy in the middle, piping hot and amazing on the top. The medium doesn't look like a lot when it comes out but after two slices I was stuffed. I also got a bowl of their minestrone soup which was very well made. Full of beans and lots of spices. This place is definitely worth a try if you're in Chicago but I wouldn't go back again just to have their pizza.
