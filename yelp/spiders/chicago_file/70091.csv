Little Goat Diner////So far I have tried the sloppy goat, chili fries, ton katsu sandwich, the corn beef hash , and the fried chicken. All of them are amazing! For the amount of food they give you I feel like the price is definitely fair. The fries are $11 and the sloppy goat is $13. I always have to take some home! They also have a really cute bakery on the side that sells little goat gear!
