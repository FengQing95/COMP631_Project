Art Institute of Chicago////But the art. The Impressionist collections are world class. The American furniture gallery is a must-see if you like the dealer twins on Antiques Roadshow. You can see why they gush over early American chest-on-chests. The Thorne room miniature vignettes delight children and amaze adults who can't imagine how anyone assembled the tiny books, rugs and furnishings. There's nearly always a photograph exhibit worth seeing. The Oriental art galleries are large. The wonderful things go on and on.
