Art Institute of Chicago////I had absolutely no idea about history and development of art forms over the years, but the way each exhibit is explained will help you learn on the way. Make sure to spend some time in reading them. You can complete the museum in one day, only if you plan to run through, and trust me, that would be a sore waste of your entry fee. I'd suggest to do one section at a time, and you'll walk out of that place a bit more informed.
