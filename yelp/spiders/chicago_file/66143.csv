Smoque BBQ////I got the rib combo to try both their baby back and St. Louis style ribs. Sides of coleslaw, mac and cheese, and cornbread. My gf got the pulled pork sandwich. Seating as under a big outdoor tent. You order and pay up front and seat yourself. Someone brings your food in a grocery basket. Someone is supposed to bring your drinks before that, but I think they forgot us and we didn't get our bottled water until after our food was delivered and asked for it even though other tables who sat down after us got their drinks first.
