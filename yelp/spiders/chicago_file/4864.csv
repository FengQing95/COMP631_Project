The Purple Pig////Food wise was quality as well! All shareable. I wish someone told us the half duck confit was massive! Haha my favorite was the MILK BRAISED PORK SHOULDER. Definitely a MUST if you come here. So freakinggggg tender!! I also enjoyed the assortment of cheese we got too..I just wasn't sure which was which. I love cheese either way.
