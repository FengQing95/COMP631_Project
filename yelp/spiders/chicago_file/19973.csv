Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There was nothing deep or good about this Pizza. Great service and staff though. The wait is ridiculous, plus 20 minutes once seated for your order. I expected a traditional deep dish, but was informed by the manager that thats their signature deep dish style compared to the other popular deep dish styles around. After the long wait we were super hungry and ordered the soup of the day, which far exceeded my expectations than the main dish of the house. For me the pizza lacked flavor and was not worth the wait. Willing to give it another shot as it was a super busy night!
