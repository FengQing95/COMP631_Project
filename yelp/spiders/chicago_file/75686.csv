Little Goat Diner////My coworkers have all been here and they said I've got to try it.  I looked at the menu and it's almost all breakfast food and it was dinner time.  I was skeptical but wow the food is delicious.  I definitely don't mind breakfast food any time of day if it tastes like this.  We shared a Fat Elvis Waffles amongst the 5 of us and I had the Bulls Eye French Toast.  It tastes so good it felt like I was sinning with a guilty pleasure.  The service was great. The place was well decorated, simple but sweet.  The prices were ok for the area.  I'll definitely be back.
