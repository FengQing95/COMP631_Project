Smoque BBQ////That said, the food didn't taste bad. The mac and cheese and cornbread were bland, but the beans and slaw were just right. Baby back ribs and pulled pork could've used more seasoning. The barbecue sauces were unremarkable. Like I said - not bad, but definitely not what I was expecting given a 4.5 star average. There's a chain in Ohio/Indiana/Kentucky called City Barbeque that blows this place away.
