Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If it is innovative tapas you are seeking, you should venture to Mercat in the renovated Blackstone. I'm not looking to damn cbbr with faint praise. If you are looking for a spot to go with a group- perhaps out of towners- Â to sample a a vast tapas menu, several sangria options, and some half way clever cocktails. CBBR is your spot and you won't be disappointed. Tapas is always a good option I think- its nature allows you to sample so much without being limited to the starter menu and one or two entres.
