Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Manager named Peter is extremely rude (tall guy with Â super gelled aging black hair) and the food is average. We were looking at the menu and he snatched it out of our hands and said he was short on menus. Would never visit this establishment again!!! WORST EXPERIENCE AT A RESTAURANT EVER!!! I WOULD GIVE IT 0 STARS IF I COULD!!!!
