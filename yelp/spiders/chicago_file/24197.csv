Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Do not waste your time with this gimmick, Mickey Mouse chain if you're in search of the real deal. Was put on hold 3 times only to reiterate why I was calling only to be met with rude service. They want your credit card in case of reservation no shows? Who do they think they are a 4 star Mechlin restaurant? I think I'd rate Olive Garden over this nonsense. Service was slow, dumb and all of our pizzas came out flat and undercooked. Only thing you'll be walking away with from here is a night on the toilet thanks to the raw sausage and chewy dough. Overall bad pizza, not high thick or cooked even after I sent it back after already waiting 40 minutes.
