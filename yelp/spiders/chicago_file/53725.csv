Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had a reservation and were seated promptly in the back room (where I worried that we may be neglected), but it was no problem. Our waiter and the bus boys were very attentive, and the pace was good. The only thing we had to ask for constantly was water, because the glasses were so small and a few people in our party were only having water. For larger parties where this is the case, leaving a pitcher of water on the table would be best. (Or at least larger glasses!)
