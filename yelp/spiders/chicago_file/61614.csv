Smoque BBQ////You don't go to BBQ place for Ambiance, but hold your horses.....you gave it a 4 stars rating!??....For me, "real" bbq place are a hold in the wall with great food. You eat with your hands. This place actually has good table and seating with nice "waiters" so the "4-stars" are in comparison to other BBQ place not a micheline restaurant - which BTW Somque is recommended by Michelin.
