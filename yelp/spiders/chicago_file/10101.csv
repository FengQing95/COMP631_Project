Art Institute of Chicago////This is one of the best museums in the WORLD, if you didn't know and appears in basically every top five list there is so if you are visiting this is worth checking out despite the high price tag on the entry! And if you are an Illinois resident and pay our sky-high taxes then you might as well visit during one of the times it's free for residents because you basically already paid for this stuff anyway!
