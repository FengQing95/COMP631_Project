Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I came here after many friends recommended.  I have to say that I was unimpressed.  The ambience was great and so was the service but the food was not good.  We had the shrimp de jonghe and it was ok.  I got the filet and it was not good.  We have been to many steakhouses over the years and this was just not good.  The steak was flavorless.  I would pick Chicago cut,  swift & sons or Joe's stone crab over this place.
