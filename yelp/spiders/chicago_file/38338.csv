Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I have never been happier to re-rate a restaurant than at Bavette's Bar and Boeuf.  We finally got the experience that everyone had been praising about - and after this time, we WILL be back. The food and the service was phenomenal.  We came here for my birthday.  The special occasion was acknowledged by pretty much every staff member we encountered - from the host stand to the waiter and everyone in between.  Again, we were seated right away, which is always a plus for a busy restaurant like this on a Saturday night.
