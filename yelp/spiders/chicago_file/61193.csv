Smoque BBQ////Best BBq chicken ever. I don't eat chicken skin as a rule but the skin on the chicken at Smoque is crispy and so full of flavor that I ate all of it. The lack of the fifth star is merely because I asked if the baked beans had pork in them. I was told that there wouldn't be chunks of pork in them. There were chunks of beef though. Should have asked if they had meat in them. Ill take the blame for that but I will absolutely come back here next time I'm in town. Only next time I will order a salad to go with the half chicken. I saw their salads at the table next to me. WoW!!!!!!
