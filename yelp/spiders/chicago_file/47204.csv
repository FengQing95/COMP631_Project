Smoque BBQ////Went there around 2pm on a Saturday - barely any wait. Two friends and I ordered the pulled pork platter (coleslaw, peach cobbler, and mac&cheese) and the brisket. The brisket is amazing! Tender, full of flavor, slightly charred, and a little bit of fat on the edging. Pulled pork was good but not the best I've had. Cole slaw was vinegar based - lightly marinated, not to strong, a great accompaniment to the brisket and pork. Mac & cheese (baked) was typical. The cobbler was a comfort dessert - pretty sure they were made with canned peaches, however still really tasty. Their ribs were out of commission (issues with quality from the source) so I'll be interested in trying those next time.
