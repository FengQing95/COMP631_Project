Art Institute of Chicago////The place is massive. Absolutely massive. The exhibits are well-organized and there are plenty of maps everywhere (and helpful workers) at the likely chance that you ever find yourself lost. We didn't try the cafe food but appreciated that it was there for visitors. I do find it weird that when you check-in your bag ($1 each item) they ask you if there's water or food in there. If you answer yes they then proceed on asking you to take it out of the bag and put it in a provided plastic bag... for you to carry around the whole museum. Makes little sense to me because 1) it's a waste of plastic 2) you'd rather have people carrying around water bottles and food that they can't eat inside than have them in their checked bags? *kanye shrug*
