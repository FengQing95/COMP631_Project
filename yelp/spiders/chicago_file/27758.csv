Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It takes about 30-40 minutes for them to make your pizza since each one is made fresh. I can't imagine having to wait that long to get seated, and then waiting that long AGAIN for your food. Geez, I'd be HANGRY! I think they might have some option to pre-order your pizza though?
