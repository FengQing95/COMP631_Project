Little Goat Diner////I don't think I'd go here for dinner, but GREAT for a Sunday meal.  Definitely a menu that everyone will love.  I took my younger brother (college age), my mom, aunt and grandmother here and there, and there wasn't one person who wasn't happy with their meal.   Much like Girl and the Goat, I think the best way to experience the menu is to share everything so you get to order, and try, more.
