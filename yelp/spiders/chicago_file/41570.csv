Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Generally good, but there is definitely something about this place that feels un-authentic (aside from the cheesy decor). Unfortunately they do not let the fruit soak in the sangria (as it should). The bacon wrapped dates are probably the unhealthiest thing you can put in your body, but are sublime in their sugary, greasy, and meaty goodness.
