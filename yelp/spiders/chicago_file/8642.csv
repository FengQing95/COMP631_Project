Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is a magical place where you can daydream, imagine what it might have been like to live during a certain era and gaze at works of art that you've seen dozens of times but still find something new and amazing. If you have young kids, bring them along--it's never too early to introduce them to fine art.
