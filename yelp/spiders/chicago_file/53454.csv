Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tapas . . . $3 tapas for happy hour, made this a happy TWO hours! It wouldn't be a Yelp review if I didn't mention the savory, crunchy, juicy BACON WRAPPED DATES. So simple, yet sooo delicious. Enigmatic little nips of goodness. Crunchy, chewy bacon, and plump-when-you-cook 'em dates. Sinful. But who doesn't love to sin, I ask you?
