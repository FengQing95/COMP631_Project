Little Goat Diner////On the plus side, it is a nice restaurant to visit because of the unique vibe it provides. It gives you the air of being at a high class restaurant and also the comfort of being in a diner. The server was so sweet and nice- she got a wonderful icecream smoothie for my friend, because it was her birthday!
