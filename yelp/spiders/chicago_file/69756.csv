Little Goat Diner////There is room for maybe 2 or 3 people to stand abreast between the carryout counter and the bar, which is a problem because, as noted, the place is heavily staffed, and there is a steady flow of workers heading through that area, some carrying trays.  This leaves you with a choice of (1) standing close to the carry out counter, which gives new-comers the impression that you have not yet ordered and blocks their view of the products and prices; (2) standing close to the bar, which comes uncomfortably close to invading the personal space of the lucky people who nabbed a place to sit; or (3) playing Frogger, jumping out of the way of every passing employee or customer.  Just a terrible layout.
