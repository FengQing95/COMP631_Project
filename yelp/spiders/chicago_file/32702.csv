Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I came here to celebrate a birthday for my boyfriend.  They gave us a huge round booth in the basement--awesome.  Dark, intimate and not crowded next to other diners.  The food was amazing--shrimp cocktail came beautifully presented, same with the crab legs.  We also ordered the filet which was cooked perfectly.  The staff was courteous and not overbearing.
