Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we got there, the wait was about 25 minutes but they graciously offered that we could order our pizzas while we waited since they take so long to bake. Â We did, which resulted in receiving our pizzas within 10 minutes of sitting down & putting in the rest of our appetizer and drink orders.
