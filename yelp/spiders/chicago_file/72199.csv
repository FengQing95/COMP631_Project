Little Goat Diner////I live about a two minute walk from Little Goat which is extremely dangerous but it's so yummy I can't help it but coming here for basically any meal. I love the fact that I can get a quick sandwich, salad and coffee on the bakery side, especially if the restaurant is really busy which it is most of the time. It's nice they do the "text you when you're table is ready" thing so you don't have to wait around in their crowded lobby. In my experience, the wait time is usually far less than they quote so be careful straying too far for a drink because the '45 minute wait' usually ends up being 25 minutes.
