Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////But that's just because Lou's pizza is so popular. And why? Because IT'S THE BEST. The crust is buttery and delicious in every way, the cheese is melted to the perfect level of stringiness, there's just enough of that undeniably savory tomato sauce -- and the sausage is just indescribable. Only Lou does this just right.
