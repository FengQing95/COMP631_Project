Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first real Chicago deep dish pizza and I must say it lived up to all of the hype. We had the Lou and loved every bite. The Caesar salad was excellent as well. The only thing I didn't enjoy was waiting 30 minutes to try to pay. Service was really lacking at the end, but the rest of the meal/experience was great.
