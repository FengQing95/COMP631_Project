Art Institute of Chicago////This museum is so impressive, it really is world class. We got there at opening time and stayed for about 2.5 hours, and we maybe got through 1/3 of the museum. I would've been happy exploring all day! We saw the Rembrandt exhibit, impressionists, modern, and contemporary art sections. Our favorites were the impressionists/Monets, American Gothic, and a Sunday Afternoon. We had no idea how many iconic pieces were in this museum, including some of the Van Gogh pieces, Warhol, and many more! I can't wait to come back and look through all the other exhibits!
