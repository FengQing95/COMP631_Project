Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When headed for Chi- town, I researched a little to find best classic deep dish. I prefer thin crust NY style in general but wanted the Chicago experience. My research narrowed down my options to three locations. Upon my arrival, I started asking cabbies, tour guides and others for their opinion on the three. This place was mentioned most often and was the closest to my hotel. The service was friendly and prompt, the food tasty, the atmosphere felt like a neighborhood hangout I would go to at home, and the overall experience was satisfying. I still prefer thin crust but gave to admit the Chicago Classic deep dish was pretty good and I would definitely go back to try their thin crust.
