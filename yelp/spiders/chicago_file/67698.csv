Little Goat Diner////I have now tried both Little Goat and the Little Goat Bakery next door and had very different experiences. My husband and I first went to the bakery to pick up some lunch. We tried the goat chili, shrimp sandwich, turkey sandwich and brought home a loaf of the sourdough bread. Food came out quickly and everything was amazing! The sandwiches were incredibly creative and wowed our taste buds. Would totally recommend stopping in for a quick bite or to grab some food to take home.
