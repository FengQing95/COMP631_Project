Little Goat Diner////I've been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I'm glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out.
