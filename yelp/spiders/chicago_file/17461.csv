Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Get the Lou Malnati's Special Pizza - it's delicious! The tomato sauce was delicious and the tomatoes just tasted SO fresh. From my experience, all tomatoes definitely are not created equal. I would compare the delicious tomatoes to those I had in Europe last summer. Great cheese/sauce to crust ratio. I love crust so there wasn't even a crumb left on my plate.
