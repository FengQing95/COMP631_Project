Little Goat Diner////Overall, I give this place two thumbs up.  Service is usually great, and I've never been disappointed by the food.  The staff, for the most part, are all really great, and knowledgeable about the things they offer.  I absolutely recommend this place, and definitely recommend sitting at the bar and enjoying the company of the bartenders.  They all seem to get along so well, and they are all really great at what they do.
