Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Very impressed! I'm adding this to my staple list for future visits to Chicago. It's the perfect spot for an intimate date and yet I'd imagine it also being a lot of fun for a group dinner. The food was remarkably good and yet reasonably priced. The bottle of 2004 St. Emilion that our waiter recommended was simply incredible! The appetizer portions were much larger than expected and we couldn't finish all of our food. Go in knowing that you'll be able to share the apps and sides. Sit back, enjoy the delicious food, fantastic wines, and savor the incredible atmosphere that Bavette's has created.
