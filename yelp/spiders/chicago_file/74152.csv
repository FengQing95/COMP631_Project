Little Goat Diner////Little goat is one of my favorite places in the city! From their brunch menu to their nachos, I have yet to find something I haven't liked from here. Came here for brunch recently, I got the bulls eye French toast! Toast and chicken, how can I say no to that?! It was delicious! The chicken was crispy and tender, the syrup was sweet, and the egg mixed with toast was in replaceable. Will definitely be coming back for more!
