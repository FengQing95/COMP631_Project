Little Goat Diner////A very good place with a group of friends. I like the fact that each dish has a sort of twist in their recipe / not typical flavor you'll find in many other restaurants. The only problem was the foods were very salty. Too salty to a non-alcohol drinker. I guess if you also order alcohol drinks with meals then you are probably fine (????)
