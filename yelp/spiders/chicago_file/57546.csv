Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This paella paradise has been hyped up by all my friends for a while. I went with a coworker after work and Â when we arrived around 7 Friday night there was no more seating. Luckily we walked around for 10 mins and found seats by the stool. We ordered a variety of seafood and red meat plates to compliment our chicken paella. The service was really good and the generous portions left me with another full dinner. Would highly recommend to others for a date or friendly outing, would also recommend making reservations first!
