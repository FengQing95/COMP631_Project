Little Goat Diner////Their dishes were pretty unique. We ended up going with the Fat Elvis waffles and smoked corned beef hash with eggs. My favorite was the waffles - so many good things going on there. The bananas were at the perfect stage of ripening, the peanut butter mound had a light and fluffy texture, the waffles were fluffy and crispy and had a wonderful flavor. I liked that this dish wasn't overly sweet. It was honestly the best waffle dish I've had in my life.
