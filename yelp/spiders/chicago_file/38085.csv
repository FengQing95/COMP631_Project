Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Last night my cognac Sazerac was spot on. My Classic Ribeye - Chicago Cut was, like the last two times I was there, delicious and cooked perfeI really like this place, and recommend it, though I am frustrated by how difficult it is to reserve a table, only to find, every time I'm there, that there are plenty of empty tables.
