Art Institute of Chicago////To earn another star would require addressing a terrible flaw in staffing. So, are they Security Guards or Docents??? What ever they are called their behavior is pitiful. Inattentive, clustering and often unavailable, these uniformed employees intentionally misdirect visitors, patrons or members at will! It is unacceptable to send anyone out of their way when what they seek is close at hand. Â Is it a form of amusement? Perhaps local art students would make ideal replacements if addressing these issues fails to correct the problems!
