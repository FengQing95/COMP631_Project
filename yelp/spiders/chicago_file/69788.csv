Little Goat Diner////While prices run a few bucks higher than your run-of-the-mill diner (most breakfast entrees cost about $12), the quality and creativity makes it well worth the slight upcharge. In addition to breakfast fare there is a lunch menu with various "sammiches", salads, burgers (with different meats, breads and fixings to choose from), all sorts of snacks and sides, desserts and even a dinner menu (dubbed Supper Club). Several dishes feature goat such as Goat Shepherd's Pie (with a locally sourced shepherd) and a Sloppy Goat. Much of the food is rich and hearty, but there are some healthy (but nice) options for those watching their weight such as a turkey or veggie burger with sprouts, avocado, tomato and relish with a housemade whole wheat bun.
