Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The second time, we were seated in the downstairs lounge. The music is club-style and loud - certainly a turn-off for me when I'm out for a nice dinner. Someone immediately poured us a water, and then we waited for 5 minutes. We were determined to eat here, so we were just going to head upstairs and eat at the bar where they're more attentive. As my friend and I went to leave, the manager hurried over to the table, apologized profusely, and asked us to stay and they'd make it up to us.
