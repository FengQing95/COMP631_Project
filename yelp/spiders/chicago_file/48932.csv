Smoque BBQ////I went first thing on a Sunday (11ish) and there was not a line at all. I got the chopped brisket platter w/coleslaw & got the baked beans & cobbler. My friend got ribs & a large mac n cheese (we split all the sides). My friend said her ribs were quite good. I thought my brisket was good, a little charred but that was ok. Good sauce. The portions for the meat were very generous but my friend and I both thought the portion on the sides was on the small side. We both agreed that the mac n cheese was great. The coleslaw is OK (it's a vinegar based dressing). I liked the baked beans & thought they had a nice smokey flavor....my friend thought they were just OK. We both agreed the cobbler was very good. Â Overall I'd say the bbq was pretty good but I'm not sure it was the best bbq I've ever had. I think I expected a little more since seeing Smoque featured on the Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives. I will say that they gave me a side of mac n cheese instead of baked beans the gal behind the counter just gave me a side of beans & let me keep the mac n cheese - which me and my friend were both thankful for because we really dug that mac n cheese. I'd give Smoque an extra 1/2 star based on that but sadly I can't. Pretty good bbq, it's worth a try.
