Smoque BBQ////Despite the spic and span interior, both of my experiences were very good and I will be going back at some point.  However, Smoque definitely lacks something.  I guess I want a "BBQ Joint" and Smoque comes off as a "Barbecue Restaurant".   I'm afraid to say that Chicago will most likely never be able to compete with Kansas City, Texas, and the Carolinas for the best BBQ joints.  But if you are looking for some good Chicago BBQ Smoque will get you close.
