Little Goat Diner////My friends and I put our names down for another restaurant but it had over an hour wait. Since we were starving, we decided to look up a place to get a little bit of food and came across Little Goat. We had no issues with seating at this place. We sat outside and got the fish tostadas and tempura mashed potatoes to share. Service was quick, and the food was good. I especially liked the tempura mashed potatoes; I don't think I've ever had anything like that before. Definitely recommend this place!
