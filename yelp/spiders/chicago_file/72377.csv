Little Goat Diner////This place has great breakfast food and a vegan menu! I ordered the avocado toast from the vegan menu and it was well worth it. It was topped with so many vegetables and tasted flavorful. The pancakes are incredible too. Can't forget mimosas! This place has so options and all are so different!
