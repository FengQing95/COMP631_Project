Art Institute of Chicago////So while the art museum in Kansas City is much smaller, I have a bit more respect for the Nelson than I do for the Art Institute simply because people are not compelled to pay to visit the Nelson. In fact, the Nelson probably gets more money from me even though it's free because I can afford to go regularly and I donate every time.
