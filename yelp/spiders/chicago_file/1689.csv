Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Amazing breakfast! The portions are very generous, so come hungry! The kids meal us a great value. The cinnamon roll pancakes were fantastic! The wildberry bliss French Toast is quite good, but ask for the toppings on the side. The Red Velvet French Toast is also good , but quite sweet. This place gets very busy. Go early or you will have to wait!
