Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Thank you for writing, Maddey. I am very sorry to hear about the poor service you received at our pizzeria. If you're open to it, our Manager would like to speak with you about this. I will send you a private message so we can address this. Please respond with your contact information and I will have the Manager contact you directly. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.
