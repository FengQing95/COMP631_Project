Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////If you've got an appetite, Wildberry will not let you down.  The portions are enormous, but the value is amazing too.  There is a minimal wait time for Sunday brunch, but it isn't too outrageous, also, there's a park across the street if you want to kill some time before your meal.  I ordered the Venetian Sizzlin' Skillet and substituted my toast for some specialty pancakes.  There is an additional charge for this, but it's only a dollar or two, and well worth it.  I loved the Cranberry Pecan pancake because it was really light and tasted, almost healthy for a pancake. My girlfriends all got specialty pancakes with their skillets as well, so I was able to try the Oreo pancake (decadent, and delicious for a chocolate lover), and the WB Signature "Berry Bliss" pancake, which was bursting with all sorts of berries.  They are very generous with their portions, I should reiterate. My meal was more than enough for two people to share.  You can probably order less than you think you need.  The service is really friendly and this is just a great breakfast and brunch option if you are in the Loop.
