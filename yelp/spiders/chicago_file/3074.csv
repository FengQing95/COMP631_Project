The Purple Pig////This place gets crowded so quickly! Come early if you don't like waiting! We came for Friday lunch shortly after they opened and were seated immediately. We did not want to sit inside because it was so loud. The Purple Pig needs more space. Seating is cramped. I could clearly hear everything the couple was talking about next to us. Kind of annoying. Servers could do their job more quickly if they had more room to pass by tables.
