Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Caveat...I grew up in New York City in an Italian neighborhood, ate thin crust pizza as a child and that was all I knew.  Now I am older and wiser and have tried some generic deep dish pizzas, nothing to rank me as an expert, and I wasn't too impressed.  I like to think of myself as having a very adventurous palate and I will try ANYTHING edible once, I am a foodie and I know what I like.  My wife and I are on a quick vacation to Chicago, staying in a hotel in the loop and we wanted to give Chicago Deep Dish a fair taste.  We ate at Gino's East on Saturday (see my newly posted review on Ginos)  afternoon and while the pizza sauce was good and the pizza was good, the crust was a disaster, and the experience was touristy.... SOOOOOOO, here I am thinking that maybe I just don't care for deep dish pizza all that much.  I don't hate it but nothing to write home about.
