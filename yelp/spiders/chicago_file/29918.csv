Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I always wanted to try Chicago style, deep dish pizza and my dream finally came true. We came here around 5 pm on Monday and luckily it wasn't busy yet. I liked the deco, family friendly, cozy, a classic pizza restaurant. Since it was our first time, our server was very helpful to explain the menu. She suggested some appetizers, otherwise, we would be waiting for up to 40 minutes for the pizza. We ordered chicken wings with buffalo sauce, 1/2 The Malnati Chicago Classic and 1/2 The "Lou" for two people. For the appetizer, it tasted fine. I loved the pizza which we ordered tasted amazing! We couldn't decide which one we loved more. I was additive to eat the part with cheese and stuffed very quickly. I preferred thick crust pizza over thin ones because they were much filling. By the time we left, people were line up outside of the street.
