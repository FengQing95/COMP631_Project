Smoque BBQ////Service was fine and quick, and we didn't feel like we were being rushed at all by the servers - although we did feel a little rushed because the rest of the diners were eating at an incredible pace. We saw people get their food, scarf it down and disappear from the restaurant within fifteen minutes. It was actually crazy, although I'm not going to complain too much, since it did result in us being able to get a table.
