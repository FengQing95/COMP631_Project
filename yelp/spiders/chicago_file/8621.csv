Art Institute of Chicago////I used to work just a few blocks away and would stop by for lunch sometimes and check in on my favorite pieces. I think that's really the only way to visit a museum - is to go multiple times over the course of a few years or so and just check back in and see how everything's doing. My friend used to call it "Let's go check on Agnes" refering to his favorite piece of art there.
