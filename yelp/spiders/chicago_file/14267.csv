Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I will say... the service was lacking. Our girl was sweet, but a little slow and charged us for a drink we didn't get. Worse things have happened, but my experience would have been better had the service been up to par. But the pizza is wonderful. I will be back again and again and again.
