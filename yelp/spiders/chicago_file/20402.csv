Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Very disappointed to be honest, we tried them because we are fans of Gino's East and giordano's.  (Yes we have a split house hold) From the moment we walked in to the what we felt was outdated and dirty place to the 2 pizzas we ordered to try different tastes we were underwhelmed.  The sauce was bland and to chunky and the crust we I am not sure what to say about the cardboard burnt taste.  We have not returned to any location and never will.  There is much better Chicago style pizza out there.
