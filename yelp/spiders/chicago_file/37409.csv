Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is a dim lit restaurant oozing with a want for old England vibe which cones off as a dense saloon with rugged hardwood floors, mix n match furniture and small china. It's a very different ambience a good change perhaps but very dark inside and the food was above average but I've had better meat and sides elsewhere. I think people come here for drinks more than food and it is hyped up a lot.
