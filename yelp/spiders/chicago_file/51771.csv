Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We also ordered 2 portions (the minimum order) of the seafood paella with shrimp, scallops, and monkfish. I could only find a single piece of monkfish in the entire pan, but there were a more reasonable number of shrimp and scallops. The paella takes about 30 minutes to cook to order, so they ask you to be prepared that it will take a little longer than the tapas orders. Though we were stuffed by this point, my Yelp check-in earned us a free dessert tapa, so we chose the caramelized banana with vanilla ice cream and pistachios, the perfect sweet but not too heavy ending to our delicious meal. We ended up spending about $85 for the meal, which earned us 1 point per $1 for the Lettuce Entertain You group's frequent diner reward program - there are so many affiliated restaurants, it's a great program to enroll in! We would definitely eat at Ba-Ba-Reeba again for the delicious food!
