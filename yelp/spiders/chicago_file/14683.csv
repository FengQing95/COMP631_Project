Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place was ok.  We were told to order an appetizer cuz the pizzas would take 30 min.. I think the appetizer spoiled our appetite.  Service was average.  I was without water for awhile.  The pizzas were aite.. But didn't seem like traditional with all the sauce on top.  We ordered the original and the Lou. The original was better.
