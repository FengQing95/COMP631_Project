The Purple Pig////As others have said, the service and timing is top notch. They must have some sort of machine learning sensor attached to the plates, because it was as if they knew precisely when the cleaned plates have sat for too long. Before ya know it a friendly staff member would swoop in on the plates, replace used plates, refill your drink, and also check if everything was ok. Fantastic.
