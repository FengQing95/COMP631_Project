Smoque BBQ////If one is a customer who has never smoked meat, this restaurant is a solid 4-stars. If you are someone who has smoked meat, this restaurant is a 3 to 3 1/2 star restaurant; a BBQ smoker aficionado will be able to smoke better food...but, then, it's a pain in the boongie to pack a 300 lb smoker in your checked-in luggage. :)
