Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Large brunch menu. This place has some of the best Spanish tapas in Chicago. We ordered the Waffle-Battered Chicken Stick, Deviled Egg, Citrus French Toast Stick, Shrimp and Grits, Potato and Egg Bite, and Ham Benedict. Portions are tapas (bite sized), and best enjoyed with a group or partner!! A lot of savory and mouth watering flavors! Amazing sangria, too!!
