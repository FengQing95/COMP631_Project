Little Goat Diner////The kimchee in the first dish completely overpowered the meal. The Bull's Eye French Toast didn't have nearly enough syrup and the chicken was very dry. The Fat Elvis Waffles were overly-doused in syrup and thus got soggy immediately and the peanut butter butter was kind of disgusting - it was more like a glob of peanut butter than it was butter (and it didn't melt). We paid about what we expected, though the Bull's Eye French Toast seemed a little over-priced at $16.
