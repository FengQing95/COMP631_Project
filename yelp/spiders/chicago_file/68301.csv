Little Goat Diner////The issue begins with the main course--all three of us ordered the fried chicken after asking for suggestions from the waitress. When our food arrives, my friend noticed that her chicken leg could have been cooked longer but the wing was cooked perfectly. I also noticed that my chicken could have been cooked a little more. It's not until my friend sliced into her chicken breast, which actually required her to cut into the meat with her knife. When she cut into the meat, we all noticed the pink, which anyone who has ever cooked a chicken will know is not the proper color for a fully cooked breast (unless it has been barbecued but this, again, is fried chicken).
