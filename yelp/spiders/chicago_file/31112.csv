Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza here is amazing! Def have to check out this place if you're in Chicago. Make sure to make reservations and order your pizzas in advance! This place is often packed, even during non-peak hours. I care with friends at 3 and it was an hour wait for seats. The pizza also takes an additional ~40 minutes to make.
