Smoque BBQ////Still great, but I have to say not in as many fields as I suggested before.  The texas sausage is weak.  Their sandwiches could use some slaw.  Their sides are actually kind of weak too with only the beans being extraordinary.  However, their salad with mustard vinaigrette is dynamite and make a perfect pairing with some of their delightful ribs.  Dessert is also really solid here.  Still the best in Chicago.
