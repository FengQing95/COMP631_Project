Art Institute of Chicago////It took me a year and a half after moving to Chicago to make it to the Art Institute. After visiting there for nearly 4 hours yesterday, I'm embarrassed to admit it took me that long. Wow. WOW. I knew it was huge but never dreamed it was that big and packed full of so many incredible pieces. And after 4 hours I didn't put a dent in it. Probably saw 1/3 of what was on exhibit. The Impressionist gallery is superb, the American collection of paintings, early furniture, and other pieces was incredible. From sculpture to modern art, contemporary art, prints, ethnic pieces, this place has it all. And it's all laid out in an incredible building that is itself a work of art. What an incredible resource this place is and to think it's so accessible.
