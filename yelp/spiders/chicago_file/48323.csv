Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Recently it has been kind of difficult to get a reservation.  Which is good for the restaurant, but bad for the restaurant goer.   My husband and I have been sitting at the bar (first come first serve seating with full menu).  It's pretty legit to sit at the bar.  If you thought the food came out quick in the dining area - it is like lightning speed at the bar!  We will definitely be going back time and time again. The food never gets old!    I need to apologize to those of you that are reading this review.... I have a rule - when I review I must say what I ate and what I thought about the dish.  I think it is pretty pointless to write a review and not talk about the food at all.   My sincere apologizes... I haven't dined here in a while.  I will write a more detailed review next time I feast on their amazing tapas.
