Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When in Chicago, do as the Chicagoans do and that means deep dish pizza! Lou's is a staple of Chicago and there are a bunch of locations throughout Chicago. If you're planning to come here, expect to spend quite a bit of time here because each pizza is made to order and takes anywhere from 45-60 minutes. If there's a long wait, you can place your order while waiting for a table so your pizza will come out as soon as you are seated.
