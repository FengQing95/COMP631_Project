Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Other than those small factors, I really loved the candlelit ambiance, our service was pretty good, and my food was delicious. We started with the Salmon Tartare which was really good. I started to wish we didn't ask for bread at that point because I was already getting full. But we kept going and for dinner, my boyfriend had the Steak Frites which he enjoyed. I had the chicken which was delicious, but the winner of the night BY FAR was the Butternut Squash I had on the side. Amazing!
