Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////the manalti salad is fantastic as a starter!!!! one of the best salads ever. the pizza with sausage was amazing. perfection with the sausage and tomato sauce. of course you have to finish off the visit with the chocolate chip pizza...yes you do. a chocolate chip cookie made in a deep dish pizza pan covered in ice cream and whipped cream.
