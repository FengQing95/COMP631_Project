Little Goat Diner////My favorites were the BBQ sauce that came with the tempuras mashed potatoes. I would put more of it on the plate and put it on top of the potatoes so I would maximize my sauce ratios. I got the chicken pot pie and it was the best pot pie I have ever had. As an adult, I usually don't like pot pies. I am so glad I gave this one a shot! I got the pisco party cocktail and it was great. This was my first introduction to pisco so the fruit vibes in the cocktail made the welcome smooth. My husband enjoyed his banh mi burger. I give props to little goat for not over cooking the burger like 75% of places do.
