Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If you're looking for starter Spanish, as in dishes that haven't been horribly Americanized, this is your place.  Not to mention that they're priced a little higher than they should be considering the mediocre quality.  If you're looking for authentic Spanish food that's properly priced, I'd suggest Cafe Iberico or Emilios.  I'm pretty sure I never ate anything in Spain that had Ruffles potato chips with it, but thanks for playing.
