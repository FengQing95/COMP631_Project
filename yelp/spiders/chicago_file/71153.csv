Little Goat Diner////I wouldn't necessarily think of Little Goat as a destination restaurant in the Randolph area, but it is a nice break from the uber yuppy drag otherwise dominated by the other animal restaurants. The food is definitely more accessible price-wise and there is more variety than some of the other places. Think very well done classic diner food.
