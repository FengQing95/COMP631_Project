Art Institute of Chicago////The museum appeals to every audience. To name a few, there's African, Asian, Contemporary, Modern, Photography, Textiles, and Miniature Rooms. My favorites were the Contemporary, Modern and Miniature Rooms. I'm obviously bad with names and remembering what I saw, but there were some pretty awesome "famous" ones that we all recognize with a blink of an eye. Picasso.... Hopper.....
