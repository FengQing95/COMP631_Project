Little Goat Diner////The hubby ordered the parathas burrito, which was also very good. I liked that it was served on indian flatbread and looked kind of like a hearty pancake stack instead of the traditional breakfast burrito rolled up with eggs inside. As this meal is vegetarian, we ordered a side of bacon to go with it. Yum. The bacon was cooked well, not greasy, and not at all as salty as bacon usually is.
