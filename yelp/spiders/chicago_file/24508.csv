Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Loved this place! Since I was solo, I sat at the bar with no wait. It was a very chill atmosphere, one tv at the bar. I was greeted by the bartender, my bad for not cleaning my ears out, he had to repeat everything, although the music wasn't too loud. I pretty much knew I was going to order a personal pan deep dish, went for the Lou Manati classic.
