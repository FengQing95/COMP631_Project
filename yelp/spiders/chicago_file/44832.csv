Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas are one of the great loves of my life.  Lucky me, Chicago has its fair share places to share tiny plates of yummy-ness.  Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is one of my go to places because what they do well (ambiance and death by sangria) they do really well.  Their tapas are on-par with most of the other places in the city.  Most of them are good to great with a few not quite hitting the mark.
