Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////No competition, Lou Malnati's is THE BEST deep dish in the city. Whenever I have friends or family from out of time come to visit and ask for real Chicago deep dish, this is where I take them. My family and I have a Lou's pizza night about once a month, whether we order it as carryout or decide to visit the restaurant. Not overly cheesy like some other deep dishes in the city, lots of toppings! And if you're a fan of leftover pizza...trust me, it tastes even better after spending some time in the fridge! You rock Lou Malnati's!!
