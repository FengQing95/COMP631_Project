Little Goat Diner////I am so happy that I went with the server's recommendation. It. was. amazing. Seriously, amazing. Normally, tuna melts are served in a greasy spoon and aren't anything to write home about. Â this was not the case at Little Goat.The mac n cheese sauce was phenomenal. I can't even think about it without my mouth watering.
