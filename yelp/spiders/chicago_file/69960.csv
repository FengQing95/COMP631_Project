Little Goat Diner////The best brunch I've ever had. The wait was long like most good places in Chicago (about 3 hours). Just put your name down and go about your day. There were so many good things on the menu it's really hard to choose, but that also means you most likely won't make a bad choice. Recommend this place to everyone. Just a warning, if you get the biscuits and gravy you might be stuffed to the brim.
