Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We stopped in today, a Sunday, for lunch to celebrate a family member's birthday. In addition to being busy as a weekend day, it's in the second week now of Restaurant Week, so I know that's a crazy, harried time for all the staff. Despite that! our server (Daniel) was fantastic. Knowledgeable, prompt, and very friendly. The food itself was delicious - I particularly recommend the Seared Salmon with cucumber crema and squash. It was melt-in-your-mouth good, and the crema plus roasted squash was an awesome combination. The serving sizes are bigger than we all expected, to boot! Daniel even took it upon himself to bring my brother, whose birthday it was, a dessert on the house with a little candle in it. Adorable.
