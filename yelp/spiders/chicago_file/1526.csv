Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wildberry Cafe was some distance from my hotel, but it was worth the walk.  The pancakes are a good as you can get, and they come in 2 serving sizes so you don't have to stuff yourself if you're not a lumberjack.  I had the strawberry glaze pancakes.  THe glaze is just that--the perfect blend of a bit of strawberry sauce with fresh, heated strawberries, served with a bit of powdered sugar on the side.  I didn't even use butter or syrup, they were so delicious.  Service was excellent.  Even though the restaurant was busy, the server took the time to describe their signature multiberry pancakes.  And the check came and was processed promptly!
