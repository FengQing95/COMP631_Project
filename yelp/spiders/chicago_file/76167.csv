Little Goat Diner////One of my favorite things about Little Goat Diner is they constantly offer specials with seasonal ingredients that are totally distinct from anything else on the menu.  My go to here has always been the parathas burrito. For a non-meat dish it is so satisfying.  Also, love love love the tempura mashed potatoes because...hello what's not to love!?! The nachos are insane. Anything on the menu that features goat is bombtastic.
