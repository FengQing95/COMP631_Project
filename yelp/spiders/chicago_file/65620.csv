Smoque BBQ////So I legit live walking distance from here. And I CANNOT believe I did not come here sooner. It took multiple recommendations and hearing about it in a MOVIE to finally get my behind here. My parents and my in-laws were in town for the weekend a couple of months ago so we decided to bring them all here. My parents still talk about this place to this day! My in-laws and husband are from North Carolina, home of amazing and some of the best barbecue, so I know they were wary coming here. I think they still prefer NC bbq (pulled pork with the vinegar sauce) BUT THEIR BRISKET!!! Wow. Their brisket was so soft and tender. Smoky and meaty. And with the sauce... it all melted in your mouth so perfectly. I love fries so that was good of course. And my parents loved their ribs and sausage. Cole slaw was pretty good too. Overall would recommend! Really good bbq in Chicago for sure.
