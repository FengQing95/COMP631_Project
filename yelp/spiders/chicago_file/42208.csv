Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Walked right in on a Sunday evening and got immediate seating.   Overall pretty good service.  I love trying out tapas restaurants anyway and this place didn't disappoint.  I had chicken empanadas and the little sausages (sorry, can't remember the "formal" name), along with the small chocolate dessert.  Although they are small plates, you still get plenty full.  Check it out and see!
