Art Institute of Chicago////The AIC provides excellent art of every style. The large variety should suit any taste, so it is great to go with in a group. I often go alone, and the smaller rooms make it feel very private. If the art isn't enough, the beautiful interer should be - especially the stone staircases near the entry. Â I often attend the noon lectures - a nice break from the office!
