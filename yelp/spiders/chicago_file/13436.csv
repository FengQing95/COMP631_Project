Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Always stop by this location when I'm in Chicago, the best deep dish in the City, even though Geno's East is good too.  Service at this location is great and it feels like a neighborhood bar if you sit at the bar.  Fun atmosphere and you can of course take home a frozen pie for later too.
