Art Institute of Chicago////About the finest art museum that I have experienced, though a little short on sculpture. The 4 hours that I spent there got me 1/3 of the way through the collection, you definitely have to dedicate an entire day to the place. Â Enter on the door at the modernist wing, otherwise you are in line 30+ minutes to get in.
