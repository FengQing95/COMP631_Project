Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////SUPER KETO/LOW CARB FRIENDLY PLACE! One of the best meals I've ever had, and incredible cocktails as well! I recommend the Negroni and the Lion's Tail. The Old Fashioneds are super smooth! We started c duck and goat cheese terrine and shrimp de Jonghe. Our waiter, Joel, really shined when he found us cucumbers at the bar we could eat with our apps, as we don't eat bread. Fantastic service! The shrimp were juicy, covered in a garlicky butter sauce, and gigantic. I recommend it! The terrine was delicious, especially paired wth the herb salad that accompanies it- imagine peppery parsley, tarragon and chives perfectly dressed as a foil to fatty duck and tangy/creamy goat cheese. Divine. Our main was ribeye, bone marrow, creamed spinach, Brussels sprouts, and charred broccoli. The ribeye is served with bearnaise, and was succulent and perfectly cooked. The bone marrow was divine. The highlight of our entree, however, were the brussels sprouts and the creamed spinach. I can't remember better tasting vegetables. The best! The broccoli wasn't as good and mostly didn't get eaten, I would skip it.
