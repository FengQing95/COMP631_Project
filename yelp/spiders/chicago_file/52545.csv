Smoque BBQ////The very best BBQ in Chicago, and probably one of my most favorites ever. Believe the other positive reviews because they are true. The meat quality is excellent- this is a huge part of what sets this place apart from other joints. I always get the pulled pork platter and it is always smoked perfectly, and the flavors are amazing. I LOVE the peach cobbler for desert, and their mac n' cheese, fries, and beans are good too. There is usually a long line, so I call in my order ahead of time and pick it up- it tastes just as good at home!
