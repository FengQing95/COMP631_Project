The Purple Pig////Purple pig has an amazing ambiance, i heard they moved and space is 2x bigger than before, friendly staff and hospitality, i sat at the bar since it was just me and ordered the milk pork shoulder which was so tender and creamy, with a potato pur√©e it was superb, i order the Spanish octopus and much to my surprise it was really sour due to the preparation of the food, I'm not for sure what they cooked it in but it was to sour for me to continue to eat, i was so disappointed especially since i was gonna order the squid and the waiter highly recommended that dish i couldn't even take a picture because i immediately sent it back, i replaced that with the pork belly which was so much better also came with pork tenderloin. Overall it's a very tasty restaurant and will come back to try more dishes
