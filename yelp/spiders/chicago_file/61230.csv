Smoque BBQ////Honest review okay do not come here i was excited because they said this is the best barbeque in chicago its not at all trust me its supper expensive n the portions are so small m its a very small restaurant the entres were cold n gross the sides were great the bread puddin was great i would jus go back for the sides n that not the actual barbeque if u want the best barbeque go to hog wild on 157th its amaizing supper cheap n the portions are huge
