Smoque BBQ////I respect your position on high fructose corn syrup.  But just to clarify, we use light brown sugar as the sweetener in our sauce.  However, we use leading brand of ketchup as the base for the sauce.  The high fructose corn syrup is a sub-ingredient in the ketchup, as it is in most commercially available ketchups.  We don't use anything but brown sugar and white cane sugar at the restaurant and in our bottled sauce.
