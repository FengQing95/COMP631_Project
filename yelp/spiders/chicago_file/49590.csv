Smoque BBQ////Prior to visiting Smoque, I had only one recommendation in terms of where to go for great ribs.  (I-57 on Halsted)  That was until I made the trek and visited Smoque.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised.  The ribs were meaty and delish.  The sides were fantastic.  Although there was a long line, the seating process was rather efficient.  Overall, I was reallly happy.  This is DEFINITELY a place to try.
