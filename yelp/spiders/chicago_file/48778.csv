Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Amazing place! Spain is one of my favorite countries in the world and I was glad to be there as it almost felt like I was in Spain. It must be the smell of jamon haha. Anyway... My friend and I ordered white classic sangria, which was so good! I'd definitely recommend and also paella valenciana, patatas bravas, and garlic shrimp. Honestly, didn't finish the paella because we were already so stuffed on tapas, so we ended up taking most of it to go. Overall I'd give 10 out of 10
