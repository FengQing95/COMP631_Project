Art Institute of Chicago////AMAZING ART MUSEUM!!! Super super impressed with the extensive collection of art housed here!!! Get the citypass to zoom thru the lines and for the audio tour! You'll have to allow several hours to really get to view all the collections as this place is HUGE. One of my favorite art museums in the country!
