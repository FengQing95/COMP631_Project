Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My girlfriend and I ended up getting the bone marrow and chop salad to start.  The bone marrow was served with a really good sourdough and onion jam.  The chopped salad has the famous bacon and a really good dressing.  For dinner, we shared the dry aged bone in ribeye, the highlight of the night.  Tons of flavor, perfectly cooked.  We shared 3 sides, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and brussel sprouts.  All really good, but nothing that you need to get.
