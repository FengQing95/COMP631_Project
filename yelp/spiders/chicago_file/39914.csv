Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One of the most perfect dining experiences I've ever had. My husband and I had reservations, but we arrived early to have a drink at the bar. It took a hot minute for our eyes to adjust to the darkness of the restaurant. Once they did, I was taken aback by the absolute gorgeousness of the restaurant. I cannot even put it into words, I could have stayed there all night just taking everything in. We grabbed a spot at the bar, the bartenders were very nice and attentive.
