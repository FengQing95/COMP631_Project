Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our trip to Chicago included a visit to this well known pizza place. We came in on a weekday afternoon so there was no line, but the restaurant was almost full. We started with the fried calamari which is so tender and crispy, tasty with the sauces. The minestrone soup was the best I've ever had. Then came the main event the deep dish which was very good.
