Little Goat Diner////Came here for my first time from out of state, and had an interesting take on breakfast food. I got the Little Piggy went to China, Okonomiyaki, and the Bull's Eye French Toast. The Little Piggy visually looked good and the taste was just like the way it looked. Okonomiyaki was an asian inspired dish with flavors that complimented my early slightly savory dish. Then I ended it with the Bull's Eye French Toast...though I was thinking the I would taste the savory chicken, it was slightly overpowered bu the french toast, but still good. All in all, staff during covid was good.
