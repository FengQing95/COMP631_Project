Smoque BBQ////Sides: Cole slaw was perfect compliment for the heavy foods. Light vinegar, no mayo. It was very refreshing.  Corn bread was fluffy and had actual bits of corn =) My favorite item out of the whole meal was surprisingly their Mac&Cheese.  Very flavorful, perfectly cheesy and I loved the crumbly breadcrumbs baked on top.
