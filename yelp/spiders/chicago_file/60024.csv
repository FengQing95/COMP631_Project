Smoque BBQ////If you are reading this, debating whether or not to go to this place, stop, put your phone down, and go eat at Smoque.  Everything is incredible.  The meat is amazing, mac and cheese is great, and the cole slaw is fantastic.  The only thing I don't like is that I can't eat here more often because I think I would easily put on 20 pounds!
