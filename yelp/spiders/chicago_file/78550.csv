Little Goat Diner////This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area Â (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay.
