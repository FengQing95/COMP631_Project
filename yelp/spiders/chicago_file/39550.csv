Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started off with the baked goat cheese. Goat cheese is my favorite of the cheeses and this was nothing short of incredible. Red sauce is poured over the goat cheese and garlic toast is provided to spread it on. I would have preferred a different type of bread to spread the cheese over, but the appetizer was still remarkable.
