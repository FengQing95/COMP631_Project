Art Institute of Chicago////Definitely worth seeing if you visit Chicago!! They have AMAZING pieces and the upkeep of the museum is fantastic as well. The impressionist gallery stood out to me as having a number of iconic pieces from the masters of that time. Â Seurat's A Sunday on La Grande Jatte, Renoir's Sisters on a Terrace, and Toulouse-Lautrec's Moulin Rouge were some of my favorites. The only gallery that I found a bit lacking was the modern art section - I'm not sure if I missed a huge chunk of their pieces but it didn't seem like they had much.
