Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My go to for an amazing steak in Chicago, but don't expect to spend less than $100 here.  Sides are all amazing.  Some people don't know this but they are BYOB- as long as you share a glass of that vino with another table!  Love the dark ambiance and the service is always on point.
