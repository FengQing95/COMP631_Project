Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I've been here many times with friends.  I love the spinach omelet, but I get it with egg whites and a side of fruit.  The bacon (when I'm feeling bad) is thick cut and delicious.  I've also gotten a skillet when I feel like getting something heavier.  Ive tried my friends' pancakes.  Everything is delicious!  Avoid peak times (Saturday and Sunday mornings).  Otherwise be prepared to wait 1.5 hours for a table.
