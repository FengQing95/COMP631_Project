Smoque BBQ////I ordered the Â 1/2 slab of St. Louis Ribs with baked beans and mac & cheese, my boyfriend ordered the sliced brisket French fries and cornbread. Let's start with the ribs, they were perfectly cooked. When I say perfectly cooked, that is exactly what I mean. Perfectly cooked ribs DO NOT fall off the bone. Instead they are tender and easy to bite off the bone. I don't like it when I get a rib and the meat falls off, I also don't want to hurt myself trying to eat tough ribs. Smoque's ribs were perfect. The brisket was equally tasty. Fork tender, plastic fork tender!! What? And the bark is amazing. The Mac & Cheese is fantastic, I wish the portions were bigger, it reminded me of my grandmothers Mac & Cheese (and hers is FANTASTIC), so to compare them is a real compliment. The BBQ baked beans were so good! They don't sell that goodness in a can that is for sure. The Fries were fresh cut and cooked to perfection and the cornbread was also fantastic. Next time I will try the pulled pork and the baby back ribs. Heck I might just order one of everything so I don't miss out! Yup, that good
