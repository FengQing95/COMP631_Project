Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Wonderful!  One of my new favorite places.  The ambiance is nice and relaxed. Woods and low lighting.  Service was impeccable. We never wanted for anything.  Could be romantic.  I was with co-workers though....  The bread that comes early is amazing.  My cocktail, Lillet Rose Martini was delicious. Three of us easily shared the smoked fish ceasar salad and crab cake.  Also delicious.  We had the filet mignon, short rib stroganoff and roast chicken.  We shared the broccoli, elote and fries sides.  Not one bad bite on the table.  As for dessert, I have 4 words; malt whiskey ice cream!  OMG  With the fudge sauce?!!  wow.  I would go back for that.  the lemon meringue pie was old school and again, delicioius!  We had 6:00 reservations.  THe place, including the bar, was packed.  Can't wait to go back.
