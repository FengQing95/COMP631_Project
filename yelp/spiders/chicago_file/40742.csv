Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I can't write anything about this place that hasn't been said already. I have been to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba three times now and it never fails to disappoint. It is one of my favorite spots in the city for a delicious and affordable meal. The chicken empanadas and the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce are my two favorite things on the menu. These dishes are fantastic! The sangrias could be a tad stronger, but for the most part I have no complaints. The size of the pitcher is enough for 3 or 4 people to share but there is no harm in getting two. The atmosphere is versatile and works for any part of the day. I have been here after work, in the early afternoon, and at night. It's especially fun with a great group of friends who are just getting the night started. The experience and the service has been wonderful each time I go. You definitely have to put this one on your list of places to try. Though this place is affordable, it is easy to get carried away ordering multiple dishes since everything is so good!
