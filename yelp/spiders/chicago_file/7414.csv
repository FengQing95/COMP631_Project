Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is enormous.  I was very impressed with the number of extremely famous original pieces they have in their collection.  I'm sure in the 480 reviews before me, everything has already been said, but here's my (perhaps) unique perspective as a photographer.  I have no idea if you can do professional shoots there.  I went on vacation.
