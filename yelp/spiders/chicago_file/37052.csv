Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is a fabulous addition to River North area and a great new entry into the 'comfy/non-pretentious high-end steak place.' Â Presentation is great- service is outstandingly attentive and friendly- not fake and stuffy. Portions are large, which is great, given the price. It's a tad pricey but worth the hit for the relaxing environs, nice folks and great food. One last note- Managers at other places would do well to take notes from how these folks supervise the flow of your evening. They are much more involved than asking, " how's your meal this evening."
