Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Hosted our engagement party here a couple months ago and it was a great experience! Alison, the event coordinator, was great to work with. The food was fantastic, the drinks were flowing and the decor/lighting at the restaurant was great for a dinner-time event! Our party had a decent number of vegetarians and everyone left full, happy and grabbed leftovers. Definitely coming back for dinner again soon!
