Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ba Ba Reeba is a great place for a large group, but reservations are a must!  It was completely jammed on Saturday night and we had to wait a little while even though we had reservations.  Our server was attentive and made suggestions.  I fell madly in love with his recommended Passionfruit Sangria.
