Smoque BBQ////There is a reason that every time I go over, it's controlled chaos and busy no mater what time it is because it's just very good. Since my first review smart phones came out and I can post pictures today of my review. # 2 is not a bad spot for my travels in BBQ land and that's why I keep going back, not as much since I moved from Chicago.
