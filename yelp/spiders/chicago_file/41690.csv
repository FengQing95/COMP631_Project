Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place was highly recommended by friends. We sat at bar since there was a 45 min wait for a table. Bartender and waiter were nice and professional. Red sangria was good. Tapas was fine but not great. For me the place seemed a bit contrived and not authentic, also a bit noisy and compartmentalized. I personally prefer Iberico more.
