Little Goat Diner////- The fat club sandwich is very tasty, but I don't know how it was supposed to be like with the cucumbers. Â My husband hates cucumbers, and wasn't aware they came on the sandwich. It was hilarious when he took is first bite, and the proceeded to pick every bit of them out of the sandwich!
