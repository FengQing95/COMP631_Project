Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our first visit to Bavettes was incredible. Our waiter, Eric, was arguably the best waiter we have ever had, attentive and friendly. We ordered shrimp cocktail (massive and delicious) and beef tongue for appetizers. The beef tongue, fingerling potatoes, and horseradish sauce was PERFECT, almost similar to slices of beef brisket seared well. The bone-in filet was possibly the best steak I have ever had and the garlic mashed potatoes awesome. We ended our dinner with the chocolate cream pie - not a pudding, not a mousse, not a cream but a delightful combination of the three.
