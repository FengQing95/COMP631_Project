Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Prejudiced here. Been going to the original Lou Mal's in Lincolnwood since it first opened, so 42 years. Well over a thousand pizzas. Two of those were not good. I remember that because of the overwhelming shock and sense the world was becoming unhinged. Aside from those two traumatic events that make me think, yes, maybe someday I will walk out the front door and there will be a gaping hell mouth awaiting outside the door instead of solid earth and concrete. Life is not about total certainty. National Geographic once called this Chicago pizza that Chicagoans eat. True. True. I like the Sah-sidge... nuttin' fancy... just sah-sidge and that cheese that makes cheeseheads jealous. Oh, I think I'm talking myself into ordering one within the week. Makes any bad day instantly delicious. DISCLAIMER: I deny all liability for any damage you do to yourself from eating more than 2 slices. Wrap that 3rd slice up for breakfast or a late snack. It tastes so good, you'll want more even though you're stuffed. Listen to your body. You'll be delighted to have the leftovers later.
