Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I picked Lou Malnati's because it was close to my office and close to their hotel. The pizza was ok. I'm not a deep dish fan, but I tried a slice. I liked that their menu offered options for the kids. My friend's toddler could have chicken nuggets and fries while their 10 year old could have lasagna.
