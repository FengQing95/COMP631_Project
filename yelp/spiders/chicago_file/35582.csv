Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm only taking off one star because of how hard it is to get in. The food is amazing and my husband and I are on a tour of Chicago steak houses to try them all and decide for ourselves. It's expensive yes, but have you ever heard of you get what you pay for? It's true here. Also, the staff is very attentive. I dropped my knife in a very non dramatic way and a minute later a new knife was brought to me before I could even ask for one. The service was also not overbearing like swift and sons. We'll be back if we can ever get in.
