Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My favorite Chicago deep dish pizza.  I tried the competition and I must say,  Lou's was way better.  Butter crust and their sausage pizza was sooo good.  We went to this location hoping it won't be as crowded as the other location near the Magnificent mile and we were right, no wait to get a table.  It takes about 30-40mins I think to get your pizza from the time you order.  It was worth it.  I had a personal size and it was just the right size for me.
