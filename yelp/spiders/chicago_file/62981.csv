Smoque BBQ////The Mac and cheese was so good. The small side left me wanting more. I love the little individual foil dishes. Every container had the perfect amount of bread crumbs toasted on top. The peach cobbler was also fantastic. The crust was one of the best ever. I only wish I had a scoop of vanilla ice cream to put on top. Maybe management will add this for a summer treat. The Cole slaw was also very fresh tasting. I loved that it was not drenched in mayo but seemed to be vinegar based.
