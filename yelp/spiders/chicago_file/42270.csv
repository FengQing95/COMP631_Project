Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is average. Cafe Iberico on LaSalle is better.I do feel they use too much oil and/or butter on all of their dishes. What is a show-stopper for me, regardless of the food,  is the environment. Every single time I have been here it smells like sewer and the place just never seems clean. The bathrooms are small and not very clean and again smell like sewer. I am quite surprised at how under-kept this place is given it is part of Lettuce Entertain You. I know individuals have their  personal opinions of a large eatery conglomerate but I have never seen a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant so poorly kept. This restaurant is not priced like a 4am burrito joint, so why does it smell like one?
