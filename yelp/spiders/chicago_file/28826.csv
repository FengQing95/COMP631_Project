Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Wow! It was really busy and it seems like "it always is" busy but was on our "while in Chicago list" so we put our name on the wait list and preordered our pizza pies as directed. .after about an hour and I could have chewed my arm off..was so hungry!  When we were guided upstairs was surprised how busy it still was (about 8:30pm) but waitress was good & Lou's house salad was delicious with tangy dressing & olives, our party dug in!  Soon the deepdish pies arrived (The Lou, and Pepperoni).  Now we were feeling better,  very happy with company and even more so with dinner!  Our fave was The Lou..there was such a good amount of cheese and veggies & full of flavor that didn't even notice there was no meat on this one. .both good with thick buttery crusts.
