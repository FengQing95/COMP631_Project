Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a tourist, of COURSE I had to come here!  I was by myself on a business trip so I ended up sitting at the bar (the least wait....) and made a couple of new friends and shared my business-paid meal with them.  I started off with mozzarella sticks... nothing special.  I then ordered a 6" individual sized deep dish pizza (sausage, mushroom, onions) and got the extra hot pepper topping (forgot what it was called) on top.... now THAT made it 283947298 better.
