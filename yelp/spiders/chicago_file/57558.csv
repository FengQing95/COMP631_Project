Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We got a pitcher of the CLASSIC SANGRIA which was delicious. For tapas we got the ANCHOVY TOAST which I found very good even with my disdain for anchovies! We got the PAPAS BRAVAS which were some of the best I've ever had, and we also ordered the FRIED CHICKEN tapa which was my favorite. For PAELLA, we got 2 of the small ones. The SEAFOOD, and the CHICKEN PAELLA.
