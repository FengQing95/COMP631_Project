Smoque BBQ////Wish I could of took a pic but I ate it so fast I didn't have time to pull my phone out. This is the best I've had in years, hands down!! I would of eaten here 2 times in one day if I could afford to do so. The baby back ribs were beyond great and the service was superb! If I could give it 6 stars I would! You have to try the ribs, bbq baked beans, mac n cheese, and peach cobbler...Trust me you will not be disappointed.
