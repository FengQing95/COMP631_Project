Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////5 stars for this pizza that blew me and my girlfriend's minds away. We had previously come from NYC and California, so the whole "who's got the better pizza" debate was finally coming to a conclusion. We had tried some Lou Maltani's at a street festival the previous day, and were extremely impressed with not just the taste of the pizza, but also the INSANE cheese pull. We knew we had to go to the actual restaurant to try this pizza out.
