Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The restaurant on N Wells St is very busy, so if you're in a rush, you might opt for takeout instead of dining in.   The wait list app keeps you updated so you can how many people are ahead of you at any given time.  The estimate on how long our table would be ready was pretty accurate too.
