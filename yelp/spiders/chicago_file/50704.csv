Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I live in the neighborhood and Ba-Ba-Reeba was always a reliable place for a quick good meal. However, my last visit was so bad I felt compelled to write this review. I came for brunch on A Sunday. We ordered several tapas some of which came out quickly while others took over a half hour. The last dish came out 45 minutes after ordering and we were no longer hungry. When we reminded the waitress that we had ordered the dish, she rudely told us she was aware. She made us feel like she was doing us a huge favor every time she came by to check on us and getting the bill seemed like a huge inconvenience. It was not the service I'm used to with Lettuce Entertain You restaurants. Needless to say, I'm on a Ba-Ba-Reeba break.
