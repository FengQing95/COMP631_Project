Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had the worst experience of my life this weekend at this restaurant. I lost my wallet there and never got it back. I left the wallet at my seat but when I called them they did not cooperate at all. They were so rude over the phone that I had to go down there and ask about it. Still could not get it or any good response from them. They did not care a bit about asking their employees working at that shift if they knew something.
