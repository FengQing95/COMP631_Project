Little Goat Diner////... But then... Arachnophobia. 2013. Starring Candice G. John Goodman is nowhere to be seen. It's all up to me. And there's about a million (like 4 or 5) little spiders coming down from the AC vent above my head. F*ck. Obviously those little f*ckers just got borned in there and I don't know if generic Target brand Lysol is strong enough to kill them all. And I have no idea how many are already nesting in my weave. Now I have to move. You can't undo that. Am I going have to disclose this incident to the next renters? What happens next? Where is my life going? I gotta get out of here. Gotta get outta this town.
