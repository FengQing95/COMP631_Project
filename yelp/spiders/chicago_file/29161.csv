Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So I thought to myself I've got plenty of time to check out another Chicago place to eat, Stans donuts. Looked it up, saw it was .7 miles away and called the uber. As soon as I arrived at stans, I got a text saying my table was ready and they'll hold it for 5 minutes. CRAP!!! Texted them back and said I was in the bathroom, whoops. Â My table was ready within 15 minutes.
