Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went there yesterday to celebrate our anniversary something casual. First time here and we were in-press with our waitress and the service. We had the Spanish cheeses, pixtos platter and the ham tapas and a pitch of sangria to start. My favorite tapas was the cheeses hands down good :). We also had the seafood paella which it was good but not something i would order again. Next time we will stick to tapas only.
