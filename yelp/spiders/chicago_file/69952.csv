Little Goat Diner////Been here 3 times can recommend the bullseye french toast from previous visit.  Today I had the best meal I have had here.  The smoked corned beef hash is a killer dish.  The corned beef is thinly sliced and shredded mixed with some diced onions and shredded potatoes.  Great flavor on the beef and the potatoes are fried extra crispy.  The dish may be a little heavy on the oil because it is cooked on the grill but that just adds to the flavor.  Makes me sorry I wasn't nursing a hangover but don't think I would have enjoyed it as much if I was.
