The Purple Pig////Roasted bone marrow w/ Herbs - My second favorite dish - but close to first! I had never tried bone marrow before simply because the idea didn't seem too astounding to me but I was convinced by my friend to give it a try. WOW. SO GOOD. Smear some bone marrow onto the bread, top it with a good chunk of cilantro salad, and sprinkle a bit of salt on top. It's like heaven in your mouth. Absolutely mind blowing. Typically I prefer not to eat cilantro in huge chunks because the flavor is just too overwhelming but the salad is prepared in such a way that the taste of cilantro is cut down drastically. I have no idea how they made it but give it a try even if you're not a fan of cilantro. You'll be impressed by how it tastes especially with the bread, marrow, and salt.
