Little Goat Diner////The coffee was LEGIT. Awesome americano. Totally deep and rich flavors. It was dinner time and I just had a cup of coffee in the afternoon, but I had to try theirs. Don't worry, I still food coma'd from the food and collapsed just fine after I got home. Anyway, coffee was a huge plus for the night.
