Little Goat Diner////Solid brunch place. I had the shrimp and cheesy grits since I'm not a super breakfast food girl. The shrimp was good but the sauce kind of made the whole thing more soupy than I like. Lost the cheesy grits I was looking forward to. I also has the special seafood bisque, it was good but nothing spectacular.
