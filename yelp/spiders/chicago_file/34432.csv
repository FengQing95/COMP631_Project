Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I went here when I was in town for a conference. My daughter is vegan and our waiter picked up on that and instantly brought her their vegetarian (maybe vegan, I can't remember) menu. She was very appreciative. We dined downstairs in a smaller area than the one upstairs. The ambiance of this place is amazing. It was dimly lit and felt old school glam because of the candles on the tables and the half-moon booths. I loved it. Our service was impeccable. I had the ribeye and garlic potatoes--both were amazing. I think my daughter got a mushroom pasta dish and she was really pleased with it. The goat cheese appetizer was absolutely delicious. It's very pricey, but so are the other Chicago steakhouses. I indulged because it's steak---in Chicago.
