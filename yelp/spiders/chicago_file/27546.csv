Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was super excited to try a true deep dish. So we came here based on my friends and everyone elses recommendation. Ordered the sausage. Staff super friendly even worned us it would take awhile for the pizza sat down watched some soccer and waited. The pizza looked awesome. Nice crispy toppings thick crispy crust. Then the bite. I felt like it was mostly just cheese and dough no sauce or toppings. The crust was way to buttery for me and it was stacked with grease. I really wanted to love deep dish but it's just a little to much of the dough and cheese for me. If its your thing though this place does everything else for you.
