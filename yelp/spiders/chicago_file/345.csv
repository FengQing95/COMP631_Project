Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The queue to get in here is a slightly annoying sight when you want a quick and tasty Sunday brunch, but its a temporary inconvenience. The staff are fast at getting you set up and then are very helpful and attentive (I sometimes feel a little too attentive...they do want to keep you moving so they can get more people in). However the food and coffee is amazing. I had some of the waffles and eggs Benedict and it was delicious and more than filling for a fair price. Would definitely come back here,
