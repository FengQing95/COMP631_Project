Smoque BBQ////No better brisket. With the Memphis sauce and some candied jalapenos, this cannot be beat. Â There is a well-explained seating system, which, for anxious old me, takes the stress out of finding a seat in an always-crowded dining area. I have yet to find a bad item on the menu, and the people are always friendly. It can get a little crowded on Cubs gamedays, but I've never had trouble parking nearby. Line moves quickly so don't be intimidated by the line out the door. Go. Get your new favorite brisket.
