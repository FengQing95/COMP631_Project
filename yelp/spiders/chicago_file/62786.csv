Smoque BBQ////Got a pulled pork platter with mac n' cheese and brisket chili, and was able to try a little bit of the brisket while I was there. First off....texture of the pulled pork was actually pretty amazing. Maybe I was lucky, but I got a bite with great crust, moist meat, and the perfect amount of savory fat to balance it all together. They drizzle a bit of their Memphis sauce on top of it but the pork stood on its own. The brisket also had a great smokey flavor, but I think from what I tried anyways their greater ratio of fat/lean meat in the pulled pork put it over texturally. Had a bit of trouble choosing which sides to grab, as with the coleslaw you get your choice of two between Baked beans, fries, mac n'cheese, and brisket chili. The Mac n' cheese was probably my favorite side; the fries were fries(still hot out of the fryer so you can't go wrong with them), and the brisket chili was alright but overall less flavorful than I thought it would be.
