Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Made reservations after I friend suggest we go here. We made one to celebrate my birthday. It was really great. Food was amazing. A lot of little bites to choose from so you can taste a bit of everything. Very nice, dimly lit restaurant. Grab a 1/2 pitcher of sangria if you are a party of two. We got a whole one and it was way too much! Great service with friendly staffs
