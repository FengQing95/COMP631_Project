Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I love this pizza! Â I know my selection is not the traditional deep dish, but we ordered a thin crust with chicken sausage, spinach, mushrooms and onion and absolutely delicious!! The wait is definitely too long, so usage of a get in line app would be helpful to keeping people from standing in the cold. I wonder if they could make me one to bring home?
