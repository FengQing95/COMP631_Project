Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Saturday night at 6PM my friends and I (5 people) walked in with no reservation and wanted to sit on the patio. The hostess that helped us was friendly and took our information and predicted a 30-40 min wait. We actually only waited at the bar for about 20 min, tops, and while drinking a pitcher of sangria the time passed quickly. Â I am not a sangria fan but on this evening I did not seem to have a problem helping to finish the pitchers we got.
