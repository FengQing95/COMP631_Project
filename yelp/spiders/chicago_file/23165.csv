Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first Chicago deep dish pizza experience and while I'm no where near being a Chicago pizza connoisseur, Lou did not disappoint. I definitely recommend coming here in a large group, it's more fun and you can order a large pizza for more wow factor. We were lucky because there was no wait on a Monday night and we were seated immediately. We tried the minestrone soup, so so good, definitely get a large bowl of that! For 2 people, a small pizza is the perfect size for sharing if you don't want any leftovers. You will both be stuffed. If your group consists of 2 grown men, then I'd go with the medium pizza to be on the safe side. It took about 40 minutes from the time we ordered to when we got our pizza, exactly as our server had told us. Our pizza came out piping hot. The pizza itself wasn't as "deep" as I had imagined, but the buttery side crust did form a high wall around the pie. The cheese and tomatoes were so fresh and they did not skimp on the layer of sausage. I've never eaten pizza with a fork and knife but this time I did.
