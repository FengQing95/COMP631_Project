Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the Lou, a vegetarian pizza.  It was Cheesy with a capital C.  The sauce was delicious.  The pizza was tasty and soft.  It was more filling than it looked.  We could barely finish a small pizza (9 inches) between the two of us.  Boy, we were glad that we only ordered a personal sized green salad as app.
