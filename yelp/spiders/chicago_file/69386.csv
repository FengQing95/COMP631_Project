Little Goat Diner////full review:  now i haven't been to all of the places (best game of whack a mole ever!) and i could eat breakfast four times a day, so keep those things in mind when i say that this is one of my favorite places to eat in chicago.  little goat is tucked away in one of the coolest neighborhoods the city has to offer, a locale i would love to live that has plenty of other quality establishments and quick access to the rest of town.  the diner itself is surprisingly  spacious and appointed nicely with great decor.  the staff are super friendly and accommodating.  the menu is moderately varied with interesting takes on classic american diner fare (i got a paratha breakfast burrito, which was amazing).  food was excellent,  portions were adequate (you probably won't need to pack anything), and the price was fair.  i'm 34 and the clientele made me feel old =D, lots of 20 something professionals out for a casual good time.  you will probably want to Lyft in and out.  if you're lucky to live in the area, walk.  if you go, tell them rizvi sent ya, absolutely nothing will happen.
