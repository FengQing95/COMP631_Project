Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is my second place I tried for a Chicago deep dish pizza.  I had it delivered.  It was a Friday night and they told me deliver would be over an hour but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived in 50 minutes.  Furthermore, the pizza was delivered hot and intact.  Kudos to the delivery folks.  I had the sausage pizza with the buttermilk crust with black olives added.  I thought the crust was decent.  I also thought the sauce and toppings were good.  Overall I thought the quality was good and I would go back.
