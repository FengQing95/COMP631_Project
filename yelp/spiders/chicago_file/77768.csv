Little Goat Diner////My friends and I popped into Little Goat because Au Cheval had a 2 hour wait at 12:30 on a friday afternoon (i'll get there one day). The hostess who sat us was a little rude and seemed frustrated with us because we had one extra person but I guess I can understand because they were busy.
