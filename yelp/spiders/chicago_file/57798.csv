Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We arrived on a Friday evening right before a 1.5 hour waitlist started due to reservations (around 5:30). We were seated and the menu was explained to us by our server. Water and bread were brought to the table immediately - there was olive oil on the table with salt and pepper but no other spices or balsamic vinegar. Dipping bread in olive oil wasn't my jam so I left it to my partner. We ordered a pitcher of the black raspberry sangria and absolutely enjoyed it throughout our meal.
