Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I went with the Spanish hot plate with chorizo sausage, potato hash, cilantro, jalepenos, and sunnyside eggs. For $1, I added a berry crepe. Lets start with the savory- at $9.95, the portion was HUGE. Made-for-a-monster huge. Hot, right out of the kitchen, and everything tasted fresh. I have a problem with breakfast in that most times they have potatoes sitting around to be ordered so the potatoes end up getting soggy. This place was the BOMB, the potatoes were perfectly crisp.
