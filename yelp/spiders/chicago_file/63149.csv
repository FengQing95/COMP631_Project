Smoque BBQ////It has been busy everytime I've gone but I have never had a problem with getting a table/seat. You will likely have to stand in a line for a couple minutes to order but it moves pretty fast and there has always been a "host" that checks with you while you're waiting how many people your with to ensure a table.
