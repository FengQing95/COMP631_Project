Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////A truly great experience! The atmosphere is old timey and the background music was from the '20s (our best guess).  Daniel, our server was super professional and not at all stuffy as one often finds in so many steakhouses throughout this city.  He spoke to every cocktail and wine at length with the finest of detail. We started with one of the various Old Fashions and a Sazarac - they both hit the spot.
