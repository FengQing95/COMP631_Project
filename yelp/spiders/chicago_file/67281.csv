Little Goat Diner////Stopped in without a reservation at an odd time and was still packed but luckily found two spots at the cute little bar ! Food was absolutely delicious ! I got the veggie quesadillas and my husband got the sloppy goat ! I think that was one of the best meals I've ever had ! Different and unique flavors were incredible. We also split the smoked fries recommended by bartender and were amazing ! I will def come back to try more food ;)
