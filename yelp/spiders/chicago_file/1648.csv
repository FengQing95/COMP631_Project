Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This place is amazing. I had the Española omelet with hash browns and strawberry pancakes. It was the perfect combination of spicy, sweet, and savory. The omelet was huge, filling, and tasty. The jalapeños were just spicy enough to keep it interesting and good, but not too spicy where I had to stop eating. The pancakes had a strawberry glaze covered by strawberries it was very sweet, and I wish I had more, but they were very small. The hash browns were huge, and they were good, but they were nothing out of the ordinary. The service was amazing too. We got there very early, knowing how packed it can be, and got a booth right away. We got our drinks after about 2 minutes, and our food after about 15. Everybody there was very nice, and helpful. Overall I loved this place. It was amazing and probably will be everytime I go back. I highly recommend this place if your in Chicago. My life has been made better by eating here once, and I think that everybody should.
