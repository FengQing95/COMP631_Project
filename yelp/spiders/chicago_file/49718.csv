Smoque BBQ////I have been here on numerous occasions and keep coming back. I just really love their brisket. My most recent time was a few weeks ago with my fiancée who raved about his meal. He really enjoyed his pulled pork. I agree this form is the best way to retain their sauce. I like a thick and sweet BBQ myself, but I love the tang this place has to offer.  My go to is the brisket because of how tender it is, but I agree that I need to mix it up on my next visit and do pulled pork or maybe the ribs. I'll just keep it standard by ordering their Mac n cheese ;p
