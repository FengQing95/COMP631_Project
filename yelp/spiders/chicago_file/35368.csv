Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This was my second attempt to eat here because they typically book up in advance. The menu has a lot of great options and the prices were reasonable considering the quality of food and the ambiance. I shared the steak Frits and trout Cesar salad with my date( fellow yelper). The two plates we ordered were great. The steak was honestly one of the best I've had and the price was excellent considering the quality of the meat. The steak was not overly seasoned, but had a distinctive taste to it. The Frites were doughy inside and had a light crunch to them. The mayonnaise dipping sauce was tart and added to the flavor of the frites and of course I ate more than I should have. The trout salad was good as well, but the dressing was a bit heavy for my taste. I'm looking forward to trying other things on the menu next time.
