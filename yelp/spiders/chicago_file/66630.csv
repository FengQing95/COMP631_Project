Little Goat Diner////Visit 1 was great. The server was cool, attentive, and answered all our questions about the menu without any apprehension or uncertainty (the menu has several unique combinations of ingredients and some items we were unfamiliar with). I ordered the cinnamon bun, which I highly recommend!!! I also ordered the Little Goat coffee which was sooooo good (you must be okay with goat's milk, because the flavor is pretty strong). I ordered the Spanish omelette. To say the least it was amaze balls. I am a big breakfast guy, and I have a sweet tooth. My go to breakfast is always french toast. But I decided since this place is suppose to be awesome and comes with the reputation associated with girl and the goat across the street I am going to challenge them with my least favorite breakfast item. They knocked it out the park. It literally looked like beams of light from heaven were shining down on my omelette giving this shiny gloss of perfection (there is a skylight, so technically there were beams of sunlight coming through the ceiling and lighting up the room...and my omelette). Everything about my omelette was awesome. My friend ordered the Reuben and I had a bit and it was sooo tasty. The bread looked soo good and the ingredients looked fresh and abundant.
