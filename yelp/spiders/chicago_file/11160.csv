Art Institute of Chicago////Everything was labeled with clear signage and you don't realize how many people are in the museum at one time because it is so big and everyone is spread out. I took a lot of pictures and there was only a few areas prohibited for photography that had signs stating this. I recommend everyone visit here, especially residents since they get a discount. It's conveniently located near Millennium park in downtown and it makes an unforgettable experience. Plan on spending a lot of time here!
