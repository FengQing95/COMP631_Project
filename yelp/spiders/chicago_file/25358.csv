Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Disappointing that the stars dropped down to two soley due to restaurant cleanliness and poor staff. We were given a crusty plate and ask for a new one. We watched the waiter go through about 5 plates before finding one he deemed acceptable to give us. Similarly my mothers fork was covered in greased. We watched the waiter sort through maybe 9 or 10 forks before finding one to replace it with!!
