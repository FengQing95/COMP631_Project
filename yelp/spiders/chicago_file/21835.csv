Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My first Chicago deep dish pizza experience. Other than the fact that I had to wait about 40 minutes for my pizza, it was an amazing experience. Even though the best pizza (overall) is in New York, I get why Chicago deep dish has its fame. Lou Malnati's proved how deep dish pizza should taste... I really like it. I'll visit again on my next trip to Chicago.
