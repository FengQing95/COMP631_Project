Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service started off well-we were almost immediately greeted by our server.  The pacing of our dining experience was poor.  We ordered the baked goat cheese and a tomato/bacon salad. Both were tasty-the bacon was thick cut and was very good.  However, for some reason, both were brought out at the same time.    We then waited a long time-a very long time-for our dinner choices-the petite steak for my wife and a pork chop for myself.  As a side, we asked to split the loaded baked potato.  When the meals were finally brought out, the potato was placed on the table-there was no effort to assist us in cutting the potato in half so it could be shared. While not a huge deal, this is an example of how I think Bavette's service fell short of restaurants such as Prime and Provisions and Eddie V's which easily bested Bavette's on the service front.
