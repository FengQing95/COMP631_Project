Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago is worth a visit by anyone even slightly interested in art. It's in a great location on Michigan Ave in Grant Park. Â The place is huge. To see all the galleries would probably require an entire day (at least when they're all open, many were closed for renovation while I was there, but the amount of art was still overwhelming in a good way). The scupture garden, although it's small, is a good way to start your tour, especially if you come in off Michigan Ave (Columbus Dr was renovation central). I'm not even going to try to explain what's in the galleries. All I can say is no matter what kind of art you like, you'll surely be able to find it at the Art Institute of Chicago, although some is missing because of the renovation. And then there's the food. Downstairs, there's a formal restaurant with a courtyard and an upscale cafeteria. We went to the cafeteria for lunch. I had the chicken caesar salad with a side of garlic bread and a raspberry parfait for dessert. It all tasted really good. This defies your typical museum cafeteria, which usually consists of soggy prepackaged sandwiches. Overall, if you're in Chicago, run, don't walk to the Art Institute of Chicago and be artistically enlightened, even if you can barely draw like me.
