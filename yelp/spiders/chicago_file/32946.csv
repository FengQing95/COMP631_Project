Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Friday evening I took my boyfriend to Bavette's for his birthday. The ambiance was great. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. The drinks we ordered were great, then came the amazing sourdough bread they make in-house. Love Love Love!:) For dinner we ordered the Steak Frites that came with hand cut fries, Salmon, Buttery Mashed Potatoes, and Creamed Spinach. Each item was amazing... I don't eat steak, but looking at the delicious steak on his plate almost made me want to try steak for the first time. The steak was so tender he cut it with a butter knife. My salmon was amazing as well I was so full but kept eating. For dessert we had the peppermint ice cream and that was amazing as well! Will go again.
