Art Institute of Chicago////It took us around 3 to 4 hours to go through all the exhibits and I thought it was pretty clever of them to put the most famous ones at the very end or kind of hidden so that everyone goes through all the rooms to find it.  Though well constructed, the map is a bit confusing and had trouble finding the impressionism room and American Gothic painting.  Best way to find impressionism room is to take the elevator on the right wing and go to the 2nd floor.  American Gothic is on the second floor of American art wing, so don't overlook the stairs when you first enter.
