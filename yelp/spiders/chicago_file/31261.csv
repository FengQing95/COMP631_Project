Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our server helped us by cutting and serving our first slice of the pizza when it arrived and I rushed to take a photograph for the review before digging in. The overall flavor was good, but the crust was honestly somewhat bland. We ended up checking the menu to see if the pizza ultimately came with the buttercrust, which it did - but it didn't taste like that at all. The delicious taste of the cheese, sauce, and veggies were ultimately mitigated by the crust to our displeasure.
