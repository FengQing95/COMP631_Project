Little Goat Diner////Pickles and onions, tasty, greasy, could have used one more dipping sauce. So far the service has been slightly inattentive and unenthusiastic. I wanted to love This Little Piggy Went to China and I did enjoy the flavor. Â The strawberries added another dimension. The biscuit was tough though and the the dish over all was greasy. Still, I loved the coffee and I am willing to try again. Someone suggested I get the fish tacos...wish I had....Wahwah.
