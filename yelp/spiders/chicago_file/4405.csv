The Purple Pig////TPP certainly has the reputation in town-everyone always says you have to try it. We were in town for a wedding and were told the same. So we tried (yes on a Saturday night) to call ahead and were told it would be that long to wait but could try to walk in for the bar/butcher block. Well we lucked out and walked straight to the BB and grabbed a spot. Standing room only-not ideal for my pregnant wife- and tried a few dishes.
