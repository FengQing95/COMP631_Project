Little Goat Diner////We went here for dinner the other night, we had been wanting to try this place for awhile. The food was really good. We started off with the crab dip with Ritz crackers-SO GOOD. The disappointing app was the fried pickles/onion rings. People, tempura does not make a good batter for everything. Hated these. Didn't even finish them. The entrees we had were the chicken sandwich and the pork tenderloin which had this great Asian sauce and slaw on it. My daughter (3) got a generous portion of fries and chicken strips. My husband ordered a Bloody Mary but thought it was too sweet-not sure what they put in it, but I don't drink these so I didn't try it. Then for dessert, we have the kid's ice cream sundae which we all shared. Overall, we thought it was a bit pricey, but very good, and family-friendly, which is important to us. We will come back and try more things. Maybe breakfast next time!
