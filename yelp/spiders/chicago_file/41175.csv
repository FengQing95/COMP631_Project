Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great for a group to meet-up and share food. Fairly safe with their selection, so everyone leaves satisfied. Satisfying and cold sangria could use more sangria and less ice. My reservation for 5 people at 6pm on a Sunday was kept despite people being 15 minutes late. Friendly service. Quick bussers keep the table clear.
