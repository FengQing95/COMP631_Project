Smoque BBQ////I always love the dry rub on the bark of the ribs, it's flavorful with just a hint of sweet that I rarely ever need the Barbeque sauce that comes with it. The ribs are well smoked, the Mac and cheese is always delish, I like the minimalism of the German style coleslaw and I often buy both the the peach cobbler and bread pudding together. Smoque is a neighborhood favorite for me.
