Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was delicious and the service over the top! We really loved what we ordered and the management was very nice -- they initally forgot to assign someone to our table so told us we could have a free dessert which was nice. Â Then they accidentally forgot to comp the dessert, we pointed it out and only expected them to make that correction, but they took off one of our appetizers as well and were very apologetic. Mistakes happen, but they definitely went over the top and overcompensated for it, which was great service. Overall it was a good experience, good food, friendly servers and it was well heated in the patio.
