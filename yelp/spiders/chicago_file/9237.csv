Art Institute of Chicago////We went through all of the modern art and impressionism, which are my favorites.  Since my school days were filled with Greek, Egyptian, and Asian artifacts, history, etc., I had little interest in seeing yet another curvy, cherub-cheeked Greek woman with ample bosoms.  My interest piqued when browsing the Monets and brightly colored, geometric, linear messes that are modern art.
