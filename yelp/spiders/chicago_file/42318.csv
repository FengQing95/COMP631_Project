Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here with our small group and had a selection of food to share (obviously since its a tapas place).  I've been to much better, but of course they were in San Francisco!  Otherwise, the sangria was very tasty, and the food was good.  Great to come with a group and have fun.  We had potatoes, squid, shrimp, short ribs, and several other items (I can't remember) but all were good!
