Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I cannot say enough good things about this place I highly highly recommend if you're in the mood for a good steak at a nice steak house located in downtown Chicago unfortunately it is usually booked so you have to make reservations at least 4 to 6 weeks in advance just an FYI from the moment we got there it was top-notch they caught us by our first name and it was my birthday so every person we spoke to said happy birthday they made it very very special from the appetizer to the entree to the drinks to the desert everything was superb I can't say one bad thing about it not even the person who kept on top of our water he was definitely on top of it he was the best so if you're in the moon definitely definitely book in advance and I highly recommend this place again definitely definitely a five star restaurant
