Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A few years ago, I was going to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba at least once a week. The food was on point and the presentation made it stand out! However, after becoming much more commercialized over the last couple of years, the food authenticity and selection has become something similar to chain restaurant quality. The last time I visited was for my birthday, I had a group of 10, a waiter crashed into my guest's chair and the entire tray of food came barreling down on her and her belongings. It was awful. They gave us coupons for our next visit. Not impressed and haven't been back since :/
