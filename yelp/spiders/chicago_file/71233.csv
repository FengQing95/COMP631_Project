Little Goat Diner////My favorite part was dessert - oh my god, this dessert, I'm still thinking about it. It sounds like the desserts are made next door in the bakery and available at the diner. We opted for a turtle mini pie (easily split between two people). It had what seemed like an oreo cookie crust, filled with cashews soaked in caramel, and topped with whip cream. When I type it out, it sounds so simple and does not do it justice, it was the highlight of the meal.
