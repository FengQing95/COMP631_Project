Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Speaking of sangria, it's delicious! And there's a bunch of different kinds, you can't go wrong with any of em. The tapas are fab, especially the bacon-wrapped dates. And the cute little dessert tapas were the perfect way to end the meal. On my go-to list for out-of-town guests or just a group of buddies looking for a fun place to eat! Ba-Ba-Reeeeeba!!
