Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Wow is my first response . We called late hoping for reservations to celebrate our anniversary. We were very happy to find we could reserve a table and my first tip is if it is a special occasion let the staff know when you make reservations , they well all warmly great you and congratulate you. But the food is what you really will Â be impressed with. We throughly enjoyed crab cakes to begin with, plenty to share for two, perfectly cooked and just mouth watering. Our dinners were broiled salmon and short rib stroganoff both outstanding , cooked to perfection and just delicious. My wife added a side of butternut squash and the serving was ample enough to share and taste like candy, superb ! So if a pleasant setting, great service and unforgettable food is what you crave , this is the place. Really hope I can return and enjoy Babette's again.
