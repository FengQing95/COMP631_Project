Little Goat Diner////We started off with the ooey gooey cinnabun and it tastes just as amazing as it sounds! My group decided to share all of our entrees so we can get a taste of everything, which I totally recommend doing. The corned beef is a classic, you can't really go wrong there. To mix it up, we tried the little piggy goes to China and we all thought it would be the perfect breakfast for a hangover, it had a nice Asian infused taste with a delicious biscuit. To end we got the creole chicken sammy and a side of pork belly home fries. Both were great, but those home fries were a show stopper to me! Potatoes were so crispy and that pork belly was soooo tasty.
