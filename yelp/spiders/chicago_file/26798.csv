Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Mediocre Pizza! Came here for my first meal in Chicago and was pretty disappointed.  Ordered their classic deep dish and their house salad.  After digging into the pizza, I could immediately tell this was a sauce forward pizza.  And although the sauce was good, it lacked balance with the "toppings", cheese, and dough.  Honestly the sauce was the star and it drowned most of the other flavors out.  But the worst part was the dough.  It was hard and lacked any kind of chew. Not sure if my pizza was overcooked but I was not impressed. On the positive side, the salad was delicious.  Came pre-mixed (as all salads should) and had great balance of sweet, savory, and acidic flavors.  In the future, I'll come back for the salad but go to Pequod's for the pizza
