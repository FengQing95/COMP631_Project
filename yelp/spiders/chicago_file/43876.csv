Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been going to this place for years, even though I don't live in the neighborhood. I think it's hands-down the best tapas in the city. The bacon-wrapped dates are fantastic, and so are the manchego-stuffed mushrooms and the little pinxtos. When you go, you must try the sangria too. I'm not usually a huge fan of sangria (too sweet), but here it is pretty much the perfect mix.
