Smoque BBQ////I'm not sure what happened here. I've always really liked this place, but today I had flavorless onion-ie cole slaw, vinegary bbq sauce, beans with way too much brown sugar and onion, pasty (instead of cheesy) mac & cheese, and the sliced brisket was dry, had a thick slab of fat on it and was burned on one end.
