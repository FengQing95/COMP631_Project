Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Having only tried Giordano's and Gino's East from our previous trip to Chicago several years ago, I can't really comment on how the deep dish pizza at Lou Malnati's compares to the other two.  I thought the pizza was decent and definitely filling.  I do remember the buttery crust being extra special compared to the other two popular joints.  I'm am only giving the place three stars partly because of the service.  I felt that it was a little disorganized since we were asked to switch tables initially.  Also, we felt that the server could've been more attentive and followed up on how our pizza was or if we needed anything else.  Perhaps I was expecting too much going in that the experience was a little underwhelming.
