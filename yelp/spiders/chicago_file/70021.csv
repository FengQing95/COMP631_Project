Little Goat Diner////I think the only thing that redeemed the experience is that another manager handed our bill to us ran the card through and since none of her coworkers did anything about our awful waiting experience I decided to tell her how long everything took.  She was super apologetic about the whole thing and comped our bill.  But even after all that, I really don't have a desire to go back.  The food was just so-so so it's not like it was that good enough that it's going to justify another experience like that.  One time is enough.
