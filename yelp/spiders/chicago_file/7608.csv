Art Institute of Chicago////I went this time to specifically check out the new CONTEMPORARY WING I was not disappointed.  The art was great; there was a great mix of 1950's modern art to pieces that were completed this year.  The special exhibit of Cy Twombly blew me away.  The collection is large, colorful and moving.
