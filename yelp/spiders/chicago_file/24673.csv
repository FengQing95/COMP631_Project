Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We decided to go to Lou's as our first stop in Chicago and we were not disappointed! The wings were amazing! We went with BBQ per our server, Angie's, recommendation and loved them. We decided to get both a small deep dish and small thin crust and enjoyed both! I preferred the thin crust because you got to taste more of the buttery, flaky crust. Service was very good and no wait at all on a Friday at lunch time. Highly recommended for travelers!
