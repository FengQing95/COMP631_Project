Art Institute of Chicago////Really great museum to visit! $25/ticket, and I think it was worth the price for the art. I loved that they had a nice mix of art through different time periods, all the way up to modern art. Everything was well organized. There were so many pieces I recognized. Also, this place is huge! My visit was only for a few hours, but you could definitely spend all day there taking your time to view different art periods. My friend and I didn't make it through the entire building. The museum store had a nice mix of things, overpriced, but as expected from a museum store. Since we came on a weekday in the afternoon, there was no line at the ticket counter. Museum itself had a pretty steady amount of people, but in no way crowded.
