Smoque BBQ////Wow, I've never had such scrumptious and authentic BBQ as this place.  My mate, whom has eaten BBQ in many states, also raves about this place.  It is the real deal.  They are so busy that you are ensured fresh and hot ribs, brisket, pulled pork, chicken, BBQ beans, cornbread, slaw, etc..  We always head West on 94 to get our fix.  It is a treat to eat there.
