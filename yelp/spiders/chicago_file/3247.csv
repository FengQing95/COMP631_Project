The Purple Pig////We stopped in for dinner here on St. Patrick's Day.  Despite the craziness of the foot traffic there, the service was darn near impeccable.  Unfortunately, I don't remember the exact name of the dishes we had but I know we had the pork shoulder, brussel sprouts, beets/cheese dish and octopus.  All were very good except the octopus.  It was just ok.
