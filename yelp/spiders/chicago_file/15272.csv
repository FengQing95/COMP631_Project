Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////In town on business, and wanted to experience Chicago pizza first hand. All the positive Yelp ratings directed me here and it didn't disappoint! Its a bit of a wait (45 min) to get a table at dinnertime, but it was well worth it. To start we polished off some buffalo wings, followed by the Lou's pizza (w/o mushrooms), as I don't eat pork. I was a bit disappointed that there were no beef options as toppings, but the pizza was still amazing. I'd definitely recommend it!
