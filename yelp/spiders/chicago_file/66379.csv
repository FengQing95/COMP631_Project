Little Goat Diner////We are from Napa, California, vacationing in Chicago. Went to Little Goat two days in a row! Both times I had a cup of tomato/apple soup. I also had mac and cheese the first day and grilled cheese sandwich the next day.  My husband had a hamburger, and on the second day buttermilk pancakes. Everything was great. Extensive, but simple comfort food. Something for everyone, and it is all delicious. Can't wait to visit again. We chose to sit outside in the shade. There was a wait both days for indoor seating.  Inside seemed crowded and noisy, so we were happy.
