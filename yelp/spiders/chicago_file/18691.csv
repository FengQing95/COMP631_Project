Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went here looking for gluten free pizza on the advice of friends and family who had lived in Chicago. The regular pizza looked amazing but the GF version's crust was barely edible. The toppings and sauce were good and fresh, but this is NOT the place for Gluten Free dining. I would give one star for the GF but raised it to three because the house salad was very good and a Texas sized portion.
