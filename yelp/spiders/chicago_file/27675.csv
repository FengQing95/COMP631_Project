Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The ambiance was nice. Service was on par. The pizza wasn't to die for. I wasn't impressed. After reading all the suggestions saying to try the deep dish pizza at Lou Malnati's, I have to say I'm a bit disappointed. If this is supposed to be the best in the Windy City, then I would rather have something else.
