Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After doing some searching around for the best Deep Dish pizza in Chicago, we finally decided upon Lou Malnati's. From start to finish our entire experience was downright awful. When we arrived we waited next to the hostess station to be seated. After a few minutes of standing there with no one helping us, finally the hostess turned to look at us and angrily said "do you need something?" Obviously, we would like to be seated, thanks for being so great at your job... When we were ordering we decided to order the "individual sized pizzas" thinking it would be enough for a lunchtime meal....we were wrong. The 'Individual' size pizzas should be called the 'child size' pizzas, because they are enough for only a 5 year old. They do not even come served in the deep dish tray, but on a mini plate. The pizza itself was good, however, there was very little of it, and we had to wait an hour for our pizza...AN HOUR for the pizza the size of my fist. We only actually received our pizza once we flagged down another member of the waitstaff. Our waitress passed by us numerous times without asking how things were, or letting us know our order was on the way. Frankly, I think she forgot about us, because for awhile she was standing against the wall of the restaurant doing nothing. When we went to pay the hostess again acted as though we were bothering her. While the food was good, I will never come back here again. The owner needs to talk to his employees about good service.
