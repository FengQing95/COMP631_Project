Little Goat Diner////I had the Bull's Eye French Toast which was amazing.  The strawberries and fried chicken were great textures and flavors to the brioche french toast, that BTW had a freakin' over medium egg inside!  The syrup was great as it was smokey, had some left over chicken stock/flavor, and offered sweetness and heat.
