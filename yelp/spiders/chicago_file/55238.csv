Smoque BBQ////Smoque is happiness. Every time my boyfriend and I decide to travel north to have BBQ at Smoque, I can't help but feel excitement. I've had the BBQ chicken and the baby back ribs-both are wonderful. The chicken is surprisingly very moist. My boyfriend always gets the half and half sandwich, with pulled pork and sliced brisket. He ususally scarfs the whole thing down before I can get a bite. Although the meat is delicious, the sides are where it is at. The BBQ beans change lives! Seriously! I know that they have changed mine on several occasions. Even the fries are incredible.
