Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////First off the bread n butter they gave was enormous, don't eat too much you will get full. We started with the Duck and Goat Cheese Terrine, BIG MISTAKE. I never had a "terrine" but I'm pretty sure its french for ground meat patty cooled to room temperature, in America I know that as SPAM, and it tasted like it.  For the LE BOEUF(STEAK)  I got the Bone Aged Bone In Ribeye crusted with Peppercorns.  It was AMAZING, perfectly cooked, juicy with a nice char on it. The steak was deff the star of the night.
