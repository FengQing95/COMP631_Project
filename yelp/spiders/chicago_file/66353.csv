Little Goat Diner////Little Goat has that wow feeling when you walk in.  High energy, fun decor.  It's like a tasteful Ed Debevics. And, we felt we were lucky to get a spot at the counter in the back where we could watch all of the food come out.  We had high expectations for the food not just because it is a Stephanie Izard creation, but also because each of the food items are so creatively assembled.  And, as the waitress explained, there is no substitution allowed -- it's american cheese on that patty melt, not cheddar, not jack.
