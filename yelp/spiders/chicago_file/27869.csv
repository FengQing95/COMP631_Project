Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza takes at least 45 minutes to make. I couldn't wait! Ordered the Malnati Chicago classic in deep dish and the Lou's in a thin crust. We were a party of 4 so we ordered mediums for both, which was too much. Smalls would have been fine for our group since we ordered two pizzas. Anyhow, they were basically the same size crust when they came out! The only difference was the end crust was taller in the deep dish. Uno's pizza is at least double the thickness! I was so disappointed! Blue Line Pizza in the Bay Area makes better deep dish pizza than here!
