Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They don't need my review; clearly they've earned their stars!  This particular place has great ambience of a renovated old building and great service.  We got there last night around 6 and had a 4 minute wait.... we left about 8 and the waiting line was all over the sidewalk.  The pan pizza was exemplary and while we waited for it to be made longer than a dominos or Pizza Hut clearly the wait was worth it
