Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm not normally a huge steak eater but the filet I had at Bavette's changed my thoughts. I now know that I like steak, I just only like steak to the level of quality at Bavette's. Go ahead, call me a snob if you must. The complimentary chocolate cake (which is definitely sized to share) at the end was the cherry on top. If nothing else, the atmosphere and interior design will mesmerize you through out your meal. Lastly, our server Sean Patrick Harris and the manager Matt Christensen offered sincere and warm world-class service from beginning to end. Bavette's is well worth the wait and money if you enjoy truly fine dining experiences.
