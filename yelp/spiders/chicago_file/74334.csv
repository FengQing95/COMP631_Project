Little Goat Diner////Great vibe, great service, and the food was delish!! The breadsticks are more like loaves of bread lol! The crab dip is divine, and if you get the AH-mazing grilled cheese sandwich, be sure to get the tomato soup to go with it. I don't even like tomato soup and I ate every drop!
