Smoque BBQ////5. I saw at least one complaint about this in the reviews here and yes it's true... you are not automatically given glasses of water when you sit down... because they do not have full table service (you aren't obligated to leave a tip, therefore). You can get water yourself from the soda machine, though. Is this really a problem?
