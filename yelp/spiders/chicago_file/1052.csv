Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Long wait but I'd say it's worth it. I had a veggie omelette with crispy hash browns. I liked that the omelette came with asparagus and broccoli, was a good combination. Upgraded my side pancakes to the special fig and walnut pancakes for only $1. Pretty good but a little dry. Portions are huuuuuggeee. Other people at the table ordered various omelets and skillets and all seemed extremely satisfied.
