Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We ordered a 30 day aged rib eye and a petite filet--both med rare. He had the rib eye with marrow and sauteed mushrooms on top. Awesome, even if you aren't into the whole weird food thing. Marrow gives it extra flavor like truffle or fat that flavors meat. I had the filet, perfectly cooked. Even at 4 oz, it was enough for me. For sides we had creamed spinach (with blue cheese), mashed potatoes and asparagus. Everything was amaze.
