Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went on a Friday night. Arrived at 6:30. They took our order at 6:38. We were seated around 7:00 and our server kept coming to say that the pizza was not ready. We ordered an appetizer and the pizza was still not ready. Evidently the 45 minute wait for pizza was extended to 1.5 hours because someone forgot to actually give our order to the kitchen. No, they did not admit this. Everyone around us who arrived after we did got their meal, ate, and left before our pizza arrived. I asked to speak with the manager, and said I wanted our appetizer and desserts free. He agreed to give the whole meal free, and said he would place our dessert order himself. He came back as we were finishing the pizza and said the dessert would arrive in 10 minutes. After another delay and more excuses, we left at 8:30, having had no dessert since it never arrived. Was the pizza good? Yes, indeed. Would I ever eat there again? NO, nor would I recommend to anyone. Such a shame that horrible service spoiled what would have been a really nice meal. Another customer told us their whole large group felt terrible eating their pizza when it arrived because we had been waiting since their arrival and were still sitting there hungry when all their many pizzas arrived.
