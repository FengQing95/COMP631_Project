Smoque BBQ////I used to live in the area over by Irving and Pulaski. This restaurant is by far the BEST bbq restaurant in this city! 5 stars, delicious food. Macaroni and cheese that is unique and mouth watering. Their sauce is better than ANY other I have ever tried. If you like pork and excellent bbq sauce then this is a place you must check out. Yes sometimes there is a wait but it is worth it. I started going there when it first opened and the owners were very kind to my husband and I. They asked us if we liked it and we found it nice that they cared so much about their food and their customers enjoyment. Can't wait to visit them again soon!
