Little Goat Diner////My friend and I were advised to come to Little Goat as the cheaper option to The Girl and The Goat. When we headed over on a Wednesday night, we figured it wouldn't be busy- were we wrong! We got thankfully got straight in, as we were willing to sit at the bar, but I would have waited days for the meal we had. We split the blue-plate special scallops and fried chicken, and had the shanghai strawberry surprise ice cream dessert. The scallops, although pricey ($23 for 6), were amazing, and the fried chicken was the best I've ever had. The strawberry dessert, though, is something that I will travel back to Chicago for. Szechuan strawberry and sesame oil gelato with candied sesame seeds- to die for. I wanted to simultaneously not eat it (to save it) and eat it (to experience the sublime tastes). I would highly recommend!
