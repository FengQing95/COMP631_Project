Smoque BBQ////I've been coming to Smoque for years . Always a smiling staff and Amazing barbecue.  Even now with the pandemic you can place your order and pull up right outside the kitchen and they are their to help you get on your way . Not sure who owns or manages the place ... But you ROCK !!!  Great customer service starts at the top.
