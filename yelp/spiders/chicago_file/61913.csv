Smoque BBQ//// However, the absolute star of the show was the smoked brisket - a juicy, fork-tender affair that tasted so delicious, it felt sinful to eat. Coming from a self-avowed "pulled pork" guy, this conclusion came bitterly at first but Smoque BBQ earned it. The brisket was bafflingly tender and exploded with flavor the moment I sunk my teeth into it. Even without sauce, Smoque's brisket outshines every barbecue restaurant I have previously been; however, add a touch of their Carolina inspired sauce, and we officially reach culinary nirvana.
