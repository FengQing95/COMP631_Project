Little Goat Diner////My fiance said that this place has the best french toast he's ever had. They top it with crispy chicken pieces and strawberries. Yum! We also got a side of the hash browns, which I got because of how many people said it was amazing. I really liked the crispiness aspect of their hash browns because I don't think a lot of breakfast/brunch places do their hash browns with this much crispiness the way that I like them to, but I'll have to say that I wasn't a fan of the cheese that they add inside it. Unfortunately, we weren't able to try too many dishes here because we were just looking for a quick meal while we were waiting for our table at Au Cheval, but I would come back to try more if I was back in Chicago!
