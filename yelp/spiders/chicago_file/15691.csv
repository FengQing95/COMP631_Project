Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is my family's favorite Chicago deep dish. I don't think it's my favorite, but it is a quality pie! The cornmeal/butter crust isn't my favorite, but other people LOVE it. The sauce/cheese/toppings are awesome, though, and of course they are cooked to order, delivered in a cast-iron pan and served to the plate by your friendly server.
