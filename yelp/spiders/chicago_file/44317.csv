Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is a great place to go for tapas. I love the food and it's a great opportunity to share food with friends and family. I have been here multiple times and can't wait for the next time I go back. Some of my favorite dishes that are MUST HAVES are the Goat Cheese baked in Tomato Sauce, the Spicy Potatoes, the Beef Tenderloin & Blue Cheese and my 2 Favorites the Prime Ribeye and the Bacon Wrapped Dates. All the portions are small so make sure you order enough tapas to fill everyone up.
