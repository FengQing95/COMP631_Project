Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Of course we did not end the night here...the ambience does not carry into the late, late hours as, say, Maude's...but this will easily become my new favorite for happy hour-ish meet-ups and such. Can I get a better steak frites in the city? Maybe. But I'm quite content here.
