The Purple Pig////The good is very good, with high quality ingredients prepared with care. The front of the house, however, is awful. Poorly trained, in attentive waiters who reach cross the table, drop utensils on guests and get defensive when asked qualifying questions. Don't come here in a date or if you are trying to impressive your guest; you will be disappointed by the third rate wait staff.
