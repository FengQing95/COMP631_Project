Little Goat Diner////I want to go back now!!  OMG, it's all delicious and there are a whole lot of great menu items to choose from.  I started with a bloody mary & it was perfect - the stuffed olive is a great treat.  I was between the fish tostadas (crisp whitefish . shallot aioli . chickpea 'n onion salad . harissa vinaigrette), parathas burrito (indian flatbread . sunny side eggs . avocado-bean salad . chili pepper sauce . sheep's milk cheddar), and the fat club (smoked turkey . ham . bacon . butterkase cheese . avocado . cabbabge & tomato . mayo . special sauce . fat toast), thanks to the suggestion from our sweet server, I ordered the fish tostadas and it was beyond amazing!  The flavors come together perfectly and I actually ate every bite which never happens.  My friend ordered the pork belly pancake (scallion pancake . house hoisin . bok choy salad . ginger maple dressing) and oh boy that could definitely be a contender on what to order next time.  Can't wait to try it again or bring out of towners here.  YUMS - hats off to Stephanie and her crew!!
