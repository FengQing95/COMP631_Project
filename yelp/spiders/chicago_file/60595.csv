Smoque BBQ////Best BBQ I've ever eaten!  The Brisket was tender and lean, the pulled pork melted in my mouth, the Texas-style sauce was tangy and thin, the best mac and cheese i've ever eaten as well (covered in buttery breadcrumbs).  There's a bit of a wait now that the place has appeared on several local and national television shows, but its well worth it.  Very Decent prices for BBQ, much less awesome BBQ.  The pulled pork and brisket were each $10 and included coleslaw and two other sides, which amounted to a decent portion of food.
