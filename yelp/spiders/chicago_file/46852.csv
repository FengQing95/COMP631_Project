Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!//// Â  My friends suggested we share the Sangria, which was surprisingly refreshing and not too sweet. After that, it's hard to know exactly happened. A parade of delicious hit our table, starting with chorizo dates and ending with a sampling of 4 of their desserts. I would like to say what my favorite dishes were(grilled squid? brussels sprouts?), but honestly each plate was as good as the one before it, and it is impossible to pick a favorite. All I can say is go, and decide for yourself. Bring a big group and a big appetite, you're in for a treat!
