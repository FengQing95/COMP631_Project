Smoque BBQ////My cousins and I come to this place whenever we're in the mood for delicious BBQ food for more reasons than one. The first being that it has so many Yelp reviews with an overall outstanding rating. If the majority of the reviews are high-rating, the business is doing something right. Secondly, the service here is awesome too! The employees are very welcoming and conscientious about their actions. They are always attentive - offer to throw your trash away, offer more sauce, looking for spots to seat you, etc. Most importantly, their food is phenomenal!!!! They have so many BBQ meats and delicious side options to choose from. I usually order the brisket, ribs, or chicken as those are my favorite types of meat. The brisket and ribs fall right off the bone - it's seriously that soft! Memphis BBQ is my recommendation for sauces. As far as sides, they are all worth trying. Personal favorites are the cole slaw and mac and cheese. In addition to that, the prices are rather affordable as well. I highly highly recommend this place!
