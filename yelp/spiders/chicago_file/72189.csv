Little Goat Diner////I am a failure.  I'm not sure how I've neglected to write a review on this amazing piece of culinary genius for so long.  Suffice it to say I love this place.  Simply put it's aaaahmazing.  So I've been here about 4 times and no matter what I get, it's just insanely good.  So let's start with a favorite.  The bulls eye french toast.  Just do it.  If you do nothing else just do it.  This delicious piece of foodgasm is reason enough to keep coming back time and time again.   The pork belly pancakes and fish tostadas are also staples that must be tried.
