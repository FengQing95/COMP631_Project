Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Dry aged ribeye was excellent as expected. Cooked perfect medium rare. Tenderloin steak tartare was great, but would have preferred pairing with chips than bread (our waitress told us that was an option after we finished the meal). Loved the Baked Crab Cake, crispy outside, juicy inside. Could have done without the short rib stroganoff (a little too salty and oily) and oysters. Peach sorbet was a refreshing finisher and a sparkler is always fun.
