Smoque BBQ////We ordered a platter with sliced brisket, cole slaw, barbecue beans, and corn bread. For more variety and better sharing, we also added a few tastes to our platter: pulled pork, Texas sausage, and quarter slab of St. Louis ribs. Everything on the platters were delicious even though I'm not generally a fan for cole slaw and beans.
