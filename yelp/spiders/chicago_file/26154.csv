Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Let me get on to the "pizza" for a moment - it is 4 star worthy food.  I would probably go 3.5 if I could, but I can't, and its definitely better than a 3.  Heck, it better be since this is the go-to for Chicago pizza...depending on who you ask.  Apparently, you can ask 20 people in Chicago for the best pizza and get 20 different answers, but that's not much different from NY.  Anyway, I got the Lou, or something like that.  It's their signature deep dish pizza with butter crust and a flavorful tomato sauce and cheese.  It's basically what you would expect a deep dish pizza to be, though I am not sure I would go with the butter crust again.  It was good, but a bit too heavy on the buttery goodness.
