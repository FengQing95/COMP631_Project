Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time to Chicago and had to have Chicago style pizza. Tried the other place, but loved Lou malnati's pizza. Crust is so flaky and sausage pieces in every bite. You need a fork and knife! One slice was plenty. Be ready to wait, lines are long and baking time is about 35 minutes
