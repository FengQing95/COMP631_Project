Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Selfishly, I am a little upset that Bavette's has gotten so much recent exposure, available reservations are now 3 months out! On the bright side, I've already eaten there twice and it is by far my favorite restaurant ever. Amazing service, delicious food, and great ambiance. What more do you need!
