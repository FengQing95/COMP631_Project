Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So my Fianc√© and I came to Chicago for a wedding. Chicago is my FAVORITE city outside of places I've lived. I got some history here. This visit was my fourth one but my first one since I started making a list of restaurants I've seen on various television shows such as "Diners, Drive-ins and Dives," "Food Paradise" and others. "Food Wars," which actually doesn't come on anymore, showcased Lou's and Pizzeria Uno so I made sure to check out both on this latest journey to the Windy City. First stop on the deep dish tour: Lou Malnati's.
