Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////While in town on business, I stopped in here with my nephew and some of his coworkers on 3-20-2018.  I knew I wanted to try some pizza this trip and this is what my nephew picked out.  This was a party of 8.  We were seated quickly, upstairs....without an elevator.  My knees!!  Our server was Kristen T.  For the table we ordered a Family Malnati salad.  For my own meal, I ordered a thin crust pepperoni and sausage pizza.  I coordinated with my nephew so that I could have a slice of deep dish pizza too.  The salad was amazingly good.  Lots of flavor, very fresh and BIG!!  The one slice of deep dish pizza was GREAT.  Good flavor.  Good temperature.  My pizza, the thin crust, came out COLD which was surprising.  So, I told a server and then the manager came over and offered to (1) reheat the pizza or (2) make me a new one.  I accepted a new one (which was complimentary).  This time the pizza came out piping hot.  Good flavor.  Plenty of topping.  Big enough for two people too.  I had iced tea and water to drink.  Next trip to Chicago I can see myself coming back again, but this time sitting on the first floor.  Keep serving up the pizza, piping hot too!!
