Little Goat Diner////I loved Little Goat because the atmosphere was both casual and elegant, fun and intimate. The decor and food was familiar and unique, like an ordinary person could enjoy without feeling like he or she didn't belong. I came with two friends and we each ordered something different: one app, one burger, and one breakfast. The food was top notch. I got the Korean burger and my friend got the pork belly and we both commented how the Asian inspired dishes were both great. Neither my burger nor my friend's pancakes came with sides, so if I went back I would splurge on a side to share. Other than that, the price is a lot more affordable compared to Girl and the Goat but you really aren't sacrificing much in terms of taste. Can't wait to try the other unique dishes!
