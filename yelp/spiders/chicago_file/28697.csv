Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////2/ if you have not been to a chicken farm in open air, you have the alternative to go to this restaurant; never seen that many service crew spending their evening counting their fingers and having no clue what their job is. We got our salad with forks but no knives to 'push it'. Napkins finally showed up way after the food, and 2 knives showed up after a while, with 2 more forks. Excellent...unless you are 3 people at the table.
