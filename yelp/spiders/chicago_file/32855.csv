Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've never been to any of Sodikoff's restaurants.  The ambience is awesome! The bar area is small and quaint. The dinning area is comfortable and menu is simple.  We split the 24 oz dry aged ribeye (medium), frites and elote style corn. It was perfect for 2 people.  You'll enjoy every bite.  If you don't have room for dessert, have another cocktail downstairs in the lounge.  It's like your in a another place, dark and intimate.  They serve food at the tables / bar area only.  If your sitting at the sofa / table area that sits on the carpet, it's drinks only!
