Smoque BBQ////Best pulled pork, best ribs, great hand cut fries, friendly staff, clean environment. Gets 5 stars for me. This place can good very busy but the staff do a good job of cleaning tables and making a quick turn around. Always good to go on off times. The biggest regret on moving out of the city is leaving this place behind. But from time to time I have to travel 45 mins to get here. It is well worth it. Try this place, you'll love it.
