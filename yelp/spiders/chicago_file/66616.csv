Little Goat Diner////Perfect. So rich, so buttery, the amount of fig just right (I sound like Goldilocks) and the pepper providing a perfect counterpoint note. Damn. It was almost a Proustian madeleine moment to bite into one. I used to eat the also-perfect scones at another biz in my review roster a couple times a week...these fig scones really took me back.
