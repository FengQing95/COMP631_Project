Art Institute of Chicago////My favorite arts were in the renaissance room. I remember learning about all those pieces in my art history class; so to be able to see them in person was beautiful and breath-taking. I was able to see a lot of famous pieces and I also saw some strange art as well, but hey.. who am I to judge what art is.
