Smoque BBQ////The brisket is the reason to go to Smoque, the sides are a reason to stay. Smoque is authentic and actually uses a smoker to cook the brisket. You shouldn't need a knife to cut it and you don't. The mac & cheese, fries, and baked beans are excellent dishes. If you're really hungry, get the fries because they give you enough to hold you over.
