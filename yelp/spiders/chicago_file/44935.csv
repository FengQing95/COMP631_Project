Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went there in a group. At first, they can't find a table to fit all of us ( 8 people) but after few mins they told us we can put tables together. I was "surprised" restaurant people didn't help us. They just told us we can sit in the area and told us help ourselves to put tables together to make our seat.
