Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I am not deducting a star for it, but definitely considered it:  the bar service before our meal was a 2 star due to the female bartender.  Mind you, the bar was half empty and we had told her we were having drinks before dinner.  Her rush to close out our check reminded me of the bars I went to in college that were selling $2 shots and were 10 people deep.  A tip to mgmt:  when you rush to close out a check with us, we won't continue to order drinks at your bar.  When we don't close out, we will order more drinks if the mood suits us.
