Art Institute of Chicago////The State Hermitage Museum of Saint Petersburg, the Louvre, La Musee d'Orsay in Paris, The National Gallery or the Tate Britain in London, the Museum of Western Art in Tokyo, The Metropolitan Museum of Art or the Museum of Modern Art in NYC, the Barnes Foundation of Philly, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and The Art Institute of Chicago.  The greatest collections of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist Art are in a few of the most excellent art museums in the world.  Travel destinations all unto their own.  If I didn't grow up in Chicago, I would travel near or far to spend the three or four full days it would take to experience this world class art museum.  Cole Porter would have wrote "You're the Top, you're the Art Institute of Chicago," only it just didn't fit as well as the Louvre Museum.  Wouldn't rhyme with, Coliseum.  There are too many strong suits here to list them all, but the Asian Art collection is incredible, the abstracts include a must see Chagall stained glass triptych, the miniature rooms are exquisite, they have so many Georgia O'Keeffes they actually lost one in their collection.  It wasn't stolen (probably), they have to find it among all the others.  This massive museum only has space for about 10,000 of their over 300,000 art objects to be on display to the public at any given time. By the way, Georgia O'Keeffe was from Sun Prairie, Wisconsin.
