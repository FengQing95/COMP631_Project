Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Visited for the first time last night and absolutely loved everything, we can't wait to go back! Though I may be biased because I love this style of eating, their tapas options are superb. We ordered a wide variety, pictured below, but our favorites were the Beef Empanada, Goat Cheese baked in tomato sauce, and Chorizo wrapped dates. We also tried a pitcher of each, the Classic Red & White Sangria, and I preferred the white while my girlfriend and our friend liked the red. In my opinion, this place is perfect for a date night or a small group gathering to enjoy some conversation and Sangria while different plates come scattered throughout your stay. To add, the prices are very good for the quality of food you're experiencing. I definitely recommend this spot!
