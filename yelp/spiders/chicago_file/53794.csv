Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My favorite dishes were their seafood ones, specifically the shrimp with garlic, olive oil, and red pepper flakes and the seared sea scallops with leeks, torched oranges, and jamon serrano. The sauce that the shrimp comes in is SO DELICIOUS. Be sure to ask for extra bread, so you can soak up every last drop! The scallops were equally just as delicious and I loved the surprising addition of the torched oranges with all the other components. However, I was really disappointed with the grilled flank steak dish, which was a little dry and tough. Will be sticking to their seafood dishes, which I thought were much better.
