Little Goat Diner////Great spot for an early breakfast with the pug! Nice little outdoor area. We went at 745 am and were seated right away. The blueberry pancakes were phenomenal!! My latte was just ok, but they refilled it with regular coffee for free. Sweet! My friend got the fat Elvis waffles, and it looked amazing but a little much for my tummy. Staff was super friendly and attentive. I love that they're dog friendly. I'd definitely go back.
