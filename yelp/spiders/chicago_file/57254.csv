Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. We heard great things about this place before coming here but overall, we felt many tapa dishes fell short of our expectation. The only notable mentions were the fried potatoes, omelet, and paella mixtas. We really didn't like the fried chicken that was drenched post-frying in some overly pungent sweet and sour sauce. The bacon wrapped in dates was another major miss as the combined taste profile just didn't make much sense and tasted strange. Also didn't make sense was the order size as each order of the bacon skewer consisted of only a single piece. What were they thinking for something so simple yet not very good!? Finally, the sangria was nothing to write home about, tasted weak and something one could easily put together using fruit punch.
