Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Excellent night here on a cozy Sunday evening. From the second we walked in we felt the buzz of this place and knew it would be a memorable dining experience. From the bone marrow appetizer, perfectly cooked filet paired with succulent lobster to the divine desserts it was awesome! Highly recommend this restaurant as a must try.
