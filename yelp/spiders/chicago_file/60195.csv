Smoque BBQ////A few minutes later we were inside and waiting to order.  The decor is nice, with the articles about Smoque from the New York Times as well as the Food Network from when Diners, Drive-ins and Dives came to film.  We got up to the counter and ordered.  I got the Pulled Pork Sandwich with a side of Mac 'N Cheese.  We moved out of the way and waited for the staff to find us a table for 7 people.
