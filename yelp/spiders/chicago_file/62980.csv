Smoque BBQ////The pulled pork was amazing. It was one of the best I've had in a long time. Carlos noticed we only got the pulled pork. I think he was sad we didn't take his advice. So he brought us over a sample of the beef brisket. Oh boy was it good. I am completely torn between two meats. I know next time I will get both.
