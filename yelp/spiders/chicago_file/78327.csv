Little Goat Diner////Great location and atmosphere, loved the sun roof and overall vibe of the Diner. They have a great menu with lots of options and not your typical breakfast foods. My bf got the French dip sandwich and loved it. I wasn't crazy about the fishy tasting seasoning they put on their fries and wish I could've opted out of that but otherwise everything was great
