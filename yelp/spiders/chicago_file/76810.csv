Little Goat Diner////5 stars for food and concept but only 3 stars for service. The guy at the hostess stand was a hot mess and not very friendly, our waitress was efficient but had an air of forced friendliness that was very off putting. Little goat diner is admittedly a refined diner but what should feel like a fun, casual, and fresh dining experience is colored by the unfriendly staff. Perhaps they were taught to be more formal, which I don't mind but it felt forced and unhappy in such a fun concept restaurant.
