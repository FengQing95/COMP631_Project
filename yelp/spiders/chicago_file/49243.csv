Smoque BBQ////The only real drawback in my opinion is the interior - it always feels like a mess hall to me and I wouldn't really ever consider eating on site.  The good news is that their take out service is great.  They will give you very specific times for pick up (sometimes in excess of 2 hours, so plan accordingly), and they are almost always on time with their schedule.  Its nice to walk in, skip the line (which is always to the door!), pay quickly and escape.
