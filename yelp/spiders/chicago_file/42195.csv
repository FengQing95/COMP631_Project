Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tried Cafe Ba-Ba Reeba for a birthday after many recommendations to try the tapas establishment out. Â Arrived earlier than my set reservation time and was happy to sit at the bar to have a cocktail to wait for my reservation to be valid, but the hostess gladly accommodated us to a table right away. For a Monday night, the place was hopping, must be good right? Ordered a variety of the small dishes to try out, knowing that Tapas is a small dish style of dining. There is not one thing I would send back, our server Velibor was very educating when introducing the menu to us. He also remembered that I made note of my boyfriend's birthday and brought out complimentary dessert. Working in the hospitality/restaurant industry myself, I was pleased that he remembered the details in my reservation request. Had an overall great first time experience. If you haven't tried the place out, do so. It seems as though they shake the menu twice a year, can't wait to come back to newly inspired dishes.
