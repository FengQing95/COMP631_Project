Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My native Chicago friends tell me that they consider this place is a tourist trap. I thought Lou Malnati's served a good deep dish pizza! This place was right on time for a couple of tourists fresh off the plane exploring a new city. It was a little pricey and I got there near closing so I had to deal with people cleaning tables while we scarfed down our pizza. Otherwise it was a good experience in a nice location.
