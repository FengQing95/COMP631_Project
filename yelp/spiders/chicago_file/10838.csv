Art Institute of Chicago////Fantastic museum! It was great to see they had some Henry Fuseli's, love his shadowy interpretations. I've seen posters, prints & cartoons amongst other media of Grant Wood's American Gothic & Edward Hopper's Nighthawks all my life, so it was great to see the actual paintings. Saw so many amazing works here. Missed all 3 versions of Van Gogh's The Bedroom, but I got to see the one he drew before he cut off his ear & sent Gauguin running! Fantastic experience. Picasso's The Old Guitarist was my favorite.
