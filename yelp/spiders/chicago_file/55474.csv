Smoque BBQ////Easily the best BBQ in Chicago.  Pulled pork, Brisket, Ribs:  all kill the competition.  Peach Cobbler, Mac and Cheese, Slaw...are all worth the trip alone.  I'm writing this after having been to EVERY other BBQ joint in the city (never had the ribs at Twin Anchors, but I've had the pulled pork).
