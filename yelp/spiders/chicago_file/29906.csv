Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the large pizza with sausage, onion, mushrooms, and green peppers and it was delicious. It had a bunch of cheese and sauce and was so delicious but not overly heavy (but I could still only finish 1.5 slices). The green pepper really helped with cutting through the grease. But overall the pizza was really delicious and of course thick. And that cheese pull though!!
