Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For the entrees the steaks were both very good, though my ribeye was sadly undercooked.  I requested medium rare, and it was much closer to blue or very rare, it was still good, but for a ribeye it definitely would have been better cooked to at least a rare, not to mention cooking a steak properly should be kind of second nature to this place.  The filet, was cooked perfectly however.  Both were very flavorful, served with extra seasoning that is not needed at all.  My only complaint is that we've had better steak at much lower price points, and the sides and hor d'oeuvres seemed to out-shine the main entrees.  (except for that horrible sweet potato)
