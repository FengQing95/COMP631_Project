Smoque BBQ////Now, the really amazing thing about Smoque is their customer service. When we got home, we realized we had gotten sausage instead of our chicken, and the people on the phone insisted on delivering the chicken to us, AND brought us a gift certificate for our troubles. So above and beyond, and we're definitely customers for life now! Totally worth the trek to support such a great establishment. Thanks, Smoque!
