Little Goat Diner////Well worth the wait! My friend and I couldn't have been happier with our selections. I had the parathas burrito and my friend had the bull's eye French toast, both were absolutely incredible! The parathas burrito was unlike anything I'd ever had and was the perfect combination of breakfast and lunch food, as well as southern and Indian cuisine. My friend loved her French toast and claims that it made her understand the hype behind chicken and waffles.
