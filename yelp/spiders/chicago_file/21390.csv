Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a few pizzas to share amongst the five of us. Two deep dish and one thin crust. The server will cut the pizza and serve everyone at your table which I thought was really convenient since it's a bit crammed inside. I was so excited for the deep dish but I really think the thin crust stole the show. It was delicious and addicting. However, the deep dish was also rich and fluffy. I loved the fact that it wasn't dense to where you couldn't enjoy it. The toppings are piled on so make sure you love what you order! I can't get this kind of pizza at home so this was a really nice change of pace. If you're new to Chicago or just visiting put this place on your list!
