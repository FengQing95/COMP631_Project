Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I started with the fantastic seafood tower for $125 which could have been good for an entire meal or a great appetizer for 4-5 people. We then had the thick cut bacon and tomato salad which was so tasty along with the bone in rib eye steak. Everything was superb and the service made it an even better experience. The thick sliced bread was also delicious. I hope the one in Vegas has this type of service along with the delicious food. I highly recommend Bavette's.
