Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started off with the bone marrow app. Can't go wrong with that right? It was delish. I wish they had large crushed sea salt to go with it though.. The bread was perfect though, I'm tired of places giving stale bread with the bone marrow. This bread was nice and soft and large.
