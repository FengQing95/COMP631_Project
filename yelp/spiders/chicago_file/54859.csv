Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////-on the pinxtos menu, the date stuffed with cheese wrapped with chorizo is to die for. Embarrassingly enough, I always order 2-3 just for myself. They have something similar on the full size menu, but it's not identical, and these are sooooo fantastic that I don't even chance it. Get more than one. It's all of the flavors you would never expect to work that just do.
