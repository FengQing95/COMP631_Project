The Purple Pig////With the location being right on Michigan Avenue, there are many places you can past the time. When we finally got the notification that our table was ready, we rushed back and was seated promptly. Upon seating, I overheard another table say that the pork shoulder was something that could not be missed. After reading the description, I knew I had to order it.
