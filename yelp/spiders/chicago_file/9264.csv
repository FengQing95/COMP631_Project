Art Institute of Chicago////I have been a member of the Art Institute going on six years and am dismayed that I have not yet reviewed it, a situation that I seek to rectify now. This cultural institution embodies the best any venue can hope to offer--visual stimulation (artworks and people watching), beautiful architecture, excellent service, education, entertainment, and even libations if one's visit happens to coincide with a special/after hours program. I came here most recently for the Evening Associates happy hour to celebrate the opening night of Christopher Williams' first retrospective photography exhibit. The exhibit was impressive in its scope, as it was a multipart exhibition spanning three galleries. I particularly enjoyed gaining early access to a specific exhibit and was enriched by the brief curator talks that accompanied the viewing. As a bonus, there was a cash bar setup offered, as this event took place on a Thursday during the museum's extended hours.
