The Purple Pig////They managed to get everyone seated and serving plates relatively quickly considering the amount of people all ordering at once. It is tapas style, and I believe our waitress said around 2 plates per person. We ordered 3 to share between the 2 of us because I don't have the biggest lunch appetite. A lot of the dishes, I liked what they did with the accompanying sides it's made with, but not necessarily the meat/seafood. The dishes definitely have innovative flavors and looked great though.
