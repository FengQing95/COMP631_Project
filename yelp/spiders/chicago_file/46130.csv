Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tapas itself is OK.  The spicy potatoes are insanely good, as is anything bacon-wrapped and the goat cheese.  The sangria was good.  The paella was kind of oily and , you know, meh, not bad, not great.  The cold potato salad was awful.  I think that the ratio is supposed to go, from greatest to smallest:  potatoes--mayo-- garic, not raw garlic-- more  raw garlic-- still more raw garlic-- some mayo or potatoes maybe. The small plate desserts we got were wonderful.  Perfect for when you want a little something sweet after dinner, but not a piece of cake as big as your head.
