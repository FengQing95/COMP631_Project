The Purple Pig////Hands down the best meal I had in Chicago. The chicken thigh kebabs are absolutely killer. So is the braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. You seriously can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and if you are feeling adventurous, the wait staff is wonderful at making recommendations. It's always packed, so either go early, or make sure you have time to wait for a table. It is most definitely worth the wait. A must-go in Chicago in my option.
