Little Goat Diner////Two of my friends and I were excited to try Little Goat Diner in Chicago while we were in town for a girls trip! We were all from out of town and weren't able to get reservations at Girl and the Goat since it was restaurant week in February. So instead we opted to go to breakfast at Little Goat Diner on a Monday morning.
