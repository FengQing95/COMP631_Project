Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Wow seriously? The place is packed, I'm sure based on Yelp reviews, that's why I went. What a huge let down. I ordered a personal size pepperoni and there were few pepperonis and lots of diced stewed tomatoes. The sauce was just ok. And the dough and crust was blah. Not worth the reviews. People wouldn't know good pizza if I slapped them in the face with it. Â And deep dish my ass. They just fold up the ends to make it look deep. Waste of time and money don't recommend going to this place, don't believe the hype. Go somewhere else. Came here starving and left here hungry. Even my 2 year old didn't like it. And kids almost eat anything.
