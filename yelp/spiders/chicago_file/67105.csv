Little Goat Diner////We went to Little Goat last weekend for Brunch and I cannot wait to go back. There were 6 of us and I was dreading an hour plus wait for what I assumed would be an over-hyped breakfast. The hour flew by, particularly with the entertainment of following our names on the list via the texted link when we checked in. They are set up perfectly for groups of 6 with large booths lining the restaurant. I personally enjoyed the Fat Club sandwich (drooling just thinking about it). Other hits at the table included the mac n' cheese (seriously the best I've ever had), the Elvis waffles, and the spiced apple pancakes. In addition we took home a loaf of the broccoli cheese bread from the bakery... a must! It's amazing. My husband and I fought over a piece of it just this morning. Do go here and enjoy. Great food, good prices, can't wait to go back.
