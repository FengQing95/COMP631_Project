Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we got back to the hotel, he was shocked that the personal size was so small and the crust wasn't really that deep. I wasn't surprised, although my pizza seemed a little more deep dish than his, maybe because I had more stuff on mine. It was so good, the sauce, the veggies, the cheese! I will say although I ate the crust, it didn't have any flavor to it. Maybe that's why they offer a butter crust option? Anyways, I will be back here for sure!!!
