Smoque BBQ////My husband was born & raised in central Texas, and while I'm a Chicago girl through & through, I lived in Austin, TX for 5 years.  After living down there and being able to taste REAL BBQ, nothing will ever compare, and Smoque didn't even come close (The Salt Lick it isn't!!!).  Unless I'm in that neighborhood and desperate for something to eat, I won't be going back.
