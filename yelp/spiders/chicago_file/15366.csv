Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I heard there was bad service here, but our waitress was great. She knew I was a damn tourist but she was nice to me anyway. She asked me where I was from and I proudly told her I was from Fresno, and she look so confused! Said to me, "I didn't know people in Fresno talked like people from Texas!"
