Smoque BBQ////The restaurant itself was mass chaos, there were groups of very loud, obnoxious post-college types swigging vodka from plastic bottles, screaming, yelling etc. etc. I thought I was at a college fraternity party. The whole experience probably would have been more tolerable if I could have got a drink myself but Smoque does not have a liquor license.
