Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great place for tapas(small plates) and good drinks and service. The Q's shared: Goat cheese baked in a delicious tomato sauce and toasted garlic bread, & beef empanada, & a special of the day "duck", Â & garlic shrimp - which was to die for. All delicious along with their delicious homemade bread, great drinks and lively atmosphere made for a great dinner. They also have many sangria to choose from and a variety of paella.
