Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////In my 200 plus reviews, I don't think I've ever described the food at any restaurant as gross and disgusting, but there's a first time for everything! And Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba gets that honor. My sister and I were in the neighborhood and I thought what kind of a Chicagoan would I be if I've never eaten here before and everyone else has. So we decided to check it out. Twenty-five minute wait on a weeknight. The smell of the grease in the air was making me nauseous before we even sat down. Ever heard of a vent hood in the kitchen? Did not like the college/teeny bopper crowd at all.
