Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As we waited for our order number to be called at Portillo's - this after having waited in a rather sizeable line to place our order - we heard numbers being called over and over again, and patrons being reminded to look at the number on their receipts.  But then, we got... the buzz.  Our number was up at Lou's and we had 5 minutes to get to our table!  We gave up on our hot dog and high tailed it back over.  Yes, we became one of those numbers... poor Portillo's.
