Little Goat Diner////Little Goat Diner is a spot that can appeal to many different tastes. I personally think it's a bit overrated. That being said, the prices are reasonable and not bad considering it's located in the heart of the West Loop. I've gotten several things from breakfast food to dinner items and overall have not been impressed.
