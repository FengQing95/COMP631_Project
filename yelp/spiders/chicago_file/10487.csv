Art Institute of Chicago////We had a great time and took a lot of pictures of the art and as a group. I got to see art that I have only seen on TV or in books. I recommend going here if you are an art lover or a novice.  The platform in which some of the art is created is worth seeing.  Open your mind and enjoy the history and beauty of the art.
