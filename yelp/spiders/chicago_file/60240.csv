Smoque BBQ////The first thing I like to try when I find a new BBQ joint is their tips and links combo. So I look up at the huge chalkboard menu trying to find it....not on the menu?! Impossible! After a couple of minutes of careful study of the board, I had to settle for the half baby back, half St. Louis rib dinner. Then I found out that they can, and do run out of food for the day. I was told they were out of baby back ribs.
