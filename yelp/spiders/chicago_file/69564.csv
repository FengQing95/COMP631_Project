Little Goat Diner////Little Goat is to diners like Instagram is to an old photo album. This place is hipster paradise, and the 8-top next to us was a lumbersexual group of mostly-bald white guys with jihadi beards out of a GQ shot. We had the bullseye French toast, a Chicago spin on the southern fried chicken and waffles, and it was over the top delicious. Also coupled hot coffee with ice-brewed cherry-heering infused coffee to get the day started with a swift kick, and I can't think of a better diner breakfast experience, ever.
