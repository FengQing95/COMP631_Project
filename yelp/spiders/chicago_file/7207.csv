Art Institute of Chicago////What an amazing place to visit.  Go to their website to see what's being displayed.  Be prepared to spend a lot of time and wear comfortable shoes!! This can easily take a whole day.  I don't suggest using the Audio which costs an additional $7.  Not all of the art work is included in the audio.  It's like an old fashion phone hanging from your neck.  A little uncomfortable.
