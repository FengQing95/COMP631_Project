Little Goat Diner////We started off with their nacho appetizer. $14, enough for three people, and DELICIOUS. Looking at the dish you'd think it would be heavy and make you feel like shit but it's actually the opposite. Every bite was packed with a ridiculous amount of flavor. The cheese sauce, the guac, the pickled onions, the shredded pork, the homemade chips that were baked to perfection. THESE ARE WHAT NACHOS SHOULD TASTE LIKE. NO SHAME. This was the first time in a restaurant that I was sad that the waiter took the almost empty plate away. "Hey! There's still a single bean on that plate" It was so good my friend ate a pickled onion off the table. The five second rule didn't exist last night.
