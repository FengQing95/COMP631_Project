Little Goat Diner////Went here for brunch and it was so busy we had to finally sit at the counter. Pretentious servers acting like it's going out of their way to serve us. By this point I'm starving and everything on the menu has 'pickled something' on it...I thought maybe they know what they are doing.... I was wrong. I couldn't even eat my omelet it was disgusting. I will not be back.
