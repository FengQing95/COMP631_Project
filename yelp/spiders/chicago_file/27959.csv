Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is my happy place when we wanna get our pig out on when its cold & we need a movie night in. We always do take out so I have no idea how eating here is. All I know is we always get the dinner salad & a thin crust medium "well done" mushroom, onion, green pepper pizza and it is always awesome. The salad is super fresh and lasts a couple of days because the house dressing is on the side, might I say the dressing is incredible. The pizza does not last as long... sadly... sniffle, sniffle.
