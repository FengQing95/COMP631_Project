Smoque BBQ////The bbq here is really good.  I got the sliced brisket platter with a side of mac and a side of fries.  The brisket was saucy and very tender - almost too tender, verging on stewed.  The mac, though tasty, was too small of a serving to be satisfying.  The serving of fries was a good size, and the fries were delicious - skin-on and cut not too thick/thin.  Great cole slaw - I dislike the normal mayonnaise variety, but Smoque's was tangy and refreshing with absolutely no mayo.
