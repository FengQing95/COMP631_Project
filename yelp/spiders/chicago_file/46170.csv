Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Absolutely divine.  Careful and don't order too much!  Those little dishes add up money wise and food wise.  The brunch is also awesome.  It's like I have to make sure all my friends have been here.  I've come here alone and ordered their seafood paella to go.  It's so good.  Avoid peak times.
