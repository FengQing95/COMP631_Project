Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Like everyone says, the wait is long but there is a decent spot outside to do your time. Our server seemed frazzled... We waited a very long time to put our drink order in and then a very long time to actually get the drinks. The food came out quick. It was decent but nothing really special, forgettable. I did however have the best cup of black coffee and the fresh squeezed oj was yummy!
