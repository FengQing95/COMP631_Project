Little Goat Diner////I may be being a little harsh on this place because of just how much it seems like it's trying to skate by on the reputation of the nearby and affiliated Girl and the Goat. This place is good, fine, whatever -- but if you've made it this far, save your money, make the leap, and get a reservation for dinner at the Girl and the Goat across the street.
