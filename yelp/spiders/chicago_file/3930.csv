The Purple Pig////The Star Wars fan in me made the Rebel Scum cocktail and no-brainer to start with. It was an excellent combination of Buffalo Trace Bourbon, Borghetti Espresso Liqueur, demerara and Bertagnolli Grappa di Amarone. We later moved on to the Colombian Old Fashioned Â which was 13 Parce 8 Year Rum, Cruzan Black Strap Rum and Amaro d'Arancia with Demerara. One of my top 5 cocktails of all time. I think I could have had 10 (I think I may have).
