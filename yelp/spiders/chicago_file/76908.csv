Little Goat Diner////While our actual waitress was very sweet, the other staff weren't as attentive. Twice we had to ask someone to fill our waters because we had gone so long without any during our meal. Also, I asked for a new fork once they brought our food and I never got one. I think the staff was overwhelmed at it being so busy.
