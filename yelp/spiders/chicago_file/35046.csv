Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////There is just really nothing special about Bavettes that distinguishes it in any way from the majority of cookie cutter steakhouses in Chicago.  It is so been there done that...pick an overpriced 24 oz steak. Pick a couple sides. Big woop. If i want an old school french vibe steak frites, I'm going to Le Bouchon, which feels so much more authentic, and they happen to do a lot of other great dishes just as well.
