Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The beef was perfect, as expected. The octopus tasted like fish sauce. I remember trying a Spanish restaurant in NYC which marinated its pork in fish sauce, and didn't get it then. I'm not offended by nuoc mam, but seriously, what is it doing in my Spanish meal? My 2 year old, however, loved the Vietnamese infused octopus, and ate most of it.
