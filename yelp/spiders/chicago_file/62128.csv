Smoque BBQ////Tried brisket, pulled pork, sausage, beans, fries, and the slaw.  Loved the slaw and the fries, but there is a serious problem if that is the best thing on a BBQ tray.    Beans had a funny flavor -- just not good and couldn't eat them.  The sauces were solid, again not great.  All three of us in the party felt the same way.
