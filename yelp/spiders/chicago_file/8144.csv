Art Institute of Chicago////However, everything my Dad and I went to see was still open. We had a blast wondering around looking and stopping at the Touch Gallery, which had certain pieces on display that everyone could touch. My two favorite pieces here were the Joan of Arc statue made of bronze and Aida who's face was made of bronze, but her Vail was this beautiful marble that was carved to look like folds. Amazing.
