The Purple Pig////I came here back when indoor dining was still a thing. I had heard the food was absolutely delicious here and they did not disappoint. We got their crispy pig's ear and potato ice cream and caviar with a bottle of riesling. Everything was delicious and the flavor combinations were so unique! Who thinks of potato ice cream let alone combining it with caviar?? But it all ended up working really well together. The riesling was also really good and paired well with the food.
