Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The best deep dish pizza in Chicago, period. I don't care what they tell the tourists about Giordano's but I've grown up with Lou's and it never disappoints. It is technically "Pan" pizza but it has thick layers of cheese and tomatoes (not just tomato sauce). The salads and other dishes are great as well but the pizza is the star. Also, for those of you cutting carbs, I recommend the "meat-za" which is a layer of sausage with all the pizza toppings, instead of crust.
