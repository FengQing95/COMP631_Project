Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We started off with the white peach sangria which was amazing. Not too sweet and perfect for a hot night. A half pitcher was enough for the two of us. We ordered six dishes. The deviled eggs(5/5), calamari (3/5), cooked salmon with dill (2/5), beef empanadas(5/5), the steak with chimichurri (3/5), and the spicy potatoes (3/5). My favorites were the deviled eggs and the empanadas hands down! The rest were delicious but I'd probably order something else my next time around to try something new. Â
