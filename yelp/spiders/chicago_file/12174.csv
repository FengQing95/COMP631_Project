Art Institute of Chicago////Absolutely one of the best museum experiences you can have in Chicago, and Illinois as a whole. So many masterpieces. It's definitely difficult to manage time, there's so much to see. So plan ahead do you know what you want to do/see before you get there. Buy your tickets in advance to save time! If you have kids, do a journey maker in the family room, then use the journey maker to decide what you see. I always love that the JOURNEYMAKER leads us to pieces that we haven't seen before, and we've been here many many many times!
