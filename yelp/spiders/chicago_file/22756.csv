Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When in Rome... eat Roman pizza. In the city for a conference and lacking any real knowledge of Chicago haute cuisine, I do the tourist thing and seek out two things: Chicago dogs and Chicago pizza. Having accomplished the former, I turn to Yelp to search out a reasonably well-rated place within walking distance of the conference. And thus I find Lou Malnati's, on whose shoulders I must place my entire opinion of Chicago-style pizza.
