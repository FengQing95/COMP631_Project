Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////There were so many good interesting choices from the menu.  I didn't order the pancakes/waffles.   Imagine that when all I could think of this place as the Wildberry Pancake House but my kids did so I was able to get a few bites in.  I had the omelette with figs, applewood bacon and aged havarti cheese - it was huge and delicious.  The portions served were all huge.  If I have known, I would have ordered one dish say waffles and have them split the meal.
