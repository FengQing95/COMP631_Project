Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went here with a group last week, a few from out of town.  So where do you take someone from out of town, Lou Malnati's of course.  Everyone loved the pizzas!  Stuffed spinach bread and comb. platters are great starters.  Malnati's salad is goes along great with the pizzas.  Never been disappointed.
