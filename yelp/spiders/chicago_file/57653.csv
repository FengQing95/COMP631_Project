Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////To start off with, I got the pinxto platter, and I was such a fan of the Bacalao Croquette and the Deviled Egg. For our tapas plates, as there was only two of us, we got 4-one from each of the sections. We got the spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms, moroccan spiced lamb kebabs, seared sea scallops, and the chicken and ham croquetas. I was a fan of all of them, especially the croquetas and scallops. The croquetas practically melted in your mouth, and the scallops were just the right consistency.
