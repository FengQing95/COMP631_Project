Art Institute of Chicago////The museum I recommend to everyone who visits Chicago is this one.  It is one of the greatest American art museums, with a huge, varied collection to appeal to the interests of almost anyone.  You can easily spend a full day here on the resident collection, more if there's something on exhibition.
