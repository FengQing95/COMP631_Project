Art Institute of Chicago////To be honest, I could leave or take modern art.  However, that's not why we went.  We saw Monet, Van Gogh, Manet, Renoit, Serat, and more.  Yes, we went to see the impressionists.  It was a great collection.  It was kind of surreal being around those pieces.  Worth the entire ticket price alone in my opinion.
