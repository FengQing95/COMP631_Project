Little Goat Diner////I was super siked to try this place out.  I was nervous upon arrival that we would have to wait, but thankfully we were seated immediately.  Our server was so nice and friendly that I wish I could give little goat more stars... but my hash sandwich was bad.  Really bad.  Like eating a block of salt.  All my friends really loved their breakfasts.  I guess I just jumped on the grenade.
