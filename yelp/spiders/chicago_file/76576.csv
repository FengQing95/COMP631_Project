Little Goat Diner////They squeezed us in on a Saturday night after spending an afternoon on the roof for goat-toberfest!  We ordered the braised beef sandwich (Los drowned) and fish tostadas. My oh my, we will be back tomorrow. So good, so good, so good!  Thanks to Justin (from NJ) and crew (you can tell when the restaurant peeps have good training and great attitudes plus the love in the food is generous - but I digress) for some great food and authentic diner ambiance.
