Art Institute of Chicago////Four stars because Â - You need to walk and walk. They have a cafeteria located in the lower level and given the size of the building walking to the cafeteria itself may take 20 minutes. Also they have food rules, that we have to eat and drink only in the cafeteria that is frustrating. Yes I hear their reason, that our food may spoil their art. But at least they must have small food stations in each floor so that we can eat snacks or drink water. This food rule is a pain if you are traveling with kids or elders.
