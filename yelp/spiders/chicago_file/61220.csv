Smoque BBQ////Yes, granted, there can be a line out the door at times, but its worth the wait. Besides, its not a long wait typically. While the ambiance is very relaxed and its BYOB, there's nothing all that remarkable about the location. It's clean, well attended, and love that they have someone get you seats when you order & time your seating with it. You never feel rushed and leave feeling satisfied with your Q feast.
