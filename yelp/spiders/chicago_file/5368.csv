The Purple Pig////I was nervous to taste the pig ears but I actually really liked it! They had a macaroni salad in the middle of the two pieces which really balanced the flavor. On to the broccoli, this was soooo good. The sauce on top was something that I'd never tasted before. The broccoli was also charred which gave it such a great flavor.
