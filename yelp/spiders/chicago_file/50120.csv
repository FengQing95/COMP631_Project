Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been coming here for years and never wrote a review. The last couple of years this place has been hands down 5 stars! I would tell all my friends that this is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Everything was absolutely delicious! However....I came here tonight and was shocked that the place was half empty! In the past I would have had to make a reservation weeks in advance! Tonight I made the reservation Â 2 hours before for a 7pm dinner.
