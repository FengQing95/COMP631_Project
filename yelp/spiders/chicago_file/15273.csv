Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was the best pizza by far that we have ever had. Not only was the pizza outstanding, the house salad was amazing. It was fresh romaine accompanied by olives, tomatoes, bacon bits, a light dusting of feta (I'm not usually a feta fan but this was delicious) and a house made Italian dressing to die for. All ingredients were perfectly cut to give you a little bit of each in every bite. The service was great too. We went on a Wednesday night and waited exactly 35 minutes which they told us was our estimated wait time. They text us when our table was ready and had us put in a pre-order for our pizza to get it cookin. They've got a good system down. Â We had a beer from the bar as we waited for our table. That was no wait at all even though the place was packed. Very friendly staff. We will be headed back here for sure the next time we visit Chicago.
