Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////An excellent spot with great ambiance and superb food. Although the menu may seem conventional and with a large French influence, dishes are defined by their classic American twists. In order to enjoy your meats to the fullest, order them as rare as you're willing to go - doneness seems to be a bit higher than what would be expected either way.
