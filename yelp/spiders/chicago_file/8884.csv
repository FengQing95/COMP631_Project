Art Institute of Chicago////Beautifully arranged, the galleries feature a large collection of up to 5,000 year old pieces from ancient egypt and china, to 19th century france. Â you will find many Rembrandt's, Dalis, and Van Goghs here, though my personal favorites are the Renaissance, and romantic/victorian era galleries
