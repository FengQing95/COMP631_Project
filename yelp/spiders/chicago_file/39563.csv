Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////If you are trying to ruin your taste buds, or just your dining life, go here. We are completely ruined now. Bavette's is like no other! They are just so amazing, from the service to the food to the ambiance, to every little detail. You'll never have to worry about your cup of water being empty, ever! Our waitress was great at first, and then towards the end of the night, she didn't really come around. Our buss boy was amazing. He was so funny and kept us entertained. The chef is so great! We went there for our anniversary and they spoiled us! Their bone in ribeye was melt in your mouth amazing. I got the honey glazed salmon and that was damn good too! Their sides are of the sharing size! The chef gave us a complimentary side of their amazing garlic herb mashed potatoes & then later he gave us complimentary dessert! Their smoked salmon Caesar is BEYOND delicious. We are definitely ruined now. Everywhere we go, we are gonna expect service and food like Bavette's! I think we've found our favorite steakhouse here in Chicago! They are VERY popular so I would not walk in. The first time we saw Bavette's, there was a 3 hour wait! Make reservations! I made mine 2 months out in advance! But, it was so worth the wait!
