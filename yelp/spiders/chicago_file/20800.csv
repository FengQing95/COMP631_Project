Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////OMG sooooo DELISH!!!  Even thinking about the gooey cheesy, perfectly sauced pizza with just the right amount of crisp to the crust is making my mouth water... I want to go back to Chicago just for Lou Malnati's pizza!!!  And guess what???  The salad, the salad is to die for too!  Wha!?!?  Yes, the salad... amazing...
