The Purple Pig////The first thing to mention about Purple Pig is their amazing collection of drinks, ranging from cocktails, different kinds of wines and beers. Based on their menus, they have over 100 options of drinks. Besides, they also offer the wine/beer of the month to highlight their seasonal offerings. I had an Oktoberfest beer (local Pale Ale, the beer of the month) and it had a very fresh and thick taste. I enjoyed it a lot and highly recommend to get a drink here.
