Little Goat Diner////Stepahnie... you don't know me, but I love you. You're like Wendy. But instead of telling me stories you feed me food. Everything about my brunch experience this morning was wonderful. Loads of natural light flooded in through the huge windows at the front and side of restaurant and collided with that from the skylight above. The space has an aura of cleanliness, comfort, and bubbling effervescence.
