Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When I lived in Chicago, my family and I always had Lou's pizza every Friday, and, boy, was it good. The waiters were always dressed well and always put 100% effort into cleaning a table after a family was done eating there. They were also so efficient to accidents like if someone dropping a pizza after getting bumped or a drinking spilling. I had friends back in Chicago tell me how they were doing and they explained that Lou Malnati's not only limited seats to keep social distancing but also made sure all workers had masks and gloves on. They suggested that guests wait outside where they can social distance more easily while waiting for a table.
