Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Coming from New York, we were really excited to try Lou Malnati's Pizzeria and see what the hype was all about. Unfortunately, the pizza came out COLD and was extremely disappointing. After waiting 45 minutes for our table with an additional 20 minutes after we pre-ordered the pizza, the deep dish should have came out smoking. Crossed it off the bucket list, but I'll never be returning.
