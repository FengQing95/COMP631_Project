Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Short ribs and mashed potatoes, I'd get these just for the mashed potatoes! The short rib was good but nothing I just had to have again. And my least favorite thing we ordered were the chicken & ham croquetas. There was nothing special about them. They looked frozen and not fresh like everything else that came out. My friend really enjoyed them though.
