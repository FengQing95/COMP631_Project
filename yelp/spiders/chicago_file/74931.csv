Little Goat Diner////The reason. I parked outside...three spaces easily. The parking valet asked for my keys and $16. I pointed out that you don't need a valet parking when your car is 10ft from the door. His belligerent look and facial tics convinced me this was going nowhere. I left and I won't be back. Robbery from a highly rated restaurant is never on my menu.
