Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our first visit to this pizzeria and I can't say enough good things about it.  My daughter, who usually only eats cheese pizza, ordered the Malnatis Chicago Classic deep dish pizza, and she loved it!  I tasted it and the sausage was out of this world!  I've never tasted sausage like that before, and no fennel seeds!  I had a deep dish pepperoni pizza and it too was excellent - I recommend getting the buttercrust - it is wonderful!  Our waitress was terrific as was the rest of the staff.  We will be back!
