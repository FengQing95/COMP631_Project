Art Institute of Chicago////Time to spare before the airport but not enough time to see this magical place. The paintings , art are incredible. A must see. Paid $25 dollars for entrance fee plus additional $7 to see Special exhibition of John Singer Sargent. Was able to see Monet, Manet and van Gogh, Seurat and my favorite.......Jean Leon Gerome for the Portrait of a Woman.
