Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Unbeknownst to me, the day I decided to try this place out also happened to be Valentines day.  As you may have guessed reservations cannibalized all seating until after 9 P.M. So I decided to sit by the bar, which has a pretty warm and welcoming appearance.  I had recently separated from my significant other, so I was pretty uncomfortable sandwiched in between 6 couples celebrating the dumbest holiday ever created.  As I sat on my thirteenth wheel throne, I was greeted by one of the bartenders who graciously handed me a menu. Problem is, she followed that by asking me "are you waiting for someone or dining alone?" Of course I am dining alone, I am sitting in the middle of the bar with no open seats to my left or right and I am the only male in this entire establishment not wearing a button up shirt.  At this point I am pretty paranoid that people are staring at the back of my head, either feeling sorry for me or making themselves feel better by judging my current romantic station. Quickly, I ordered a Tequila on the rocks, followed by another within a minute or two.  It is not that I have forgotten about the eyes in the room, rather, I have come to terms that they will follow where I go, as they always in my life, scrutinizing my lack of charm or behavior found appealing to the opposite sex.  I ordered a medium rare Chicago rib eye and a side of creamed spinach.  The steak was cooked to specification and was rested before a waiter brought it out.  The creamed spinach was very good, definitely in my top 3 of the same offering from Chicago steakhouses.  The portions of the sides were definitely for two, so be wary about ordering with your eyes.  They have an additional bar with booth and table seating on the lower level.  If you do not have reservations, it is probably best to show up before 6:30 or after 9 as the restaurants location and food is prime.
