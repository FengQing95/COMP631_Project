Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have to get a Lou's deep dish every time I'm in Chicago but I have to admit I wasn't absolutely in love with my pizza this time. Perhaps it's just this location because I've never been here before but the pizza was on the very soggy side. Â Service was fantastic though. Our server was really attentive and funny.
