Smoque BBQ////So far, one of the few best bbq in Chicago. I recommend the sliced briskets and the pork. For their sides, I'd go with mac & cheese and peach cobbler. If you get the dinner portion, it comes with their coleslaw (made from scratch) which is really good and fresh. I thought their beans were a bit sweet and the fries and cornbread weren't too different from any other restaurants. It's BYOB and it's packed during the evenings but they're good with their seating system. Sometimes the line starts from the outside so dress warmly for the winter. It'll be like a 15 min wait but it's worth it.
