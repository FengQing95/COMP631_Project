Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We sat down, ordered a drink, knowing we wanted to split a 9 inch traditionally sausage and cheese pie, we ordered a house salad to split. Out of nowhere, this salad came from left field, what with it's slightly sweet dressing and it's blue cheese crumbles and veggies. It was SO good. We split the salad. Now I must say the waiter warned us before hand of the wait time, but besides peeking duck, I don't know another food you need to order so damn far in advance at a restaurant. haha.
