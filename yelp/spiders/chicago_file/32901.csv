Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////DH and I rarely get a Saturday date night out these days so, when we do, we like it to be special. Well, let me say that from the minute we walked in the door to the minute we left, we were treated exceptionally well (most notably when the hostess almost sat us next to two women who were dining with a BABY but realized before we even said anything that this would be a less than ideal table for a romantic night out--that's why we left our baby at home--and moved us to a quieter table next to Mr. Sodikoff himself) and enjoyed (almost*) everything.
