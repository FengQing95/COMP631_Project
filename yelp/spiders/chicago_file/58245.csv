Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love this place! pitchers are great size worth the money and every dish we tried was amazing! i would skip the olives and go for the calamari,bacon wrapped dates and of course the wagu beef with truffles! the spicy potatoes with tomato aioli were also so good! very filling place I would stick with their recommendation and get at least 3 plates per person. overall fun atmosphere and with the heaters and tents up it wasn't cold at all
