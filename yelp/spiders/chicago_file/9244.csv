Art Institute of Chicago////Being a self proclaimed "museum snob" considering all the choices we have here in the SF BAY AREA, I will say for a fact that the Art Institutes of Chicago FREE FRIDAY HAPPY HOUR (held between the hours of 5pm-9pm on select Friday nights) is a worth while event to attend. A diverse crowd of different ages and races. Lots of cultured beautiful women walking around, dressed to kill.... lol
