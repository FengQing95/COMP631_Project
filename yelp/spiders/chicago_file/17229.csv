Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place lives up to the hype, it's a kick back pizza place to enjoy some authentic pizza. You can really tell they only use fresh ingredients; nothing processed or artificial. Don't be upset about the wait time to get food, it warns you on the menu that it takes about 30min, remember this is REAL pizza, not Dominos/Pizza Hut.
