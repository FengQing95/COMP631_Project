Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We went for Sunday breakfast-long line but we were expecting that. When we finally got seated ordered the corned beef hash which was very good BUT had to pay an extra $1.75 for real maple syrup. At a pancake restaurant???? Really???? And the pancakes were way too sweet let alone with the powdered sugar on top. Yuck. Our waiter never asked how our meals were-I got the feeling he just didn't care. Still haven't found a breakfast place to compare with Walker Bros.
