Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The food here is great! The veggie deep dish pizza tastes good (always a fan of mushroom + pizza) and their BBQ chicken salad was delicious and tasted fresh (A+ for crunchy leaves)!! Not a huge fan of the bruschetta though bc I didn't expect it to be cold. There was a huge line outside for Saturday lunch and the pizza does take a while to come out, so definitely come early and order things to eat as you wait for your pizza!!
