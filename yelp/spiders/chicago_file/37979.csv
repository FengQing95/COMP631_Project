Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Now the food is AMAZING. We had a wedge salad, which I usually never order, and it was the best salad I have ever had. Like ever. Would go back just for the salad! We then got our meat and mine was delicious. I will say it was a little undercooked for my liking, but I was splitting my steak so I kept my half the way it was. If I were to go back I'd get medium instead of medium rare. Our sides were all delicious! I don't think you can go wrong with anything here. My colleagues had fish and other dishes and they loved them as well.
