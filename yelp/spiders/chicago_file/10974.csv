Art Institute of Chicago////Institute of Art Chicago is any art lovers dream, holding works from Warhol, Chagall, Picasso, Matisse, Dahli, Kandinsky, O'Keefe, Van Gogh, and Seurat. It is located in Grant Park and is one of the oldest and largest art museums in the U.S. My friend and I had visited during a weekend trip in Chicago. We purchased city pass, 5 attractions for $106, about $21 a piece, a great deal. You can purchase City Pass online or at any of the participating attractions where they give you a booklet. Don't rip out the tickets in the booklet or else it will not be accepted. We were on a time crunch since we were meeting with a group of other people and were fitting in a large amount of activities in a weekend so we only had an hour to spare. With admission, you are given a small listening device that plays auditory commentary for specific paintings/exhibits indicated by a symbol and corresponding number to be inputed in the device to listen to the commentary. You are also given a map of the museum that indicates the location of major exhibits and pieces. Since we were in a time crunch, we wanted to hit all of the major pieces but the setup of the museum was a bit tricky. The famous pointillism piece Sunday Afternoon on the island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat was a challenge to find. We kept receiving conflicting contradictory directions in locating the painting from various museum staff, since you have to loop around various stairs to find it in a different building but eventually we found it, and it was breathtakingly beautiful. One member of the museum staff recommended starting with modern art and finishing with Impressionism but honestly there wasn't a lot of works upstairs in modern art besides Â The Old Guitarist by Picasso and a few Matisse and Dahli paintings. Next time I would begin with the Impressionism wing which is immense and you could honestly get lost in for hours. The Monet section was definitely my favorite with Water Lilies, Haystacks, and several other beautiful pieces. Van Gogh's self portrait and The Artist's Bedroom and several Georgia O'Keefe paintings, and Edward Hopper's Nighthawkes were also in this vicinity of the museum so I would definitely recommend beginning with exploring the Impressionism wing first and finishing with the Modern Art wing so that you have more time to explore. Great museum, with amazing art. I would love to return when I have more time to linger, just wish that the setup/layout was a little more straightforward. Would also love to return to see American Gothic which is currently on tour in New York.
