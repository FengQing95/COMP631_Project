Smoque BBQ////I found Smoque at Revival Food Hall. As a native Texan, I am generally skeptic of barbecue spots outside of the south. In order to gauge authenticity, asked the food line workers if the owner or chef was from Tennessee, Texas, or Carolina, considering their three sauce options. They didn't know, but directed me to the owner, Barry, who was sitting at the end of the counter. He was very friendly and chatted with me a bit. He explained that he was from Chicago, but spent some time in central Texas, which inspired their smoked turkey. He gave me samples of that and the sliced brisket (unfortunately they were out of the sausage). The brisket was fantastic - so tender! I highly recommend it.
