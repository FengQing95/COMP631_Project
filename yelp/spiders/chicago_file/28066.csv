Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza here is pretty great! We were in Chicago for a day and made sure to carve out enough time to stop by lou's. We got a classic pizza with bell peppers and black olives and their house salad with no salami. All the food was vegetarian and the servers were more than happy to accommodate. It was busy when we got there, so I would recommend ordering up at the front while you're waiting for a table so you don't spend ages waiting for your food. The pizza wasn't too cheesy and had a good balance of flavors. We loved it to much we got another pizza to go for back home!
