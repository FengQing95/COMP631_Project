Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Final verdict: Lou Malnati's Â is so much better than Giordano's. The Malnati Chicago Classic pizza blew the deep dish pizza served at Giordano's. It wasn't only the golden brown buttered crust, but also the fresh ingredients (particularity the sauce) which made my experience worth the 5 stars of this review.
