Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Checked this place out due to all the reviews and overall it was a bit disappointing. First, it's very crowded and when you come in they tell you wait by the bar until your table is ready except there is no room at the bar to wait in so you can't really get a drink or wait anywhere. The food itself is good. Had the steak tartare and the dry aged rib eye with creamed spinach. Steak was good but didn't stand out from any other steaks in other highly rated steakhouses. What stood out was the creamed spinach. With caramelized onions it added another depth if flavor which I enjoyed. What was disappointing was the staff. My waiter and another person (maybe a manager) were bitching about the ppl next to me not getting up fast enough after their meal was finished. Yea I get that you need to turn tables but if you're gonna bitch about your customers then do it in the back where ppl can't hear you. Do I recommend this place? I'm not sure. For me I will check out other steakhouses before returning to this one. I feel like I'm being a bit harsh on this review but I expected a lot more because of the all the highly rated reviews.
