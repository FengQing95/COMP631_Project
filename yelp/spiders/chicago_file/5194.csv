The Purple Pig////I'm generally not a big fan of desserts but knew I had to try the Sicilian Iris, which was a fried donut stuffed with ricotta and chocolate chips. Cutting open the dessert was glorious, and the taste matched the appearance just as well. I loved how creamy the filling was without being too sweet.
