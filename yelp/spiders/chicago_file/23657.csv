Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Delicious but heavy ! Definitely bring your stomach!  While the food was great, it takes awhile to get your food. I  came around 3pm and we ordered food at the pre order place, but it took an hour before the food finally arrived. When we asked about the status of our order, they told us " it'll arrive when it'll arrived " so that was unhelpful. Also the calamari was good but it's different - the breading is like fried chicken in feel.
