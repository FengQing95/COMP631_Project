Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is simply one of the top three museums in the United States.  Moma, the Met, and here.  It is that good.  For anyone who can actually appreciate art and history it is a necessary stop for the Chicago visitor.  Hopper, Sargent, Van Gogh, and a dozen other works that you have seen photos of but once you see in person, can truly appreciate.  If you even have a passing interest in the Impressionists then save yourself the money for a ticket to France and go see the best collection that is not on the banks of the Seine.
