Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Very traditional and epic Chicago deep dish pizza! One of my friends recommended that I try this and Giordano's while there and decide which is better. To be completely honest, they're neck in neck. They don't take reservations but you can join the queue and place your order so it can cut down your wait time to get food for when you're seated..which is a huge help because Chicago deep dish usually takes 45 minutes to prep and service generally.
