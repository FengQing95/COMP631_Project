Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We arrived when the lunch crowd was starting to fade.  Service was quick and friendly.  Even though our waitress forgot a couple items, she promptly returned with the request items.  The food itself was OK.  The Salad was OK as was the pizza.  With the pizza, the sauce was great and the crust was deep and crispy.  However, working towards the center of the pie, it just got soggy.
