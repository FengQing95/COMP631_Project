Little Goat Diner////The wait: We arrived on a Saturday morning just before 10 am. We put our names down (party of 3) and were told 45 minutes. Ok not that bad. Went next door to the very cute bakery where we grabbed a coffee and a coffee cake and proceeded to wait...and wait...and then wait some more. 45 minutes after we initially checked in I went to the hostess stand to get an update, she looked for me name and then said "it'll be 45 minutes..." Wait. What? You said 45 minutes, 45 minutes AGO. She double-checked her little screen and said oh sorry, just give me 15 minutes...well, 45 minutes LATER we were finally seated. Long waits are kind of annoying but what is more annoying is when the wait time is DOUBLE the time you are quoted...it was a lazy Saturday (and it also happened to be my birthday) so we were sort of ok just lounging around waiting but no one acknowledged or apologized for the delay...I definitely want to go back but it'll have to be on another day when I have hours to waste just waiting...unfortunately, those are few and far in between.
