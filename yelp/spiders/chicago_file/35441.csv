Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've been going to Chicago for many years and this was my first experience at Bavette's.  Been to many steakhouses and this by far was the best experiences in a steakhouse.  Water never went dry, service was impeccable and food was second to none.  I highly recommend a visit to Bavette's on your next visit to Chicago.
