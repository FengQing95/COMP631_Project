Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!
