Art Institute of Chicago////The value of the Art Institute of Chicago according to the Go Card was $42.  I calculated this to be $35 for a Fast Pass Admission and $7 for the non-member audio guide rental.  General Admission would have been $20.  We purchased this alongside 360 Chicago ($20.50) for $50 - a savings of $12.50 purely numbers-wise.
