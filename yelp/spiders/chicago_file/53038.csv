Smoque BBQ////Im from st. louis originally and this is deffinantly in the same vein, apply you own sauce, slightly spicy, not to sweet, goodness...people say the brisket is the best but i just love ribs, so im gonna say the ribs then brisket, haven't had the pulled pork but friends have they said its good, and the new texas sausage is great, just really good flavor all around...
