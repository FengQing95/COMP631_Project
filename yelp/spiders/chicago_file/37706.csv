Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We've been here for birthday dinners twice and it is definitely a place worthy of a special occasion. Steaks are some of the best in the city. Bone marrow appetizer is out of this world. My husband loved the old fashioned. The corn casserole was my favorite side and the fish specials are also solid if you are looking for a healthier entree. The only thing we didn't care for as much was the fried chicken, which was also supposed to be one of their specials. Overall though we think this place is one of the best steakhouses in the city
