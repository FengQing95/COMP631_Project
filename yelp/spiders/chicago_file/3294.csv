The Purple Pig////roasted bone marrow with herbs - I grew up eating bone marrow, no joke. Cantonese people love making soups out of big bones and we'd suck on the bones for the bone marrow, which is believed to be highly nutritious. So in my memory, there is no way bone marrow would not taste good. This dish is a bit of a let-down because of my familiarity with the food. If you have never tried bone marrow, you should give it a try. The consistency and almost buttery flavor of the bone marrow are so unique you would appreciate that there is complimentary bread and salt. Essentially it is like a spread now that I think more about it... rather expensive spread, that is.
