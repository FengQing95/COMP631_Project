Art Institute of Chicago////I love museums. Especially this one, I love art. No matter how many times I stop in, I am truly in love with this building. Just walking up the stairs, I feel a transformation and once I am enter those doors, I feel alive. This location is perfect location in Downtown Chicago. The lions in front of the building are always a welcoming sight. The entire building is amazing, the grounds are well kept. A perfect summer or spring or late fall is a perfect time to visit. You could never go wrong with a visit. The Art Institute of Chicago stands out. I have paid admission to enter and it is worth. But also you gotta love the free museum days, were the admission is free for IL residents. Either way being here is a lifetime and beautiful experience. Thank you.
