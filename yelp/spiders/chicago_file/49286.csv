Smoque BBQ////The problem with Chicago is no one can do BBQ and this place has no exception. Cold, dry, chopped pork. The sauce is a mix of a typical BBQ sauce/paste with some vinegar, which is just enough to drive this city wild with excitement calling it revolutionary. Do yourself a favor and buy a plane ticket with the money it would cost you to purchase a sandwich here and fly to any place in the south and figure out what real BBQ really is before ranting and raving. This place isn't diverse or anything special, it's truly just a cash crop for the owners and has quite the poorest wait staff I have ever experienced, it seems a bit useless to even have waiters if you have to get your own food.
