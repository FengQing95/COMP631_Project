Art Institute of Chicago////The one museum I miss most living far away from where I grew up.  The Art Institute's collection is magnificent from impressionist masters (Renoir, Monet, Caillebotte) to Dutch painters (Steen, Van Gogh, Rembrandt) and the beautiful Chagall stained glass window.  Coming here puts my soul at peace especially hearing a lutist performing in one of the galleries.
