Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ah-mazing! A must when in Chicago area. I know there's a pizza challenge by the locals for Lou's vs Giordano's and I feel bad weighing in as a non-local BUT after asking several locals and trying myself - Lou's is the winner. The Malnati's salad is one of the best salads I've ever had in my life! It tastes like a wedge salad but with a lighter vinaigrette dressing. It's the most popular and worth splitting the family size to start off with. They even sell their dressing! We got the Classic deep dish half sausage and half cheese, a medium for two people but honestly we couldn't finish it. We could've gotten a small after sharing the salad. Going to NYC often, we were hesitant about Chicago deep dish pizza but it's a totally different taste and filling pie, DELICIOUS!!!
