Smoque BBQ////The bottom line is that Smoque is a nice alternative to the more expensive BBQ joints in Chicago. It's a bare bones dining experience. If you are looking for a fancy night out, you may want to go elsewhere. The interior reminds me of a High School Cafeteria, just a bunch of tables, chairs and Napkin holders. But it was a $9.00 Brisket Sandwich, so I'm"m not complaining. Smoque is good BBQ at a affordable price. I can do without the Bells and Whistles. It's all about the food.
