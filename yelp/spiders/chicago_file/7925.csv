Art Institute of Chicago////As far as art museums go, this was pretty vast. They had a lot to see and they broke it down into different sections. They even have a guide for you to see major works of art in less than an hour, which came in handy since my friend and I only had about an hour to spare! We used up that hour to see all the major ones as well as a few side ones we were interested in.
