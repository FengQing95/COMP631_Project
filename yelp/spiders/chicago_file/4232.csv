The Purple Pig////The roasted bone marrow was tasty! It comes with an herb salad and sea salt on the side. I like that we can add our own salt to the bone marrow and the herb salad wasn't bad! It had a lot of cilantro, which I'm not too fond of, but the sauce really overpowered the cilantro so I couldn't taste much of it.
