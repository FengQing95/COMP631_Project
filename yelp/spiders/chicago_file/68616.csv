Little Goat Diner////I LOVE this place. The food is on another level. My favorite would have to be the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes and their chocolate malt shake. That's my go-to for breakfast, lunch, or dinner when I'm there. The Los Drowned sandwich is also amazing as are their fries. My fiance once had their famous Goat Almighty burger which is like $20 - it is massive and looks like a heart attack, he loved every bit of it. EXTREMELY friendly service. I could be there with 1 other person or a party of 12 and they are so attentive and friendly. Would highly recommend.
