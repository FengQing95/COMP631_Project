Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This review is for Lou's mail ordering abilities. 5 stars all the way and I will continue to treat family with Lou's because of Lou's 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed reputation! I have family that can't always get to the brick and mortar restaurants, so we depend on being able to order through the mail. The last time I ordered, the USPS had to get this precious Lou Malnati's pizza order all the way to Washington state, across a Ferry and to a pretty remote island. Thanks Lou Malnati's for making this possible!
