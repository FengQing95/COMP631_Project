Little Goat Diner////I had an order of their parathas burrito and we also got a side of crumpets to share. The burrito was delicious: the eggs and bean salad was definitely more Mexican in flavor profile, but the chili pepper sauce and the paratha wrap was obviously more Indian. The crumpets were unfortunately a tad too greasy for me, but the strawberry rhubarb spread it came with was delicious.
