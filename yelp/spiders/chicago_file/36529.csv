Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was good.  Just a smidge about average.  I had the pork chop and the bf had the roasted chicken, both were salty.  I guess the kitchen staff was feeling generous with the sodium that night.  And its hard to compete with STK in Vegas because they set the pork chop bar so darn high.  I also had the peppered duck terrine, for myself, too much for one person.
