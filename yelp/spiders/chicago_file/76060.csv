Little Goat Diner////Great brunch venue. I was a little hungover so I strayed away from a lot of the heavier items but the tomato soup combined with the grilled cheese was exactly what I needed. Solid Bloody Mary as well. Also I have great friend who is dairy free and they were able to provide her with her own menu, great place if you have any food allergies.
