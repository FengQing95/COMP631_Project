Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place was packed.  I have been told its ALWAYS packed.  When you arrive, its best to check in, and then order your pizza.  The pizza's take about 30 minutes to make, so its best to order them before you are seated, otherwise you end up waiting a long time at your table.  I am sure this would be especially true on days when its extra busy.  We were finally seated on the second level.  We ordered the Malnati salad..its fantastic and I highly recommend it.  Its a green salad with dried salami chunks and a super tasty vinaigrette.  If you are into salads and like salami, this is something you will definitely need to try.  This isn't your typical salami salad..its a must try!
