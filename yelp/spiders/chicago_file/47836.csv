Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For brunch (which I recently discovered), the french toast pintxo is AMAZING. You will need to order about 3 because you can't get enough of the divine, perfectly-textured stick. The vanilla yogurt pintxo is sweet and solid but the short stack pancake pintxo is just ok. Potato and egg bite was heavenly as well as their spinach and artichoke crepe. I have always been seated promptly (with reservations) and service is on point. I can't wait to find another excuse to go back!
