Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is by far my favorite restaurant in Chicago. It's a great atmosphere, huge menu and the best sangria ever. Babs is perfect for all ages and tastes. Their huge menu will be a hit even with the pickiest eaters. I take all of my out of town guests here any time they visit!
