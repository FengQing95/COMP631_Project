Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Food: Always great. We had the appetizer sampler and chopped salad to start. The sampler included fried motz, fried zucchini and cheese balls. I never had cheese balls before. They were pretty good. The salad is a must. Then we had a large sausage deep dish, a large plain deep dish with extra sauce and a plain thin crust. The deep dish pizzas were terrific. While I didn't try the thin crust, it actually didn't look all that interesting, but my daughter liked it.
