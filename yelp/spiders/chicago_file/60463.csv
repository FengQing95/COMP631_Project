Smoque BBQ////We went for lunch. Chopped brisket was good although its' temperature was lukewarm while the chicken we also ordered was piping hot. Chicken was delicious - very moist - and delicious when dipped into the sauce we were given. Mac and cheese was ordinary, coleslaw dry, and fries greasy. We were not asked what sauce we wanted so I guess you just get what they want to give you. Compare that to Smoke Daddy on Division which has various sauces on the table for you to try.
