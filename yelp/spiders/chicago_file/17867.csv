Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's is my favorite deep dish in the city. I know Todd and Brian don't like it but that's okay with me. Also, let's be honest, Todd doesn't even like the Beatles! So I'm not sure what to think about him. I know what I think about Lou Malnati's pizza, it's a 10/10. I love the sausage and pepperoni deep dish.
