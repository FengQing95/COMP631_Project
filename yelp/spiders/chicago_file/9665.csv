Art Institute of Chicago////That being said, the Art Institute didn't particularly impress me in any way, but it wasn't necessarily bad, either.  It was just another art collection.  It could definitely be considered in the big-leagues with other super-museums, though it may not be at the level of, say, the Louvre.  The Art Institute had smatterings of big-name pieces from Seurat, Picasso, Dali, etc, -- enough to keep it interesting -- but still, a lot of (what I would consider) "filler."
