Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Last breakfast in Chicago and came to Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe thanks to Yelp. I had the Southern Poached Breakfast with fruit. Delicious. My wife had the Mexicana skillet. She loved it. Great service, comfortable atmosphere. 4 stars only because I've been there just once. If I go back there the next time I'm Chicago..hold on let me rephrase that. When I go back there there next time I'm in Chicago, if I have the same pleasant experience that I had today, I will be upgrading to 5 stars.
