Little Goat Diner////Went for breakfast, there was a wait but seating was efficient even for our group of 6. I had the Indian Flat Bread burrito and it was awesome. My sister had the blueberry pancakes and those were great too. Â Topped with a cinnamon crumble she didn't even need to use syrup. The waitress noticed one ache was burnt so before it even came to the table she had them remade and the manager came over to explain and comped the meal. Very professional and friendly staff. I'd definitely go again. They had a couple off-menu specials that sounded great as well. I'd like to go back and see waft else they come up with for specials and try that. Great work Stephani!
