Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've visited Chicago a few times in the last couple of years and this is a go-to spot. I am a true NY lover of pizza but its ok to like something else from time to time. The thick buttery crust is like the guilty pleasure that you crave. This is not the type of pizza that you have 1000 toppings on. Keep it simple with one meat and cheese. The best part of this spot - I got to take some frozen ones back home. Once I cooked them back home - it tasted exactly the same. So, don't be afraid to purchase the frozen ones.
