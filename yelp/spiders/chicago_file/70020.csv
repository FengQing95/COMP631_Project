Little Goat Diner////Needless to say, the waitress was nowhere to be found during this time, didn't even apologize when our food came 45 minutes later and then had the gall to ask us to look at the dessert menu.   Also during our period of waiting one manager came up and said he really didn't know why the food was taking so long.  Ok well thanks a lot for that information that does absolutely nothing.
