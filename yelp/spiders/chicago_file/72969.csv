Little Goat Diner////The 3 of us ended up ordering the special omelette (which came with smoked salmon I believe), this little piggy went to china (my dish), and the parathas burrito. Food came out in what felt like 10 minutes or less, super savory-looking and actually in the perfect portion. My dish was a little on the salty side, probably from the heavy chili garlic chive sauce, but I enjoyed the biscuit and 2 perfectly-cooked eggs, and instead of gooseberries, grapefruit chunks.
