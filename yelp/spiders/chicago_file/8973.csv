Art Institute of Chicago////The art institute is one of the renowned museums with an extensive collection.  Exhaustive, even.  Don't bother catching it all in one day or two days or a week.  Your mind will be begging you to stop.  There's just so much contemplation and observing of art a mind can take in, and since art is about interpreting the world around you, or how an artist sees that world, or a world in the past, you also need to go out in the world with just a few tidbits you learned from looking at and learning from art.  In other words, don't just think, do.  Then think about what you did through those new eyes.  You know when people tell you to empty your mind of your woes?  You should go to a museum, then take a walk in a park.  Thankfully here you can do that, but I'll get to Gehry later.
