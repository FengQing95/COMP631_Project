Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I came here on a business breakfast, otherwise wouldn't have been caught dead here.  Across from the park and right next to Tavern and Michigan Ave, this is the epitome of a tourist trap. Trendy, new looking spot that looks like it would be good to the untrained eye. Huge menu with fruit additions on everything from pancakes, waffles and crepes. The server was pushy trying to get us to eat and leave, rude and sarcastic in not a joking manner. The thing that blows my mind even more is if you are going to be called Wildberry and put fruit in every dish, have fresh fruit and a seasonal menu.  I had strawberries that were clearly frozen.  They had the syrupy taste, weird texture, and the taste of freezer burn. Are you joking? You deserve to be shunned and shut down.
