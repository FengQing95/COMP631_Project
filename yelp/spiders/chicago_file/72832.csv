Little Goat Diner////For the main dish I ordered the (can't remember the exact name) Indian bread filled with two eggs over easy, topped with a bean salad, and a side of breaded mashed potatoes topped with Asian slaw. Very yummy!! The Indian bread (not naan) was drizzled with some type of sauce which was super delicious and paired well with the egg.
