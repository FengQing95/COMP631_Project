Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was a freezing cold day, but we were gladly seated in the back away from the front door. Once we sat down Â and looked over the menu, we finally decided on our order. 1 order of spinach bread, 1 med. deep dish Spinach and Garlic pizza and 1 med. deep dish Green peppers and onions pizza... The bread came out first, very good, flavorful and just enough to hold you over during the 30 mins it takes to make the deep dish pizzas ( do not come here if you are in a super rush!)
