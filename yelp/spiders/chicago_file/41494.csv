Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My girlfriend and I hit this place up on our Chicago weekend adventure and we were not disappointed. The tapas and paella were tasty and sangria of the day hit the spot. Our server was really friendly and made some good recommendations. The restaurant has a nice ambiance and was well priced.
