Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Calamari was amazing! It was crispy and flavorful! The deep dish pizza was really good, but I have had better. We waiting about 15 minutes for a table. While waiting we got a beer and the bar tender was pretty unfriendly and rude, but our waitress saved the day. She was a breathe of fresh air and turn around the experience for us.
