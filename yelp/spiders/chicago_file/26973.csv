Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The place was packed, and were told that it would be a 45 minute wait.  We were also told that we could pre-order our pizza and by the time our table was ready, our pizza would be also.   45 minutes later we get a table.  And wait.  And wait.  Another 30 minutes for our pizza.  The ambiance was crowded and loud.  We literally could not hear across the table.  So we thought, "ok, its gonna be worth it when the pizza gets here".  Wrong.
