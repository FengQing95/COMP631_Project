Smoque BBQ////Smoque is decent barbecue. I got the mini pork sandwich, it was flavorful and juicy. The fries were mediocre and the corn bread was moist but not much flavor. The peach cobbler was tasty, good sweetness and crunch. The establishment it self was a bit run down and they make you pick up your own food once your seated. Overall I would say Smoque is just Okay.
