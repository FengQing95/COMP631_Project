Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Everything was very good. We had the peach sangria and lots of plates. I can't remember everything but we had asparagus, spicy potatoes, beef tenderloin which was awesome!, shrimp, deserts. Definitely had a lot more plates but everything just seemed delicious. Cool place with a lively, vibrant atmosphere and attentive service.
