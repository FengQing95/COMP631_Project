Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza finally arrived, and the waiter served us each a slice. The pizza was piping hot. You can see the crust was golden and buttery and glistening underneath the lights. The tomato sauce was sweet with the cheese salty. The sausage was plentiful. The pizza is a stick to the ribs dish, and it is hearty. You can't eat it with your hands or fold it in half like a New York slice. You need to use a fork and knife -___-. Aghast! a fork and knife...but i guess when in rome, do what the romans do. The pizza was yummy. Usually i'm not a fan of deep dish pizza because it is too heavy and crusty, but this was yummy.
