Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I will truthfully say it was not worth $50 maybe $30 at most. Not trying to be rude but wings were DRENCHED and soggy in the sauce. Pizza was to be honest meh, crust was okay... don't know maybe it was an off day. I think they're making a huge profit just from the location and "name" won't be back but at least we tried it I guess. Lol never know till you try it :)
