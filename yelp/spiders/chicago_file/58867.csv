Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food here is always delicious. Be prepared to share food and spend a lot. We enjoyed the bacon wrapped dates and paella the most! This place is always crowded but its also really big so you might be able to get a reservation day of. They're pretty good about spreading out the dishes you order at different times. Highly recommend for a larger group so you can try a lot.
