The Purple Pig////The Salt Roasted Beets are raveable, as is the Mushroom Agnolotti, however, I would've appreciated a large bowlful of these and therein lies the plight. The menu says "tapas" portions, the price says "entree". I wish I didn't have to feel that asking for bread was an inconvenience and recommend that the music be more reflective of a Mediterranean atmosphere being a Mediterranean restaurant. There was a 30 minute wait on a Saturday afternoon. Overall the food was extremely flavorful, I just wish there was more of it for the price. After sharing a plate of the beets, mushroom agnolotti and morcilla sausage, for two people and $100 later, we still left hungry.
