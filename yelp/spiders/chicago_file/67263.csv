Little Goat Diner////We thought the place was decorated very nicely. I was very impressed at the decor and even the chairs for the long tables. It was very classy and I sure love the atmosphere. The music they were playing was really good as well. The manager came to greet us and asked us nicely how everything was. That was before the missing food and before we ate. So, we said, it was great! We thought our server was very nice and friendly at first but after the missing food part, we left like her friendliness was going short. I was quite disappointed at the whole experience because we were very excited to be there and just indulge in the yumminess but it didin't happen like that. I will however, come back for the bread.
