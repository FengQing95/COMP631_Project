Smoque BBQ////I would come back and get a different cut of ribs. I would also get the sliced brisket then update this review to reflect that. As it stands now I wasn't overly impressed. It was good BBQ but not really worth the drive. I am sure Chi has other joints that I'll be checking out when i am down there next.
