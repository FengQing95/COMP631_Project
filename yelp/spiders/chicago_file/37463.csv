Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place is fantastic.  Service was super warm and friendly.  We were made to feel right at home from the moment I sat down.  Highlights of the menu and perhaps the best of the dinner was the raw bar - Maine lobster and fresh oysters.  Off the charts.  Wedge salad and cesar salad also excellent.  Dry aged bone in rib eye was awesome.  Cooked perfectly.  The best side dish was the corn.  Maude's is a favorite too - try them both.
