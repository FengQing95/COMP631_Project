Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The server was friendly when she was around but she was rarely around.  I tried to get her attention for 15 mins for the check.  First we sat there with the pizza pushed away from us and plates stacked, looking at her standing in the soda station.  She didn't even turn her head our way.  They Seated another person in the section and she went right to them.
