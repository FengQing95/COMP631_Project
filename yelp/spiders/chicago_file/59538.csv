Smoque BBQ////However, the one feeling I had after last night's last minute decision to venture to Smoque was...when's the next time we're going???  We happened to stumble in there at the right time...because as we sat down, we looked up and all of a sudden the line was out the door.  Thank goodness for good timing, because I was starving!
