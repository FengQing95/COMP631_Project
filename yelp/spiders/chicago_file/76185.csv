Little Goat Diner////Awful service this time and the next 3 times I went I had similar disappointment involving oblivious, lazy staff too self involved (even drunk once) to care about the job they were hired to do. This place needs a new floor manager stat. They are losing business by not turning tables and being attentive, let alone giving a damn.
