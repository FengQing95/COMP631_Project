Little Goat Diner////I had a very weird experience today at Little Goat. I was in the neighborhood and had been meaning to get in there to check it out. I didn't have much time but I figured I could grab a sandwich to go. The place was packed when I walked in and there were quite a few people waiting for tables. I asked the hosts about take-out and they said they don't really do it since it messes up the flow of the kitchen, but I could sit at the counter area and order something to-go there. There was no wait for one person at the counter so I grabbed my seat. I sat down and tried to make my way through the menu and checked out some of the yummy looking dishes that were circulating near-by. A few minutes late, one of the food runners placed a plate of food in front of me! Thanks, but I haven't ordered yet, I said, and he replied that it was a mistake and I could have it if I wanted it. He politely asked if I had any dietary restrictions, and left me with my "Crumpets with Chorizo and Maple Syrup" which were a bit too sweet but free so they were great. Soon after, a waitress stopped by and I ordered an expresso from her while I still contemplated ordering something to-go for later, and after she walked away, I never saw her again. The espresso never came, but a "soup of the day" was dropped off accidentally again. I again told the food runner that I had not ordered it, and he took it away to sit in the kitchen window, probably to be thrown away. Eventually I finished my crumpets and decided that I had to go. I asked a nice girl who worked there who had been overseeing the events to find a server so I could follow up about the espresso and settle my bill. Moments later a new server came and apologized about the espresso and asked if she could give me one to-go which I declined. She left to print out my bill which she soon discovered I didn't have. She apologized again, and declined my tip so I had a free meal! It did look like things were a bit disorganized coming out of the kitchen, and I noticed things were sitting in the window for an unusually long time but everyone in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying themselves anyways! Needless to say, it was a weird experience, but i will definitely return another time for a real Little Goat meal.
