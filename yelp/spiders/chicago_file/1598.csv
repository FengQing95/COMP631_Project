Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This place was so good we returned the following day for more. you will need to wait 1-2 hours before you get seated but it's worth the wait . the pancakes are delicious , skillet is amazing . my only complaint the coffee drinks are bland . I don't recommend the egg benedicts as it was watery and salty .
