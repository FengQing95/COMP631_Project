Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Before coming to this place, I have never been to a restaurant that serves tapas. I mean, I've seen it on the tv and heard of it, but never had a first hand experience. However, I'm glad that I finally did. It was AMAZING. My favorites would have to be the spicy potatoes w tomato alioli, roasted dates w bacon and apple vinaigrette, and beef empanada. Those along with the other tapas we ordered were simply amazing. At this location, you pay for the abundance of flavors and that is okay because quality is more important that quantity some times. The servers were really nice and always asked if we wanted more. I wouldn't say they went beyond or were exceptional, but they were decent. Lastly, the desserts were really delicious too. Once again, they are small, but one bite of it is enough to fill your entire mouth with flavor. My favorite was the coconut flan.
