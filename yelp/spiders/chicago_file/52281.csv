Smoque BBQ////I admit, I am not a BBQ expert, or even fanatic. But this food is yum-yum-YUMMY. The price seems just a smidge high by typical BBQ food standards. But you leave feeling so full and satisfied, it's worth it once in a while. The order at the cash register then go find a seat system might make some first-timers feel a bit lost or apprehensive. The place is too small for its own good. It's so popular, there's usually a long line anytime, anyday. The rib portions are very small for the price. But the chicken is a pretty healthy size. The side dishes are perhaps what push this place over the top for me. The mac and cheese and peach cobbler are to die for! This may not be a good place for kids if you're carting a bulky stroller or have a picky eater. That means more mac n cheese for me! I suggest this place find a bigger place to serve more fans of their eats.
