Art Institute of Chicago////The best part of the museum, is just the two building them self. On the south side is the modern with glass and steel. Then there is a bridge which connects to the original building on Michigan Ave. with the Two Lions in the front representing the strength and originality of the buildings. Of course beautiful sculptures and paintings.
