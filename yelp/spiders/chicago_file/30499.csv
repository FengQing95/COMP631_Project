Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ended up heading to Lou's after the river boat architectural cruise, and thus unfortunately had hit prime time.  We were quoted over an hour's wait (1 hour 40 min?), but we put our name in because there didn't seem to be much around the area and where would we take a take-out pie?  So we put our pizza order in under the name on the reservation list.
