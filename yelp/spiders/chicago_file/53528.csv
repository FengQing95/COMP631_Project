Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////But the food...OMG!  I don't think we had a single item that we didn't love!  Shrimp, pork, lamb, olives, shredded brussels sprouts, chorizo, jamon iberico, and I could go on and on!  A couple on the other side of the table ordered the paella, and thankfully sent a sample to our side of the table, and it was delicious as well!  There wasn't a single menu item that we didn't love, and we actually re-ordered a few of the items because they were so delicious!!
