Art Institute of Chicago////My only disappointment was portions of the modern wing.  The building itself is gorgeous and a work of art.  But many of the modern art pieces are truly unremarkable.  Or rather, the only remarkable thing about them is that someone considered them worthy to hang in this fabulous museum.  On the positive side, I did get a few ideas of "art" that I can create myself to cover a large wall in our family room!  LOL!
