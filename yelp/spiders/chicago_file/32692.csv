Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////the food was impeccable. I love that all these seemingly simple dishes were done with so much care. I'm forever on the hunt for the perfect Caesar salad and I think I found it at Bavette's! the smoke whitefish was cooked to perfection and the dressing was bursting with flavor.
