Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Had such a delicious meal at Bavette's Bar & Boeuf! We ordered the crab & avocado salad to start. For our entree we had the bone-in fillet with bone marrow & b√©chamel. We also tried the ribeye steak with fries. Everything we had surpassed our high expectations as we had heard really good things about the restaurant prior to going! Additionally our waiter, John, gave us great service! Will absolutely be back!
