Smoque BBQ////I'm not sure if I came here on a bad day or what.  We've had recommendations from a lot of friends and this place has been on my radar.  We both got brisket, one chopped and one slices with sides.  I was a bit disapointed that they didn't serve the brisket on a slice of bread.  Not a deal breaker by any means but literally you're just getting a pile of meat.  Like a couple other reviewers mention, its just missing something.  There was no great flavor and worse yet, both of us through the brisket was really dry.  There was no moistness at all.  Some pieces boardered on being a bit tough.  I'm not sure if what we got had been sitting out for awhile or what but frankly, it just wasn't that great.  The sides weren't great either.  The fries were what you'd get anywhere.  Cornbread was decent but nothing special and the mac and cheese had a weird cheese blend.  I'm not sure if I'd go back.  This place has so many good reviews I want to chalk it up to being a bad day but who knows.  Maybe I'll try it again in the future.
