Little Goat Diner////After being told by many people that this was the spot to hit for great eats - I was sadly disappointed by the quality of the food, the staff and presentation. When we arrived, there were several dirty tables sitting with no attention and we were told that there was a 90 min wait. After taking a walk for about an 1.5 hrs, we were finally seated. My friend heard that the grilled cheese was amazing - so we both ordered one and I also added the chocolate pancakes. The grilled cheese was sad - hardly any cheese and overly cooked bread and a few tomatoes. For $10-12 for a grilled cheese, I would have expected some cheese, at least. The chocolate pancakes didn't taste like chocolate at all. They really had 0 taste. I could have made Nutella pancakes at home and saved myself some money. Overall, the entire meal was flavorless and very disappointing. The ambiance was noisy. It took forever to get a coca-cola and a refill. By then, we were ready to just leave.
