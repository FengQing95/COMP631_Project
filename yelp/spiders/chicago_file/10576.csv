Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago is a world-class museum.  It is an institution and major landmark not only for Chicago, but for the United States as a whole.  Chicago natives can be proud of many things, and this is among the very best the city has to offer.  Unlike NYC or LA, where great art is spread across various museums and collections, the Art Institute of Chicago offers all of the city's great art in one stop, conveniently located right in downtown, near Millennium and Grant Park.  This is a very special place.
