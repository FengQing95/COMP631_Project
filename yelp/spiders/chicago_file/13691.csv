Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////While in Chicago for a few days I went here to meet up with some friends. I'm from NYC/long island so I've had some great pizza, but I wanted to try Chicago style pizza. This place fills up fast, we went here on a Sunday for lunch around 11:45 and by 12:30 there was a wait. The pizza's take about 30mins to cook. The sauce and butter crust is really good. I only had one slice and I was full! It's definitely a must if you're visiting Chicago and want to try there take on pizza.
