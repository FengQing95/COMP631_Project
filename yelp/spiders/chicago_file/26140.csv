Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My thoughts... solid tasting pizza just not what im used to. Eating NY style pizza for nearly 30 years will result in quite a bias. To me deep dish is Sicilian or pizza hut. Now this is much better than pizza hut im sure even though I was probably 10 the last time I ate pizza hut. The beef I have with this style pizza is 1. it just seems super rich an unhealthy and 2. you cant just get a slice. In NY when your running low on time, rushing to catch a train or what have you, being able to just grab that slice and go is key. Also a classic NY slice will run 300-350 calories. One of these baby pizzas will cost you over 800.
