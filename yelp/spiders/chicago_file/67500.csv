Little Goat Diner////My boyfriend and I stopped here before a Blackhawk's game and loved it! I honestly can't remember what beers we had, but we were satisfied. After those we had the pork nachos... game over, so good. The Pork Nachos are a MUST have if you come here (how could you not want to try them?) After those we tried the Los Drowned Sandwich, and that was just as delicious. Try either of these choices and you'll be happy! We also noticed a lot of people in the restaurant eating breakfast and it looked just as good, will definitely be back to try it! The only thing holding me back from the 5th star was we were stuck at a "communal" table which wasn't bad until a family with two small kids showed. I just think they are kind of a waste of space. Regardless, I'd definitely check this place out!
