Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I know this place has some lovers and haters, but coming from someone who's had a few experiences with Spanish tapas, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is still my favorite. I've come here numerous times with groups (I don't think this is a place to eat with less than 4 people), and every time, the group has been MORE than satisfied. I love the overall quality and variety.
