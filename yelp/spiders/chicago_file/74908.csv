Little Goat Diner////Oh how excited I was about this place when it first opened! Getting into Girl and the Goat was like trying to get a sit down for life advice from the Dalai Lama, but when this little place opened, I thought maybe there's a chance I can get at least a small taste of what the rave is all about. Sure, I'd have to wait over an hour to get in, but comparatively a one hour wait sure beats a one and half month wait. I was sold!
