Art Institute of Chicago////The Van Gogh exhibit is fabulous! I totally recommend the fast pass. I paid $40.00 for the fast pass and Van Gogh exhibit fee but it was well spent. It's really crowded but still so worth it. This has always been one of my favorite places. Wonderfully maintained and easily accessible. With engaging exhibits always.
