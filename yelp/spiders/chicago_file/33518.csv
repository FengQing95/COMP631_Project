Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////-We are so mad, we need to leave. Now. Every single thing has been wrong to this point and nobody cares.  So my husband says [the entire entrée course and 2 cocktails each are on the table] whatever you think is fair that we pay for, and we'll take the check. Julio's got our check in his pocket, with only the one steak taken off. Says "we got the steak, here's everything else". $240 and we don't eat 3/4 of it because nobody could be bothered to *ahem* fucking apologize.
