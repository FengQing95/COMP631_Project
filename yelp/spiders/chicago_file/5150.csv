The Purple Pig////Service: The lady at the front door was very cold and unwelcoming. So does our waitress. You can tell that they are busy and trying to juggle with all the people they have to serve. But come on, at least try to pretend you mean it when you ask "How's everything", instead of dropping the question then leave. But the Manager, I believe, is very attentive and nice.
