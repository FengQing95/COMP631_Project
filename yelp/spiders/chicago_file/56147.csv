Smoque BBQ////Visiting my friends in Chicago, they told us that we HAD to eat here at some point during my trip.  A week prior to my arrival, another friend was visiting a week early before we all met up for a convention.  She almost had Smoque everyday that week!!  All she could talk about was this place when I got picked up from the airport.
