Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Stopped by Cafe BBR for desserts and wine, actually (had dinner at another place down the street) and being my first tapas restaurant, I thought it was pretty cool. Our server, who was also a fellow Californian, was very nice and easy going. We had ice cream and I also had a glass of the white peach sangria, mmm. I promise to come back for the food!
