Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The good: Fantastic tasting tapas, with a huge list to choose from. The paella was amazing as well. Left very full. For tapas, it was good on price. Nothing crazy expensive, nothing crazy cheap. Service was fast and friendly, got seated early. Atmosphere was romantic yet casual.
