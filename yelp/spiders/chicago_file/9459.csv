Art Institute of Chicago////i also loved the exhibits that i don't usually appreciate in a museum -- american art, indian art, and photography. they do a refined job of everything! it's easy to see everything in this museum without feeling stale and overexerted, because there's such variety and accessbility of interest everywhere.
