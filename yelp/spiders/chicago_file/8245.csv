Art Institute of Chicago////Anyway, I just can't recommend the Museum highly enough as a wedding venue.  If you can afford it - and it's more reasonable than you'd expect when you look at combined food and venue costs, especially during the off-season - I'd tell you to go for it.  It was an amazing experience that my husband, my family, my friends and I will never forget.
