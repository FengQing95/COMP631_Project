Little Goat Diner////Such a better experience than girl and the goat, the food was way cheaper, and honestly way better as well. I got the breakfast spaghetti with a side of crumpets, both were great, i would easily get them again, but there are so many other things on the menu that look good that i wanna try first, service was fast, got seated quickly, hope to be back soon
