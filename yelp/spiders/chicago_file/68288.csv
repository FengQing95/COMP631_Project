Little Goat Diner////Man, where do i start?!! First of all, the interior decoration is on par. Love the furniture and ambiance the owner decided to go with. Really fits the whole diner feel. Anyways, my friend and I got to this place right when it opened on a Wednesday and it wasn't busy at all. Service was great and our waiter gave us several recommendations for the city. I ordered the okonomiyaki and it was delicious! The texture and flavors had me smiling during my whole stay. Also, i had an iced mocha. It was normal and nothing extraordinary. Overall, I would come here again and try the tempura mash potatoes. Few of my friends are telling me to get it before I come back home
