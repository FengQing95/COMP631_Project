Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were not satisfied with this place. My fried chicken could have been cooked better. I would say five more minutes would have it tasting kind of rubbery in certain bites. The mash potatoes were the best part of my meal. My coworker got a filet mignon and it was really dry, they must have let it rest too long. Though they issue her another one, the satisfaction of the meal was gone. The second one was okay, she ate it as not to offend anyone. The staff was cool. I'm giving this place 2 stars, because the bread was so good, lol, the staff was friendly and the ambience of the place.
