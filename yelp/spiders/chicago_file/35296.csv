Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bone in ribeye- This steak is definitely one of my top two ribeyes ever!  I usually order my steak medium rare but I asked the server how their med rare was and he said red in the center so I got it medium instead. And it was cooked perfectly!  It had a delicious crusty char on the outside and was so tender and juicy on the inside.  And it had the perfect amount of marbling to make it rich but not too fatty.  Sooooo good!
