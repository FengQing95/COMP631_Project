Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Finally, I *must* talk about their cava sangria. It was my first time trying a cava sangria, and I was first wary to try it because my friend compared it to a bubbly champagne (I do NOT like champagne). However, it was far from champagne--a good thing. In fact, it had a fresh, crisp taste, and I didn't taste the alcohol unlike a red sangria I've had at other tapas restaurants. There were also apples in the sangria, which I found very refreshing. We ordered a pitcher of the cava sangria, and it didn't disappoint (though, after three glasses, it definitely hit the spot!).
