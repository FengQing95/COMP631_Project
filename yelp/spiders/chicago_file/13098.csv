Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was tasty.  I won't say I was blown away by the butter crust; I honestly didn't taste anything buttery.  It was crisp on the side and not crisp under the toppings, of course.  I liked the tomato sauce which tasted cleanly of tomatoes but no strong spices.  I ate a slice without any of my beloved red chilli peppers and a helping of salad and was full.
