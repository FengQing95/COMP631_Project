Smoque BBQ////Smoque is so , so delicious and was a huge hit for a smaller party at my home. Beyond literally EVERY person raving and then begging for leftovers - the people at Smoque are simply wonderful to work with. From helping me make good selections in appropriate amounts, to suggestions for serving and then down to delivery - top notch and wonderful! I had to cancel a previous order as the party date had to cancel at the last minute and they worked diligently and stayed in communication while my credit card was refunded. Just a well run organization with amazing people and food!
