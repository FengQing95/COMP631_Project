Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Commence food coma. After arriving in Chicago to spend a weekend with a friend, I was treated to a meal at Bavette's. The meal was remarkably good. Upon entering Bavette's you'll see that the restaurant feels exactly like what it claims to be, an upscale steakhouse. It's dark and warm, and the lower level (where we dined), was even cozier. The drink prices were on par for upscale Chicago, and it would be easy to rack up a large tab if your crew is drinking with dinner.
