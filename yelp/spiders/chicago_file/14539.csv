Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////can't go to Chicago and not have lou malnati's!! I'd say most of their pizza's are fail proof. I came here with a large group and got various different pizza's and they were all delish! We had so many different types I can't even recall what I ate, but who cares! It still left a lasting impression on me and I'm not even a pizza person!
