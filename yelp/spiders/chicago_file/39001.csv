Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is one of my favorite steakhouses in Chicago and I've been to most. The food is fantastic. We usually split the 22oz dry aged ribeye ($69) and it's amazing! This should definitely be ordered medium rare due to the marbling of fat, we tried it rare yesterday and it was too much! Our mistake!
