Little Goat Diner////Just finished having dinner here with my dad. I ordered the Reuben and it did not disappoint. I liked Izard's twist and loved literally everything about the sandwich. I will definitely be back the next time I have a Reuben craving. Even if I have to drag myself all the way to the West Loop. Server was also nice and attentive with helpful suggestions. The space is very cute and my dad was impressed by the attention to detail (creative bill/credit card holders).
