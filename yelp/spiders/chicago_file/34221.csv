Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The server, although super sweet, was just not as on point as all the previous servers I've experienced! But the killa...I mean the VIBE KILLA OF ALL VIBE KILLERS.... when the server described the fried chicken to one of my girlfriends (the fried chicken is what I get almost every time) I almost passed out! "The fried chicken is boneless, skinless, breaded and fried in pork fat!") HUH? So I politely asked "I've had the fried chicken here before, has it changed?" And she shares the story of the changed fried chicken...the Chef wanted the chicken to be more appropriate for fine dining? HUH again? Since when is fried chicken fine dining but ok..."the Chef wants you to eat it with a fork and knife." Well, fancy fried chicken eaters do it that way when it's on the bone but who the ef cares...I ordered friend chicken and I know how the hell that comes...at least I knew how it came here! On the bone, with skin, crunchy on the outside and super juicy on the inside...it WAS outstanding fried chicken! Â But it's completely inedible now...each piece I put on my friends plates was still there at the end of the meal and frankly I was more pissed that the discussion of how awful the fried chicken was overshadowed ME! (my only child syndrome kicked in...don't judge me) It was my damn birthday and now I'm made to have a 20 min conversation with 4 black female foodies & one crazy about friend chicken Puerto Rican about fried ef'n chicken when all could have bee avoided with serving what previously worked! Whew! I mean this chicken was the worst I've ever had! The breading was thick and flavorless...well it had the flavor of flour! It was extremely greasy and frankly ugly on the plate! It had the appearance of southern fried chicken minus the gravy! Just not good at all! So with that...I'm hoping they at least give the option to have the original recipe on the menu! Now that I've vented, everything else that came out was delicious as always...steaks perfect, side dishes delicious, sweets & cocktails superb! Just give me back my fried chicken on the bone please & thank you! (and a hey Bambi thanks for visiting for the millionth time would be a nice touch! lmao)
