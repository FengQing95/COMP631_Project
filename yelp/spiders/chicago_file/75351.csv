Little Goat Diner////I would say 3.5 stars overall. This is definitely the type of place you would take a group or your friends for brunch. Came here around 2 P.M. on a Sunday and the place was packed (but no wait). The menu is pretty interesting and creative, a mixture of Asian-fusion as well as traditional American favorites. Tried the Okonomoyaki, a burger, has browns and a bit of a milkshake. Everything was tasty (though very unhealthy). Portions of some items are huge (e.g. some of the sandwiches and the special goat burger), but others were just modest. Hash browns were a good size, crispy and hot, but super greasy. The Asian-fusion foods did, in fact, taste Asian, and I enjoyed the meal. The burger was on grilled bread (rather than a bun) and was smothered in butter and cheese (a win for me), but it's disappointing that it doesn't come with anything else. The milkshake was decent. The one reason why I would say 3.5 stars is that the prices seem to be extremely steep for the items we ordered. $8 for a milkshake and $14 for a regular sized burger with nothing else is more than I would expect for a casual brunch.
