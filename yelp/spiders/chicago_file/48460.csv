Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas + sangria = PERFECTION. This is the perfect place to go with your girlfriends. You can't really go wrong with any of the tapas but you should definitely order the spicy potatoes! They also have a happy hour everyday at the bar during a specific time with $3 select tapas (they have a pretty decent selection for happy hour including 5-6 different tapas I believe). AND THE SANGRIA!! You must order the sangria (whatever special they have at the time). Beautiful ambiance with string lights as well
