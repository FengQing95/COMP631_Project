Little Goat Diner////The service was a bit off, as we all had our food, except my sister. Her food actually didn't come out until the rest of us had finished our dinners. It was handled well though. The dish was removed from the bill. In addition, they gave us lots of free deserts, cookies, cupcakes, and an ice cream cupcake as well.
