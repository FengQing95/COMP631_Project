Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Service was a bit crappy. We pre-ordered about 40 min before we got there because we knew we had to make our flight, and once we got there, they still made us wait for 15 minutes or so before even seating us. Then we had to wait for our server. Then we had to wait longer for our food. It was probably not the best time to go here, when we were worrying about our impending flight. Even if you plan ahead and call in, don't expect them to follow your schedule.
