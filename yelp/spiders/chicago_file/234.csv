Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////By far my favorite brunch place in the city. I have been on a mission to find a place that compares and so far have not been successful. I have been here a half dozen times and gotten something different each time, and not once I have been disappointed. Whether you are craving something savory (omlettes or skillets) or something sweet (Oreo S'mores Pancakes, Red velvet french toast, and banana bread french toast to name a few) they have what you are looking for. The atmosphere inside is super cute and the outdoor seating is nice too. You can expect to wait on a saturday or sunday, but where is that not true? Â Even when I did have to wait it wasn't that long, a nice plus as well. The only thing that could make it better would be if I got get a mimosa with my brunch. If you have not been here yet what are you waiting for, you need to go.
