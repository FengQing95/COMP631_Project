Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When I had bruschetta, I kinda knew the pizza's crust would be good because the bread was amazing, very garlic-y. Diced tomatoes and basils are very fresh and aromatic! Parmesan cheese is amazing and authentic. I can literally taste of the extra virgin olive oil. The dish is just lovely.
