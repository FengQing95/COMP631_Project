Art Institute of Chicago////Had a lunch date at the Art Institute and checked out some Van Gogh drawings, looks pretty small from the outside but there is plenty of stuff for you to see.  I think we walked around for good 2-3 hours and we got to see about 1/4 items that were displayed.  I definitely will be back!
