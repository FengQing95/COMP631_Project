Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Lincoln Park has so many great brunch places to compete for my Sunday mornings. On this particular day, my friend and I were planning on eating at another place nearby, but it had an hour long wait with no waiting area (and it had already climbed to humid ~80 degrees outside). Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba saved our lives because not only was there no wait on a busy Sunday morning, it had a well ventilated, gorgeous interior with both sunlit rooms and more intimate dim-light areas. Because it felt so big, it was never nearly as noisy as the cramped brunch place we tried earlier.
