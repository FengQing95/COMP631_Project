Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You walk into Lou's knowing it's going to be busy-- add to that the standard 45 minute wait for a deep dish and you've got quite the wait. Use that wait to order appetizers! The atmosphere here is great; there's always a crowd and while it gets VERY packed, it keeps things entertaining. The service is great as well and servers manage to be extremely attentive and friendly (a recurring theme in Chicago). The food here is good-- you won't be disappointed. But the deep dish left me wanting for more. This was my first authentic deep dish in Chicago and I couldn't help but feel that the spot was way overhyped. So I went to Pequod's (see my review on their page) and my expectations were blown out of the water. Still, Lou Malnati's has decent pizza and food/drinks-- you won't be let down that easily.
