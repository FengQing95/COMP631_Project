Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They do a good job of getting you to pre-order your pizza while you wait for a table. One would assume this means hot pizza. After waiting an hour and fifteen minutes we got a cold pizza. Our server told us he'd see what he could do, then returned five minutes later saying they'd taken the pizza off the bill. Okay, but the pizza was still cold. We asked that they maybe heat the pizza, which they did, and when it was warmed, it tasted alright. Wouldn't go back as it wasn't exactly stellar, even for free pizza. The house salad was meh.
