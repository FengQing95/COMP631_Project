Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great Tapas.  The Sangria was very nice.  Service was good.  I heartily recommend the Spicy Potatoes, they were my favorite.  also had the mushroom empanadas, cherizo and chicken skewers, and chicken Paella which was also very good.  Also had one of the specials - beef that was tasty.  So 4 Tapas and one Paella plus the 1/2 pictcher of sangria for $71.00
