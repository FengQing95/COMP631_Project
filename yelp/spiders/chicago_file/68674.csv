Little Goat Diner////Bull's Eye French Toast (4.5/5): This might be the best french toast that I have ever had, and the bbq maple syrup is also not overpoweringly sweet. The egg is cooked into the french toast, and the brioche itself help to mute how sweet the dish is. The chicken is tasty and surprisingly juicy. Would definitely recommend this dish. -- $16
