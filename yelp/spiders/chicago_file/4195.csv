The Purple Pig////Dishes were huge for tapas. We ordered the broccoli, the roasted beets, the half duck, and the bone marrow. The broccoli had a nice grilled flavor and the anchovy sauce reminded me of Cesar salad dressing. The pistachio butter on the roasted beets was amazing, but the goat cheese foam kind of overpowered the entire dish for us. The half duck was good, not amazing. For all the rave on yelp about the bone marrow, it just didn't deliver. It was not charred on the surface (kind of looked boiled?) and it lacked creativity as a dish overall.
