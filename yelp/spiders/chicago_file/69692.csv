Little Goat Diner////We shared a small order of the biscuits and gravy which were delish.  I had the elvis waffles...they weren't bad but they were just too much.  Too much of what?  I'm not sure...just too much.  I barely made a dent in them.  I think I would have liked them more if I could have put my own syrup on them.  My husband had the choc chip pancakes.  I wasn't a fan but I prefer milk choc to dark so that may be why.  Our waitress was fantastic and very friendly.  I need to go back for lunch or dinner next.  There's just too many things to try and not enough time!!!
