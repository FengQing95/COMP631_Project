Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here for brunch on Saturday after hearing good things, the food was solid but nothing great. I stuck with the waiters recommendations: deviled egg, wagyu baguette, buttermilk fried chicken thighs w/ piri piri, and then the affogato. The chicken was the only thing I really enjoyed. I think I'll have to give another try with some other dishes. Â
