Smoque BBQ////I have to just come out and say it that Guy Fieri you my friend are a liar, and I trusted you. You are paying roughly $11 for a sandwich the size of a big mac (in width, not in height), a "fruit cup" size of macaroni and cheese (and it is not "dynamite, again Guy what the hell?), small piece of corn bread (that was actually good), and slaw. Did I feel ripped off? Absolutely. The pulled pork was extremely dry and didn't taste special and the brisket itself was good and really was the "Star" of the meal. Now to the sauce-we all know in the United States BBQ Sauce is a personal preference, kind of like underwear. I myself am not not not not not a fan of this BBQ sauce and neither was my fiance. It is definitely Kansas City BBQ Sauce and It was to me absolutely repulsive-very thin, very sweet, very vinegary. Overall after months of wanting to try this place and making a trip for lunch, insanely disappointing. So, if you're reading this and you love KC BBQ, then maybe you'll love this place...if you don't skip Smoque because it is awful for those of us who are not KC BBQ fans.
