Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Extended version: I took my dad here since he is in town and wanted steak. Our waiter was rude and condescending as well as touchy feely (an oddly bizarre combination). The food was honestly just traditional American that was trying to masquerade as a "modern" or perhaps slightly hipster spun but failed on all counts. I found it uninspiring and mediocre. We ordered the weird pizza dip (called baked ch√®vre or some variety or herbal goat cheese on the menu), the (42 day?) aged ribeye, oysters, crab cakes, mushrooms, baked potato, and drinks. Totaled 250 and I would say totally forgettable. I'm not a steakhouse person but I'm pretty sure I would have a less mediocre time at Outback than this place.
