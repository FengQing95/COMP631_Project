Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After trying Giordao's, I have to say that this pizza didn't wow me. Lou Malnati makes a thinner deep dish, which means less cheese and sauce. If I want a thinner deep dish, then I would much rather go for an authentic Italisn pizza. But for a deep dish pie, the deeper the better.
