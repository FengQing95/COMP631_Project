Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For entrees, we ordered the bone-in filet and fried chicken. Although the chicken was juicy, it was labeled as spicy, which it definitely was not. However, they do give you a Louisiana hot sauce to put on your chicken, so maybe that's where the "spicy" component comes from. The steak was cooked to perfection and was perfectly seasoned. Definitely one of the best steaks in Chicago, and I have pretty much tried almost every steak house around.
