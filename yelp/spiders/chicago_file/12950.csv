Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's Chicago-style deep dish pizza abso-LUTELY Hit. The. Spot! Perfect balance of delicious sauce/fresh filling/tasty crust presented in a hot iron skillet on a windy, cold Chicago afternoon. Great, friendly service. If you are in a hurry beware: you must allow 20-30 mins for this or any other deep dish pizza to hit your table but it is well worth the wait! Looking forward to our next visit to Lou's. We WILL be back!
