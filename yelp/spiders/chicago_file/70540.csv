Little Goat Diner////I'm a G&tG fan from way back, and Little Goat is a close runner up for my favourite eating hole in Chicago. But I was there with a group of friends yesterday and experienced my first goat mis-step. The fried pickles and onion ring dish left all three of us feeling a bit queasy and unable to finish the plate. I don't know what it is - we're all hearty ladies with no delicate sensibilities in relation to fried foods - but all three of us felt roofied by this dish, even the next day, and to the point where we could barely touch our entrees. Very odd, guys, very odd indeed. The fish tostadas - which I'd tried prior - were a bit muddy and...bland. I don't know if the entire kitchen staff were on vacay and you had a skeleton crew step in or what, but this is the first time in my many forays to an Izard restaurant where I've not been at the very least slightly blown away. It doubly sucked because it appears there's been a price raise in everything (including the merch I finally got around to purchasing), which led to a case of the sad face.
