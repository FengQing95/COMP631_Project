Au Cheval////Would have been 4 stars if their customer service was on par with their food. Four of us went on a Saturday at 530. There was already a 45 minute wait. Went across the street to Haymarket for a drink. I love that they text you when your table is about ready. Nice service. That's probably the high point in their customer service. I really have an issue with a restaurant that doesn't take reservations. Who do they think they are? Why do civilized adults have to wait around like cattle to get a chance to eat their food. When we were seated we overheard the hostess telling people it was a two hour wait. That is horrible. Take reservations and treat adults like adults. Since they don't take reservations and people are waiting waiting waiting. They rush you. I hate that. I waited for a table and now you're rushing me? They must not want people to come back. My hemmingway daiquiri was wonderful. Very balanced in flavors and strong on liquor. Our potatoes came out 5 minutes before our cheeseburgers. Strange but okay, not the end of the world. All of burgers were juicy without being greasy and the condiments made the meat taste even better. Burgers are 5 stars. The pickles, hashbrowns, fries and mash potatoes are very good too. Our server was like a hobbit and had ZERO personality. He never checked on us and we were never offered a second round of drinks. Okay, I guess you don't want our money or us to come back. Then my pet peeve happened. The buser kept trying to take our plates. I told him 4 times, we were not done and he kept trying to take our plates. Again - stop rushing us! We'll tell you when we're done. It was like a gnat spoiling your picnic. Our hobbit, never asked if we wanted anything else or offered any dessert menu. I don't even know if they have dessert or not. He just brought our check and didn't say a word. Really dude, get some personality - it'll work out better for you here and elsewhere. I asked for the  pickles and the hashbrowns to be boxed up. I guess I should have been more specific, they were put in a box TOGETHER. So my hashbrowns this morning had a  pickle flavor. Who does this - box two dissimilar things together. I guess he's a lazy hobbit to boot! Love your food Au Cheval but Mburger delivers better service with a smile and doesn't rush me out of there like I  were the gnat at your picnic. Plus Mburger is the fraction of the price.
