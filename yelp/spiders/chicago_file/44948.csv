Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First time trying a tapas bar and I was not disappointed. The menu is very big and everything is of high quality.  We went there with a group of about 20 people so we were able to try a lot of different things,  the bacon wrapped dates definitely took me by surprise like I said everything is very unique.  I would love to try every item they have on the menu one day.  If you haven't been to a tapas place then try here
