Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chicago pizza is a different beast than the New Haven style. It is deep dish. I had heard some about the deep dish crust being greasy, but I didn't find that here. Actually, this crust seemed rather dry to me. We also ordered one of their thin crust pizzas, but don't even go there. It's neither Chicagoan nor anything else--the thin crust is just a sop to those who are afraid of carbo-overload.
