Little Goat Diner////I insert myself into the one-and-only-empty-and-made-for-me-place at the Little Goat bar. Â Seriously, I filled in the only gap left between couples and friends hanging out. It was a place no two could fill - only me - as if it were hallowed "Toffee pork bourbon milkshake" ground. So you can imagine how shocked I was - that when I ordered it...I failed to say aloud, "bourbon" at first.
