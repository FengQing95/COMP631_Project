Smoque BBQ////SO GOOD! I love BBQ but am a little picky, and this spot definitely didn't disapoint. It's a very casual place that you wait in line to order and then they direct you to where to sit. Â We went on a Friday at 7:30 PM, and I was worried the wait would be ridic but it wasn't bad at all. We probably waited 10 minutes which gave us the perfect amount of time to figure out what we wanted. We shared (2 people) chopped beef brisket, half slab baby back ribs, peach cobbler and mac and cheese. I wasn't IN LOVE with the brisket, but it was good. Everything else was delicious. I like my BBQ saucy, so we drenched the ribs in sauce and they ended up giving us a piece extra because they shorted us a little. We didn't ask, they offered! The mac was super creamy but not too heavy. The peach cobbler was the perfect ending to the meal! So awesome!!
