Art Institute of Chicago////I always love going to the Art Institute. I had a memorable experience the first time I went, on my first trip to Chicago in spring 2001. Love some of the shows they come up with beyond the usual suspects and the biggies. This trip was specifically to see Bisa Butler, which is one of the most beautiful exhibits I've ever seen, regardless of the medium. Obviously, everyone else feels the same way, because I couldn't buy the book for her show, as it's in its fourth printing! I've gotten many books through the years of the thoughtful exhibits seen here so that I can revisit them later. This is a classic place, that continues bringing exciting and fun exhibits to Chicago. Always worth a visit!
