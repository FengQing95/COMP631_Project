Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////As for the food, it's always excellent, as is the sangria, both red and white.  They have everything ranging from the ubiquitous tortilla espanola and baked goat cheese, as well as some creative salads (beet, goat cheese, oranges, greens) and mouth wateringly good meat dishes - pork tenderloin, chicken and chorizo, and my favorite, the spicy albondigas.  I've never met a tapa here that I didn't like.
