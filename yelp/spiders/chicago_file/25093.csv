Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm incredibly happy that Lou Malnati's offers gluten-free pizza. Thank youuuuuuu! For all of you out there who are gluten-intolerant or have an auto-immune disorder like me, their pizza is the real deal. They serve the pizza small/thin crust which makes for a perfect individual serving. Thank you very much for your kind consideration to us who have dietary restrictions Lou Malnati's!
