Little Goat Diner////Overall: Service was slow, food was overpriced, food was totally bland and boring.  I'd also classify it as one of (many) Chicago restaurants that seem to think the customer should be grateful to sit in the hallowed dining room.  Not interested in braving the crowds at Little Goat ever again.
