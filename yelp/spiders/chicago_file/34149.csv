Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food and drinks were great but the service left something to be desired. The staff at the bar were a bit too cool for school. As an out of towner I felt a bit awkward when they had to loudly announce that there weren't many things on the menu for single diners. Apparently this was a new phenomenon for them. I ordered the burger and when they asked how I wanted it cooked I explained we didn't have those options in Canada and he loudly said that we aren't in Canada. Right then.
