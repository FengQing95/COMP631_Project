Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. One of the things I like the most is the exceptional level of consistency. The tapas and pintxos are always a solid choice and the service staff is friendly, helpful and quick every time. In my opinion, this restaurant is a great place to have not only a nice casual dinner, but also to celebrate special occasions with friends or family in a laid-back but lively ambience.
