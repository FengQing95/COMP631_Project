Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////After sampling bakeries and hot dog stands and other Chicago Institutions all day, we just werent hungry enough for a big dinner, but not stuffed enough to just call it a night, so Cafe BBR was the perfect answer.  They have a huge menu of lots of tapas (in fact, the whole menu is tapas) and all of them except for the octopus were great, and some of them, the short ribs in particular, were outstanding.  The 520 reviews and 4 star rating made me expect something a little more unique and unbelievable, but the food was all really good, and they have a comfortable enclosed patio, so I was pretty happy overall.  Just dont go expecting a once in a lifetime experience.
