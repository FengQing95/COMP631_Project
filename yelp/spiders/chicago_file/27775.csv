Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We flew in late and my gf's sister had bought this to go for us to have as a late night snack when we got there.  It was reheated and was still delicious!  Crust wast buttery crispy, cheese was melted, and sausage was warm.  This was like an upside down type. Of pizza where the sauce was on top.  Flavor combination was prefect for the crust. I'd come back to try other pies.
