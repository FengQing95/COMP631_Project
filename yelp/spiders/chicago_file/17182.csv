Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For lunch, two of us split a small Chicago Classic pizza with sausage and pepperoni.  It was fine but no better than many other deep dish pizza we have had.  The pizza made as feel crappy all day - it was just so heavy.  Maybe it was that extra butter in the crust that was just too rich with all that cheese.
