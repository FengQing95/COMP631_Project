Art Institute of Chicago////Pro tips: use their website before you go to see what exhibitions will be on display and download the app. If you're in Chicago for more than a few days, getting the City Pass will help to bring the admission price down or go for free the first weekend of every month if you're a BofA customer. Photography is encouraged (except for special exhibitions) so know how to turn your camera flash off.
