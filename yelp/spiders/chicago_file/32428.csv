Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The first thing the hostess says to us when we arrived is "Did you preorder?".  We said no, and she make it seem like we should have.  Before our true server showed up, someone else showed up to our table and asked why we didn't preorder.  It was so confusing.  Supposedly this is a thing; however, I went back again and looked on the website. There is no mention of dine in guests being given the option to pre-order.  When you place an order, the options are pick-up or delivery.  There is no mention in or around the wait list page that gives you the option to pre-order.
