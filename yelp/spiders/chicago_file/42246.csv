Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is like a hidden gem. I just happened to stumble upon and I am so glad that I did. It's a lot bigger than it looks from the outside and it was very packed on a Saturday night which is to be expected. They told us it would be an hour and a half wait for a table for 2 without reservations but we could order food from the bar. We took the bar option obviously. Food was great, sangria was great and very inexpensive. I'd 100% come back. I'm only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't get the full dining experience because we were at the bar, but all in all great restaurant.
