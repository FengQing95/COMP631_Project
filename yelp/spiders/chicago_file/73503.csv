Little Goat Diner////My wife's pork belly pancakes (yes, I know we went pb crazy) were fantastic. Basically it is an asian-style scallion pancake that is traditionally married with savory foods and it too was piled-high with kimchi slaw. It was also wonderful. The kimchi for both dishes wasn't super authentic in that it was neither very sour nor spicy, but it was tasty nonetheless.
