Little Goat Diner////Holy Chicago food lover! I came here after a run and left thinking I needed to go for a second run. This current trip was my foodie trip so I made my way over into Goat Country for a late lunch.  Walking into The Little Goat, it's a clean space and set up very well.  You have a bunch of different options (booths, bar, island type seating).  I came for a late lunch around 1:30, but there were still a good amount of people around.
