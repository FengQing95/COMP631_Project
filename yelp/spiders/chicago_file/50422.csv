Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My gf and I ordered a pitcher of their mango sangria, and her mom had the blueberry patch. Drinks hit the spot and the blueberry patch is a new favorite. I would just come here for drinks, but you can't step foot in here and not eat food. I believe that's a sin in the bible or somewhere.
