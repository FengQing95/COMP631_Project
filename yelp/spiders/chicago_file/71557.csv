Little Goat Diner////I love the food, workers, and atmosphere here. There's not enough clean, modern, stylish diners in Chicago so this one was a treat. I had the pulled pork sandwich/burger. I can't remember but I remember it being so delicious. I devoured the whole thing before my friend finished dinner. Our hostesses yesterday, Jessica, was very friendly and accommodating as well. She checked up on us a few times while the waitress was busy to make sure we were alright. Good vibes. Good food. Awesome cocktails and selection of drinks. Definitely coming back!
