Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Whenever I visit Chicago I pay my respects by eating at Lou Malnatis or Giordanos. Both great deep dish pizzas! The butter crust is delicious, full of flavor and crunch. The service was friendly and prompt. Overall great experience! Only deducted one star because for me thin crust all the way!!!
