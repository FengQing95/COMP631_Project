Smoque BBQ////Five stars for the St. Lois ribs (spare ribs). Those in the know get these, provided they are Q'd right, as Smoque definitely does. Meaty, fatty enough, nicely seasoned. I eat them without the sauce. Good meat is like that, it doesn't need the extras. The wait can be long, and parking can mean a walk.  BUT this is a popular city restaurant  and should be expected. I've seen many good places become a victim of their own success by expanding and losing their quality and price point.
