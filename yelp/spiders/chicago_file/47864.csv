Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We visited this place as a group and it was a good idea. The ambience is stylish, although a little crammed. There's always a huge, happy crowd. The food is all small plates and that gives you an opportunity to try lots of their wonderful dishes. We had a couple of vegetarians in the group who had a large variety to choose from and they enjoyed their dinner. The white peach sangria was delicious!!
