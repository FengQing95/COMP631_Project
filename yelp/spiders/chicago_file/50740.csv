Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////AMAZING! I would eat every meal here if I could. The plates are the perfect size and 3 plates were plenty for the 2 of us. The sangria is good but not strong at all in my opinion-drink to taste not to get drunk kind of beverage. I recommend the Brussels sprout salad, the salmon (omg that sauce!) and of course the short rib. Can't wait to return and try more dishes
