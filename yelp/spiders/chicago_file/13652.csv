Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My FAVORITE Chicago pizza place.  Great deep dish, but I personally love the thin crust. The crust is amazing; it is a butter crust and it is to die for!!  Also, the Lou Malnati's salad is fantastic.  Not necessarily the most healthy salad - it has I sometimes just order this as I am leaving work and pick it up on my walk home. One of my favorite things of all time, that I actually crave it!
