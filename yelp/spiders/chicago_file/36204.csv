Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////If you're going to eat here, do yourself a favor and take in the entire experience and savor every bit of it. Don't just order a steak and leave. Pick several items on the menu, enjoy their vast drink menu and order dessert. Just know ahead of time that it won't be cheap. But wow, it's worth it.
