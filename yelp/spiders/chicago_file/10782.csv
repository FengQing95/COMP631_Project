Art Institute of Chicago////This is one of my favorite art museums and the collections here are magnificent. Two big lions mark the entrance to this grand building and it is very close to Millenium Park. I found a special on the Bank of America site called "Museums on Us" and it is valid the first weekend of every month. B of A cardholders can get in free so that is a $25 savings.
