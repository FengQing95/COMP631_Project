Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My family came to visit from out of town and I wanted to take them somewhere special.  There were six of us and we each ordered something different so we could sample each others. The dry aged rib eye was cooked to perfection and one of the best steaks I ever had. The beef stroganoff with mushrooms was amazing as was the meatloaf and the sides of mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes.  The service was excellent and they seated us right away at 5 pm on a Saturday night without reservations. Definitely the best meal I ever had and now my favorite steakhouse in Chicago jumping ahead of Chicago Cut which was my favorite for 4 years. The ambience was perfect and my only regret was not having room for desert.
