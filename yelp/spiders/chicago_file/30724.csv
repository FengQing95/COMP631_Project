Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The bottom line is I would come back here again next time I'm in Chicago. I think this is a cool experience that is unique to the area and that if you're visiting you should definitely try this out for yourself. I bet the pizza also tastes better fresh out of the oven rather than being delivered.
