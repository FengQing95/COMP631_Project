Smoque BBQ////After reading that Smoque was the best brisket outside of Texas, my expectations were a bit higher than they should have been. In reality, it was good, but not mind blowing. It was a bit dry, more crumbly than tender. The sauce was solid. Cornbread was dry, macaroni and cheese was standard.
