Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The one time that I tried this place while staying in Chicago, I personally liked their pies a lot. Having grown up on NY style pizza, it took a bit of a mental adjustment to accept this. The way I got around this psychological block was by not thinking about this as pizza. Instead, think of it as what it is: a savory pie.
