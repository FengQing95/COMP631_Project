The Purple Pig////-Manchester cheese w/ fig jam: This was a spreadable double cream cow's milk cheese recommended by my waiter and it was absolutely delicious. It paired well with the fig jam but I could easily eat it alone. It was almost like a creamy cheese fudge. Absolutely would get this again or try one of their other cheese options (5/5)
