Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Old Fashioned are always amazing! They have a signature old fashion menu as well. I would save this in one other place are the best steak restaurants in town! In addition the vibe and the service is second to none. My other favorite place in town is steak 48. I love them both Bavette's is my first choice!!
