Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For years in my youth, I was deeply deprived of quality pizza. I grew up on the likes of Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Little Caesar's. If you like those pizzas, wait until you try deep dish pizza, "it'll knock your socks off!" my friends would say. So I make the trip to BJ's restaurant and brewhouse, and take a huge, doughy bite of their "deep dish" pizza. No, no, and NO.
