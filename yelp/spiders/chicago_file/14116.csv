Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Delicious and amazing service. I wish I could give our hostess Alisha 10 stars! We started talking about it being our first time in Chicago and asked us what we were looking to do. We mentioned we wanted to check out the much talked about Chicago Bar Scene, Alisha returned with a list of near by bars that we had to check out. She had surveyed her co-workers and populated a top 5 list. This act of customer service is brag-worthy. At that point it didn't matter how good the food was (which by the way, rightfully deserved all 5 stars as well). Thank you! Look forward to be back soon!
