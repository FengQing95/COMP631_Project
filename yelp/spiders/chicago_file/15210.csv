Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't think I've ever had more anticipation for food than to try an authentic Chicago deep dish pizza. With a group of friends and my girlfriend, we finally decided on Lou Malnati's as our first Chicago pizza experience. Never have I done my due diligence on Yelp, but this time, I read review after review and decided that this would be the optimal choice (unfortunately, other joints in the running like Giardano's were just too far away).
