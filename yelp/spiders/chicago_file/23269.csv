Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As filling as the pizza was, I thought the sausage was really excellent, tender and full of flavor. I also really liked how the sweet tang of the tomato sauce cut through the richness of the meat. But I did not care for the dense buttercrust, which was hard and crumbly and reminded me a little of biscotti. I was also turned off by the heavy layer of cheese in the center, which had started to coagulate as it sat and cooled in the pan.
