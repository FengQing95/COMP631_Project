Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The highlights of this meal were the chorizo wrapped dates, shrimp pinxtos, pork paella. Everything on the tapas menu was worth a try and was well priced. Truly tapas sizes where the goal is to try as many tiny dishes as possible. The sangria was also fantastic. Service was wonderful as well. All around best meal in Chicago!
