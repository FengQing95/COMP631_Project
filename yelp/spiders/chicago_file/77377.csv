Little Goat Diner////Upon my first week in Chicago, with my native Chicagoan we went to Little Goat and what a delicious way to welcome my taste buds to the Chicago food scene. We had a 8pm reservation and upon walking in we were seated and met with by our server. This place has such a chill vibe betwixt with the modern decor.
