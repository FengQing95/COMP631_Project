Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If I am in Chicago you better believe I am going to Lou's for some deep dish. My cousin took us to this location which was new to me. We shared a pepperoni deep dish and the salad as usually and as normal, it made me not want to leave Chicago! I cannot express how good this pizza is! It will have your taste buds doing the happy dance. Â The also had a great selection of craft beers available. I was able to point my friend towards the New Holland Poet which has since become a favorite beer for him.
