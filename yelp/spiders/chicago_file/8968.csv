Art Institute of Chicago////I was at the Art Institute on a Saturday this time to participate in a scavenger hunt through another company. My experience overall was quite good- I love the Art Institute of Chicago because it has many staple sections that I can revisit, but also frequently has new and traveling exhibits to peak my interest. This was my first visit to the Modern Art wing as well, and while I don't love all modern art- I did love how the entire wing was laid out- absolutely beautiful.
