Little Goat Diner////The Korean burger also struck out. I was looking forward to the spiciness of the kimchi... but instead all I got was cold bacon/egg and kimchi that tasted like normal cabbage. The goat pattie was good but not too different from beef; it also had difficulty staying together as one coherent patty, meaning I had to go in with a fork to finish it. The bun was pretty banging, though!
