Smoque BBQ////Hey man, what about the rub man? Well, every credible place by osmosis has some kind of rub. People that BBQ put a lot of love into what they do and I'll say it, pretty much use the same stuff. Going out on a loin, I've never had a dry rub that I didn't like. It really comes down to preference, sweet, hot, salty, mild or some kind of combination.
