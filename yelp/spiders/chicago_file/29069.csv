Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now onto the most important part... the pizza. Since we came in a large party, we decided to get both the Lou (vegetarian option), and the Malnati Chicago Classic (contains meat). I definitely preferred the the Lou pizza more, but both were out of this world. When you cut into the pizza, it felt like cutting into a fluffy cloud. 1 slice was pretty filling, but luckily we had some leftovers to enjoy for later (which I happily kept eating).
