Little Goat Diner////I had wonderful, friendly but not overly friendly service both times I went. Servers are more than happy to answer questions about the menu. Also, at brunch, my server made a particular effort to pour the coffee away from my toddler, which made me happy. Because nothing ruins brunch faster than a trip to the emergency room.
