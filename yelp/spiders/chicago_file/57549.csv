Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The menu has changed a little over the years, but the food has remained consistently good.  Tapas is always fun and the sangria is good.  The ambiance is great.  It has a good vibe and is always full.  In the summer you can enjoy the patio.  At the risk of giving away my secrets, if you can't get a reservation go anyways and just snag a bar table.  There are plenty.
