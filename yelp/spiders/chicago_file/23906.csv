Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The best thing about Lou Malnati's is......For three years since the moved across the street from my condo I had stopped eating their pizza due to development of a tomato allergy. I called one day & asked what I thought was an odd question. " can you cook a pizza without tomato sauce?" I am so happy that the answer was yes. Pat % 9th & State street.
