Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm new to Chicago, and I believe this is important to mention as I'm coming from a pretty unbiased opinion regarding "fine dining", especially for a steakhouse. Overall I had a fantastic experience and I will certainly return again to explore more of the menu or revisit favorites. There's also a downstairs lounge which I'll be interested to explore. Right off the brown line Kinzie St. stop, so it's fairly easy access as I came directly from Hyde Park. This will serve well for a fancy dinner with a loved one or friends. Call me a prisoner of the moment but I don't see why I shouldn't give this place 5 stars...so I will.
