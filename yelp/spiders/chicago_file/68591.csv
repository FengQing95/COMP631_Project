Little Goat Diner////Over-hyped in my opinion. I feel like they are trying TOO hard to make food different and have an edge. We had the Skirt Steak salad with a weird salted caramel dressing. I could have done without the dressing. We had a side of fries that were mediocre, the chicken fingers were dry. The only good thing there was the french toast. I didn't try the whole menu obviously, just was not really impressed with this place.
