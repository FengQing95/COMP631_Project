Smoque BBQ////Heard a lot of hype about this place. Decided to order the St. Louis ribs, mac n cheese, and corn bread. The dry rub was so good you really didn't need any additional sauce! However, the bbq sauce is still very good. Mac n cheese wasn't the best thing ever but still pretty good. The corn bread first off was also nothing special but I love corn bread so I always get it. I actually really liked the slaw that came with the ribs. This place is a bit pricy but what high quality bbq joint isn't. My bf got the brisket and it was definitely the best brisket I've ever had. If you are a brisket and ribs person, try this place out! It gets pretty busy and you'll definitely have to wait in line but it's worth it!
