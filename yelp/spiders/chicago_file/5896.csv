The Purple Pig////Only came here for happy hour, but had a good experience.  My friends and I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  It was quiet when we arrived, but filled up after work (this was pre-COVID precautions).  Their happy hours specials were a good deal, and also tasted good.  The food menu looked good, so I would love to go back at some time to try a good meal (or at least happy hour with some appetizers).
