The Purple Pig////By way of background, we discovered this place indirectly. We searched Apple Maps for tapas near us and went to our choice. We arrived and were told that even though the place was literally about 90% empty, they were not taking walk-ins til hours later. So back in Maps. Maps' listings tend to reference Yelp rankings; Purple Pig instead was noted as being cited by Chefs Feed, that is, IMO, more impressive than a Yelp ranking by definition. And we were not disappointed-- and appreciate the rejection at the first place.
