Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Update August 2010: Been to Lou Malnati's many, many times - both dine in and carry out. I'm a thin-crust fan - the deep dish is just too filling for me. One of my favorite salads of anywhere is the Lou's Salad with their famous homemade dressing - a medium is perfect to share for 2 and so tasty! Still loyal to the thin-crust cheese with butter-crust and low-fat cheese (you can't even tell the difference.) Only complaint is coming to dine in on the weekend is madness - usually a 45 to an hour wait always. I ate at the bar - not nearly as comfortable or pleasant, but food just as good when you don't feel like waiting over an hour for a table.
