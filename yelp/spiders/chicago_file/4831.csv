The Purple Pig////OMG!  This was by-far the best thing we had in the evening.  The brioche buns we were expecting to be small (like the bao buns), but these were almost the size of a burger bun!!  The dish comes with 4 of these buns which is crazy!  Between two people, you could order just this and two glasses of wine and be very satisfied with your meal.
