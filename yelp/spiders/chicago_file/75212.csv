Little Goat Diner////Update- I've been back 3 times and every time keeps getting better and better.  The Patty Melt is the absolute BEST Patty Melt that I've ever had!  The meat here is AMAZING!!!!  I've had the FAT CLUB (Bacon, Turkey, Ham, Guacamole, Cheese), Patty Melt and the All American since my first visit and have not been disappointed!
