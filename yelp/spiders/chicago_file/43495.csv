Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Baba Reeba is not the best tapas restaurant in town but it is definitely a good choice when in LP.  I came here for the first time years ago when I was student teaching at Lincoln Park HS around the corner.  They had (still have I think) a fabulous happy hour special where a list of about 10 tapas were very inexpensive ($1-$3 each) and there bottles of beer for $3- a great value.
