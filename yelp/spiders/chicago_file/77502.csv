Little Goat Diner////I liked that they still had brunch/breakfast items to serve. I saw that this place is pretty big on brunch, so to have that still available late in the night was exciting. Of course, I didn't try that but instead tried the pork torta sandwich. Which was all right. I mean it tasted good but it was really messy to eat. I noticed that my friend who had the tonkatsu sandwich had the same problem. The tonkatsu on the other hand was oddly sour and not very satisfying to eat. I guess I should have expected that since that was more of a "fusion" item on the menu.
