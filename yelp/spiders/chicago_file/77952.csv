Little Goat Diner////I love good kimchi and Little Goat's version is actually decent. However, I'm not sure I liked it in the Reuben. The spicy and sour flavors of the kimchi just didn't jive with the traditional Reuben for me. The buttered and toasted bread and the quality of the corned beef was good. The sandwich was a little heavy and salty, but overall, not bad in my opinion.
