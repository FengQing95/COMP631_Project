Little Goat Diner////What I ordered: I started off with a cappuccino-- amazing. Def one of the best I've had in the city. It was perfectly frothy with no bitter, sour taste. For an appetizer I tried the tempura potatoes. They were good. There was a lot of Asian flavor. For my main I got the Bi Bim Bop Breakfast Bowl. It sounded good, but there was something off to me. Idk if the pickled veggies didn't sit right in my stomach or the sauce was spoiled sour-tasting. I truthfully am already having stomach problems after eating here.
