Little Goat Diner////We started with the biscuits and gravy, and the gravy was hearty and the biscuit so flaky, it was a good start. Then I had the special menu's lamb with sauted veggies, and my companion got the beef stew. The lamb was tender, and with the contrast of the crunchy veggies, and thin sweet potato glass noodles with some peanut sauce, it was a tasty bite! The meat itself was a little under-seasoned, but everything together tasted great.
