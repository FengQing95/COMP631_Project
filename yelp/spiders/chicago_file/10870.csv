Art Institute of Chicago////I went on a Friday morning/afternoon and it was packed. I got the CityPass and purchased access to the Van Gogh Bedrooms exhibit for additional $5. The Van Gogh exhibit was really busy and was crowded, but it was cool to walk through and see the three versions of Van Gogh's bedroom paintings.
