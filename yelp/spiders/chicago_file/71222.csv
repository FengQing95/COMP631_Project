Little Goat Diner////Had a 40 min wait so my friend and I went next door to get some coffee. I got a vanilla latte and it was delish and a good way to sit and wait. For food, my friend got the paratha burrito (we're Indian, so she was curious lol) and I got the Los Drowned and we split a side of Mac and cheese. The main dishes were great, I wolfed down my sandwich and the dip was so so good. But the Mac and cheese was disappointing, kind of dry and not very cheesy. Otherwise though, we enjoyed everything from service to atmosphere.
