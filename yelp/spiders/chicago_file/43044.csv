Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My only complaint was that the place is so loud. We found it was hard to have decent conversation, and people a few seats away from each other couldn't hear each other. Just keep that in mind. All in all, a very enjoyable experience! Make those reservations, though, the wait looked terrible (even though the place is HUGE).
