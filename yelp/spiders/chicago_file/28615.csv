Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza was delicious but the wait is insane.  Ordering pizza before being seated is a joke.  No way they even get it prepared.  You get seated after 90 minutes then they definitely cook the pizza because 45 mins after being seated your pizza arrives.  Some servers are really good some are awful.  We were there on a Thursday evening at 930 pm.  Our server actually came into our area where about 5 tables were located and said whose the fuck drink is this  !    Yes we were all shocked. Our bus boy was awesome very personable and did a great job.
