Little Goat Diner////Our party of five ( including a young child) had dinner at the Little Goat last evening. Dinner was a " tale of two cities" ---- terrific food with a poor overall dining experience.  Management at the front of the house was nonexistent. The two women at the front desk were unpleasant, indifferent, clearly bored and seemed to want to be anywhere but working at TLG.  They were having air conditioning problems ----- the place was stifling --- but rather than being upfront about it, the hostesses sat us silently, leaving us to wonder why we were so warm.  Our server tried valiantly but was clearly over burdened and warm.  Something was off throughout the meal. Even getting ice in our water proved challenging.
