Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I sat down and ordered an Old Fashioned. The Old Fashioned was very good. It was sweet, decently strong, and had a few big rocks so it wouldn't water down super fast. It is what to expect when it comes to a $14 cocktail and a high quality steakhouse. We both ended up getting our own 10oz Filet Mignons and ended up splitting a Mac n Cheese with bacon knowing that steakhouse sides are always massive. I ended up passing on the sourdough bread as I didn't want to be overly stuffed for the Bourbonfest.
