Little Goat Diner////Overall, I was unimpressed by the food for what i had expected, though a portion of that was my own fault. I want to go back and give it another try and be more adventurous with the menu, like a typical, not-hungover version of me would do, but with so many other comparable options for brunch (especially in the area), I'm not sure if I will return.
