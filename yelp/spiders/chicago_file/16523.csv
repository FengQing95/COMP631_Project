Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After writing my review, I was contacted by Lou Malnati's district manager to talk about my experience.  As reflected in my review, I wasn't crazy about their deep dish pizza --but that doesn't matter.  I really appreciated Lou Malnati's commitment to customer service, to reaching out, and to doing their best to make it right.  It's such a simple concept; it's so unusual to find it in today's world.  It makes me all that much more delighted to join them next time I'm in Chicago to try their thin crust.
