Little Goat Diner////Corn beef hash -- Interesting take on this dish, where the corn beef is not cubed, it is five inch slices of corn beef. In my opinion -- ick. And the hash browns were soggy, greasy, and at the same time al dente. I have never had al dente hash browns before...they were spiralized potatoes -- love the creativity-- but they were crunchy and not because they had been browned (which I would love). They were crunchy because they were slightly raw. To my taste, the only crunch I want in hash browns is on the outside of a fully cooked potato. This was a sloppy, unsightly mess. If I had been eating at the restaurant, I would have politely sent it back.
