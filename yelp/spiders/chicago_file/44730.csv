Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////After reviewing the menu, we each ordered something different for us to all pass around and try. My favorites are the Goat Cheese & Tomato Sauce, Spicy Potatoes, Bacon Wrapped Dates, Garlic Shrimp, and Stuffed Mushrooms. Make sure you get enough to share! They recommend 2-3 per person.
