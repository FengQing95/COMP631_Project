Smoque BBQ////Cons: Parking sucks during lunchtime--all the neighboring streets except one have NO PARKING between the hours of 8-5. Odd, huh? Parking during evening hours must be much better, though. There's a parking lot behind the restaurant that's free after 5 p.m. Also, there's only one BBQ, and it's a bit strong on the vinegar side.
