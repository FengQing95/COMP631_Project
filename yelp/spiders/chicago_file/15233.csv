Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ever since my husband and I moved to Chicago two years ago, we have loved dining at Lou Malnati's!  We like Gino's East and Giordano's but find that the crust is the BEST at Lou Malnati's.  It is lighter and crunchier.  We freeze the leftovers and it comes out good as new when reheated.
