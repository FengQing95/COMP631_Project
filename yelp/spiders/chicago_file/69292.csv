Little Goat Diner////Other:  This place is super cute.  I loved the decor - clean lines, white, and cute - but not too many - decorations.  There doesn't seem to be a good time to come - at least on the weekends - because it always seems busy.  Maybe during the week might be a little slower.  Either way the way they seat you is pretty cool - via a texting system.  It is also nice that they have a spill over area for you to wait while you wait for a table.  Nice bar and coffee area.
