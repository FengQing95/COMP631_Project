Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My bf and I wanted to impress our friends from out of town..being it Saturday night at 8pm , it was hard to look for a great restaurant that will give a good impression without a reservations . Luckily, I saw this place on my bookmark on yelp, I quickly called and was immediately told that there won't be any available seats until 10:30p I almost didn't go but I've been wanting to try this place since my friend recommended this place to me for a suprise bday party last yr bec this is a good place for a get together, however we didn't get to throw our suprise party because of reservations problem( in their defense tho its hard to reserve a table for 20 ppl in such a short notice), luckily my friends tonite wasn't picky and was willing to wait for 2hrs in the bar .
