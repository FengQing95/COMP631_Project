Little Goat Diner////My daughter, granddaughter and I dined at Little Goat Diner on a Saturday night in March. Although the restaurant was very busy, the service was friendly and attentive; and the server had excellent suggestions. I thoroughly enjoyed the shrimp and cheesy grits and the side of Brussels sprouts (these were fabulous - you must try), along with an very good apple flavored cocktail. I sampled my daughter's chicken pot pie, but was not impressed; rather dry and not much taste. I did love my granddaughter's mac & cheese (and so did she)! Â This place is worth a try, especially if you're up for a very casual, lively, fun and rather noisy dining experience.
