Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had high expectations. The wait was the worse for pizza on a Saturday night. Probably waited about an hour outside, received a text to come inside and wait more. They had me order pizza before going in to be seated because that's how they operate and said it takes time to make the pizza. To order other food that's not pizza, you have to be seated.
