Little Goat Diner////Quite a busy spot on Sundays, after a short wait was seated at the bar. As someone with a food allergy, I was impressed by their "dairy free" specific menu, which I have never seen at any other restaurant. I ordered a pork belly pancake that was delicious and reasonably priced. My girlfriend ordered fried chicken waffles and she was also impressed. Would highly recommend if you are visiting Chicago
