Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Took a trip to Lou Malnati's for my first deep dish experience in Chicago. My friend and I were seated right away, even though it was busy and the waiter was super attentive. We ordered the house salad to start and the classic Chicago deep dish pizza to share. The salad came out quickly and was pretty good. Nothing special, a very typical Italian restaurant salad. We got the creamy lemon garlic dressing over top though, and that was super delicious.
