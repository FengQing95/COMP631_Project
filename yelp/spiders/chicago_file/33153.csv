Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I am not one to give bad reviews but Bavette's host/hostess are rude. My husband and I are loyal customers to Gilt, Maude's, and Au Cheval. We have had 3 less than acceptable encounters with the host/hostess. The only reason Bavette's is getting two stars is because we had some drinks/apps at the bar and the bartender was great. Â I have no tolerance for poor customer service (I work in the industry), especially from the first person you encounter in a restaurant.
