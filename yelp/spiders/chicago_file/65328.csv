Smoque BBQ////Smoque catered a work event I recently attended and being originally from Memphis I must say this was some good bbq. We had the full spread from pork, brisket, chicken, chili, Mac and cheese, cornbread and some delicious bread pudding! The pork bbq was what you would expect from a true bbq place with nice seasoned smoked crisp edges with a nice consistency to the pulled pork just the right amount of juiciness. A nice surprise because I haven't found many bbq joints here in Chicago that lived up to Memphis. Even had a Memphis sauce which I thought tasted true to form. I would put Smoque right up there with Green Street Smoked Meats as quality bbq joints here in Chicago!
