Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The standouts were 30, 53, and 68. The spicy potatoes are perfection, especially with the sauce. The empanada's crust was really fluffy. The roast dates were the nice surprise of the night. The fried calamari wasn't very good. I like my calamari to be very crispy, and this one was disappointingly soggy. The sirloin was also nothing special.
