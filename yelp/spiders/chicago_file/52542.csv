Smoque BBQ////Now this is what I'm talking about!  Finally found some respectable BBQ in Chicago.  All the meat items received a satisfactory score in my grade books.  I usually like my baby back ribs to just fall off the bone, but I'm quite happy with Smoque's offerings.  Even sweeter, I got to use my Chicago a la card too!
