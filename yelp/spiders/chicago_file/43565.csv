Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our waitress was very friendly, it was our first time so she took the time to walk us through the menu, and also gave us her recommendations. We ordered the paella ahead of time because it takes about 30-40min, and started out with a pitcher of white peach sangria and a dish of bacon wrapped dates. Seems like a simple dish but it was very tasty ;)
