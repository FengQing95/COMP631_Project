The Purple Pig////I had the bone marrow meal and my cousin had the pork and set potato. There was also a broccoli dish we tried which we both loved. The waiter was great! I would have to give the biggest kudos to the people sitting around us. We asked what their go-to was and they were so nice to give us a variety of food and their thoughts!
