Little Goat Diner////My friend had the corned beef and hash which got a thumbs up, and my boyfriend had the Spanish omelette, which was not at all a true Spanish omelette.  This was more a pile of potatoes and scrambled eggs squished together and had tortilla chips on top!!  Although it's often called a tortilla española, it is NOT supposed to come with tortilla or tortilla chips!  Aye aye aye.  And no, it wasn't a "play on words"...
