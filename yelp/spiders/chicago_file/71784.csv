Little Goat Diner////My wife and I FINALLY went there this morning, and ordered Korean Burger and Fork Pork Chop.  They both were amazing.  Pork Chop had a very surprising turnout with Kimchi and steamed (or it seems.. def. not grilled) boneless pork.  The taste was simply amazing, the meat was extremely soft.
