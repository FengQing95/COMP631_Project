Little Goat Diner////I'm going to start my review by saying I am a Girl and the Goat fan and all of Stephanie's restaurants. My husband moved out of Chicago 3 years ago and every time I visit I look forward to either seeing what she has that is new or visiting my old favorites. We went on a Sunday so naturally I expected it to be a long wait. However, when we got there it was 1.5 hours, once again, not a surprise. However, while we were waiting there, you could see seats open (wasted in my opinion) for long periods of time. In fact, the 2 seats at the counter that we were sat in stayed open for 30 minutes before we were sat in them. They need to get their front of the house in order. Also, when you sit at the counter you see a lot. I ordered the bim bim bop and my husband the bull's eye french toast. I saw there for 15 minutes and could see our orders sitting under the heat lamp and sure enough, when I got my dish, the 2 eggs on the top were over cooked. You can't have bim bim bop without the runny egg. My husband's egg were the same within the bull's eye french toast, not runny. I'm not sure I will wait this long again if the service and quality continue on this path.
