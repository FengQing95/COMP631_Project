Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My friend and I went to dinner last night and split the 16 oz ribeye (medium rare), garlic mashed potatoes, elotes corn and wild mushrooms. I would give the sourdough bread/butter they bring out 5+ stars (bread was phenomenal, warm, and huge slices). Â I would also give the sides 5 stars, especially the elotes corn (I would go back for the elotes corn) that was super tasty and a great side to a steak. However, the ribeye was just okay. I expected a better tasting steak for the $59 price. The ribeye did not have much marbling. Steak was the leanest piece of ribeye I ever had and having a lean piece of ribeye is somewhat of an oxymoron to me. Steak flavor was okay. I like the ribeye steak better at Gibsons which is charred, had great marbling and flavor. Customer service was great and water glasses were filled all the time and was checked on. I wouldn't go back for the steak but come back for the sides (and order some other meat entree). I am giving this a 4 star for the customer service and sides but a 3 star for the steak.
