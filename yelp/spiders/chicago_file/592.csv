Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Me and my family absolutely loved this place! I was going to give it a 4 star because the wait to this place is ridiculous however, their food won my heart. I stayed in Chicago for three days and everyday that we tried to eat here, the wait was one hour and 30 min and finally, the last attempt was a wait of 30 min. This place gets very packed! The wait was definitely worthwhile because the food was very good and the service was quick. I would definitely come back to this restaurant if I visit Chicago again.
