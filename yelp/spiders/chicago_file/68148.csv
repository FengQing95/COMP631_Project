Little Goat Diner////I went here last weekend while visiting my sister for the weekend. We were a party of three, and waited 45 minutes for a table for brunch (on a Sunday), so that was no problem at all.  When we got to our table, we had already scoured the awesome menu (very fun and creative), and got right down to business and ordered.  My sister and her girlfriend each ordered French toast with fried chicken.  I ordered the Elvis waffles.
