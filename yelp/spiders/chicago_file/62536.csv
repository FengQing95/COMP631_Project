Smoque BBQ////Fantastic. Although it's a little out of the way, I loved it. We had chopped and sliced brisket, BBQ chicken, pulled pork and sides of macaroni and cheese, cornbread and fries. It was a feast for all! It was delicious-- all of it-- and the guys were really nice and helped us share all of it with extra trays, lots of napkins and awesome service.
