Little Goat Diner////This is considered a diner, but the menu is very innovative and the atmosphere is trendy and classy. The menu is huge- everything from breakfast to dinner. My mom and I finally narrowed down the choices to 3 items and our Â waitress helped us choose 2 items - los drowned and the pork belly pancake. After we ordered, Rod Stewart walked past our table on his way out and my mom embarrassingly chased him down for a picture. After this she said she was too excited to eat, but as soon as the food arrived her appetite quickly returned! Everything was delicious and the portions were generous. I will definitely be back so I can explore the rest of the menu!
