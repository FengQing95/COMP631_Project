Smoque BBQ////So while Smoque definitely ranks near the top of my nationwide BBQ list, it is certainly the best in Chicago and everyone should go here often.  Oh and the wait is super long so if you just roll up and ask for a table, you'll be waiting super long.   My advice is order takeout and they'll give you a specific time to come in and get it. And although you may feel guilty walking past the fools in line and going straight to the register, you deserve it for planning ahead.  Even just calling on your way over will get you a lot closer to that brisket platter.  Oh and ask for the thick sauce too.  I prefer it to the more vinegary style sauce that comes with the platter.
