Little Goat Diner////Of course as a tourist, I was all like "We are going to Chicago--- let's go to Stephanie Izard's Girl and the Goat".  And of course we didn't make a reservation.  And of course they had a ridiculous wait (it may have been 2 hours... but don't quote me on that).  So we headed across the street to Little Goat.
