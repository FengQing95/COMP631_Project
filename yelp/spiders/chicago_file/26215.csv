Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So good! The line can get super crazy so you'll want to time this right--early on a weekday. There's a ton of space inside (multiple levels) but still. The food itself is incredible. The Lou came out and the small size served two of us perfectly--we finished it and were full but not hating ourselves too much. The service is friendly and quick! However, as is typical with true deep dish, you can expect to wait about 40 minutes for your pie.
