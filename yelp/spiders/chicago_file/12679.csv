Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was told by a Chicagoan that this was one of their more commericial pizza chains, and I figured having over 300 good reviews, how could you go wrong? I ordered the cheezy bread loaf and a deep dish chicago style pizza. Straight forward and simple. BOTH came to us semi cold and the crust on the pizza was undercooked. It was as if when they were done baking them in the oven, they let it sit out for pick up and no one grabbed it for a while. Pizza should be piping hot, oozing with cheese! You could still taste the grainy squishy dough underneath. Our hostess was really attentive and friendly, so that was a plus. Not a good deep dish experience.
