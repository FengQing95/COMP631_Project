Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Bread was ok, salad was good. On to the main dishes. The pizza was subpar. Very thin crust, I almost didn't even know it had a crust at the bottom and not much cheese. Now the pasta. They said they make homemade sauce, there's no way! The creamy sauce tasted like a canned sauce with cheese added. It have zero flavor, not much chicken at all. It was horrible.
