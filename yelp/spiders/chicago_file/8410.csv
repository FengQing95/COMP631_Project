Art Institute of Chicago////Dos: what is it about art museums that brings out such heightened ignorance in people? Fuck all of you douche bags who clogged the halls and my ears with your philistine-like bird calls of "I like ___/I don't get ___"--don't you know that one of the prominent objectives of contemporary art is to reject the inadequacy of such thinking? Yeesh. Go to the poster store across the street if you want some lilies, you dumbfucks.
