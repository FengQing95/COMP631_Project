The Purple Pig////The Purple Pig was probably one of the most memorable meals I've had in a while. My boyfriend I were in Chicago for vacation and I really wanted to try this place because of the reviews on yelp. Needless to say I was very happy that our plans worked out. We ordered the crispy pigs ears, chicken bolognese pasta, and the blade steak. Our waiter was very great and informative that our plates did not have a course order. The plates would come out whichever was ready first.
