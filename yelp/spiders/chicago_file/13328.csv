Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Excellent.  I always order a pie for carry out, get there a little early, drink a beer at the bar, and then head home.  The bartenders are fantastic!  They are easily some of the best bartenders in the city.  Everyone is extremely friendly.  The deep dish is what they are known for, but I've become a bigger fan of the thin crust.  The deep dish is still really good, but the thin crust has been just-right this fall.  I was also pleasantly surprised to find the Italian beef sandwich is very good.
