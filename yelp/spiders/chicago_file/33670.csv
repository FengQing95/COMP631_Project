Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is exactly what I expect from Brendan Sodikoff and company. 5 stars for the atmosphere and service. I patiently sat at the bar swigging exquisitely crafted dirty marts while I waited for my date whose flight into snowy/icey Chicago was delayed. The hostesses were beyond patient and when he finally arrived, we were having such a great experience that we cancelled our plans scheduled for later in the night to instead stay a bit longer (while drinking numerous French 75s).
