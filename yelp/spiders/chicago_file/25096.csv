Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////HOWEVER, this pizza accomplishes rare form, as it's even better a day later than when first out of the oven - and it's pretty legit fresh. I admire their tomato sauce the most and believe their cheese to be heavenly (when pulling a slice, the strings create an actual gateway into heaven).
