Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I went in on a Friday around 5pm. It was starting to get really busy, but I was able to avoid the lines and got seated at the bar. Bartenders were extremely friendly; they took the time to help a tourist like me decide which pizza to order (which I appreciate, I'm sure it gets annoying sometimes). Put it an order for a classic deep dish pizza, personal size.
