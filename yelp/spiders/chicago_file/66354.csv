Little Goat Diner////Ok, that's all good.  So, we ordered a small caesar salad and a special "wings" burger which the waitress said was the best one.  As we waited, we saw a lot of fried foods and enormous bread buns going out to other diners.  Indeed, when we got our caesar, the salad had some delicious fried anchovies on top and a pretty good dressing, a little mayonnaise-y and salty and some huge soft croutons.  Had we not been seated in that great atmosphere, however, my husband thinks that we would not have been that interested in eating all that salt and fried food on a salad.  And, then came the wings burger with its buffalo sauce and blue cheese sauce and fried onion bits on top.  And, an enormous, kind of dry bun.  I wanted to love it, but it was so salty and the beef was so tough, it just wasn't great. It was too complicated.  Too many different salty flavors.  It seems like making a great burger should be easy for a "diner" type of place.
