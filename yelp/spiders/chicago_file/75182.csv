Little Goat Diner////We had breakfast here.. more like brunch or even lunch.... it was our first meal of the day, how's that?   Anyway, this is a pretty darn decent place to eat whatever meal of the day you're having.   We had a bit of a wait.. 20 minutes or so.  What do you expect when you arrive at 11 am on a Saturday, this is not an original idea!
