Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So to be fair I love lou Malnatis to begin with- I grew up in Chicago and have been eating it since birth. Tonight I ordered from the wells location and was quoted an hour for delivery- worth the wait on a normal evening. However, I had my first ever disappointment with lous when the driver was an extra 15 minutes beyond that AND brought us the wrong pizza. My friend politely said that's ok(really, it's not) Â and I instantly got on the phone with the manager(I think his name was Jason?). I explained the situation and before I was even done talking he comped our meal and even gave us a free appetizer of our choice! I was so impressed with this customer service that I don't even mind waiting the extra 20 min for the driver to go back and get the right pizza. Needless to say I still think Lou's is the best deep dish in Chicago, and I will continue to order from here over anywhere else.
