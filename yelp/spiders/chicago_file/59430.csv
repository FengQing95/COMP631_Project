Smoque BBQ////We got the baby back ribs, brisket, and pulled pork platters with all the sides they offer. Our favs were the brisket and pulled pork. The baby back looked dry but actually weren't. However, none of us were a fan of the dry rub marinade (that's a personal preference b/c my mom's ribs are 100000x better than anyone else's, including Smoque's... sorry!).
