Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////While we were intimidated by the large crowd assembled at the entrance when we arrived on a Fri night, we were pleasantly surprised by the ease of being seated. The waitress took our pizza order in advance, as the pizza takes 45 minutes to cook, so by the time we were seated 25 minutes later, we only had a small wait for our food. Additionally, we devoured the free pizza samples while we waited.
