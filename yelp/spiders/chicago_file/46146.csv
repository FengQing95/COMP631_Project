Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Any place i keep going back to deserves 5 stars in my book. Really tasty, diverse tapas menu. Like everyone has said, get the bacon date wraps. we were floored by them. But! another favorite of ours is the mini lobster tails. Â One time they came out alittle overcooked, but every other time has been delicious- once we even ordered them twice in one meal!
