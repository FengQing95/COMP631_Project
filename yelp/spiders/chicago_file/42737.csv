Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place - one of the only accurate Spanish restaurants I have ever eaten at in the United States. Every time I come here I feel like for a brief period I am in Madrid again! Order a bunch of raciones plates (make sure the Jamon Iberico and Calamari are included!) and share with a few friends.
