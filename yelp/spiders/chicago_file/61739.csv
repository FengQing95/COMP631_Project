Smoque BBQ////Delicious!!! Best BBQ ribs I've ever tried. Side dishes are not that tasty compared to the ribs but they were good. It's a small place, sometimes you have to wait to be seated, they also have take out but it's a 40 min drive from where I live so by the time I get home food won't be warm anymore. The only thing I didn't like it's that they have this long tables where you sit next to others and it's kind of uncomfortable because you are eating ribs!! It's messy so at least I want some privacy and I don't like to have a stranger seating next to me and watching me eating this messy food. Other than that it's a great place. I wish they were closer.
