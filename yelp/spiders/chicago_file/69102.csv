Little Goat Diner////We went on a Monday, which also happened to be President's Day (and my 30th birthday, bam!) which meant the wait was 45-60 minutes. Oof. So, we got our name on the list and went to Haymarket for a beer while we waited. 55 minutes and two brews later, we were seated at the end of the (only?) communal table with a family and their two kids (who stared at us the entire meal.)
