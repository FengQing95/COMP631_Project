Little Goat Diner////We had a reservation and so were seated promptly upon arrival by the very friendly hostess. I was quite excited to see such a large vegetarian/vegan menu as I am usually provided with 2-3 mediocre options. The waitress was quite helpful in recommending a few options, and I went with the veggie burger done banh mi style. Although far too greasy for me, grease is expected from a diner and the sandwich was still delicious. I don't know the name of what my friend ordered, but his dairy free chocolate shake was fantastic. Overall, great service, ambiance, and food. I would highly recommend.
