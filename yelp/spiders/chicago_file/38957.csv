Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////If there's an award for Chicago's sexiest steakhouse, Bavette's would be the hands-down winner.  This place is dark, almost clandestine, and oozes old Paris, with shadows, bricks, beams, leather and smoky mirrors, moody gaslight lamps, and vintage French jazz music in the background, like Edith Piaf is going to make an appearance at any time.  People speak in hushed tones and avoid eye contact.  This is the place to bring your lover, or as it was on this night, my wife and son!
