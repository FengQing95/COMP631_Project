Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Casual. Street  parking: feed meters. Good margaritas. Vegetarian options. It was our first time there so we wanted to do strictly tapas vs. Paella.  The menu is clear and easy to navigate once the waiter explains. A menu is kept table Side so you can continue to order throughout. I'd start with ordering all the pintxos, and anything else you can order as a collective sample.  Good way to get started.  Beef with blue cheese and anything with dates were stand out items. I'd return again.
