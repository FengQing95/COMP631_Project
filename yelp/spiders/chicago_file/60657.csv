Smoque BBQ////Our order was placed and I had the brisket....something I dearly miss from Texas and have struggled to find a place that does it as well as places like Salt Lick in Austin in the Mid-west.  It was a brisket platter I ordered which comes with cole slaw and 2 sides.  My sides were baked beans and fries.  By the time we had our order taken and paid we had a table to sit in.  We waited for between 10 and 15 minutes which wasn't that long, but felt longer with all the folks around us eating, plus the smell of the food cooking?!?!?!
