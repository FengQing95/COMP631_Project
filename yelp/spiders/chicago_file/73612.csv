Little Goat Diner////We ordered the Los Drowned, Machos Nachos, Patty Melt, All American, Banh Mi Style, and Loco Moco. All the food was unique, flavorful, and very filling. The portions were, in true diner style, huge. The menu features classic American food with an unexpected twist. However, the menu lacks detail, so I would recommend asking your waiter/waitress for more information. For example, my friend thought she was ordering a burger and it ended up being served without a bun, but she thoroughly enjoyed her meal regardless.
