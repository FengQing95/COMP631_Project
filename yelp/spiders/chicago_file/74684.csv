Little Goat Diner////The serving is very tiny for the price you pay. We ordered the This Little Pig Went to China dish and it was only one biscuit for $14. The service we had for our first time there was awful. Tried to sub my pork sausage for something else and the waiter was a jerk about it saying that it can never be done with no further explanations. Would NEVER come back to this overhyped place.
