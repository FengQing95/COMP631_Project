Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The dishes that I did not love were the seared sausages and chicken and sausage. The sausages were too fatty for my liking, and the chicken and sausage dish came with the same sausage as the seared sausage dish so not worth getting both! However, there's plenty more options on the menu to try! Looking forward to trying the paella and one-bites (pinxtos) next time.
