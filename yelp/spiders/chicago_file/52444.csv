Smoque BBQ////So the third time I had Smoque BBQ, my boyfriend surprised me by ordering ribs for pick up there on a Saturday night, we barely made it there before they closed their doors to pick up the food and this time the ribs were the worst i had ever had. I don't know if it was because they were about to close already and they just gave us the last ribs they had, but they were hard full of fat and muscle that you are obviously supposed to take off before you cook, I have made ribs before so I know its sucks and its hard work to take off all the fat and muscle (it also depends where you buy them obviously) We were so disappointed, AGAIN! We swore never to return to Smoque BBQ for ribs, they just were not ribs to be consumed by us, but hey apparently many other people do like them. This was just my experience.
