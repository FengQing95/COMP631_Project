Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The bf and I split the small 9 inch Chicago Classic (with tomatoes, cheese, meatball sausage on their famous Buttercrust) and added sauteed fresh garlic to the mix. After 35 whole minutes, as the waitress had warned, our pizza arrived hot in its own cast iron deep-dish pan. I have to say that I did enjoy the overall flavor of the pie, especially the sauce and sauteed garlic. The buttercrust was good too, if not a little greasy; I was grateful that the deep-dish here isn't actually too "deep" - not too heavy on the crust to filling ratio. What I didn't enjoy so much however, was the way that Lou Malnati's layers the different components of their pizzas. The cheese is layered in slices under the sauce, and the sausage was layered similarly, evenly across the bottom of the pan. The construction not only made each bite kind of boring after two bites, but the cheese also got quite gloopy and chewy as the pie got cold. Overall the pizza was just a total gut-bomb, not something I would want to have more than once.
