Art Institute of Chicago////I highly recommend seeing the Impressionist paintings first. There you will find Monet's Haystacks and Water Lilies, George Seurat's A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Paris Street; Rainy Day, Van Gogh's Self-Portrait & Bedroom, Renoirs, and many other famous paintings. If you are in a time crunch, take a look at the back of the Art Institute brochure and the notable artwork will be highlighted. You should try to see those first. But I guess this is really personal preference.
