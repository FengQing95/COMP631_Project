Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Like Au Cheval and Maude's, Bavette's has great cocktails.  I started with the Sazerac and was not disappointed.  Wonderfully blended, it was a traditional Sazerac with an absinthe rinsed glass instead of putting the absinthe right into the cocktail.  I definitely want to go back to try some of the other drinks.
