Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////After which the waiter was in such a rush to clean up ...I was feeding my 22month old and he just picked my plate without asking if I was done there was a whole toast in there in which he threw the syrup dish and when I told him I was still eating he put that plate in front of me in which there were condiment dishes from the clearing and my daughters toast was soaked in syrup!
