Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My dad really wanted to try this restaurant out and he had clients in from Amsterdam to take to dinner, so there were 5 of us in all, not a large number. He had made a reservation and we walk in, and they had our reservation, and no table set up for five...so around ten minutes later, they seat us in a passage-way area, with my dad at the head of a table for 4, so it was really crowded to begin with, then we had the waitstaff and bussers etc. all squeezing past him every 5 seconds, like the last table you would ever fill in a restaurant, saved for those who did not make a reservation.
