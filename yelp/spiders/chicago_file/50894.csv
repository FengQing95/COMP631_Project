Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ok. This is my second time here and I really enjoyed the service and the food. Everything was spot on!  I had Mezcal Mule and it was awesome - a small kick with the pepper!  Loved it!  Try the goat cheese in tomatoes sauce. It was great!  Don't eat the free bread - it will just slow you down!
