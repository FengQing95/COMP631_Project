Little Goat Diner////Only been here once, which makes it hard to review since there are so many items on the menu that look really good. I wasn't super adventurous and had the chocolate coco pancakes and a side of pork sausage. The portion was huge, so I could only finish about 2/3 of the pancakes, but they were really good. I naturally have a sweet tooth so I couldn't resist ordering them, but there are definitely some more adventurous items I'd like to try next time. If you go early, there is no wait, but I hear it can get really crowded at peak times. If I had to be really picky, the only thing I didn't love was their coffee, mainly because they only have this organic sweetener available (which isn't as flavorful), and I'm so used to regular sweet n low, but that is minor. Overall, very nice service and restaurant.
