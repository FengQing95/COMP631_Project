Smoque BBQ////The sides were, well, meh. Â The mac n cheese didn't have much flavor to it, and I am not a fan of the bread crumb topping at all. Come to think of it, the corn bread didn't have much flavor either. It was pretty dry and I have had better from a box from Trader Joes. Husband said the beans were good, I thought they were just ok. Honestly, the slaw was pretty bad. I thought I would like it more because it's not too saucy, which is good for me considering that in my version of hell, everything is covered in mayo. But it just wasn't good. The cabbage pieces were too large and again didn't have a good flavor. I took two bites and offered the rest to my husband, who will eat pretty much anything, and even he declined. Oh well.
