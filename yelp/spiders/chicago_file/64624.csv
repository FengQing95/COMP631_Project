Smoque BBQ////I came her mid day on a Saturday and it was pretty packed, I but was able to get a table right away. I ordered a sliced brisket sandwich with coleslaw and Mac and cheese. My Bf ordered the chicken, coleslaw and chili. With my entree i was given two little barbeque sauces with a description. One that was Carolina Â style barbecue, thin and vinegary good for brisket. And Memphis style barbecue thick, and bold. I poured both on my sandwich and stuffed in some coleslaw and devoured it. Then I proceeded to eat my bfs food also, I am such a fat ass. The chili was light and packed with flavor. Everyone should definitely try this restaurant out! I would love to come back and try the rest of the menu.
