Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For starters I had the duck that came with an apricot spread on toast. I was a bit hesitant because it had a pate-type of look...But It was tasty. My main course was the N.Y. Strip...hands down one of the top 5 steaks I've ever ingested, so the rumours were true. Sides were truffle mac w/bacon (so good), spinach (good) and fries (not bad.) For dessert I went with French pressed coffee which was a perfect end to the meal.
