Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visited Chicago from LA and heard this was a must-try.  Line was over an hour long wait.  Once seated we ordered typical appetizers, wings, mozzarella sticks, cheese bread etc.  You could taste the store-bought refrigerated taste.  We were full once deep-dish pizzas arrived.  For all the hype, I wasnt too impressed.  Tasted pretty much like LA's Pizza Hut.
