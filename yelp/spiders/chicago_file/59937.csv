Smoque BBQ////That's it. Smoque is officially THE BEST barbecue in town. The last time I visited this fine establishment, I had the pulled pork. Good, very good. But this past time, I went out on a limb and tried the baby back ribs. I must admit that I was a bit skeptical, as I have a special affinity for barbecue sauce on ribs and didn't really trust the dry rub. But alas, I was feeling a little adventurous. And boy did it pay off!
