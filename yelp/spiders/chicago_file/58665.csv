Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////so I made a reservation weeks ago and at that time, only the patio was open. However, I was informed that you cannot only make a res for the patio and that you can only wait 30 minutes or you had to be seated inside. No body in my party was comfortable being seated inside and I think this communication error impacted our dinner. We waited for an extra 20 past our res. I will also note that not the entire patio is completely open - I would not be comfortable siting further in the patio that is enclosed. However, we were seated at a very open table and were able to order food.
