Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The customer service here was astonishing. The waiter was personable and provided history of some dishes and Spanish culture. A manager also stopped by our table and had a genuine conversation with us. We were short on time at the restaurant due to traveling and the staff worked to accommodate us. We were also given a complimentary dessert due to celebrating an anniversary. Amazing tapas and sangria, hands down the best customer service.
