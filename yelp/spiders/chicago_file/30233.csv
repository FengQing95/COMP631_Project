Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They've got their service down to a science to expedite your order and I appreciate that.  It's take about an hour for them to bake up the hottest pies north of the river.  So to minimize wait time they have you place your order while you're waiting for a table.  It was a 15-20 min wait for a table on Friday evening, not too bad. Once seated we we're served drianks ans appetizers/salad.  Shortly after our pizza came out. It was seamless.  You can tell they've been doing this for awhile, expertly executed.
