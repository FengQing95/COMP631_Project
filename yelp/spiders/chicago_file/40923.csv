Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////excellent service, excellent food, and great atmosphere. definitely a busy place. i went there for a business dinner and we had a great time sharing the tapas and the sangria! i would recommend the spicy potatoes, the tomato bread, and the paella! i dont remember the actual names :)
