Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I went into our lunch fully intending to order their Chocolate Chip Pizza after a previous stay in River North that taunted me the entire time with the smell of fresh-baked cookies. However, after my gut-busting failed attempt to eat a second slice of our deep dish I had to abandon all hope. Meal or dessert - never the twain shall meet in my belly during a LM visit.
