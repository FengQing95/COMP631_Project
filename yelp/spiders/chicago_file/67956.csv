Little Goat Diner////This is a new place in our neighborhood and I had to try it - even if there was a wait on a Sunday morning - and there was, but it wasn't awful, just about 30 minutes. Â I would love to go to Girl and the Goat, but I can never get a reservation when I want it, so I decided I will settle for Little Goat since it takes no reservations.
