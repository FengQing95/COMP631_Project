Little Goat Diner////As I sat and looked around I was just enamoured - the design of everything from the booths, the counter in front of the kitchen, the bar in Little Goat Bread (beside the diner), and even the windows on the ceiling in the middle of the room - it was all just wonderful and homy. Plus, any place that plays at least one Fleetwood Mac song while I'm there is a winner in my book! Â I'll definitely be back, but maybe at a less busy hour - in an attempt to avoid mistakes and slightly frantic workers.
