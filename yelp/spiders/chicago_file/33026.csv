Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food is good as you'd expect but its not a 5 star for two reasons. Firstly it's ridiculously expensive.  I have eaten at every high end restaurant in Chicago and I'm a great believer in you get what you pay for.  That is not the case with Bavette's.  The Dover Sole was $85.  the next night I was at Tavern on Rush where it was equally as good and $46.  Go figure.  Secondly, it's so dark!!  Even with my reading glasses I struggled to read the menu.  I believe in mood lighting but this takes it too far.  I like to see what I'm eating.  So very good but there are equally good steak houses in Chicago where you can see and feel as though you've had better value.  ie Joe's, Prime and Provisions to name a couple
