Art Institute of Chicago////From Lord's inspiration to Yelp's persuasion I hit the Art Institute. When I arrived, I did not find any Yelpers. It was a fortuitous blessing. I haven't had *me* time in a while. As soon I started viewing the work, I was thankful I was alone. The beauty and genius was too much.
