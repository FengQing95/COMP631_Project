Little Goat Diner////Our server was friendly and fun, and also super cute, so that was a plus. She was attentive and most importantly didn't f*** anything up (cute only goes so far when you're playin' wit a fat man's food). Her recommendations for some things were great as well, like the Goat's Chocolate Milk, which was amazing and rich.
