Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Let me give you some positives, just in case you want to order "take out"--highly recommended that you do.  To name a few highlights, the Gambas al Ajillo, Braised Shortrib, Escargot, Patatas Bravas, Sausages, and Croquetas were all delicious...the food was good tapas fare.  No issues here with the food and the pricing is very reasonable.
