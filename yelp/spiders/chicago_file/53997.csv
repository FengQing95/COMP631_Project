Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite spots for tapas! Everything is so delicious and different. Such a fun spot to go with a group of people and just order different things. The food is so rich in flavor and please do yourself a favor and order the sangria.. OUT.OF.THIS.WORLD. It's amazing!! The staff is very friendly and helpful if you have any questions. This place is a must for rotation or if you're visiting town and want a delicious tapas bar! Make sure you make reservations to make sure you get the time and date you want easier!
