Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Def. get a reservation here, because have done it both ones- once with once without.  And the without- not so much.  Overall, good experience.  Would suggest summer for this place as the patio is a lot of fun.  Good Sangria.  Try the mushrooms and the smoke salmon with cucumber.  You'll fall in love :)  Ok, not really in love, but you know.  So why now 5 stars, because there are just to many other WONDERFUL places in Chicago to dine at.  Will go back at somepoint in time, that's for certain.
