Art Institute of Chicago////I spent about and hour and a half in the contemporary galleries. My time was running short so I made a quick skimming of the Asian art galleries. I wanted to run up to the American and folk artists, but my time was short. If i didn't read every little description, I would have been able to fit it all in, but unfortunately all I could do was wish for more time.
