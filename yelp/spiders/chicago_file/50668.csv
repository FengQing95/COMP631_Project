Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Next out was some kind of steak with bleu cheese with chips and stuffed mushrooms. The chips were crisp and browned, just as I like them. The steak was cooked perfectly - the waiter said the chef usually cooks it medium, but we can choose how we like it cooked. We told him however the chef recommends, we will do that! The bleu cheese was a bit much, though, so both my friend and I scraped it off. The mushrooms were stuffed with spinach and cheese of some kind and topped with bread crumbs. They were cooked to perfection. Still had a little bite to them but the mixture inside- YUM!
