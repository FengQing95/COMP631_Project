Art Institute of Chicago////This was my fifth trip to the Art Institute. I can't visit Chicago without spending at least a few hours here. I love Chicago and this is one of the many things that make this city one of the great cities of our country and, dare I say, the world. From the iconic lions outside to the excellent café and gift shop, and all the art in between, it's well worth your time. I love the architecture of the building, the beautiful stairways and galleries. I tend to focus on the impressionist and Dutch Master art but I appreciate the nicely curated medieval and renaissance collections as well as the Greek and Roman exhibits. For whatever reason, this trip I focused on still life art. I find them infinitely fascinating plays on texture and light. The temporary exhibits are always well done and worth including in your itinerary. This was my first visit at Christmas and this made the visit extra special. We loved the Christmas wreaths on the lions outside and the greenery on the stairwells inside. We only had a few hours but we were able to see most of the things we wanted to and still had time for a gourmet lunch in the café and some browsing and buying in the gift shop.
