Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a person coming from out of state, this cannot be "the" place to get a deep dish. Perhaps the shops expanded too quickly, cause the food was mediocre. I've had better deep dish outside Chicago. It was an average deep dish pie with above average pricing. Not worth the wait, nor the hype. Service was ok. I'd go somewhere else.
