Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After a trip to Millennium Park to do "touristy things," my friends and I decided to stop here for a quick dinner. We came at around 9 on a Monday Â evening and there was about a 20 minute wait for seats. No biggie. Once we were seated, our server greeted us and took our orders. We settled for an order of fried calamari, Lou's bruschetta and the Malnati's salad. All 3 appetizers were delicious and were amazing to munch on before our deep-dish pizzas came.
