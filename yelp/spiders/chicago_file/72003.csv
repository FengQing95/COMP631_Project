Little Goat Diner////Service is great, food is great, menu has a wide variety from diner type food to higher end restaurant food. For appetizers we ordered the crab dip, which is my favorite by far. It's so damn good! I always need more Ritz crackers, I want to lick the plate clean after. We also got a crispy shrimp that was super delicious, it didn't even need to be dipped into the dip it came with.
