Smoque BBQ////We decided to hit Smoque on our last day in Chicago.  After seeing it featured on Diners, Dives, and Drive Ins my family had very high expectations (and hopes).  Parking was a problem but we found a spot on a side street and walked right up and in- no long lines at 11:45am!   We are from Texas and my husband is a barbecue snob.  We tried the pulled pork, brisket, and ribs. We were not disappointed.  The meats and the sides were delicious!  A place well worth going "out of the way" for!
