Art Institute of Chicago////This review has nothing to do with the art. It is some of the finest in the world. However, it was uncomfortable in parts of the building. So much so that my wife and I started feeling sick. It was stuffy and stagnant and stale. Unfortunately, we weren't able to fully appreciate our day there.
