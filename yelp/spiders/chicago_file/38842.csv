Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Drinks (a Gibson) is weak and not cold enough for a true steak house beverage. Lacking ice shards, the liquid is simply not cold enough. Wine is available although you can bRing a bottle sans corkage fee but be prepared to pay a tax - a pour of the bottle to be shared with another diner.
