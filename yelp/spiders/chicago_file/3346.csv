The Purple Pig////The Purple Pig is a very happening foodie hub, set in an intimate dining layout. You share food in a tapas/small plate style, so come with a few friends and prepare for foodgasms and endless flowing wine (that you can all chip in for). Make sure to come early and grab your seats, since there are no reservations! We waited 45 minutes before they opened up a table. You'll probably be sharing a table so if you're not a conversationalist .. position yourself elsewhere.
