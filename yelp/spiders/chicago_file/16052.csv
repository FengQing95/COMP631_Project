Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first taste of original deep dish pizza in Chicago.  We were walking around one afternoon shopping and checking out the scene near our hotel.  And BAM! there it was Lou M's...  We sat down and ordered from their lunch menu which was a great deal.  We were seated right away and the waitress took our order.  We got drinks right away, but  they sent out a complimentary appetizer to ease our hunger since our pizzas were taking awhile in the kitchen (still not sure what the hold up was).
