Smoque BBQ////I was in Tinley Park on business and decided to drive into Chicago to try Smoque.  Boy am I glad I did!!  The best bbq i have ever had!  The prices are amazing too!  The bread pudding was out of this world.  The best though is the babyback ribs.  Fall off the bone tender and the flavor cannot be beat.  If you want world class ribs this is the place!!!
