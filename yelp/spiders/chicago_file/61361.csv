Smoque BBQ////Thanks for the review. I'm glad you enjoyed the food and I'm sorry for the other stuff.  It's true that as a matter of policy, we don't seat incomplete parties, but when the restaurant is empty I have to agree that it seems a little silly.  We need to do a better job using judgement on that during slow times.
