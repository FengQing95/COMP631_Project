Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As for food, it was just as amazing! We ordered the shrimp cocktail for an app (HUGE-like 10 pieces of delicious shrimp), the 10 oz. filet with buttery mash and elote style corn for sides. We STILL had leftovers at the end, very nice portion sizes for shareable sides. And the service was on point! Refilling water glasses, taking plates, cleaning up crumbs, good timing between drinks/apps/main course. And our server Eric was amazing! Overall an amazing experience!
