Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////all in all,,,i give this place 5 stars. if u plan to go there calll for reservations bc it is surely purely packed with lots of people. I went in Chicago and i heard there's also one in Vegas. In the chicago location, it's a huge restaurant..they even have patio seating. it is noisy in there.. our server was not sooo great..everytime we wanted her so we can order more tapas she is now usually there so we usually wait or we talk to another server. The sangria was also delish!!! i wanna taste their white peach sangria..maybe next time i'm out in vegas i'll try this place again
