Little Goat Diner//// I will start with recommendations for improvement...both the cinnamon roll and the smoked fries would taste better if served warmer.  The cinnamon roll is very delicious and very rich...gooey with the indulgent frosting, however was just a bit warm when served.  A just out of the oven or close to it temperature would be much better.  Also, the fries were not that appetizing as it seems as though they were sitting around before being brought out.  They were not hot and barely warm...chewy too rather than crispy.   Finally, I stopped over in the Little Bread area and was thinking of getting something to go, however the person at the counter who was taking orders and money used their bare hands to serve customers food...not sanitary at all.
