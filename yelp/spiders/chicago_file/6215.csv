The Purple Pig////I rarely mark places as a five star but this place pace deserves the accolades.  Deliciously good!  They took us in at last minute even thought they were full that evening. We ordered the 5 different dishes and they came out almost together, in perfect synchrony. Each wine pairing was remarkably well planned, and we walked out feeling like we had our best meal in Chicago.
