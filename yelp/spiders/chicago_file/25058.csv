Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Being from Queens, NYC...I am really hard on "Other People's Pizza," I am not down with "O.P.P" but since I was in Chi-town, I decided to peep out their beloved Pizza. And I must say, it was really tasty-like a nice twist on the concept of pizza. The service-accommodating and friendly. The decor-nice brick structure with historic art on the walls. The Pizza-really flavorful, hot and cheesy.
