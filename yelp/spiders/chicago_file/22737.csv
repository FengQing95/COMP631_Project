Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our first deep dish pizza.  My friends all recommended Lou Malnati's so it is the first place we went for dinner in Chicago.  Now we are spoiled for any other pizza anywhere :)  More than worth the 45 minute wait.  You can call ahead if you know what you want, or order before you're seated.  A must have on your Chicago trip!
