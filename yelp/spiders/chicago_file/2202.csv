The Purple Pig////Not once could I get anyone's attention. I get how they need to pack everything and everyone into this place, but a restaurant famous for pork does not attract the fittest people...and therefore, everyone is on the larger side, spilling into everyone else's personal space and server travel lanes. I seriously have bruises from trying to sit at the kitchen counter waiting for nothing it turned out.
