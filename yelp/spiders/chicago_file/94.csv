Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Really good. I don't even like eggs that much, but once I discovered the Napa Valley Fig omelet, it became a Saturday ritual. Fluffy, delicious pancakes. Good portions and very reasonable prices. I've brought two sets of out-of-town guests to Wildberry twice and both times they loved it. I wish they kept longer hours, but I guess it's really just a brunch and lunch place. Cute inside and conveniently located across the street from Millennium Park. I recommend it.
