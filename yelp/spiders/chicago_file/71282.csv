Little Goat Diner////After immediately being seated we were greeted by our very friendly and very knowledgable waiter. He asked us if we were allergic to anything and I appreciated that considering I am allergic to everything and will be living on water and air eventually. After we ordered he stated things that I may be allergic to-to make sure I was ok-I was so impressed he knew the menu so well and he did not make it like it was a chore-he was happy to make sure that we had an enjoyable meal....which unfortunately at some places it always seems like more a nuisance that you are allergic to something.
