Little Goat Diner////Overall, so good and worth the wait if you have one. We lucked out and got in after about 10 minutes on a Sunday at noon (it was cold out). Everything on the breakfast menu sounds delicious and it was a tough choice that came down to either Okonomiyaki or Paratha's Burrito. The first is a Japanese street food like a savory pancake served with pork belly classified by our server as the richer of the two options; the second was a "burrito" consisting of a sunny side egg and this magical cheese wrapped in thin naan topped with avocado, bean and arugula salad with this creamy chili pepper sauce described my our server as the "brighter" of the two. Well you might have guessed it, I went with Paratha's Burrito and, although I'm sure the Okonomiyaki is also delicious, I think I made the right choice. It was flavorful, interesting and hey, it had salad on it so that'll make ya feel good, huh? I ate the whole thing. Side note: The burrito is the last on the breakfast list and (correct me if I'm wrong here, goaties) I feel like it might get overlooked it because it doesn't have meat or a sweet element to it - poor Paratha.
