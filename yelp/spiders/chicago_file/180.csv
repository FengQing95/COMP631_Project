Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Brunch doesn't get as good as this. Wildberry was conveniently close to Swissotel, where I stayed for a duration of a recent trip to Chicago. After examining the menu for about 40 minutes (our wait to be seated on a Monday morning!), I had set my heart on the Venetian skillet paired with pancakes. K had the Florence Benedict. The serving sizes are plenty enough and everything tasted exquisite. The hashbrowns lining my skillet were crispy and brown, they were the taste of perfection. The mix of the veggies and sausage were well-balanced. K's eggs benedict were very tasty. I was pretty jealous of his choice, to be honest. Next time I will definitely not skip the eggs benedict. I had their iced turtle mocha, also flavorful and brought out in a timely manner. The service was great! They hustled and got our orders and food out to us super quick while being very patient, accommodating and efficient. The manager on duty was personable and kept the hungry people waiting to be seated rather happy considering the almost hour wait. Their coffee station is strategically placed right by the door so you can stay refreshed while you wait. About that, my only tiff would be the wait, but I can't really blame all of my cohorts, we all know a good thing when we see it. Definitely worth the wait, trust me.
