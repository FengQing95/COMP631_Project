Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Definitely one of our favorite places to eat!  The atmosphere, the service and the food are all wonderful.  We always get the baked Goat Cheese to start.  We tend to get the usual few tapas but I promised myself that I would try their caldera dishes at some point.  The paella was salty for me.  But, normally I go for tapas so that's not an issue.  LOVE their grilled squid in oil and peppers.  Yum.  Just thinking about it is making me ready to go to the Bob.  Their passion fruit sangria is my favorite and definitely can go through the full pitcher like water.  Normally I am so full that I never venture to the desserts.  I especially love their New Years Day PJ brunch!  Who wouldn't love going in your pj's and getting gift certificates in the amount of your bill to come back on them?!  Haven't used those yet but I have a sneaky suspicion that they won't be lasting much longer...
