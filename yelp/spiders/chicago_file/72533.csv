Little Goat Diner////I had catered lunch by Little Goat and it was one of the worst meals I have had in Chicago. The only words I would use to describe the sandwiches would be "gooey" or "huh?". Both the beef and the tuna sandwich had toppings equivalent to what I'd imagine a 10 year old would stack on a piece of bread before daring his friend to eat it. The ratio of tuna or beef to "mystery ingredients" was easily 1:6. The shrimp sandwich was edible, but still a bizarre concoction.
