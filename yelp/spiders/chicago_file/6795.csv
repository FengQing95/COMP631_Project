Art Institute of Chicago////The collection of art pieces in this place is very vast. I didn't know that this museum housed the original of Seurat's "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte." I remember learning about pointillism in Art History class in high school. I didn't realize how massively big this painting was in person. From this, I moved to Renaissance art and saw the work of Caravaggio. I loved the big contrast between light and dark. They really covered all their bases in this museum because they even had modern and contemporary art. The most memorable piece I saw was a pile of candy in the corner of one gallery. It was supposed to represent the ideal weight of 175 pounds of the artist's partner who died of AIDS. Visitors are encouraged to take a piece and the supply of candy continually replenished thereby making this person eternal. Very interesting. Kind of weird, but I ate that piece of candy. I then thought about how old that candy had been sitting there. Ugh. Overall, I had a good time here. There is way too much to see in this place and I could spend a whole day walking through all the galleries here.
