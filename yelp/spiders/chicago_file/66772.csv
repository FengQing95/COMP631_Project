Little Goat Diner////After an incredible meal at Girl & the Goat we had to try Little Goat for breakfast on our way out of town. It was sensational! Imagine all of the delicious items you'd expect from a diner but reinvented, modernized and loaded with more awesome flavor than you can imagine. The Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thingy was all that it's name suggests! This place rocks, we can't wait to get back again soon!
