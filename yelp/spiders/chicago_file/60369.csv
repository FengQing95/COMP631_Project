Smoque BBQ////Sides: the fresh cut fries are excellent, although it would be quite the disappoint to ever get a bad order of fresh cut fries (was there ever a food name with such built-in deliciousness?).  They didn't skimp on them either, and that's appreciated.  Some of the other sides my friends and I sampled were small but intensely flavorful.  I'd never had baked beans that needed to be savored quite like that.
