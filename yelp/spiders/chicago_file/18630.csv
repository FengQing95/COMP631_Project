Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is an OUTSTANDING pie!  The rest of the pizza places in Chicago have to really bring out the stops!  The crust is great, crunchy but flaky.  We ordered the classic, pepperoni and sausage, got just a sausage pie.  Lunch service was slow, but it looked like our server had way too many tables to give great service.
