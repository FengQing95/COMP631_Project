Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the medium "classic" deep dish, which had sausage. The medium feeds three people, but we could have ordered the small for the three of us. We ended up leaving with pizzza leftover, which no complaints! Â The deep dish itself was so filling, cheesy, and full of luscious sausage chunks. The sauce itself wasn't too acidic or tomato tasting. The crust was my favorite part- it almost tasted like a pastry. Not sweet, but buttery and soft. Not greasy at all! We all ate one piece and called it quits; amateurs, I know.
