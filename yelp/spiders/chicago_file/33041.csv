Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////There was nothing I didn't like about my first time at Bavette's.  Our party of 4 arrived at 7:30pm but had 8pm reservations.  We were seated right away without any problems, which was a pleasant surprise.  The restaurant looks great with dark woods, high ceilings, soft lighting, etc.
