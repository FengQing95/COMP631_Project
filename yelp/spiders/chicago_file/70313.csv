Little Goat Diner////After an hour wait drinking beer in the "cafe" section and snacking on cubes of delicious bread, we were sat at the counter. I am not sure if they are shooting for a hipster irony or are truly trying to recreate an American diner experience, either way the feel of the room and the flow of the room fail miserably.  The room is deafening by design, silly if you ask me.  There is something to be said of the energy of a room, but when a designer does everything they can to force noise into your space it just gets annoying.
