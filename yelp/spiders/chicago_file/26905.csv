Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I got the Chicago Classic - lean sausage, tomato sauce, cheese on buttercrust - and it was good, but nothing life-changing. The sausage overpowers the other ingredients, so I didnt pick up the sauce flavor that much and the cheese was kind of just there. Again, pizza was good, but I guess my expectations were a little higher.
