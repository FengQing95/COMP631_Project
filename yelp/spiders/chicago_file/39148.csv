Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Omgosh what can i say? I been to many steakhouses in chicago and by far bavettes is my favorite. My date and i pretty much ordered everything off the menu. Truffle mac and cheese, wild mushrooms, elotes, pome frites were my fav btw just because i love garlic aoli. I got the 22oz dry aged rib eye and with the sauce it was absolutely delicious. Melted right in my mouth. The only problem with the rib eye was that i usually ask for my steak to be medium rare which i did but the steak was more rare than i thought which made it really chewy and i could not enjoy the steak much. But that was my fault i shouldve asked for medium rare plus. Â Other than that our server was very nice and attentive and the atmosphere was nice. The lemon meringue pie was bomb btw. I would most definitely come back again no doubt!
