Art Institute of Chicago////And the rest of the museum was just awe-inspiring. I'm not going to go into details, but it's something everyone needs to experience at least once. The few staff members I encountered were friendly and very knowledgeable. There was only one thing I would change. The map of the museum that they give you upon entrance makes no sense. I threw it away in frustration. But still, I think I made it to the things I wanted to see.
