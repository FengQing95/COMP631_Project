Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a large deep pizza and salad...total cost was about $55. The salad was good and the dressing was tasty. The deep dish pizza was also good and right up there with some of the other competitors. Nothing to really set them apart from the millions of other pizza places however our Lyft driver did say her favorite here is the thin crust pizza so I hope to try that next time.
