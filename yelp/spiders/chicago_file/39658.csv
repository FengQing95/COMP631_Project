Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is a steak house worth doing...one of Chicago's finest. We saw it written up in Chicago Magazine and it was everything they bragged on. Come prepared to spend $100 per...depending on alcohol...but it was really worth the expense. This was a nice experience from start to finish.
