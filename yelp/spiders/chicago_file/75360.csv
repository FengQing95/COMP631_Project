Little Goat Diner////I had heard great things about Little Goat Diner from a few people, so I put it on the list of restaurants to try on our last trip to Chicago. Reservations were made online, which is simple and gets you to a table quickly. We went for brunch on a Sunday morning, so there was a wait if one did not make reservations. Once we got to a table, we ordered an Ooey Gooey Cinnabun for the three of us to share, and OMG, it was heaven. Soft and chewy, with loads of cinnamon and copious amounts of cream cheese frosting. So yummy! I ordered a cold brew, which was strong and delicious. I also tried my fiancee's Bloody Mary, which was spicy and very unique, as it is made with kimchi. It was good, but a little unexpected-tasting. For a meal, I got This Little Piggy Went to China - cheddar biscuit, szechuan pork patty, chili-garlic-chive sauce and strawberries. The flavors work very well together, and the portion was huge. I also got bites of the Parathas Burrito - delicious, I'll get this next time - and the biscuits and gravy - good, but a lot of mushroom flavor. I love the decor here, which is an eclectic mix of shabby chic and retro diner vibes. Our server was polite, efficient, and made good recommendations. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area.
