Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is the original Lou Malnati's Pizzeria location. That said, expect a wait because if you're like me, you just can't live without experiencing a meal with the charm of an original location (like many others in line). The good news is that, given it's crazy popularity for the deep dish pizza, they have a streamlined seating process which includes texting you when your table is ready and having you order your pie before you get seated so that it comes out in a timely manner. Deep dish pizza greatness takes about 45 minutes to cook!
