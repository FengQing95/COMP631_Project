Art Institute of Chicago////"Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity" (traveling exhibition) was the favorite among our group. I was happily surprised that "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte" (Georges Seurat) was displayed as part of the exhibition. I didn't know that it was such a large painting. I wished I took more time taking it all in and admiring it. Unfortunately, I couldn't take a picture of it because pictures weren't allowed for this exhibit. Within the exhibit, two other paintings that stood out to me were "Paris Street; Rainy Day" (Gustave Caillebotte) and "Evening Soir√©e" (Jean Beraud).
