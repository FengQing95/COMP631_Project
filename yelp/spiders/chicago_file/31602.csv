Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Dudes. I don't understand how the system here works. Well... I do now, but it is absolute CHAOS. So, you put your name down on the waitlist with the hostess who will give you an approximate wait time (and you'll wanna double the number they give you, by the way). You'll need to expect a text from them, after which you'll have 5 minutes to check in at the "Text message" section. Now, right after you put your name down on the waitlist, you should get in the other line to pre-order pizza so that it's "ready" for you once you sit down. I'm not really sure how much time this saves you since once we finally sat down at the table, our server said the pizza was still not ready.
