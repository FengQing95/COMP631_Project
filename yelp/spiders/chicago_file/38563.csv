Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////On to the experience, the restaurant itself is gorgeous, classy, swanky, dark and just all around my kind of steak place. The music is perfect the lighting is dark but once your eyes adjust, perfect as well. I'm already digging the vibe & the evening gets even better when our server John introduces himself, walks us through what Bavettes is about, specials and a few suggestions for us to ponder. We immediately took to John, how could you not? this guy is great, I can't even do him justice saying he provided the best service I have ever had anywhere. I still feel like that's not saying enough.
