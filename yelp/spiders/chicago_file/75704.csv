Little Goat Diner////When I first moved to Chicago this was my go to diner for brunch. I liked the unique dishes and most that I tried were pretty tasty (the Elvis french toast, and Spanish omelet were my favs). But the more I came over time and tried other dishes for lunch/dinner, the more I realized that my go to spot was actually kinda mediocre. I'll be sticking to my fav brunch items if I ever come here again.
