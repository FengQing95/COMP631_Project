Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a salad first which was really flavorful and very large.  I like a large salad.  If it weren't for the salad, I probably would have only doled out 2 stars.  It came with toasty tortilla strips, good cheese, and a smokey barbecue-type dressing (we ordered the chicken club minus the meat because there were no interesting vegetarian salad options, which I found weird).
