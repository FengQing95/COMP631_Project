The Purple Pig////The style of this restaurant is family-style so be prepared to fight your siblings or significant other for the last bite. I've always ordered a lot when I come here, and just a quick tip. As shown by the name, they specialize in pork dishes. I am a red meat fan all the way but the pork dishes here are far superior.
