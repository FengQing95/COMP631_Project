Smoque BBQ////Smoque has the best brisket sandwich in the city.  I've tried the ribs, the pulled pork, and then my experimenting stopped when I tried the brisket!  I get it every single time and I never wish I got something else.  Believe the hype, it is THAT good (the brisket).  The rest of their menu is very good and the portions are generous, but the brisket truly is the one thing I've had that's out of this world.  My favorite sides are the delicious mac and cheese and the slaw!  I love slaw that's oil and vinegar based.  I've also tried their cornbread, beans, and the peach cobbler.  They're all very good, but there's a reason I've been going to Smoque regularly for over a year and I get the same order every time: 1/2 brisket sandwich with mac n' cheese and slaw.
