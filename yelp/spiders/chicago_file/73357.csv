Little Goat Diner////I came on a weekend afternoon. My oh my, the wait was quite long. They don't take reservation during weekends, so try to come a little earlier. They will get your name and number, and once a table is ready, they'll text you. It's quite "modern/efficient" for them to do so. Now, they also have a coffee/bar/snacks/accessory area. It's a really small room connected to the restaurant. Products vary from books to coffee to fresh flowers and wrist band. If you are bored of waiting/standing by the main desk, you can at least wander/look around there.
