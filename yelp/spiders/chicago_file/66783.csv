Little Goat Diner////I sat at the counter, ordered fried pickles & onion rings and a burger. They were all terrible. The fried pickles & onion rings came out stuck together (imagine a huge fried mass) and was way too salty. The burger came out overcooked and was also way too salty. I heard that this was a great place to eat, don't believe everything you hear. The inside of the restaurant is a pretty cool rendition of a 50's diner but the food just isn't worth it.
