Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The atmosphere is fun, a little 1950's Ny style vintage inside.  The ambiance has a great feeling to it, with a little dark lighting to add to the mood.  The moment I walked inside the parlor, I definitely wasnted to order an Old Fashioned... which I did both times.  The Cognac Sazerac is awesome and recommended!
