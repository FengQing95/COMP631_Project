Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't get how some locations can be so different from each other, when it comes to taste and texture.  This place is for tourists,  which is a shame.  I would think the place where tourist would go.  Would be the place with the best pizza.  Dont you want people to go back home and tell people how good it was.  Either way its still better then the other pizza places....
