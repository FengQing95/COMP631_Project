Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've heard a lot of good things about this pizza shop and given that I've never had deep dish I was excited to check it out. My sister and I only had two nights in Chicago and were planning on eating a lot of food, so we didn't want to overeat here. We also didn't have a lot of room for leftovers in our hotel fridge. When we arrived here it was about 8:00 pm on a Friday night and the wait was about 45 minutes- 1 hour to sit inside. It was a nice night so we asked if we could be seated on the patio and we were sat right away. Our server was very nice and provided great service to us during our visit. As we were trying to decide what to order, the couple next to us told us that a small pizza was huge and too much food for them. We decided to go with a personal pizza instead. Let me tell you.... the personal pizza is tiny. It's like pizza hut personal pan pizza size. It's kinda comical. I was disappointed at just how small it was (and for $12 it's extremely overpriced). We went with the Lou style pizza and it was pretty good. The flavors were decent. However, the crust was just flavorless. It's buttery, I suppose, but it's just not very flavorful. Overall, I would go again to try a regular sized pizza and maybe some other items on their menu as well. But judging off the pizza I had I just wasn't in love with it.
