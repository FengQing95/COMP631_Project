Little Goat Diner////I stopped in here to get the goat liver and some bread and both were excellent. The artisan bread they sold me was very rustic looking, feeling and tasting. Hearty and balanced, I wish I could afford a $10 loaf every week. The Goat liver pate I got here tasted like any other live pate I've ever had and was $13 for a very small jar. My guests were impressed with the fact that I served it on a cheese plate, but beyond that I think I'll go elsewhere next time.
