Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Next, I really wanted to order the Dry Aged Bone In Ribeye, because who doesn't want 22 oz of amazing aged red meat?! But alas, it was a little too much for me to consume (I tap out at 10 oz barely breathing) so I settled for the 6oz Filet. I also had the Elotes and the BLT Salad.
