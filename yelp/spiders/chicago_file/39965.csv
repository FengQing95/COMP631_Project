Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Wonderful steakhouse in Chicago! Great ambiance and friendly staff. It says that it's very fancy so I went in a nice dress and my boyfriend went in jeans with a suit jacket. But there were guys in shorts and a polo. So it's really whatever you feel comfortable in! Very dark and not too big of a space. We were worried it was going to get too loud but it really didn't! Highly recommend making a reservation as this place seems to always be packed!
