Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Decor: Kinda cool. Every location has a different theme but this one is all about baseball. There are all kinds of White Sox and Cubs memorabilia everywhere. From autographed team jerseys to baseballs neatly displayed in a case, this Lou's is a haven for Chicago baseball lovers.
