Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The only reason this Lou's location doesn't get 5 starts from me is because of where we sat. There are about 5 or 6 high top tables right by the front entrance, bar, and waiting area. This is where we sat. Now, I'm sure on a normal day (not a cold-ish Friday night), sitting there is fine. But there was a swarm of people basically on top of us and we felt a cooooooold breeze every time the door opened.
