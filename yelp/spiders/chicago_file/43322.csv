Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Another amazing thing on the menu was the spare ribs. They were so tender and the sauce and potatoes were a perfect addition to it. The last thing that stood out from the visit was the braised lamb dish. Again, the meat was very tender, the sauce was amazing, maybe a little too sweet for me, and the pine nuts and cous cous were amazing additions to the dish.
