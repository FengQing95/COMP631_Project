Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was our preferred touristy pizza place (compared to the other touristy pizza place that rhymes with "too much cheesedanos").  The crust was buttery, there was the right amount of cheese on top, and the sauce tasted really fresh.  We ate in the late afternoon, so we were looking for a stopgap between landing in Chicago and dinner, but it's as a great fill for us, and we wish we had more time to eat another meal here.
