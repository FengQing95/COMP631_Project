Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love, love, love this place. Only downsides are the parking (valet if possible, especially in winter!) and how crowded it gets (definitely make early reservations as this place gets packed, especially for larger groups). I love the Patatas Bravas (spicy potatoes), the calamari, empanadas, and the garlic potato salad. So good!!
