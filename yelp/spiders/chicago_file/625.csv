Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Food was decent enough, but my girlfriend's food was incorrectly prepared after having repeated the order to clarify and we ended up not eating together because the remake of her food didn't come until well after I'd finished eating. They also falsely paged us before our table was ready by 30 minutes. When the food did finally arrive we were ready to leave. A poor effort and will not be returning on our yearly trips.
