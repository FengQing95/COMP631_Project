Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If you like Sangria, be prepared to walk out of this restaurant a little bit drunk. I went with a group and we order a ton of tapas and A LOT of sangria. It was amazing. I havent had a chance to go back because it can get quite crowded and they've never been able to take my reservation. But the next chance I get, I will definitely return
