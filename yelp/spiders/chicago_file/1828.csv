Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The only redeeming thing about the place: awesome service. My waitress was friendly and very attentive (and rather cute too!). I never had to ask for refills and she updated me regularly on the progress of my food and coffee as it was being made. She even gave me tips on neighborhoods to check out for my impending move!
