Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's has an interesting corkage policy.  You are allowed to bring one bottle of wine, saving you a great deal of money.  There's one catch though.  You have to offer a glass of your wine to another table.  We just ended up choosing the people behind us because the waiter said they were celebrating a birthday.  Once we opened up the wine, we ordered our salads.  My bf got the wedge salad, which probably could have fed 3 people and I got the lyonnaise.  It was super delicious with a bacon-flavored vinaigrette.  Both of the salads came with two chunks of pork belly, equally delicious.  My bf ended up boxing up half of his as not to ruin his appetite.
