Little Goat Diner////Also important to note - their cocktails are very good, the service was terrific (our waitress was so knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful). Â The atmosphere definitely feels diner-like but in light and airy way...it's a busy restaurant, but you do not feel overwhelmed by what is going on around you.
