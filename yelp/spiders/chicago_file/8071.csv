Art Institute of Chicago////A really spectacular place.  One of those places that everyone tells tourists to go when they're coming through Chicago, and it actually ends up living up to the hype.  Honestly, there is so much history and cool stuff in here that you could get lost in here for hours upon hours- or really days.  But, you aren't going to see all of this place in a few hours, so don't even try.  Just check out the parts that interest you(and trust me, there will be at least one).
