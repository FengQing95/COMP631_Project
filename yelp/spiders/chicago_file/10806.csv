Art Institute of Chicago////Fabulous museum.  Make sure to buy tickets in advance and download their app.  Manet's expo was very complete.  The modern / contemporary hall was also very comprehensive :  Picasso, Monet, Van Gogh.  Give yourself about 2-3 hours to get overview or full day if you like to get lost in the details.  A great combo for visiting Millennium park as it provides must needed shaded and A/C.  Food in the café was somewhat acceptable.
