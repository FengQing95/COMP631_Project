Smoque BBQ////Now to the food, my fiance and I got pulled pork sandwich, fries, mac-n-cheese, and a sample taste of their ribs (which is a nice feature, so you can try and not buy the whole thing).  The pork was very good, a tad bit dry, but again I was spoiled for a year.  The fries were very good and crispy with a great seasoning.  The mac-n-cheese, which is what a lot people crave, was very good.  However, the portions were very small on that.  The ribs were good as well, they were seasoned great and had great char and smokiness.  The sauces.  I was not a fan of the Carolina style because it was too vinegary.  The Memphis styles sauces were good, both the spicy and original.  I wish they had a KC style sauce (ketchup based).
