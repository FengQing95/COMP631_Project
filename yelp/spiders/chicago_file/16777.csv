Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This may be the New Yorker in me talking but I really dont understand the hype. It was just a big pile of bland bread with a tiny bit of tasteless cheese and flavorless sauce on top. Really not worth the calories. Â Give me a crispy thin crust pizza from New York any day, the deep dish is gross.
