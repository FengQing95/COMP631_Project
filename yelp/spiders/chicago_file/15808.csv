Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great pizza.  Many fellow yelpers recommend this as the "best pizza" in Chicago.  I'm not sure if that's true, since I have a limited sample size (i.e., one), but Lou Malnati's does make a good deep dish pizza!  Lots of tasty cheese and sauce, and the crust is tasty!  I liked how we were able to pre-order our pizza prior to seating so that it would be ready faster once we actually got our table.  We also shared a Malnati salad, which I would say was just above-average on the tastiness scale.
