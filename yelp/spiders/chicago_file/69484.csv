Little Goat Diner////I've been on somewhat of a Little Goat tear lately, but I think it's still going to stay at 3 stars for me. Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious for the most part, but most of that deliciousness comes from copious amounts of fat and sugar, and in the end, I'm not a fan of super heavy food loaded with fat and sugar.
