Art Institute of Chicago////Love this place.  Massive collection...you can't do it all in one day.  For less than a year of Netflix, you can buy the membership and visit the Institute as much as your heart desires for a year or two...and invite one guest or (I think) any number of children under 12.  With admission going for 20+ per person, and more for out-of-staters, membership for residents who want to visit regularly is a steal.
