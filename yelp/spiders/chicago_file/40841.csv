Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Perhaps the definitive tapas of Chicago.  Lettuce Entertain You has pulled a solid, bustling, enjoyable theme restaurant together yet again.  Go in a group - the social atmosphere really brings out the meal experience.  Sharing is, after all, what tapas is all about.  I haven't tried their paella, but I remember enjoying pretty much everything I tried of their tapas - all solid, 3.5 star fare.  The lively experience and setting is what tipped it up to 4 stars (and the quantum star requirement).  This isn't gourmet food - the bacon wrapped dates are not even close to Avec's, for example, but in a bustling group, it's almost better to have more "normalized" fare so you don't "weird out" some peoples' palates.  Plus they have some of my favorite kinds of dishes; a mushroom soup, gazpacho, grilled sirloin with shiitakes, spice crusted ahi tuna.... You get the gist.  It's fun, it's flavorful, and it's a nice break from having one massive entrée.
