Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Had the Rutherford omelet.  Cooked perfectly and paired it with their signature pancakes.  They managed to fold in a lot of spinach without having the spinach weep extra liquid.  Goat cheese and plenty of bacon really balanced the dish. Pancakes were decadent without syrup or butter that accompanied. Coffee was solid.  Will probably return tomorrow for my last breakfast in town this trip.
