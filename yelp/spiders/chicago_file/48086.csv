Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here for lunch with my best friend who was in town visiting from central Illinois. She's not a big city fan, so I wanted to take her somewhere fun! Atmosphere is always great at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, and this day wasn't an exception, though the food came out cold (the stuffed mushrooms were literally ice cubes), and the bathrooms did not have any toilet paper in them. Myself and other women waiting in line to use the bathroom had to use paper towels, since we had no other option, nor was the bathroom attended to at all. Not the first time the bathrooms here were a bit dirty, to be honest. The staff also just seem like they're over-it (again, not the first time I've experienced this). It honestly stinks to write this review, as we had my friend's bachelorette dinner here, and I've come here many times and have enjoyed it. It just seems like the place went down hill a bit. I'd love to come back again to some hot food, happy staff and maybe some well-kept bathrooms.
