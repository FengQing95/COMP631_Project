Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What does a girl do when she's in Chicago for a day, but hasn't had a chance to try deep dish pizza?  I stopped by Gino's first and they only served four slices -- taking 40 minutes to make.  I had to catch a flight, so I really wanted a quick deep dish.  Luckily, Lou's was there for me!
