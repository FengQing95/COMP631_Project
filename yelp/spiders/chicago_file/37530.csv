Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As it's gained popularity and has no trouble booking tables, it's unfortunate to see the lack of service building on these recent visits. Maybe Hogsalt has diversified a bit too much and attention to detail is slipping? I don't know, but it gives me pause for a return visit or further recommendations.
