Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came here for lunch on the recommendation of Yelper's and staff at the hotel.  It's a hidden gem of a place.  I arrived 09/28/13 around 1:30 p.m. and the place was packed.  I was seated quickly.  I had a coupon for a free brochettea and believe me it was great.  Perhaps the best I've had.  I ordered the Famous Lou's pizza with spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms.  It was delicious.  I ordered the small and it was perfect for two.  When I visit Chicago I have to indulge in the spinach pizza.  Very good!!  Salad was huge.  Order only one and split it.
