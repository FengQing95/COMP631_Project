Smoque BBQ////Keep in mind this is a popular little place so during the weekends and prime time dinner hours it's going to get pretty busy...so busy that you will end up waiting in the sunshine, rain, and snow to get in.  But the food is worth it!  My tip, come during the week or early evening like as soon as it opens so you can get what you want cause if there's a long line by the time you get to order they may run out, yeah really...
