Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I made reservations over a month ago for 7pm on Saturday. We were 4 people and 1 friend got there right at 7 (traffic due to St. Pattys and all that). They told her once 1/2 the party was there they would sit her. Great. Around 7:05, another friend arrived. My friend went back to the hostess and let her know and was then told the table wasn't ready and that they would text her when it was. I arrived at this point, as did our 4th person so we waited for a bit. At 7:30, I went up to the stand and asked about our table. I gave my name and was then asked if I was on the wait list because they didn't see my reservation. Now, I called earlier in the week to confirm and my friend checked in and they gave her no problem so I am not sure what happened. I said no, we had a reservation. The hostesses started talking and I think what happened was that it seemed like they skipped right over us. She did apologize and said she would get us seated as soon as she could. Finally around 7:45, the host sat us. He also apologized for the mix up but at this point we had waited 45 minutes past our reservation and were starving.
