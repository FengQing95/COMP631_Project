Smoque BBQ////This is my favorite BBQ restaurant in Chicago. I reminds me of Phil's BBQ in San Diego, it's that good! I recommend ordering the Beef Brisket and the rack of ribs. I usually don't coleslaw but it's delicious here. It's a little pricey here, ended up spending almost $60 for two people. Definitely BYOB, makes it that much better
