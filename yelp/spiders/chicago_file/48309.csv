Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food itself is just average as well as the sangria. But the dining experience is always a pleasure and its great to be able to share and sample a bunch of small plates. When trying to do dinner with picky eaters, this is highly recommended. There's bound to be something for everyone.
