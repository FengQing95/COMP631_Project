Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Did I mention that the vibe is fantastic?  All this time you've been dining with me they've been playing 20's era jazz and it has been smokingly seductive.  You'd like to stay for an after dinner cocktail but, oh, you've been so intoxicated already you must hurry hurry home.
