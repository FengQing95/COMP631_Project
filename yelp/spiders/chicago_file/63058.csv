Smoque BBQ////Visiting Chicago for Cub's game.  Found this gem near Wrigley.  WOW great BBQ.  Had brisket and wife had ribs. Both were excellent. Good smoke flavor and good sauce. Sides were good, liked the corn bread and mac n' cheese. Place got crowded very quickly around dinner time. Looking forward to next Cub's game and killer BBQ
