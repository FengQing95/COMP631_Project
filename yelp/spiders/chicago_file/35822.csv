Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Always a favorite but last night was extra remarkable.  It's such a gem of a place that blends exceptional food, service and vibe into magic that's well worth the $$$ so I view it as a winner when you sadly depart.  William, the cat herder (GM?) was on his game and service from Julio was all smiles.  Great way to spend our 20th wedding anniversary!
