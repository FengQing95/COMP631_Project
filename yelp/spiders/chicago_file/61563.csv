Smoque BBQ////This is by FAR my favorite BBQ place in Chicago.  There's something great about the non-pretentious atmosphere coupled with the communal seating.  Although some places (like Chicago q & County BBQ) have a more intimate vibe that might be better for special occasions, if you're just worried about the food, then Smoque is your best bet.
