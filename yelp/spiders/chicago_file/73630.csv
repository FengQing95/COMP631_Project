Little Goat Diner////To put it bluntly, I wasn't that impressed with the food either. Everything we ordered tasted the same. Oily. And the sauces used for all three items were also very similar, a mayo-type sauce and a sweet bbq sauce. We ordered the crispy shrimp appetizer, the tonkatsu sandwich and the Korean burger.
