Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were seated immediately on a Wednesday ~2pm.  The service was good but the pizza took a long time as advertised ~35 mins.  I was dissapointed with "The Lou" pizza we ordered.  I found the crust to be dry and the pizza didn't have enough sauce.  I thought that ordering the namesake pizza meant it would be THE pizza but I guess not.  This was the only time I've eaten here and was my first Chicago deep dish experience.  Fortunately, Giordano's redeemed the deep dish pizza for me so I left the Windy City a happy traveler.
