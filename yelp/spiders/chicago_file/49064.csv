Smoque BBQ////I used to live down the street from this place, and let me tell ya, I wish I still did. Smoque is by far my favorite BBQ joint. Pretty much everything on the menu is fantastic and the staff is just as great. Doesn't hurt that one of the owners was always around to say "hi." My go to meal here is their pulled pork sandwich with either the mac and cheese or baked beans. Their vinegar-based slaw is also awesome. Every once in a while, my husband will still surprise me with dinner from there when he spends a day working in the city.
