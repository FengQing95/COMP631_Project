Little Goat Diner////Tom Petty playing, couples around me in intense in conversations that I'm not even trying to overhear: "You know if a guy spends more than $100 on you...he likes you." That line works and they are now exchanging a tongue text. Oh yeah, this is a good place to be and a milkshake to savor. Â What a laid back but energetic bar scene, where people may just be falling in love. I recommend a visit here even if you aren't waiting to dine. It's small, intimate - just a row of seats at a bar - and a couple of two tops off to the side - couple of patio tables when the weather's right. (Rumor has it...there's even rooftop seating now.)
