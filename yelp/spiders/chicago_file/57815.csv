Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was really hoping that I would like cafe ba Ba Reba more Than I did especially because I'm from the suburbs and it took me an hour to get there. I'm hoping their dinner will be more impressive than their brunch. I do love the concept and I felt full and that their pricing was fair.
