Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This is always our first stop when we visit the city. We always have an incredible meal, and dining experience. To start with, there is always a wait but you receive a text message when you check in and have 5 minutes to check back in. Millennium park is right across the street so if you don't want to sit and wait you can wander through the park while you wait. When you check back in it is a quick wait to be seated. The flow of serving and seating is quite something! Wait staff is very efficient in service and clearing tables. Your water glass is never less than half full. Although one person may take your order we've always had others serving the food or filling water, each one friendly. Now the food. I'm still full 5 hours later so save your appetite so you can enjoy all you can. My favorites are the cinnamon roll pancakes- so so good. Today I ordered the Fresca omelette which comes with hash browns or fruit and pancakes or ( I think there's another choice but for crying out loud order the pancakes! The omelette was delicious and so big- stuffed with sun dried tomatoes, fresh basil, avocado and tons of provolone cheese. Oh. So. Good. You can choose either crispy or soft hash browns which is I why I choose them- I usually order and they are soft which is not my style so loved that I could get them crispy. My husband loves the butcher skillet so full of meat. He tried the strawberry lemon poppyseed pancakes today and loved them. You must NOT miss this place when in Chicago.
