Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe-Ba-Ba-Reeba is a spanish tapas restaurant. You should around around 2-3 dishes/person. I highly recommend ordering breakfast paella, bacon wrapped dates (comes with 6), potatoes braves, spanish tortilla (Warm potato and onion omelette), and citrus french toast. Skip the brunch pinxtos - it's not worth it. The menu will seem overwhelming but if you stick with the red colored items, you won't go wrong!
