Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Appetizers: We got the truffle mac and cheese and the bacon. The truffle mac was loaded with truffle flavor, yet wasn't overpoweringly rich, and had a perfectly crispy top to it. It was decadent with just fantastic flavoring and presentation. Then the bacon. If you've had the burger at Au Cheval and added bacon, think that, but better. It was very thick with crispy edges, but a softer middle, with a sweet maple flavor, yet retained the delicious saltiness of the meat itself. Then they sprinkle coarse black pepper grounds on it for an added kick. Just incredible.
