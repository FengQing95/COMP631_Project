Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Possibly the best steak dinner I've ever had. The New York strip was one of the specials that evening and it was cooked to perfection. West coast oysters and garlic shrimp was great. Dipping the bread in the buttery garlic sauce after the shrimp was done was perfect. Got the bone marrow on the side of my steak with Brussels sprouts, truffle Mac and cheese with bacon, and elotes style corn as the sides. Our server was friendly and they comped us some extra bone marrow bc one of them didn't have much 'meat butter.' The ambience and atmosphere was great as well!
