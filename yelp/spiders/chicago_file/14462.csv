Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visited Chicago for a week and decided to try as many deep dishes as possible.  Without naming our other choice destinations, Lou was the best in our opinion.  The crust was just somehow different and stayed crunchy despite the heavy toppings.  The flavor was also better.  Yes, the wait was long but can't rush deep dish.  Did I mention place was packed at 2:30pm?
