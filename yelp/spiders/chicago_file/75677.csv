Little Goat Diner////I like their creativity and playfulness with their food, however, I was not thoroughly satisfied with what we ordered at all. I would not plan on visiting this restaurant again in the future. The food was overly priced and it could have been something we made at home for half of the cost. And worst of all, I got pooped on my head by a bird while dining outside! Ugh!
