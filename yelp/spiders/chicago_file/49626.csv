Smoque BBQ////Very popular place.  The wait to order was long and it was filled to over capacity.  The staff was very friendly.  They adjusted my bill after I misunderstood the menu and ordered an extra side by accident.  The half rack of ribs is enough to fill one or two people.  The brisket and ribs were just okay.  Nothing really special or flavorful.  The side dishes were small, but tasty.  Good mayo-free cole slaw and good mac & cheese.  BYOB.  Easy to get to off of the train, but wouldn't say it was worth the trip out of the city lines.
