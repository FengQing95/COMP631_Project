Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Got the thin crust sausage with fresh sliced tomatoes, garlic, onions and jalape√±os. So so delicious and very fair price! Great value. My husband and I couldn't finish a medium! We ordered through grub hub as the place was literally lined around the block waiting, I can see why!
