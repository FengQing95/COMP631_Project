Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This was place was nothing short of amazing.  We went for a birthday dinner and were seated in the basement.  Our server was very charming and helpful, and he enhanced our experience - including recommending our table to receive a glass of wine after we shared a glass with another table (their policy is to share a glass of any wine you bring instead of charging a corkage fee).
