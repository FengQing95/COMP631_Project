Smoque BBQ////Sliced Brisket is the only thing I ever order here, there's no reason to mess with perfection.  The beans are amazing! The cole slaw is delicious.  It gets busy but they do a great job of keeping it organized when they seat you.  If it's nice weather the outdoor seating gets you away from the hub bub inside.
