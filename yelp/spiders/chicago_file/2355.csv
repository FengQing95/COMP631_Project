The Purple Pig////Per the waiter's recommendation I ordered the calamari and pork shoulder paired with a glass of wine. The calamari is served cold and is more like a salad mixed with various toppings. I really enjoyed the cool flavors of this lighter dish. The pork shoulder on the other hand is denser and richer in flavor. The meat was so moist and the potato/cream(?) sauce surrounding the meat slab was a nice compliment. This was enough food for myself and I left stuffed with a happy tummy.
