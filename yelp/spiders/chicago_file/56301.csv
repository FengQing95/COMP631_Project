Smoque BBQ////Awesome place to eat! I had the pulled pork, fries and baked beans. Pulled pork was definitely the best I've had, fries was plentiful and fresh! Baked beans was a little to sweet for me but still good! Parking is hard around the restaurant, but if you park near the bridge, its free and plenty of parking!
