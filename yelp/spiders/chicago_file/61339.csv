Smoque BBQ////Ordered the rib combo--both St. Louis style and baby back ribs. Definitely preferred the quality of meat of the St. Louis style, as was recommended on the menu. I really liked the sauce, much tangier than I'm used to, but a pleasant surprise, if not sometimes a little too tangy. Good coleslaw, good corn bread, great macaroni and cheese, decent prices. I was not impressed with the baby back ribs, have had better at family barbecues.
