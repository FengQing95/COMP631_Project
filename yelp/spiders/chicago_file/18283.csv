Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our son and daughter-in-law highly recommended this restaurant as we were in for several days visiting Chicago. They previously lived in Chicago. So this past Sunday evening, July 8th, my husband and I, along with another couple, went to the Wells St. location at 7 pm. The hostess told us it would be a 20 minute wait. Turned out to be 35 minutes. The worst part of the evening turned out to be the waiter. He was rude and disinterested. My husband and I ordered a medium pizza. The other couple ordered a pan pizza and one chicken marsala. The chicken marsala was brought to our friend (the husband) long before the rest of us received our food. In fact, our friend finished the chicken marsala way before we received our food. Approximately 20 - 25 minutes after he got his meal, we got our food. Several of us had asked the waiter why he would bring out the marsala way before the rest of the food. His response? "The pizza takes longer to make." He also said he didn't realize we all wanted to eat together. SERIOUSLY!! We asked him several times to check on the pizzas. Each time he said he would but he never came back to the table to tell us the status- not once!! He never refilled our waters. Our pizzas were very good- the chicken marsala contained tough chicken and was presented in an odd way. One of the worst dining experiences we have ever encountered.
