Smoque BBQ////Boom-Shaka-Laka!  I love great BBQ and Smoque does it like a boss!  We arrived starving on a Saturday night and as expected, there was a line starting to form out the door.  We ended up waiting only 30 minutes and since we had a bunch of beer in a mini icebox, it was all good.  All 8 of us luckily got a large table, only a few minutes after ordering.
