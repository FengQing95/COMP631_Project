Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Made the mistake of trying to make reservations on Saturday at 4pm.  Mistake.  It's only been open a month...very popular now.  I see why.  My last impression was make by the ambiance and setting.  It reminds me of Whiskey Bar with the comfortable intimate and classy setting.  Relaxed enough to come not only on a date but with a group in my opinion.  Food was good. Steak was average not exceptional.  Service was great as well.  Immediate fan ..looking forward to trying the rest of the menu.
