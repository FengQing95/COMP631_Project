Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was our favorite pizza while in Chicago. The crust was crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The sauce was very chunky and seemed to be very fresh. As we put our name on the waiting list, we were able to place an order for our pizza so that we wouldn't have to wait as long. Their chicken sandwich was yummy and the side of fruit was very fresh. This place did not disappoint at all!
