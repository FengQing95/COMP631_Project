Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////After our 4-5th visit I had to write a review. Bavette's is unbelievable in every sense of the word.  Terrific wine selection, great cocktails, and excellent atmosphere. Modern without being trendy, classic without being stuffy, and the best service you can imagine. Erik was our server a few times and exemplifies what a professional server should be.  The bread and butter (left out overnight so it doesn't need to be spread) are a perfect start, followed by the goat cheese. I've ordered the filet (medium rare, of course) with and without the bone and it surpasses my expectations every time. Try the bone marrow; it is earthy but a great accompaniment to the steak.  The salmon, corn, mashed potatoes, shrimp, etc all set the standard.  I've never had a bad dish at Bavette's and highly recommend this gem to anybody who wants an unforgettable experience.
