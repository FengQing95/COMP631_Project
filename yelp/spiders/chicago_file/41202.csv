Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been to this restaurant several times and it never disappoints.  They have added some new menu items and loved it. I have tried other tapas restaurants and Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is still the best.  You should definitely make reservations, if you don't you will be waiting a long time unless you can find a seat at the bar. The stuffed mushrooms are my favorite, a must have!
