Little Goat Diner////I had the shrimp and grits on my first visit. It was good, I'd order it again. Last weekend I had the "Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing". It was okay, I don't think I'd order it again. It had a good taste, but the texture of everything after a bit was, meh.
