Art Institute of Chicago////I am a huge fan of European art, so we started off there.  We moved to early & modern american art.  I was happy to recognize quite a few pieces!  I was  disappointed that the photography section featured just one photographer.  We were getting hungry so we skipped most of the sections and finished with the miniature rooms.  I love period things so fell in love with the Roco style rooms!
