Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Amazing..amazing..amazing place! Went there on Jan 8'16 to celebrate my anniversary. While making a booking my wife told them the occasion. While we were waiting for our table... A server offered us the drinks menu.. Instead of just letting us wait. The person taking us to our table wished us. Our server wished us. The person who got our food wished us. Brilliant customer service & attention to detail! The food was AMAZING & very flavourful! the cocktails were very very good! Highly recommend this restaurant! Their customer service was commendable!
