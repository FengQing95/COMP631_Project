Little Goat Diner////Holy cow this place was delicious.  I had the Bull's Eye French Toast and it was AMAZING.  It was a ton of food, but I made everyone at the table try it so it ended up working out.  The waiter was very helpful since I had never been here!  I would definitely recommend this place!
