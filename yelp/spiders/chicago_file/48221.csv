Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Fantastic food in subtle Spanish ambiance. Our server Erika was on point and table touched the perfect amount. Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection and very flavorful. The chorizo wrapped medjool dates were so good that I ordered seconds. The next time we visit Lincoln Park we will absolutely come here for a meal.
