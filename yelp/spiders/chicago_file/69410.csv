Little Goat Diner////My favorite diner in the city, I mean what's there not to love about it... It's a diner take on the amazing girl and the goat restaurant. Â They do an amazing job from service to the food no questions asked. The menu at this diner is not like something you've seen before so be prepared to be dazzled for a minute and then a few more to figure out what you're going to eat. Anything and everything you order will be pretty perfect so don't be worried to experiment unless otherwise (self explanatory). I went for a very late brunch around 3:30ish on a Saturday with a few of my boys and surprisingly it was still quite busy. They had a few tables clearing up right as we got there so waiting wasn't an issue. Since we were starving we ordered right away, we got the bullseye French toast, little piggy went to China(oh my god), pork belly pancake, and the corned beef hash. So the French toast is gorgeous, it's a fluffy crunchy French toast cooked to perfection with an egg in the middle (yolk flows out like a river and goes tooo good with the syrup and chicken on every bite). The little piggy is probably nothin like you've seen before with a sauce that's just going to blow your socks off the flavor is unreal, so I'm just going to leave it a surprise. Porkbelly Pancake is a scallion pancake with a nice piece of porkbelly and topped of with brilliant slaw. Finally the hash, it's a great portion packed with everything you want for a hearty breakfast. Overall this diner is a must do in Chicago. Sooo feeling a little home sick?...go to little goat !
