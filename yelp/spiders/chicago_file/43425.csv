Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////More like a 3 1/2 star review here but we rounded up on this one. The enclosed patio where we were seated was very nice. We ordered a number of tapas here; the patatas bravas, brussel sprout salad, pickled vegetable salad, the meatballs, spanish tortilla, chicken empanada, a kids mac and cheese, and a chocolate almond bar for dessert. We came during happy hour but were disappointed to find out it was only served at the bar. As we were dining with our 2 children, we couldn't take advantage of it. The restaurant has a nice kids menu and they give the kids crayons and wiki sticks. The mac and cheese was not great with neither of our kids really caring for it. Out of the tapas, the highlights were the patatas bravas and the meatballs. I like the brussel sprout salad while my wife found it too strong on horseradish. Â Both the patatas, tortilla, and empanada came with a goopy sauce which seemed to be just a flavored mayonnaise. Service was good and prices are fair.
