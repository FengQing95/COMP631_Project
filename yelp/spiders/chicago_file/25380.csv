Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Took a trip to the CHI for some deep dish. This was defiantly my favorite. Straight off the plane, found this place and it was heaven , the anticipation of the pizza had me on my toes lol 30mins was tooooo long but SO WORTH IT. Everything was so rich and cheesy , I can't explain the taste you just have to try it for yourself.
