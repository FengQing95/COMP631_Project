Little Goat Diner////Very worth the 75-90 minute wait on a late Saturday morning.  My friend and I shared the Fat Elvis Waffles (peanut butter butter, sliced bananas, and bacon maple syrup), Pork Belly Pancake, and the goat cheese hash browns - everything was fantastic and there were so many other things on the menu I would have liked to order.  Will definitely have to go back at least a handful of times to try other things.  Sitting at the counter is fun, and you'll probably catch a good view of Stephanie hard at work.  And once you're able to find it, the hidden bathroom door is amusing.  Little Goat is fantastic!!!  Can't wait to go back for more.
