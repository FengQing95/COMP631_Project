Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was so annoyed I know that if I walked back in there to get the cheese & have to recook the $36 worth of pizzas... lets just say I thought the better of it and just went to CVS for cheese. CVS is not a fine purveyor of cheeses lets just say. The best I could do was Provolone. I recooked our sad little pizzas only to find they only had spinach. No onions, no garlic, no basil. Sigh.
