Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had lived in Spain for six months, so I was so excited to see all the décor, complete with jamón hanging from the ceiling and FC Barcelona (Booo) scarves above the bar. We opted to sit outside. The patio was decorated with pretty lights and they even had traditional Spanish street signs on the wall (Calle de las lechugas AHAHA) Upon the standard checking-in to Facebook, Foursquare and Yelp, deals popped up. At the time, checking in on Facebook got you a free order of baked goat cheese, checking in on Yelp got a free pintxo platter. Such a good deal! We first wanted the baked goat cheese but then saw the pintxo platter and went for that. I was originally going to get only that, but I ordered the special Green City Market paella while my friend ordered a garlicky shrimp tapas. We rounded it out with a pitcher of white peach sangria.
