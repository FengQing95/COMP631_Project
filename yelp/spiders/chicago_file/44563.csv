Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The only reason I was intrigued by this place was because a friend of mine worked at Ba-Ba-Reeba in Barcelona and took me there on her day off.  I checked if they were run by the same group, but they're not.  I guess the food shows for it.  If both Chicago and Barcelona are connected by any chance, then the recipe must have been lost in translation.
