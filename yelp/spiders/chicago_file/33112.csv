Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavettes is a great place for a date.  There were lots of dates going on around us.  I went with 4 guy friends and they all loved the food.  This place also makes a mean cocktail.  The lounge area is a perfect place to kick back with friends.  It has a cool atmosphere, but it isn't too loud.  This is a great addition to the River North scene.  I look forward to becoming a regular.
