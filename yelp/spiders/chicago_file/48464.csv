Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////As for the food, they had a small but good selection of brunch items, along with brunch-food-themed tapas and pintxos.  Very clever.  The very best part of their brunch, however, is the Bloody Mary Bar!  I was kind of blown away, they have so many options, from 3 different kinds of base (gazpacho, tomato juice, and firecracker sauce), to mozzarella and salami on a stick as garnish, to 5 different kinds of hot sauce.  I can't wait to go back for brunch.
