Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For dessert, we've ordered the Chocolate Chip Pizza, a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie prepped in a deep dish pizza pan, topped with vanilla ice cream and loads of whipped cream. The dessert was pretty good, the warm cookie with the combination of ice cream was super! The vanilla ice cream was not white, but it has a hint of orange coloring.
