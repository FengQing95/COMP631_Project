Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My steak was perfectly cooked medium rare and super flavorful (mouth watering thinking about it). The fries were a great side that came with garlic aioli for dipping, but some were a little too salty. Both our steaks came with b√©arnaise sauce, but I enjoyed mine just fine without it. The Chicago cut came with steak salt, which tasted like a lemon pepper seasoning almost, but my bf also found his meat to be tasty enough without using too much of it.
