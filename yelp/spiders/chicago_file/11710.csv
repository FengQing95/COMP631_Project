Art Institute of Chicago////One of my favorite museums of all time. As a museum junkie, this is one of the great ones. A must see when in Chicago, this museum is just stunning! Take your time when visiting to truly appreciate all that it has to offer. I absolutely cannot wait for the chance to visit again. It was the first museum that made me fall in love with art. Since then, I have visited many, many...including the Louvre in Paris. It is breathtaking and will leave a lasting impression on you that will resonate for days to come. I would allow roughly 4 hours for your visit.
