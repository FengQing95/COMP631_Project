Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The appetizer that arrived was Lou Malnati's three cheese bread. Upon seeing this behemoth, my jawk dropped! I didn't really read the menu and thought I was ordering bread sticks or something. Instead this giant loaf of bread dropped down on the table and it was a welcome sight as I hadn't eaten all day. The bread was crisp but could have used a bit of garlic, but overall a solid appetizer.
