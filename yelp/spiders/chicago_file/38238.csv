Bavette's Bar & Boeuf//// Â We ordered the steak frites which is an already sliced 10oz ribeye, it's a great portion size to share and it comes with these amazingly delicious French fries that are paired with a garlic aioli. Sides were the truffle mac n cheese (which I will always order) and the elote style corn which was creamy and cheesy and perfectly seasoned.
