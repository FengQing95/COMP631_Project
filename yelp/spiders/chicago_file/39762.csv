Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's Bar & Boeuf was the first restaurant we went to in Chicago. We went for dinner on a Tuesday (6/6/17), unsure if we'd be able to get in. We did not have reservations. Luckily, the wait was only 15-20 minutes when we arrived (sometime around 6:45-7PM). Not bad at all.
