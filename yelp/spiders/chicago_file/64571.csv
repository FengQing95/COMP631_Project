Smoque BBQ////Being from Texas, it's hard to find bbq that I think is just as good as what I am used to but I lived so close to it that I had to give it a try. Their bbq sauce is different than what I was used to but that's expected, Texas has their own way of making just like Memphis and other bbq towns do so that wasn't a disappointment, just observed. Out of the 12 years I lived in Chicago I would have to say this was the best classic type bbq I had. I've had other fusion type bbq that were extremely good but the down home classic bbq from the cook out...this is it. I cant speak of the service, I got it to-go each time but the limited conversation and face to face contact went really well.
