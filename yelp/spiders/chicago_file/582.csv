Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////GREAT place for breakfast or lunch. In spite of 30 minutes wait every time we went we'd still return for the food. The key to a great, but not overly expansive meal is to split one of their skillets for two and add to it one of the meat sides and Specialty pancakes. You'll get a filling but not overstuffed and overpaid meal. We wish they would franchise so we could enjoy their food not only in Chicago.
