Smoque BBQ////My only cons: Virtually NO seating and NO decor. the place is made of stacked concrete bricks. Seriously, it looks like (from the outside AND inside) a bathroom you would find at the 9-hole turn of a public golf course that they spray down with a hose. Maybe its on purpose... but the place would make a Â KILLING with some investment in nice real estate closer to the city and some decor, or at least a mural on the wall.
