Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm not mad that they lost my reservation. It happens. It's not their fault. What I am extremely frustrated about was the attitude of the hostess that answered the phone. They were completely nonchalant and unhelpful. Not once did they apologize for the loss of the reservation. Not once did they work to provide a viable alternative. They very much answered the phone with the attitude of "we already have a lot of people who are dying to come so it's no big deal if we lose you."
