Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////But things went downhill when I ordered my pizza. I ordered spinach but received cheese. I told them the mistake but said I would eat the wrong topping if it saved me a half hour. The manager said no it would take 15 minutes so I let them make me a new pizza. The new pizza had the right toppings but was not cooked all the way. Lesson: if they give you the wrong topping suck it up because the second pizza will be not edible. I wish I had the crust of the first with the toppings of the second. But given the choice I would pick the wrong toppings with an edible crust. Such a dissappointment since the people next to me said it was the best pizza of their life and I could not even eat mine.
