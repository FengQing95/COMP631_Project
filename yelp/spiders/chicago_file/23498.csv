Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Foodie bucket list - check. Awesome deep dish pizza fulfilling the dream. Stayed with the primary proposition...Classic (with sausage), a house salad and  a beer (ok two). Very similar to Uno but like their garlicy  butter crust. Must have been destiny for seating under Larry Bird's jersey.
