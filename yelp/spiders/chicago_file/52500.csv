Smoque BBQ////Smoque is a hoppin' place, unpretentious (I mean, come on, it IS a BBQ joint after all), comfortable and lively.  If you come during the rush, be prepared to wait a few minutes and to vie for a table.  You'll probably get to meet one of the owners if you choose to eat in--one of them was making the rounds, chatting up his customers and making sure everyone was happy.  Go now before it's even more packed, thanks to its mention in this month's issue of Gourmet...  I can't wait to head back for some St. Louis-style ribs.  And more cobbler. :)
