Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So we had just come into town and we were so tired so we went to our hotel and ordered a pizza. We had it delivered. It took about an hour for us to get it so we showered while waiting. When we were done our pizza and stuffed bread with spinach was arriving. The food was very hot and delicious!!!!! I think that was the best pizza I've had to date!!!!! I'd definitely order from this place again!!!! Thank you for making our night amazing!!!
