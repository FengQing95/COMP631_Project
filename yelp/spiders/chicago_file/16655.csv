Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For dessert we split the deep dish chocolate chip cookie. The individual size really is for an individual; it is small, but delicious. While its name suggests something out of the ordinary, it's basically a warm chocolate chip cookie with whipped cream. There's nothing disappointing about a warm chocolate chip cookie, but do not expect something exotic.
