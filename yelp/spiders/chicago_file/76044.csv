Little Goat Diner////After friends and my wife had raved about the girl and the goat, we decided to come over here for breakfast based on Yelp reviews and word of mouth. A short cab ride from downtown, this is a place I would hike to if it were located on the top of a mountain- anyone who seen me knows that Papa is not a hiker!
