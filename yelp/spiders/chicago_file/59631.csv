Smoque BBQ////Overall, I considered Smoque a great value, which is really hard to find in a BBQ place in a major city... actually, it's probably because I'm a cheap bastard and I don't think many places offer good value ^_^ I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere here and their commitment to amazing brisket. I will definitely be back!
