Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Yum.  i was out for a walk on a hot day, and I stopped in here.  Had a glass of rose and some garlic potato salad at the bar.  Nice service. Good wine.  And delicious potato salad.  I did not sample the dinner offerings, but I bet they are good.  A bit noisy but that's not a bad thing.
