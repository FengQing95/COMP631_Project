Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My go-to recommendation when folks ask where to eat in Lincoln Park. Everything is delicious, and the tapas style is so fun for groups! You get to try so many different things that way, and the menu has so many unique dishes to try out that you could go every day and have something new. Big fan!
