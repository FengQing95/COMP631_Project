Smoque BBQ////I absolutely love this place. It is an authentic BBQ joint and amazingly good at a very fair price. I am from the South and this place is way up there in the world of great cooking and smoking. I love going there to eat. It is a total everyman place. The folks who run the place are down to earth and just really great and friendly. There is no pretense. They know who they are and they know how to turn out a delicious product and they seem to really appreciate their customers. It really does not get any better.
