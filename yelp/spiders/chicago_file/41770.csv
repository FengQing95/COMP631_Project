Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Amazing brunch is created by a combination of key elements. To begin, the bloody mary. Well, with a bloody mary bar you've no excuse if you can't create the bloody mary of your dreams. Begin with one of seven or eight vodka choices, then take your glass to the bar and choose one of four tomato juice/mixes. Now, try to leave enough room in you glass after all the hot sauces, citrus juices, peppers, and celery salt for some garnish. In fact, bring a plate because you'll need it - but don't go taking all the shrimp skewers, ya cheater. Save some for the rest of the kids.
