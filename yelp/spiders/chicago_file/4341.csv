The Purple Pig////The cheese plate was also excellent. We only picked 5 - she liked some more than me and vice verse, but the O'Banon cheese was amazing - goat cheese with a sweet creamy dessert flavor that when mixed with the almonds and honey or the fog jam on the crackers was exceptional. All of the garnishes (not sure if that's the right word to describe the fig jam/relish, almonds and honey, crackers and cornichon pickles) were house made and excellent.
