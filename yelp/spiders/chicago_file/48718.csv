Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm not a fan of dates, but their bacon wrapped dates are so good! I also like the calmari, yum! Their sangria is delicious, too! I had a great time and loved almost every tapa we ordered. It is quite expensive but the food is yum and definitely make reservations a week in advance if you have a big party. They book up really fast, especially on the weekends.
