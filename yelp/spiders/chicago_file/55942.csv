Smoque BBQ////We had the chopped brisket sandwich and the pulled pork. Both were good, and I would order the chopped brisket again, but the pulled pork just didn't taste too great. Their amazing spicy bbq sauce made up for this, however the meat doesn't stand out on it's own. Their sides are pretty delicious. I enjoyed their cole slaw, which held back on the mayo in favor of vinegar, a big plus in my book. Their mac and cheese was good, however I wish I would've ordered their fries, which on the plate next to me looked delicious!
