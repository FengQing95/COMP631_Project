Smoque BBQ////We wanted to visit Smoque since seeing it on Triple D. We finally made it on a Saturday evening after a Cubs game. The wait was about 45 minutes to place our order, which isn't bad considering their popularity. Once ordered we were immediately seated at a table outside and our food was ready within 15 minutes. The staff are excellent with customer service and friendly enough too. We shared sliced brisket, chicken, mac and cheese, baked beans, slaw, and the peach cobbler. It all was good, but I had personal preferences that stopped it from being great for me. I prefer creamy cole slaw and theirs is vinegary, and the baked beans were really soupy. Glad we got to go and experience it, but the general agreement is we wouldn't go out of our way to do so again.
