Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place.  Any of the sangrias are great but I especially like the peach.  The staff is friendly and helpful, prices are reasonable, and everything tastes amazing.  It can get pretty noisy during peak times but the food and drink make it worth it.  However, if you don't have a reservation during that time, don't even try to go.  The wait for those without a reservation on the weekend is always forever so do yourself a favor and hit up Open Table first!  This place is also great for large groups.
