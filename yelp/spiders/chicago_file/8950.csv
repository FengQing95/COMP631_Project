Art Institute of Chicago////Outstanding museum with an impressive collection!!! I've been to the MoMA, MET, MFA, and other museums in the country and this museum is definitely high up there on my favorites list. During my stay in Chicago, I stayed here for probably 3 hours and felt like I could've stayed even longer! Definitely visit this museum if you're in the area.
