Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////IM SO DISAPPOINTED ):  I came to Chicago wanting REALLY BOMB deep dish pizza and I didn't get any... Lou Malnati's was highly recommended by so many people except I had a group of friends who thought this place was a let down but I still wanted to try for myself.  With a solid 4 stars and over 4k reviews and many other locations.. I had such high expectations.. maybe too high.
