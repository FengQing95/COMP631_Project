Smoque BBQ////Wow! This place is as amazing as everyone says it is! The line was out the door, but don't let that stop you from coming in. We had 6 people and It only took about 15 minutes get to the front of the line, order and have our table ready. We waited about another 10 minutes for our food to be done. The food was amazing, between all of us, I tried; the sliced beef brisket sandwich, ribs, corn bread, baked beans, French fries and the salted Carmel/bourbon pecan bread pudding. Everything was amazing! The Memphis BBQ sauce is the BEST BBQ sauce I've ever had! And the bread pudding, was by far, one of the best desserts I've ever had! The ribs were tender and amazing! It was a bit pricer than I thought, about $35 a couple for sandwiches/sides/drinks. But, totally worth the price and time you'll spend waiting. Take-out was an option too!
