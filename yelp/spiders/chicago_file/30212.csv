Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Was recommended by a few different friends who had been, or lived in Chicago, where they go for deep dish. Thank you Zza Gods for aligning me with this place. Everything from the salad, wings, and the main event, that incredible deep dish, were above what I expected. Skipped out on lunch just to have enough room for all the food here and it was still too much food! Will definitely be back.
