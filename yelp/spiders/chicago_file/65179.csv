Smoque BBQ////Overall, the food was amazing and affordable. The staff was attentive and never missed the chance to clear away finished trays and even provided take-away containers/bags without having to be asked. While Chicago is famous for it's deep dish pizza, I would visit Chicago again just to have another taste of Smoque BBQ!
