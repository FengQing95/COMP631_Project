Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My experience was near-perfect, we parked on the street, walked in, were pleasantly greeted and then were ushered to our seats.  Service was great and the pizza was even better.  While I will concede that the 35 minute wait time seems like an eternity, that comes with the deep-dish territory.
