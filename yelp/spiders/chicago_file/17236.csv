Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ordered in for a working lunch. Unfortunately when you're still working by the time you actually get to sit down to eat your food is cold. But having said that, the salad was delish. They're dressing is what makes the difference. Â It's sweet and tangy. I believe we had the thin crust pizza, cut into squares. Even cold it was good. Hopefully on my next trip to Chicago I can visit the restaurant and enjoy it fresh and hot.
