Art Institute of Chicago////It is worth becoming a member. As a member you can view all exhibits (without restrictions) for free as well as receive a discount at the Gift Shop. If you are a college or high school student they have discounts for students (you must have a valid picture ID from your university/college/high school) in order to obtain the discount. Also, you can bring a friend along, for free, which is a nice bonus. If you have the "Family" membership you can bring up to three friends or family members for free. You can go to the museum as many times as you'd like. Present your Membership Card to the security guard stationed beyond the information desk and beyond where you purchase tickets. You will by pass all the tourists and/or non-members. Getting in quickly, for me, is worth the cost of a membership. You can also purchase tickets on-line, but expect to pay ridiculous fees. As a member, you don't have to wait in a super long line when it gets incredibly busy during the Summer months.
