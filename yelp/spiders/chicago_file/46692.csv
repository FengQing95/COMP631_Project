Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////When we were seated we had many of the menu items and they were all exceptional.  I want to point out the octupus a la pancha, this dish was amazing.  It was by far the best octopus I had ever had in my life.  Octopus is usually chewy and not so tasty but this was melt in your mouth and bursting with flavor.  We asked the waiter how they made this so well and he said, "we tenderized the hell out of it". And that about sums up how awesome this place is.
