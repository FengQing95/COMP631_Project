Smoque BBQ////Smoque has amazing food and sides and is my go to BBQ spot but today I was even more pleasantly surprised by their service. I really wanted some of their delicious peach cobbler and I called in to pick up and they told me it would be an hour wait. I was put on hold and when the Â guy came back to the phone he told me to come in and ask for the awesome owner Mike and he was going to get me some peach cobbler quickly AND gave it to me for free! awesome customer service and awesome food!
