Smoque BBQ////Since I was in a trance-like state as I gorged, I noticed a few things on the sparsely covered wall.  1.) a crayon drawing done by a child, complete with the word "Texes."  It took every bit of my self-control to not turn the "e" into an "a."  I am still thinking about it. 2.) I couldn't stop giggling at one of the plaques.  It was the EAT OUT AWARD for BEST BUTT.  Hee.  Dirty, but oh-so-humorous to my 12 year old mind, it made me laugh and laugh.
