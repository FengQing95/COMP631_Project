Little Goat Diner////Finally, foie gras ice cream.  It completely sounded like a gimmick but the entire thing feels like it should be but it was, legitimately, the best ice cream experiene I can remember in my life (and I eat way more ice cream than any self-respecting 37 year old man should) but every piece of flavor in this ice cream worked perfectly together.  It was, as my dining companion called it, a "revelation"
