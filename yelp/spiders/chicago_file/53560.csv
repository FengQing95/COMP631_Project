Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Would recommend making reservations on any week day or weekend! Super yummy food, great staff, drinks also are AMAZING. Would totally recommend the sangria, salmon, and bacon wrapped dates. Went with a group of 4 on a busy Friday night and we all had a great time as well as indulged in great food. Pricing was fair as well as affordable. Will be back!
