Little Goat Diner////This is my go to breakfast place in Chicago.  There is no other place I'd rather go.  I love breakfast, and the Little Goat is the holy grail.  I always seek out the best breakfast places I can find at home and when I am traveling.  I no longer do that in Chicago. I have no way of knowing whether Chicago may have better places, but I'd have to try at least 1,000 of them before I found a better one.  That means trying 999 inferior places before i found one in its league.  That was OK when I was a young whippersnapper, but at my age not so much.  I can still try other breakfast places in other towns, but I don't see the point of missing the Little Goat when I'm in Chicago.  My favorite is the little piggy went to China.  It starts with the most delicious biscuit I've ever had, topped with a delicous szechuan sausage patty with just the right amount of kick and a sunny side up egg  in an incredibly delicious asian sauce with scallions, gooseberries and red pepper flakes, which is perfect with the egg, biscuit and sausage.  The servers are delightful, and they have outdoor seating weather permitting. I cannot recommend the Little Goat and the little piggy went to China more strongly.
