Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I totally get the anti-tapas attitude as I used to have it years ago.  I also feel that my favorite times here are when I wasn't with a big group, but with one or two people, just enjoying life and not being in a hurry.  truly experiencing an afternoon or evening out where it is as much about talking and sharing as it is about where you are at and what you are doing.
