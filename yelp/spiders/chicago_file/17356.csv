Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I want to preface this review by saying that I am totally a NY/New Haven pizza girl. Deep dish is not really my thing but I thought I needed to try it while in Chicago and I had heard that Lou Malnatis was one of the best. When we arrived, we had to wait about 20 min for a table which was not bad and they actually have you order while you're waiting so your pizza is ready faster when you are seated- this is a good system. We grabbed a drink at the bar and were seated shortly thereafter. We ordered the Lou Malnatis original and one other pizza. We though the personal pizzas would be too small so we got 2 small pizzas. It was way too much food for us! Since the pizzas are so thick, you would probably be good with a personal pizza for each person. We also made the mistake of ordering an appetizer which filled us up a little too much.
