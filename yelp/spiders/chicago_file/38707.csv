Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The Bavette's Dry Aged Bone-In Rib-eye is THE best steak in Chicago, and probably anywhere else. Served the way steak should be, simple. Just some sea salt and some b√©arnaise on the side. Come here prepared because this could be one of the greatest things you will ever eat.
