Smoque BBQ////Overall, a disappointment. I waited for years to get  in there and am pretty well aggravated that I did not instead go to my stand-by, Fat Willy's. While Willy's cornbread is only slightly better than this cornbread, everything else they do is LIGHTYEARS ahead of this feeble  attempt at BBQ.
