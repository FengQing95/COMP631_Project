Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My second visit to Chicago and had to go back to Lou's. This was just like I remember. Fresh tasting mozzarella and chunky tomato sauce. We were a party of four so we ordered the large and a large house salad. Salad tasted fresh and the dressing was just right. "Maybe" I'll try a different pizza place next time I come back to Chicago.
