Little Goat Diner////I just don't get the hype? It was alright. It's got a cool updated modern diner feel and super family friendly. We saw lots of families and kids dining but also it's def a spot for millennial foodies. Our waiter recommended the tempura mashed potatoes, it was horrible. I had the patty melt and it was so greasy and heavy, also disappointing. The only thing we liked was a salad we shared before our entrees which was a cold beef and soba noodle salad. I think it was a seasonal menu item. Idk if I would go back.
