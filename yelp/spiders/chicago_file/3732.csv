The Purple Pig////I sat at the bar and the servers were on top of everything. I had a meat and cheese board to start with duck prosciutto, chorizo and prosciutto and a Brie cheese. The duck and chorizo were delicious but I'd skip the regular prosciutto next time and try a different meat. The Brie was delicious and perfect for spreading and I really enjoy the fruit spread that came with it.
