Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////While the bone in filet was great and cooked perfectly, I honestly didn't think it was that amazing. I've definitely had much better, and at a cheaper price, too. The meat was nice and tender, but it by no means blew me away. I guess it's safe to say that I was expecting a lot more, especially at the price point. That being said, it was still a solid piece of meat.
