Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Everything was amazing! I especially loved the steak with blue cheese and the short rib was a major standout for the table. I tried a few different sangrias as well, and all were refreshing and wonderful. I preferred the peach over the berry sangria, however, both were extremely balanced flavors. I love that the sangria is on tap, too!
