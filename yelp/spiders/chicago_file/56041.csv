Smoque BBQ////OK, so was the food at Smoque worth the 45 minute wait?  ...Kinda?  I guess?  I mean, don't get me wrong.  The St. Louis style ribs were perfectly done--meaty, tender, and not swimming in fat.  The chopped brisket (yes, I got ribs with a side of brisket--you wanna make something of it?) was moist and full of flavor.  But 45 minutes in line?  Really?  When there are so many other great rib joints, even on the northwest side?  Next time, I'm definitely calling ahead.  Some things are worth the wait, but some things just require better planning.
