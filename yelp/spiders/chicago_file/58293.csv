Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place never fails to amaze me. I love love love the variety on the menu. I am definitely a "grazer" and love to have a little bit of everything, so tapas and small plates shared among a small group is perfect for me. This evening I shared patatas bravas (ALL TIME FAV!!!!!!!!), goat cheese and tomato sauce, Brussel sprout salad, and a beef empanada. While my friend said she felt the salad was over-dressed, I thought it was perfect. And the spicy tomato aioli that comes with the potatoes and empanada is outstanding...creamy, hot, and tangy.
