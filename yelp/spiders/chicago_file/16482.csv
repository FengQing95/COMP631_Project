Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Host to your artery clogging, coma enduing, carb-centric fare. My latest visit to the land of calorie averse, binge drinking, brat mecca known to many as Chicago came this past week during a road-trip to California. During my brief layover here I decided to visit famous Lou's to have my second tasting of their famous deep dish pizza, a staple of Chicago.
