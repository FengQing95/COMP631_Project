Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza was so good! The butter crust was amazing! Just got classic deep dish. Normally I don't like sausage either but man I couldn't get enough of the flavor! I didn't have any more room, but I wish I could have taken a pizza home with me. Will be returning any time I'm in Chicago! I didn't give 5 stars only because the service wasn't great- we waited a good 10 minutes before even getting a hello, and another 5 for our waters... but she was at least nice!
