Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Last week, I had scheduled a reservation at 10 pm on 6/26 for a party of 10 people.  At 8pm, I received a confirmation our table will be ready at 10 pm.  All 10 people arrived to the restaurant at 945 pm tonight, to only see that the restaurant was closed due to a power outage.
