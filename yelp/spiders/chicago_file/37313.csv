Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////There is a reason why it is hard to get into this place. Instead of waiting for 2-3 months for a prime time on a Saturday night, my gf and I went and found seats at the bar. We lucked out further, when we spotted some guys paying their tab at a high top table in the corner. Score!! FYI, the only first come seats are any seats with a bar stool; i.e., at either bar (upstairs/downstairs) and the only 2 tables located upstairs in the back corner of the bar.
