Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////You'll be greeted immediately with a very friendly host stand, and seating at cozy booths and tables in an intimate, low-lit, swanky, jazz-club-like steakhouse. With delicious cocktails and an incredible sourdough bread that will threaten your high-hopes for dessert, you'll already be glad you came within the first few minutes of arrival.
