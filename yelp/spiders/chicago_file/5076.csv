The Purple Pig////The ambiance in the restaurant is vibrant, and very tight quarters but it's done deliberately I feel. It's loud, especially inside but it's part of its charm and vibe. The waitress was incredibly kind and knowledgeable with the pairing of each wine and food item on the menu (appetizer or main dish). She was also incredibly understanding, as my coworker lagged for 40 minutes and I delayed the ordering process.
