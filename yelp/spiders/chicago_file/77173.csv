Little Goat Diner////At the time, I was on a strict eating regiment so my options were narrowed pretty quickly. I ended up getting a faux noodle dish - Tofu Noodles with Spring Peas, Peanuts and Chilies in a Blueberry Szechuan Sauce. I've eaten of these ingredients at some point in my ongoing culinary quest around the country, but I've never eaten them all together in one flavor exploding bowl. The tofu noodles were incredible to the point that I forgot that they were made of tofu. The spring peas and and peanuts added great textural contrast. The Blueberry Szechuan Sauce brought everything together in a fantastically tangy and spicy way. The creativity and balance was executed perfectly. I would challenge any tofu-haters to try it. It completely changed my perspective on tofu and I'd imagine it would change many others' too.
