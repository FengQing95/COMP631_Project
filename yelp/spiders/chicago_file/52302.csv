Smoque BBQ////Had the brisket , I was not a fan of it until I had it here , I really like the brisket here. The peach cobbler was just alright , did the job. This time I got 2 different sauces , one with the brisket and pulled pork , thin and vinegary-y. The other sauce came with the ribs and was much better suited for it , way thicker , sweeter and enough to bag the elusive fifth star.
