Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The appetizers were amazing. We ordered the elote corn (which seems to be a must try when visiting Bavette's), the garlic shrimp (my absolute favorite) and the crab cake. I gotta say the crab cake was delicious but in my opinion not worth $21 (yes, $21 for a single crab cake - you can skip it)
