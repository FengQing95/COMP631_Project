Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We tried to avoid the River North dinner crowds on a Friday night by wandering a few blocks over. And failed. They initially told us it would be a 45 minute wait for a table...but we were finally sitting down an hour and half later. They were nice about it, but the wait was twice as long as they had told us.
