Little Goat Diner////Love the whole atmosphere of the place! The decor is lighter and more whimsical than its goat companion across the street. Also, they have the bar/bakery area attached to the diner in the back where you can buy bread, pastries, etc. as well as have the full menu service in the bar area.
