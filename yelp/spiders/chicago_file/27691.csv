Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Not sure what all the hype is about.  I'm not going to go into that much detail but after the the couple bites, it went downhill fast.  Pizza was a bit bland to me.  I liked the sauce for the most part.   You could tell that it was fresh tomato.   The sausage was a bit much.  They could have had less and I would have been happier.  And I don't say that about meat very often.   Maybe I'm just not a deep dish guy.  But I would 1000% take New York style pizza over this every day.   Took about an hour to get seated.  Ordered first and then was able to leave and walk around since they text when your table is ready.  We ordered calamari but the pizza came first first and we canceled that.   By the second slice I was just trying to force the pizza down with a disappointed look on my face.
