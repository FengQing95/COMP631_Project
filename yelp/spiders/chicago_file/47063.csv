Smoque BBQ////We went to Chicago for the weekend and was hoping to try some good food. All weekend time after time we were disappointed. We were actually going to Hot Doug"s but they were closed and ended up at Smoque's which was a pleasant surprise. We came right before the rush. The staff was very professional. It was our first time there and they clearly answered all our questions about the menu. The plate sizes are very generous. Everything tasted great. We had leftovers which we ate 4 hours later cold at the airport and it was still good. The only complaint: they should give different flavor of bbq sauce.
