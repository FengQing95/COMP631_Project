Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Update: Â After my last review of Bavette's I received an apologetic email from one of the managing partners. At first, the skeptic in me deemed it to be lip service. However, after exchanging several messages it was clear the gentleman was authentic and Bavette's was genuinely interested in providing great service and somehow making it right. He did some investigating to check out what happened and got back to me. After refusing the offer of a gift card and another go... our bill for that evening was adjusted, which we did not ask be done. It was a very nice surprise, and one that made us feel cared for.
