Smoque BBQ////Side dishes were pretty good.  The fresh cut fries, perfectly cooked and seasoned were outstanding.  The mac and cheese is very, very good.  Mac and cheese is a good litmus test for a restaurant and they passed this test with flying colors.  I also tried the peach cobbler and was disappointed.  It was not very sweet or rich.
