Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza chips were a lot better than the pizza - they were crunchy and the artichoke and the garlic hummus were tasty. I wish I had tried another pizza place, because for now, I prefer "Masa of Echo Park"'s pizza Waay more - which is a bit disappointing as I wanted to have some great Chicago pizza IN the windy city -
