Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I'm not saying that the food is revolutionary (it's not like the Girl & the Goat equivalent of breakfast, for example), but it IS damn good. We both ordered skillets when we came -- he had the Butcher's Block skillet (all meat) and I had the beef hash skillet. The portions were generous and substantial (but not overwhelming), and they were just so hearty and delicious. Order your eggs poached -- you won't be disappointed. With the skillet, you get a side of toast or pancakes. I say spring for the pancakes. I ordered the gluten-free kind, which they can substitute for the normal ones for $1.
