Smoque BBQ////Really great bbq join! Loved the food & the sides were awesome. Coleslaw was was different, more acidic with vinegar but added a good balance to the meats. The meats were not as good as I've had before though. Brisket and ribs were a bit dry but still very yummy. My fianc√© likes when the meat falls off the bone & it didn't :( again, overall the food was killer.
