Art Institute of Chicago////Had an awesome time at the Art Institute of Chicago doing a museum hack with Colin. It was fast-paced, interesting, hilarious, and I learned a lot. The museum has a ton of art pieces to look at. Definitely enough to make your head spin. It is a huge, clean, and well-lit space. Overall, a ton of fun and few hours well spent.
