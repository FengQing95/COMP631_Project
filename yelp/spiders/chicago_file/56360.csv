Smoque BBQ////Every time I order from there, I'm very satisfied. The ribs are some of the best I've had. The beef brisket is heavenly. The fries are cut fresh and the cole slaw very fresh. I also recommend the corn bread and to top it off, try the peach cobbler. Its delicious! Â I'm lucky this place is one mile from my place.
