Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I went on an off day with my friend (Monday around 12-1pm) so it wasn't crowded at all. No line up and seated right away. The pizza does take about 30-40mins though, so if you are short on time..schedule it accordingly. We tried the Chicago classic Medium size ($20) and a penne pasta lunch special. I would skip pasta and just do pizza. Â The pasta didn't have much flavour to it, just felt like I was eating pasta and cheese. For pizza, I would suggest their Classic or Sausage version (we tried sausage a few days before at a food event where Lou's was at too). Both are good!
