The Purple Pig////We ordered the crispy pig ears, the pork shoulder, and the duck pate. I wasn't impressed with the crispy pig ears because the texture and flavor of pig ears were overpowered by the way they were cooked. The whole dish was very oily as well. The pork shoulder was yummy and your classic comfort food. The duck pate was my favorite though - the cherry sauce complemented the pate very well. Overall, the restaurant is good, but I wouldn't call it a must-do if you were taking a trip to Â Chicago.
