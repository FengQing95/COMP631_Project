The Purple Pig////With such a crowded space and crazy long wait lines we were nervous about how the service would be, would we wait 30 minutes for drinks and then another 40 for appetizers? Nope, when we sat our waiter went over the specials. He was a little pushy on the special as he noted they change them every hour and this one they only had 3 left so we had to order it at this exact moment. It was a fried blue crab dish and yea it was AMAZING. Nonetheless, our waiter was great, our drinks came out expeditiously and so did our food!
