Little Goat Diner////I got together with a former co-worker to celebrate my move to NYC today at Little Goat. This is the second time I've been to the restaurant in the past 2 weeks and each time we arrived a couple of minutes before our reservation but still had to wait to be seated. My assumption is because people wind up staying at their tables too long but who knows. Usually I always get a burger and they're phenomenal but I wanted to switch it up this time. I ordered THIS LITTLE PIGGY WENT TO CHINA. It was sooooo good. I will definitely order again and I'm upset I never got it before today. Service was good, a little slower than normal. It's midday on a Saturday so I get it. I will obviously be back again :)
