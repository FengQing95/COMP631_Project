Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It was SO hard to choose what to order. Those of you who are indecisive about food can empathize. My husband and I ended up splitting the fried green peppers, the beef empanada, the citrus-cured salmon, the garlic shrimp, and the fried calamari. We also checked in on Yelp and scored free desserts, the chocolate truffle cake and the butterscotch custard. Everything was delicious; I think our top favorites were the fried green peppers, the salmon, and the calamari.
