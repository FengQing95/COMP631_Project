Little Goat Diner////Got to try this place on our last day in chicago. The place was delightful. Very huge menu which took a while for us to choose from. Surprisingly quite a few asian and mexican dishes on the menu. We weren't entirely sure what to make of the menu. I end up getting their Okonomiyaki which was very good. It was made the traditional way but had all the elements of it which I enjoyed a lot. It was nice and filling. My friend ordered the Goat Almighty burger which was humongous. Great meal ending our trip.
