Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////After a really disappointing birthday meal at Mastro's, I made reservations here for a do-over.  Both of us were thrilled with the experience and can't wait to come back.  We had a very early reservation on a Thursday, but the place was already packed.  I started with the oysters and the husband got the bone marrow.  We then shared a wedge salad (huge) and I got the steak frites as my entree and he went with the fried chicken.  Everything was super fast to the table and the steak was perfectly cooked.  The chicken batter is a tad on the peppery side, but I am a fan.  Wedge was fresh and had a lot of blue cheese chunks as well as two thick cut slabs of bacon (but the dressing has onions).
