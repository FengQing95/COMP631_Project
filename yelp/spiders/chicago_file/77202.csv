Little Goat Diner////Loved the updated dinner look!  Went early so  no wait!  The menu is very unique so if you aren't adventurous this isn't the place for you. I got "little pig goes to China"  It was delicious. A corn muffin with fresh sausage over easy eggs & an Asian sauce with green onions. Super umami!
