Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////See, I spent a good majority of my three years in Chicago hating on deep dish pizza. Oh sure, I still ate it when presented with the stuff because food and I are best friends like that but I was by no means its biggest fan. But now? That I'm many stones away from this ubiquitous staple of Chicago cuisine? Yeah, I miss it.
