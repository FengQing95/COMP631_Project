Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Tip to male staff---don't call women "girls".....please!! (Do they call male patrons "boys"?) Happened twice, first with the host, and I could have sworn the male server we had heard me complaining to my friend about the host's use of "girls"; the female server we had upstairs would never think of calling my friend & me "girls". She was great.
