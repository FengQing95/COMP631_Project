Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here quite a few times in the past for both happy hour and regular restaurant dining. I haven't been back for awhile but my recent experience was quite different from what I remember and I walked out very disappointed. I went for happy hour on Thursday and sat at the bar. It was the menu that was disappointing; service was EXCELLENT!
