Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza itself was delicious and decadent. I generally hate sausage, but Italian sausage done right is a treat and I'm glad I trusted my instincts to give it a try here. The amount of cheese would make any Wisconsinite feel at home, and the sauce was a tasty topper. The butter crust was, as advertised, buttery. You will definitely feel like a 'Da Bears Chris Farley after enjoying a meal here.
