Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The filet was cooked a perfect medium rare and has a side car of spices and salts which Joe's does as well. I love this. It was fantastic until a nice bite of my filet was so tough I couldn't chew it and had to secretly spit it out. I noticed a small additional piece again before I took the bite and just cut around it. Besides that, wonderful filet. The grilled tomato on the side was a nice touch.
