Smoque BBQ////Smoque BBQ is a great place for barbeque in Chicago. Heck, I even like it more than some bbq places in Texas. Bring your friends, arrive all together, drink some beers, and get that food in your belly! Don't forget to order the bbq beans. Oh, Â and if you have room, the bread pudding is full of cinnamon. It's delicious and I normally hate bread pudding.
