Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place has some of the best deep dish pizza around. The dining room features sports memorabilia on the walls, including a home plate from the old Comiskey Park. They even have a low-carb pizza with a large thin layer of sausage acting as the base of the entire pie, but the regular sausage chunks taste much better.
