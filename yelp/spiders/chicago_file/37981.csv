Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had reservations on a Saturday at 5:15 so we were seated right away. They have a downstairs that not a lot of people know about so it is not as loud as upstairs which was great. Where do I began from the outstanding first class service to the most amazing food! Let's start off with the food. We ordered the bone marrow which came with toasted bread and some onion jam, loved it! If you are not into that kind of stuff then try the bacon which is amazing. We then ordered the classic rib eye which was so tender and probably the best steak I ever tried as I had salmon. Yes I know it's a steak house but I love salmon and theirs was so good. We also ordered the mashed potatoes with chunks of garlic, delicious as well as the mushrooms which were excellent. I saved the best for last which is a must that you try the truffle mac and cheese, probably the best mac and cheese ever! If you have room for dessert then try their chocolate cream pie which is delicious. Now for the service which was excellent from walking in, being taken care of and just everyone is so freakin nice. We will definitely be back. Also we were able to park in front which cost $8.00 to park and pay which is pretty cheap for Downtown!
