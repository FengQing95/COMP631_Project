Smoque BBQ////My husband and I each had the brisket, and it beats just about any other brisket I've had.  I'm from Kentucky...land of the Moonlite B-B-Q Inn (world famous barbecue joint), so I know barbecue when I have it.  Portions were generous, the brisket was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the atmosphere was friendly.  Beware of the "family style" tables in the tiny restaurant, though.  We got there around 6:30 on a Friday for dinner, and a line began to form soon after--so go early.
