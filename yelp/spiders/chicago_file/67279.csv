Little Goat Diner////It's always worth the wait!!...One of my favorite places to go for brunch (especially after a night out!). Love the old diner atmosphere and hanging out in the bar/coffee shop while waiting for a table. The food never disappoints and you definitely won't leave hungry. Favorites: Cheesy garlic bread with marinara melts in your mouth, sloppy goat, and Los drowned is massive but full of flavors I can't describe. 4 stars because the service is subpar.
