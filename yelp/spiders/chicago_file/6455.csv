The Purple Pig////We then ordered the pork belly, which had a great flavor and was the most tender pork belly that I've ever had. The portion size was also pretty big too. I was expecting like the tiniest pork belly slice ever. But was decently surprised. The half duck was also a very large duck! Did not think they would be giving us such a large portion. The duck was delicious as well, and was so tender and didn't have that gamey taste that duck usually has. They gave you bread to make sandwiches with the duck. But we were so full that we couldn't eat the bread.
