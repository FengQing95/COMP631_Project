Smoque BBQ////My partner got the Pulled Pork Sandwich with a taste of the St. Louis Ribs, both were reallyyy good. The only thing I would've like was more sauce on the Pulled Pork, but it's personal preference really. I pretty much want everything on the menu, so I will definitely be coming back to do just that. Yay Smoque!!
