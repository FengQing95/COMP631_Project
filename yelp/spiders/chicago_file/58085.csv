Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas are great, and Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba has lots of different tapas. Unfortunately, they're kind of hit-or-miss. The "spicy potatoes" (patatas bravas) are really good -- they definitely remind me of Spain! But the short rib is like a weird, mini-sized beef dinner. And this wouldn't be a Spanish restaurant without paella. There's a minimum of two portions, and they're each HUGE portions. Two portions could easily feed four without any tapas on the side. The paella definitely has a smoky flavor to it, but the first time I was here, it was straight up burnt. Again, kind of hit-or-miss.
