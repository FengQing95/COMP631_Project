Art Institute of Chicago////Wow! I'm not much of an art guy but this was well worth it! So many cool things to see and I liked way more than I ever expected that I would. Seeing many of the famous painting in person is turkey nothing like the pictures in books. Though it would be a quick trip cause I would get bored and ended up spending 3 hours there. Only honestly left at that point to get food. Would go back!!
