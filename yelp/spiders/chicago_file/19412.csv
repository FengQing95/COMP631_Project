Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////). The crust of the pizza was unforgettable. I'm not sure what kind of crust it was, but it was corn-meal-y in terms of texture and extremely crispy. The Chicago style pizza in California does not do this place justice. Best part about this meal, total bill was $25. Can you believe that?! A great kick off to our trip!
