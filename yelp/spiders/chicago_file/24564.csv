Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was disappointed. Last time I was in Chicago I was pleasantly surprised by Chicago pizza being a New York girl. Â Make sure you ask for the butter crust. I failed to do so and I think that was based on the crust. I had a great time talking to other tourists at the bar. The place gets packed on a Saturday around 1pm. But Giordani's is better!
