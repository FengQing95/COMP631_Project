Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This restaurant is amazing. Bavette's joins Girl & The Goat, Publican, and Maude's as one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. The prime rib sandwhich, rib-eye steak, raosted tomatoes, and stuffed baked potato were out of this world. Keep in mind, the portions here are big. I would stay away from ordering appetizers because the main courses are so big and because the cold duck appetizer we had wasn't as mind blowing as everything else. Our server was also fantastic.
