Art Institute of Chicago////It's a very nice museum. But the worst design for where to go. I'm great at taking directions but I had to ask 3 different people where "Sunday in the Park" was. I can't believe it took me close to half an hour walking around like a dork trying to find it. The entire layout was extremely confusing even the map was easy to read but did not reflect the actual layout very well. There is so much to see in this place it definitely is going to take longer then just a few hours here. Depending on what you want to see will depend on your length of time in here. But seeing a handful of famous originals was very incredible.
