Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here with a Barcelona native, so it must be good, right? We had the goat cheese that everyone raves about, as well as the stuffed mushrooms. I can vouch that the goat cheese is indeed delicious, but the mushrooms were just so-so. Sangria was standard. I gave this place 4 stars though for its ambiance (romantic, carefree, relaxed) and its service (very friendly waiter who consistently checked in with us and refilled our sangria). Definitely a great first date spot.
