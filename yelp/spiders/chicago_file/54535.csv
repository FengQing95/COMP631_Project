Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Another Spanish staple is "Tinto de Verano."  This is a drink that you can get ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE in Spain during the Spring and Summer months.  I asked if they made it.  It isn't hard folks - red wine, sprite and some fruit.  The waiter looked at me strange. The bartender had to look it up on google.  It was better than the tortilla but that sure isn't saying much.
