Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered via the phone for a meeting we were having at the office. First of all, you have to be prepared to be on hold for 5 minutes, then the person who took my order was WAY off on her recommendation for how much pizza we needed to order....we did not have nearly enough.
