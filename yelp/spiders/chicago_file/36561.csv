Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For the food, I ordered the petite filet mignon (6 oz) and our party shared the thick cut bacon, Brussels sprouts, fries, corn, and crab cakes. My meat was a PERFECT medium rare, which as a steakhouse is really important to get right. The meats don't come with a lot of seasoning but they do bring you it on the side. I kind of prefer this because I like the natural taste of my filet mignon and I find that often times the seasoning can hide that flavor. But this is of course a personal preference. As for the sides, the fries were good, but nothing super spectacular. I didn't try the bacon because I'm not a big fan of bacon and especially not of thick fatty oily bacon, but if that's your thing, then this is the side for you! The corn was very creamy and flavorful. So delicious. The crab cakes were done very well. A great texture and a lot of crab. Definitely one of the better crab cakes I've had in my life. But my favorite side was definitely the sprouts! I'm a huge fan of sprouts and these were done so well! They were well seasoned and properly cooked and I could not stop eating them. I also LOOOOVE the sourdough bread they bring out for you, and I even had to bring a box home with me :) Honestly, I was really pleased with everything that I ate that night.
