Little Goat Diner////-The service was a joke, I was looking for a hidden camera. I wouldn't recommend even trying this place in a group over 4, I understand its new and there will be a wait but its not efficiently run at all. Twice the hostess pointed to a 6 top table that was "ours as soon as it was bussed" and twice she sat a 3 top in it. To their credit they ultimately moved one of those 3 tops to a smaller table because there was no where else to put our group of 6 (who had been waiting for over an hour). I'm sure that three top will be writing a similar review.
