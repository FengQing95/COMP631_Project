Art Institute of Chicago////This museum had artefacts related to various culture.I got an insight into japanese, Indian , Greek , European artistic Â work.If you are on a tight schedule and if you have just an hour to spare I would suggest you to refer the brochure which lists the major exhibits to be covered in an hr. I spent about 4 hours to cover all exhibits. The museum is very well maintained and the staff were very warm and friendly.
