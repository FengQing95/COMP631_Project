Little Goat Diner////If you've been to Girl & The Goat then you'll understand that the Little Goat is far from the quality of its predecessor. This restaurant is a diner that is held just right across the G&G and it serves up American diner from noon to night. My personal opinion is that this diner was open just to nestle some of the customers that couldn't wait to be seated at the G&G. (I can understand that the wait for G&G can take sometimes days for a reservation... but shit, it's worth the anticipation)
