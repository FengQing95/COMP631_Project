Smoque BBQ////I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of coleslaw and peach cobbler. The pulled pork was just how I like it with certain pieces a bit crispy. I smothered it in their hot BBQ sauce which kept my taste buds on their toes for sure! The only down side was that they use soft buns so things got mushy a bit.
