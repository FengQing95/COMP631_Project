Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My water was un refilled for a good portion of the meal. I feel like he kept looking at us hoping that we would ask for a check, he was obviously not checking if we needed anything else.. since again, my water was not refilled. At the end he gave us the check without saying anything.. no thank you. My boyfriend and I are industry so these things bothered us.
