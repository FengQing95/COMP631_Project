Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////4) Mashed potatoes - not my favorite style but good. Brussel sprouts - phenomenal! It might be one of the best brussel sprouts I have ever tasted, where you get the smokiness from the char on the brussel sprouts and the flavors of the dijon mustard that cut through the richness of the cheese. I highly recommend you order the brussel sprouts.
