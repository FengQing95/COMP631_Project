Smoque BBQ////My husband ordered the same pulled pork but I do believe SOMETHING must be said about how amazing the mac and cheese is. No joke, it's amazing. If we ever venture back to Smoque, I will be ordering that M&C because it has this lovely crumble layer on top like a panko bread crumb and it's so cheesy! I also tried my brother's brisket which was delicious. I did not try the ribs but they looked great, too!
