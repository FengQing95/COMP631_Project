Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's has always (and forever will be) my favorite pizza place in Chicago. I have been going to Lou Malnati's since I can remember. Typically, I go with family and share the sausage deep dish pizza and a house salad (creamy lemon garlic dressing is awesome for a splurge on the salad).
