Little Goat Diner////My family went here for my birthday. It was a great place to meet for it, and we had a good time. That being said, I told my server as I ordered that I can't eat any dairy or egg due to food intolerances. He suggested putting my burger on sourdough bread so I could be sure there was no dairy in the bun. I thought that sounded great. When they brought my food out, there was cheese on the burger. Not a big deal--I just politely informed them again that I can't have dairy, and I asked could they please get me a burger without cheese. When they next brought me my burger, there was still some cheese melted into the burger and the bread. Basically, they had just taken it to the back, scraped off the visible cheese, and sent it back like that. Yeah, I cannot eat dairy. It's not a taste discrepancy or some weird aesthetic thing where the absence of visible cheese would make it fine. I cannot eat it. And my server was well-informed of that. How freaking hard is it to cook a new patty? Seriously. For this reason, considering that I have food intolerances, I'm not going back there. On the surface, they appeared considerate of food intolerances, but in practice, they were terrible.
