Smoque BBQ////The price is excellent, the staff is friendly, and again the food is outstanding.  Peggy, the catering manager, made things clear and easy and was onsite the day of our event to make sure everything got off to a great start.  I won't hesitate to use Smoque catering again for a major event.
