Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a Chicagoan.....naturally, I'm a fan of the deep dish pizza.  I adore other spots' pies, but it's unfortunate that I didn't like Lou's.  It was hyped up since it is a sister company of Pizano's.  Pizano's actually has a delicious butter crust.  I tasted no butter on Lou's self-described butter crust.
