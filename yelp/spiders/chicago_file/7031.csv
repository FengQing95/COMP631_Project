Art Institute of Chicago////The 'Tute, as its lovingly called by my boyfriend and I, is an amazing museum. They have a wonderful collection that includes work from the past billion years. They've got all the hits, Picasso, Seurat, Warhol, Ellsworth Kelly, FGT, and on and on. Everyone has their own spot that they wander to in the museum. I'm excited for the Modern Wing.
