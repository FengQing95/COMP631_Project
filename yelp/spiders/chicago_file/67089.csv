Little Goat Diner////This is such a great place and the food is amazing. I had ordered the fried chicken sandwich with fries - the chicken was a bit raw in the middle and when I've asked the served if that's the way it should be, he apologized and took it away and another fresh sandwich was brought up to me within minutes. Also, a fresh side of fries! If you eat half of the sandwich you are set to be full and it's also soooo yummy!!!! When I was done with my order, my server packed up my food and the manager came up to me and apologized for the incidents with my chicken and told me she took care of my bill and invited me back - everyone is so nice here!!!! I am definitely coming back here with my family! Great place!!!
