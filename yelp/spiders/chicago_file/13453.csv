Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is THE place to get Chicago Style pizza!  It was amazing.  I have had others and this one is my favorite. The ingredients are super fresh.  The crust is perfectly balanced.  The sauce is not too viscous - it blends nicely.  Love it!   Thanks Lou for keeping with the original recipe!
