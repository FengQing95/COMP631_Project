Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Next up was a Chicago Classic.  I think it's official: I don't like deep dish pizza.  I don't get it, I think it's too heavy and I can barely make my way through more than one slice.  The more I ate it, the less I liked it.  The tomato sauce and cheese were good, there was too much sausage and the butter crust was just okay.
