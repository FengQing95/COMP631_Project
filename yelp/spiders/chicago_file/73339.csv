Little Goat Diner////I already returned a second time this week and service is still amazing, ambiance great, menu options delectable but food was slightly less impressive this time while still good. I got the cheesy garlic french bread again and came out a little chewy this time. The hot chocolate was really good and the french toast was interesting..
