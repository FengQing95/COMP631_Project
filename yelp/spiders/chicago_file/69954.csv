Little Goat Diner////OMG so full!! Portion sizes are huge and the food is amazing. Definitely worth stopping by if you're in the area and worth the trip if you're not. It was pretty busy and Sean, our server, made sure we had everything we need as well as making awesome recommendations, despite how busy he was.
