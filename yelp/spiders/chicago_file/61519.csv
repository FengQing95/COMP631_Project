Smoque BBQ////Visited Smoque BBQ at 3800 N. Pulaski Av. Pleasant atmosphere and friendly staff. My meal consisted of the pulled pork platter w/coleslaw & 1 choice of side. I chose bbq baked beans. Food was average. Nothing spectacular about their signature sauces. Although, I really liked the flavor of the bbq baked beans. My husband had 1/2 slab of baby back ribs and 1/2 of st. louis style ribs. The ribs were smoked just right, very tender but the so-called "memphis rub" on the st. louis ribs didn't sit well with us. It was pastey and did not live up to what the restaurant offers which is tangy, semi-sweet and spicy on the ribs. Coleslaw was a bit vinegary but didn't taste bad. Lastly, they're slightly overpriced on the menu. May not go back.
