Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////2 of my friends took me here for my birthday and it was really fun! They have great specials. They also start you off with soft bread and olive oil. We ordered passionfruit sangria, potatoes and cheese, soft-shell crab, goat cheese and tomato sauce, beef skewer, and shrimp and scallop paella. The price is a little high, but the tastes were delicious! The waitress also setup a birthday flan for us. Thanks again!
