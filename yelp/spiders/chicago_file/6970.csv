Art Institute of Chicago////There seems to be two entries of the Art Institute of Chicago on Yelp. One under museums and another under colleges. The museum category seems right to me, considering it's a museum. Anyway, it's a fantastic museum with a phenomenal range of quality art exhibits. The place sort of reminds me of the V&A Museum in London. I visited during the Liechtenstein show, magical. It was great to see 'American Gothic' in the flesh as it were. If you love art go see, well worth the $18 entry cost.
