Smoque BBQ////Not really what I expected. It's good BBQ but it's not the best I've ever had. The brisket was better than the ribs but they all had way too much sauce and it leaves you with an upset stomach. Mac & cheese is my favorite but I was very disappointed in theirs. It tasted like leftovers that were warmed up. The corn bread is very good - not dry at all. The prices are a bit high but they usually are for BBQ places. Would go again sometime.
