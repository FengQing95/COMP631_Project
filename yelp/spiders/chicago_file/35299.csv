Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Ice cream- We ordered the whiskey ice cream based on the reviews and once again I was not disappointed! I don't even know how to describe it, it didn't taste like booze but there was just the most subtlest hint of the whiskey flavor.  It wasn't too rich,  it was smooth, creamy, and sweet, but not overly so.
