The Purple Pig////My best friend and I split tapas at their bar. Nice inside but the wait to get a seat was an hour and a half long but the bar is first come first serve.. we lucked out and got a seat at their bar. They have a big bar lots of seats! Bartender was great and attentive .. Fabio looking with long hair . Â He was nice and gave us suggestions. We went with the fried manchego which was delicious! Melted with such good flavoring in your mouth came with a jelly type sauce for sweetness but we were not a fan of that.. then out to the scallops and clam dish so yummy! Great combination and we ended with the best dish pork belly and pork tenderloin. Both cooked to perfection and let a great pig flavoring in the mouth. Overall very pleased and would come back
