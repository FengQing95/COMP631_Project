Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our experience did not start so well unfortunately. We were in town just for 2 day to visit the city and try something new. The service was very slow, we ordered a medium deep dish with a few toppings. It took them 1 hour 35 minutes.. The manager then came over to apologize and told us they lost our receipt in the kitchen. Then said she would take care of the pizza off our bill. Which was very nice of her but people around were starting to get upset with the service.
