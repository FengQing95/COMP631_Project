Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I feel sort of obligated to write something spectacular about this place. I feel almost guilty because I didn't like it and obviously so many people do. Or perhaps it's the convenience of the location and the fact that there aren't many pancake spots around? I went in with my two sons because they absolutely adore pancakes (of course). I had the butchers block, my 2 year old had the silver dollar pancakes and my one year old had one egg with pancakes as well. They loved it (of course). They love all pancakes, really. Nothing stood out to me about them but they were good. The butchers block came to the table suspiciously fast. I'd say it literally took less than five minutes between the time I ordered it and the time it arrived at my table. The hash browns at the bottom were greasy and hard and didn't taste fresh at all. Everything else was just OK. My sons picked the meat out of it and I just sort of ate the eggs and old hash browns. I do like that this place is across the street from millennium park. It's nice that my kids can have their favorite meal before heading off to the park. I also like how friendly everyone was and how accommodating they were as well. I came in with my double stroller and the hostess offered to put it away for me or she said she would wait with my babies at the table while I put it away. She was really sweet to them, offering them crayons and asking them their colors, making animated faces and showing genuine interest in them. There was another waiter who stopped and asked my son if that was the new transformers car he had and they talked a bit about that. So it was really nice warm feeling. Next time I come I'll just have a pumpkin latte or something and just enjoy the vibes.
