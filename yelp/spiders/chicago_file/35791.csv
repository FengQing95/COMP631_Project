Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////If you're not in the mood to eat,  Bavette's is perfect for a nightcap, and Zach the bartender is the perfect man to make your drink(s); may I add he's extremely dapper and debonair? ;).  He makes drinks on the menu, as well as his own signature drinks (off the menu).  Watching him make them is almost as good as the drink itself.  He made me "the south-side" (off the menu) which was delectable.  It was so refreshing and unlike any other drink I've had, you'll just have to try it to see.  He then proceeded to tell me the history of the drink which was quite enjoyable.  He was extremely knowledgable and experienced in food and beverage industry making my first experience at this sultry, speakeasy-like restaurant that much better.  I'll be back for sure for the food and to pay Zach a visit.  A+++++
