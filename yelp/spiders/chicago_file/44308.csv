Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Thanks to a $100 gift certificate I was able to indulge at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba and officially pop my tapas cherry. I also took three other tapas virgins (yeah I'm a stud like that) and we all had a blast. But really how can you not? The sangria is amazing, the food was wonderful and our waiter was a blast.
