Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Really great pizza! Tried to settle the debate of which pizza is better NYC or Chicago and Lou's definitely made it tough. The sauce is where the magic is. It's outstanding and honestly for a New Yorker like myself, their pizza wasn't as deep as I thought. I still think it's a bit weird to eat pizza with a knife and fork but hey what can I say that's just me. If you're in Chicago definitely try Lou's pizza.
