Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chicago-style pizza done right. I went to Giardono's the week before and was utterly disappointed by the rubbery cheese and lack of flavor. This place was SO much better and fulfilled my desire for a deep dish pizza. Not only was their pizza good, their dessert was nothing short of heavenly. A chocolate chip cookie baked in a pan, smothered with ice cream and whipped cream with a cherry on top. What more could I ask for?!
