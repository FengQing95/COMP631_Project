Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////NO JOKE, my ABSOLUTE favorite restaurant in Chicago since moving here in 2009. Not really a bad seat in the house, but I highly recommend the speakeasy downstairs. Ambiance, 5 service [hostess, bartenders, chefs, servers, GM, etc.). HIGHLY ADVISE making reservations well in advance - months if you're able - especially around the weekends, holidays, pretty much any day if the week! The bar fills up quickly, but great if you can grab a drink and have cocktails while waiting... or pop over or Gilt Bar until you're table is ready.
