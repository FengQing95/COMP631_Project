The Purple Pig////(++) Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes + puffed farro ($19): This was a fascinating dish with the pork so tender and mashed potatoes so creamy, it is of molten consistency that melts in your mouth. It is rather indulgent but not too unbearably rich, because they creatively use pork shoulder infused with milk rather than fatty pork belly. Intriguingly, the only contrast is the topping of crispy puffed farro.
