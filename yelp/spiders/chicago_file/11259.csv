Art Institute of Chicago////The restaurant serves a varied, interesting menu and the cafe also has very tasty treats so there is something for everyone. The Member's Lounge always has coffee and tea, with hot chocolate in the colder months. There is also a bar in there and comfortable seating so we often take a break from Michigan Ave just to come in and relax. The gift shop is a great place to find something unusual for yourself or someone special.
