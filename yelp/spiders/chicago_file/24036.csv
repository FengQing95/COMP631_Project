Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I waited 45 minutes for this "best deep dish in Chicago" pizza, and was very disappointed. We got "The Lou" Deep dish. The crust had no flavor and neither did the tomatoes. And the was so little spinach I forgot that it came on the pizza. There was a lot of cheese on the pizza, but that was also flavorless.
