Little Goat Diner////Great food, good service, attractive space and amazing music. Went twice in one week, once for dinner and then for breakfast. Dinner was good but breakfast was amazing!! Bagels and especially the cream cheese were delicious. Staff is fun, accomodating and energetic. Will definitely be back.
