Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went here late Saturday night, we ordered 2 different types of west coast oysters and a crab cake to start.  Then had a filet and obviously the dry aged ribeye with the Brussel sprouts, truffle mac and sweet potato.  Service was excellent, with two small exceptions.  First we never received any bread, we were definitely looking forward to this after reading reviews so that was disappointing.  Second, the sweet potato was just not good, extremely sweet, served with far too much brown sugar which was also slightly burned, leaving a very poor after-taste.  Our server was good, inquiring with us about whether we didn't like it, unfortunately, we were still charged for it.  Not a big deal, but just one of those small things that can sway one from coming back again soon.
