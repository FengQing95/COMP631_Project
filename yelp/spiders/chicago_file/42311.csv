Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A very trusted friend of mine recommended I try Cafe ba-ba-reeba and he was 100% right about it!  The sangria, (specifically the passion fruit and the black raspberry), is amazing.  I like tapas style places, mostly because I can experience a little bit of everything they have to offer.  A few of my favorite dishes are; grilled green peppers, asparagus with manchego cheese,  and their grilled mushrooms.  I tried their chicken empanadas and did not like it at all!  If you are going there  on a weekend, definitely make a reservation, or get there before 8 pm or you will be waiting forever.
