Little Goat Diner////If I can give it 10 stars I would. It was that amazing!!!! I got the Braden belly (their version of Benedict) with pork and eggs and this special sauce...so good!!! The meat was so tender!!!!!! We also had this mashed potatoes...tempura style and that was just perfect! Crispy on the outside, nice and soft on the inside!!! Our server was very friendly and helpful! Really, all our interaction with their staff was just great! Seats are comfortable, very trendy decor inside! Ohhh and they serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner all day!!! I would definitely come here again!!!!!!
