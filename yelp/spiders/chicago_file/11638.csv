Art Institute of Chicago////It was my first time visiting museum outside my state.  This museum is very large and you definitely need sometime to finish touring the area.  No wonder it is one of the largest and oldest museum in the United States.  We were standing in long line at the front entrance by Michigan Avenue and an employee told us to use the back entrance for shorter and faster line.  Sure it was, the line was faster.  I was very amazed with all the collections exhibited.  Pablo Picasso's collection was phenomenal.  There is entrance fee but worth it.  And if you get hungry while inside the museum, there's a cafe on the 2nd level.
