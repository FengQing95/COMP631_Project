Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I'll keep this short and sweet. I got the Berry Bliss Waffles after a recommendation by the table next to me and I was not disappointed. The waffles were super fluffy and the fruit was nice and fresh. I had a Mint Mocha to go with it and it topped it off nicely! Looking around me I can see there are lots of people with not much left on their plate, so I can only assume the other meals are just as good.
