Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's exceeded our expectations!   We couldn't snag a reservation but when my husband called the gal my husband spoke with encouraged us to come early and grab a seat at the bar.  We snagged seats near the end by the service bar where bartender Michael took care of us all night.  Their cocktails are amazing (I had the Lillets Rose Martini) and the service is superb.  If you don't know what you want to drink - ask for suggestions!   I saw Michael suggest drinks to a number of undecided drinkers and they all walked away satisfied!!
