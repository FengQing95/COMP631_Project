The Purple Pig////The food is great, yummy. Staffs are friendly, however I think they are super understaffed, we were sitting there waiting for water for more than 10 minutes, we ordered the bone marrow first but got the order after other peoples seated after... I hope the service would be on par if it was not that crowded.
