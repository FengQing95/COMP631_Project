Little Goat Diner////We also got the chili cheese goat fries.  This is why I'm giving LG 4 stars.  I didn't care for them.  The fries in general could have been done better.  They were thin I'm a fan of a little thicker and crispier fries.  The goat cheese didn't have a lot of taste to it and the goat chili just didn't have enough chili powder flavor to it.  I would pass on this next time.
