Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were seated at our table and given the chance to order more drinks while bread and butter was brought out. THE BREAD. it's so good. I ended up ordering the roasted chicken, mashed potatoes and chocolate cream pie. Normally I'm hugely disappointed by upscale restaurants. The food never lives up to the cost. My bill totaled around $65 including my two cocktails and I would gladly pay it over and over. The chicken was moist and full of flavor and the mashed potatoes were delicious with whole cloves of garlic. The chocolate cream pie was rich without being painfully so. It ended up in my freezer and was just as enjoyable on the second day.
