Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Fantastic tapas! Loved the goat cheese with tomato Â and the spicy potatoes. Also the shave Brussels sprouts salad was delicious-lots of texture with the addition of the nuts they add for flavor. The sangria was tasty but definitely a bit weak. Celebrated a birthday and they brought out delicious dessert tapas as well...the chocolate cake one (can't think of the exact name) was amazing. Cute place and friendly service-a great place to celebrate with a group or a fun date.
