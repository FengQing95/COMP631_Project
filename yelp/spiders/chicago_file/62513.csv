Smoque BBQ////Smoque is one of the few places in Chicago that makes really good BBQ and isn't pretentious (BBQ and pretension are NOT good bedfellows).  You line up to order and then get in where you fit in as far as a table is concerned.  Sharing tables is encouraged, as all real BBQ joints do, so the atmosphere lends some credibility to the food.
