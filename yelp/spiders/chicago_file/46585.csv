Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas and paella are the things to get here.  There is a balance between vegetarian and meat tapas.  I really liked the wood oven roasted vegetables and short rib.  I thought the paella was a little salty.  Sangria is a must for a spot like this.  a pitcher is fine for a party of two or three.
