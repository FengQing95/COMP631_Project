Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Large enough portions for sharing! Located just off Michigan Avenue, it was a nice stroll from Hotel Monaco. Very welcoming staff, no wait for a table, and friendly waitress. We have a Wildberry where we live, so the menu was familiar. This was a nice experience. Definitely recommend for a quiet, and I might even add, romantic breakfast for 2.
