Smoque BBQ////Loved Smoque! Went over lunch on a weekday. Particularly enjoyed the no-frills ambiance; sat outside. Liked that you could order half sandwiches, which was just the right portion for me and allowed those with a larger appetite to enjoy a wider variety of the (awesome!) bbq. The cornbread was tasty (a sweet cornbread, which I like), as was the mac & cheese. Â I can't wait to return to try other menu items. I need to learn more about how to judge bbq though to truly appreciate how great Smoque is.
