Smoque BBQ////I've been here before but only for take out and on Friday night we decided to not worry about the horrible traffic and make the trip to come eat here.  This is a BYOB place and we brought a 6 pack of beer with us.  I guess not everyone realized that this is a BYOB place because some people looked pretty jealous as we sipped on our booze and enjoyed our BBQ.  The place itself is very small but efficient because they seem to crank out a ton of customers a day.  People sit down, get their food quickly, eat and leave, so in essence the perfect BBQ spot.  We ordered a full rack of the St.Louis ribs. It came with slaw and two sides of our choice, beans and fries.  Everything was delicious and smokey, including the beans which were probably the best bakes beans I ever had.  My bf also ordered their gumbo and said it was awesome.  I definitely will be making a trip out to this place again, super casual, great food and good prices.
