Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great tapas place for a great price. Everything that is in red on their menu is delicious. The roasted chicken empanada just melted in my mouth- not to mention the mouth watering sauce it came with. Don't even get me started on their potatoes with spicy aioli. We got their sourdough bread and dipped it in everything- the garlic shrimp, the aioli, etc. honestly when I ate here I felt like an elevated version of my self- it was as if all my chakras aligned, taste buds bursting. The wagyu beef was also delicious.
