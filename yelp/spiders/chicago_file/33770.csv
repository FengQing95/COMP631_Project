Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Truly a fantastic all around dining experience at Bavette's, from my pre dinner Negroni at the bar to my Black Dog Gelato Malted Whiskey ice cream for dessert with French press coffee. I was impressed from the moment I walked in; very well thought out sexy decor. Sleek leather booths, dark wood, exposed brick, dim lights and noticeable but unobtrusive Rat Pack music - this is one classy old school steakhouse. Lots of energy and pizzazz yet comfortable.
