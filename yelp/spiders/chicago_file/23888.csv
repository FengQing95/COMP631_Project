Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I may be biased since I am a New York pizza lover or real Neo pizza lover, but I have to say restaurant was a chain and seemed like would be in the fast food/casual dinning group compared to Friday's and chilis only difference it's pizza! I do not recommend this place for "authentic chi pizza".
