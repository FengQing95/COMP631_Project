The Purple Pig////My sister and I came here for a late lunch on a Friday and the place was absolutely packed. Thankfully, we got seated almost right away at a community table. The ambience of the restaurant is lively and loud. It also seemed fairly hectic as our waiter was running all over the place, but I really appreciated how casual it was. The dishes came as soon as they were finished (just not all at once).
