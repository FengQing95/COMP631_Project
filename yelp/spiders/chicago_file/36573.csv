Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This might be my favorite steak house in chicago.  I love the old school speakeasy look with a dark lit interior. The cocktails were delicious.  I have had their lamb, steak frites,filet, dry and wet aged rib eye and I think my favorite was the dry aged rib eye, however its difficult to tell as they are all amazing.  Every side is perfectly cooked as well.
