Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////There is only one steak restaurant I recommend to tourists when they come visit and that restaurant is absolutely, 100% Bavette's! Vegetarians stay clear, there are virtually no options for you here unless you just want the mixed green & apple salad (sigh). My pescatarian friend, though, said she had one of the best salmon dishes she's ever had here @ Bavette's, so that may be an option, if you're part of the latter group.
