Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We visited Chicago last week and we excited to try Chicago deep dish pizza! We chose this location and didn't get disappointed. We were aware of Â waiting time since the spot is extremely popular. We ordered some calamari as an appetizer and were amazed by the freshness of the food! We also went for Lou's special deep dish pizza with mushrooms, spinach and three cheeses. Pizza was just yum and our waiter was extremely helpful. Definitely worth of waiting.
