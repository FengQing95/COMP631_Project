Smoque BBQ////Superb BBQ.  We get dinner here (carry-out) every couple of months.  The food is incredible and here's a recommendation that I am surprised and happy to report....they have a fantastic salad!  The one thing I don't like about BBQ places is they tend to be rather unhealthy.  The salad sounds like an after thought (romaine, sunflower weeds, some cukes, some sun-dried tomatoes) but it's a simple salad and the vinagrette dressing is so delicious.  Sometimes I stop in just for that salad.
