Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best spaghetti with meat sauce I've ever had. Not too sweet, lots of meat, CREAMY, delicious. Did not like that it didn't come with bread or salad, had to order both separately. Even the freakin marinara sauce to dip the bread in was amazing. They only had reduced-calorie ranch, but the waiter assured me it was flavorful. Ordered it on the side with a red wine vinaigrette (just in case). He was right. The ranch was bomb. Lastly, the portion size...ridic. An order of spaghetti can feed 3 people, or 2 greedies :) Bread is enough for a whole table.
