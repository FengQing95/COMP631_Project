Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Okay,  I'm a huge Chicago pizza lover and  sorry, the pizza here was disappointing. The dough was very hard and what happened to the sausage patty that covers the entire pizza? The staff was unconcerned about customer service and the place needed cleaning. Maybe it's the location or the time we visit but, I want visit this location again.. Disappointing and the only reason 3 stars because I know they typically has good food and service.
