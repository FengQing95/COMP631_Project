Smoque BBQ////All I can say is that the ribs were delicious on it's own but with the "regular" bbq, it's to-die-for!  The brisket was awesome again and they were nice enough to give me the vinegar based sauce and the tomato based sauce on the side so I could do what I like.  Both sauces are great but it's a matter of preference for how you want to top your meat.
