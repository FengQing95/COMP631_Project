Smoque BBQ////I have not had any better pulled pork in Northern IL, so worth the hype and yelp rating. A pure BBQ joint with all the traditional favorites. Â The Mac and Cheese was awesome and pulled pork sandwich with slaw was perfect. I have had BBQ all over the country and really enjoyed this place. The sliced brisket was also extremely tender---Wow it was good! Easy street parking in front.
