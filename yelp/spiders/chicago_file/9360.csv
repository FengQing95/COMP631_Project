Art Institute of Chicago////This place is HUGE! Plan to spend a good couple of hours here, it has a huge variety of works from different periods, cultures, and mediums. Saw the Van Gogh exhibition, which was open in March, which showed a glimpse into his work on the Bedroom, with an installation of what the room looked like in real life. A much smaller exhibit, but worth it for the extra $5.
