Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Hands down... Bavette's is one of THE BEST restaurant for date night. The lighting is just enough -- not so dark that you couldn't see anything at all, and it's dim enough that you can feel the romantic atmosphere everywhere. Plus the background music choice is amazing. The jazz music gives just Â the right vibe. You can choose this for your special celebration as well. I think the table next to us is celebrating birthday. And the waiter presents them with an ice cream with a firecracker on top. You can clearly see the smile on their face.
