Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The food appeared okay but tasted "off". Had the organic turkey burger. Waiter handed me a VERY hot plate and burnt my hand without an apology. I went into the restroom before leaving and a man was in there cleaning; garbage cans were on the sinks so you couldn't even wash your hands. Gross! How about waiting until you close to do this? To make matters worse I got extremely sick a couple hours after leaving. Would never go back again.
