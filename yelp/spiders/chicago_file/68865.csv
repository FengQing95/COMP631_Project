Little Goat Diner////Seriously so, so good. Everyone talks about the brunch, so my boyfriend and I decided to try the dinner. He got the shrimp and pork belly, I got the goat patty melt, and we also got goat cheese fries and the crab dip. It was all incredible. The cocktails were great and super fresh too. And of course we had to finish with the pork and toffee shake. I thought it sounded too weird for me, but really just has more of a smoked flavor with tons of toffee goodness. The hosts, bartenders, and waiters/waitresses were all super friendly and gave us lots of great suggestions too!
