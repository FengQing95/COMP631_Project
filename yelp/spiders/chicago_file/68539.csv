Little Goat Diner////We decided to try our luck a second time on Monday morning on our way to the airport, figuring it would be less crowded. It was, and we were seated right away, although the dining room was impressively busy for an early morning weekday. (I guess I shouldn't be surprised). I was worried they'd frown upon us having our luggage with us, but the hostess was very kind and offered us a place to set our stuff by the hostess stand. We had great service throughout the meal, from the hostess, to our waitress, to the servers and various others who picked up plates and refilled coffee. I love places that can strike that good mix between being friendly and attentive but not overbearing. I ordered the Fat Elvis Waffles, which was two GIANT waffles served with peanut butter butter (yes, you read that right), banana, bacon, and bacon maple syrup. They were wonderful, and I loved the combination between salty and sweet. My husband ordered the blue plate special, which I assume changes daily or periodically, but on this occasion was a goat + beef hot dog wrapped in a pancake, with two over easy eggs on top and a maple barbecue sauce over the top. His dish was also quite good - we thought the goat hot dog was a unique spin on a classic, and we especially loved the taste of the sauce. Everything here is a la carte, so if you want sides (not that you need them - the portions were huge), you'll have to order them separately. We ordered the cheesy grits, which were indeed quite cheesy and incredibly rich - almost too rich until I asked for some hot sauce to help cut the richness. I was presented with two house-made versions, both of which were delicious and had a great sweet-spicy balance.
