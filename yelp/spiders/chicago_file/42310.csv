Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My fiancé and I have been here multiple times.  First time we visited this great restaurant was 6 years ago.  The experience was so great we have a tendency to go back at least once per year.  The food and service are as good as they always have been.  Need to try their spicy potatoes and ham puffs.
