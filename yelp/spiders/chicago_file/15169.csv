Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The service was perfect and I never had to play Where's Waldo to locate my waiter since he was very on top of things, especially considering how jam-packed this place was on a Thursday night.  Water was filled at all times and he did a nice job of serving us the pizzas once they came out.
