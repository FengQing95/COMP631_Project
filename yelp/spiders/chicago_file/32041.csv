Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////THE FOOD: For both of our visits, we ordered the same pizza with only one (regretful) difference. I ordered a pepperoni deep dish and my friend had tomatoes, basil, cheese deep dish. For our first time, our waiter recommended we got the buttery crust, as it made it crispy and flavorful. So we did, and wow! AMAZING!!!!! We were so delighted. The crust was garlic-y, buttery, crunchy yet still heavenly soft! However, for our call-in order we forgot to tell them to add it, and though the crust wasn't bad on it own, I wouldn't do it again, too plain and it didn't have as great of a texture as our first one did.
