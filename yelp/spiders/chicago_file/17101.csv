Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////LOVED it... We went to Gino's East for our first Chicago style experience per recommendation but I'm glad we went to Lou's for one more Chicago style experience before we left. The butter crust is awesome and light. The sauce is very homemade and with remnants of tomato peels and they use Wisconsin cheese (plenty of it!) which is also very delicious. Well done, yelpers for helping us find this place!
