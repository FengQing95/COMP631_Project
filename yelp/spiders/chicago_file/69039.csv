Little Goat Diner////For an appetizer, we started off with the Goat Chili Cheese Fries - out of this world good - and I ordered the Smoked Corned Beef Hash with Eggs as an entree. The kitchen was backed up and I had to get back to my office, so I requested that the waitress bring a to-go box when my food was ready. When she brought out my food she not only had a box for me, but her manager also came over and apologized for the delay before giving us 2 free cookies for our patience. I also found out later from my family that my sister received a free birthday milkshake.
