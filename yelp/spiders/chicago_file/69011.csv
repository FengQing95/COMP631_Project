Little Goat Diner////We were excited to try this place; this restaurant group has a lot of hype. It seems like brunch is their thing, and we went for dinner. We got the fresa cocktails which are delicious if you like strawberry and also a little kick--very original. We got Caesar salad with fried chicken (creative and familiar at the same time, and quite tasty), tempura mashed potatoes (sooo good: as the name suggests, soft and smooth inside but crispy on the outside), and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was really disappointing: bland, not much cheesy flavor, lacking in salt. Now, I love good Mac and cheese of all kinds: from the kind made with American cheese and string cheese to gourmet skillet cooked Brie or Gouda Mac and cheese, etc--I'm not a snob, but this just wasn't good. For a place that prides itself on gourmet comfort food, I expected better! But everything else was good, and I love the whole concept, so I'd definitely return, especially for brunch. If we had come any time of day besides 9 pm, I would have loved to try "this little piggy went to China."
