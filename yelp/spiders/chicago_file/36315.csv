Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The Space:  Swanky is the only word that does this space justice - something I'd realize the following day that Sodikoff does quite well.  Antique mirrors and fixtures, brick walls, red leather, and dark wood from wall to wall with a beautiful bar 2-3 deep with beautiful people as smooth jazz filters overhead - it's a great place to see and be seen, but also the sort of place where a low table in the corner could serve quite admirably for those wanting to disappear into the background.
