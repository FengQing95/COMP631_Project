Little Goat Diner////Not very impressed. I have had so much better in Chicago with very little to no expectations and although the price was right was underwhelmed and regretted coming here rather then any of the other amazing breakfast joints in the area. We had This Little Piggy Went to China and Corned Beef Hash. Flavor of the Little Piggy was unoriginal and tasted very cheap. The hash wasn't seasoned enough and the hot sauce we received after asking was thick and overpowering. Try Birchwood Kitchen in Wicker Park or Big Jones in Andersonville
