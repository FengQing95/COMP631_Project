The Purple Pig////Some of the dishes were a little heavy on the salt, but nothing the garnishes couldn't help with. Yum. We also decided on getting dessert (even though we didn't need it, but we were on vacation...) He got the affogato and I got the caramel poached pear dessert. We are huge desserts people. He loved the affogato (I'm not a coffee person at all), the poached pear was STUNNING. It looked gorgeous and tasted delicious. I definitely did not need to eat most of it, but that didn't stop me. I love the flavor of the poached pears, and the ice cream was a delicious nice touch.
