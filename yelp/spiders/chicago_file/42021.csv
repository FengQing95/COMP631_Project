Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////this place has to-die-for sangria. i loved the different flavors to choose from. i tried i think the peach. the empanadas were very good as well, along with the curried chicken salad. i wasn't impressed with the chorizo which made me sad because i'm a huge fan of it. the best part was the end of the meal when we got our check. i was 2 other friends and the bill was around $17 each and we were all stuffed. i will be back to try all the other dishes and sangria's :) - especially in the summer to sit outdoor.
