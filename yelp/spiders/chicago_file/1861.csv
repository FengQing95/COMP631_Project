Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Haven't been for a couple of years.  Went after Black Friday sales so got there about 10:30.  Was told it would be a 30 minute wait.  Based on previous experience we thought it was worth it.  Was seated in about 20 minutes.  We ordered skillets, toast, pancakes and lattes.  All of it was perfect.  Waiter was friendly and helpful.  If I had to find any fault and that would be their eagerness to clear the table.  That's understandable when you have a queue of 30 people waiting.
