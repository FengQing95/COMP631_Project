Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is the perfect place to go with a group of friends. You can try so many items and they have pitchers of sangria which are fantastic. We've tried just about everything on the menu over the course of 5 or 6 visits and everything was good. Nothing was good enough for me to crave it again but nothing was terrible either. W have tried the paella and it had mixed reviews. Some of us thought it was lacking flavor but others thought it was just right. I think it will strongly depends on how much spice you're use to eating. I'm always cooking with lots of spice and seasoning so for me this was not seasoned enough.
