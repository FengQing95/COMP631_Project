Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Again, I suspect that all the good places in Chicago has a wait. There was a 30-45 minute wait for a table for 2. We opted to wait for seats at the bar which we successfully got. We ordered the "Malnati's Chicago Classic"- Individual size deep dish buttercrust pizza topped with their own blend of sausage. It took 30 minutes made-to-order but it was worth it. We ordered the individual size $7 to share to get a taste but I am sure if we came for a full meal we would have ordered something bigger. But even for the small size, they still manage to pack a great deal of flavor in the dough, sauce, and definitely the winner on the pizza = the sausage. It was a great deal because the sausage covered the top of the pizza.
