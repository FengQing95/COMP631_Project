Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////hour wait for a seat at the bar, once I got there I realized why and that it is so totally worth it. Everything is top notch, top shelf. Best crabcakes I've had. Wedge salad comes with bacon about a half inch thick, they give you a steak knife just cut the bacon. Drinks are terrific as well. And don't even get me started about their chocolate mousse pie dessert with whip cream.
