Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas Extrordionaire!! This restaurant was packed on a Thursday night when my date and I went for the first time. The service was well organized and we were seated for our reservation early and approached by our server immediately. The menu consisted of 50-60 items in true Tapas style.
