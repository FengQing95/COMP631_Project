Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place, where to begin - it's just top notch in every-way. We had a reservation but arrived a little earlier to have a cocktail at the bar, which was the best decision we could have made. We then met Eddie, Steven & Andrew. Eddie quickly became our guy, we ordered 2 different old fashion's (they're known for them) to share and they were both outstanding. This then lead to a very wonderful conversation between my fiance and I, Eddie and Steven. It was quickly learned that we were there celebrating and they brought out a surprise delicious cup of their strawberry ice cream (it was amazing) with a wonderful sparkler on top (we haven't even been seated for dinner yet!) Eddie then brings over a glass of Frank Family Cab as we are about to depart for dinner (I mean, come on!!) We then close out at the bar to be seated at our table, downstairs which had an awesome, romantic vibe! Our waitress quickly showed up, telling us how she heard we had a great time upstairs with the guys and she wouldn't let them show her up! She was also 100% and had many laughs with her. We ordered a bottle of the Frank Family, which was amazing! We then ordered (recommendations from Eddie and Steven were fully taken into account here). We got the filet (amazing), the 22 oz ribeye (he said it was out of this world), the fries (bc the aioli was fantastic) and the truffle mac-n-cheese (also, yum). Our wonderful waitress came back to see how were doing (she was so good at timing!) and brought us another glass of wine (we did not order this) and said it was from this cute couple across the way (bc we didn't know what was up we asked her :)) - they do a BYOB and you can either pay the corkage fee or they will waive the fee if you share a glass with someone else not in your party, how awesome is that! We finished up with the chocolate cream pie, which was also out of this world. As we headed back upstairs to head home, we swung by to say thank you and bye to Eddie and he greeted us like old friends and wished us well. The staff was top notch (thank you!), the food and drinks - outstanding - overall A+.
