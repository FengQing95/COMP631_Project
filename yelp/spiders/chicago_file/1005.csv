Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////My wife and I were split in this one.  I thought the banana bread French toast was incredible.  She had the multigrain pancakes but was not too impressed.  The flavors in the French toast were incredible.  The pancakes were just ok a relies to heavily on the cinnamon  sugar and candies walnuts which masked the multigrain natural sweetness.  It was also a bit pricey.
