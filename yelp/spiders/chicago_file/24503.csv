Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Well, thanks to Lou Malnati's, I now understand why people love deep dish & also how so many places fail at making it taste good. This absolutely changed my opinion on something I hated every time I tried and the only reason I went to Lou's was due to the urging of a dozen or so friends.
