Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We came in for a Chicago visit with our son and delightful girlfriend and told them we wanted to go to the best steakhouse in their city.  When they booked this 6 year old spot over the venerable names I had my doubts.  When we walked in to a packed, high energy, well dressed (both clientele and staff) dining room at 7:45 pm I knew they were on to something.  Over the next hour and 45 minutes we enjoyed nothing short of one of the best steakhouse meals in our lives.  Expertly mixed cocktails ($13.50-$16) and an array of a dozen fresh oysters from both coasts ($42) to start were great.  Thomas and I had the 22oz dry-aged bone-in ribeyes that were perfectly cooked and tear inducing Prime beauties ($69.95).  Joyce had the dry-aged NY Strip ($65.95) and Nicole showed the only restraint having the petite filet ($39.95) and both raved over them.  We split 2 lettuce wedges oozing with chunks of blue cheese and blue cheese dressing accompanied by slabs of thick cut bacon - ridiculously good and refreshingly cool and crisp ($18 each) - we easily could have split 1.  Creamed spinach ($12), charred broccoli $(14), fries ($12) and a Parmesan crusted chile lime corn ($12) were worthy sides.  While we indulged in this great, well paced meal, with our own wines (you just have to contribute a glass to avoid cork fee) we watched waves of happy patrons to continue to stream in.  Our waitress Hope ably and professionally guided us through the night.  You will not be disappointed in this throwback, speakeasy cool as heck place packed with people who couldn't wait to get there and staffed by people who are happy to see you.  Yes, it's a serious blow to the wallet but you truly get what you pay for here.
