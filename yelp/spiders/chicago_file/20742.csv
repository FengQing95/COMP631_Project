Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Loved this place! Best pizza and house salad ever!! Loved the dressing! Taking some home to Texas!! We had the classic pizza. My husband always wants wings when he has pizza because he wants meat. Â He was so surprised as this pizza was so delicious, meaty and very filling. Tomatoes were sweet and sauce was delicious!
