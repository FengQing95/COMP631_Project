Little Goat Diner////I've been here several times now (for both dinner and brunch), and I've yet to be disappointed.  Most recently I came in for brunch with a group of 11 people, and the waitstaff could not have been more accommodating of our large party, major props.  I love how unique the menu is, and the portions are enormous. Of what I've ordered (that I can recall), the Parathas burrito was interesting and really tasty (lighter than a lot of the breakfast menu), and the Fat Elvis waffles were delicious too (the salty-sweet combo of the peanut butter, bananas, and bacon has my mouth watering just thinking about it).  I'm not sure it's still on the menu, but I think I had some sort of scallion pancake thing here once as well, which was also great. Definitely a solid spot for dinner or brunch.  I've been meaning to try their cocktails--next time!
