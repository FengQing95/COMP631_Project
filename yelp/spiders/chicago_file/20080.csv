Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Decided to eat here based on fellow yelper reviews. It was close enough to our hotel so we walked the mile to Lou's. We got a seat at the bar and had fantastic service from Mark. We ordered the Malnati salad and the classic pizza - both of which were amazing! Â Such a great experience for our final dinner in Chicago. A must for all.
