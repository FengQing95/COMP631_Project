Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////One note about the atmosphere: I wish it were a bit quieter. My dad is getting older and has trouble hearing. I had to lean over the table to talk to him. Can't they put down some carpeting? Noise seems like an issue at so many restaurants these days. It's the only reason I'd think twice about coming back.
