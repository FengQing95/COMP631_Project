Smoque BBQ////BYO BBQ joint is great, unfortunately if you are going for the BYO, you are required to sit inside. I had the pulled pork platter, with an add on taste of ribs. The meat is well smoked, I preferred the Carolina to the Memphis, but that may just be a matter of taste. Between my friend and I, I tried all the sides. I would say the beans, cornbread and Mac n Cheese are the winners. The chili is alright, but it's not spicy enough, and if you're having the BBQ it just doesn't pair correctly. Even with a line that reached to the door service is quick, so don't let that deter you. I tried the bread pudding, it had a good flavor but it would of been great if it was served warm.
