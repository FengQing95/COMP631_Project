Art Institute of Chicago////There is so much to love about the Art Institute.  It's not the Louvre Museum in Paris with time requirements it takes to see everything but a day isn't really enough to do it justice either.  My husband and I have been members for several years and continue to enjoy the fresh new exhibits, the restaurants and the general environment a day at the Art Institute can bring.
