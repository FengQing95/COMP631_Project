Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was one of the best reviewed & most talked about pizza joints by all of our Uber drivers.  The deep dish takes about 45 minutes to make so they recommend you order appetizers while you wait but  I say wait it out because once the deep dish comes, you will get so full & it will be that more satisfying.
