The Purple Pig////Okay so I have to say I went twice to this place while we were in Chicago. I feel like you could fall in love with all the food and never feel like you are tired of this place. First off the location is cool and very convenient near the water. There is always a wait some days better then others but they will get you a drink while you wait and it doesn't feel so long. I love there sangria had probably more than I should have but hey when in Rome as they say or in this case Chicago. We tried a variety of options and never had anything we didn't like.
