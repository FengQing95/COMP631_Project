Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute has world class collections in a number of fields - Impressionism, Monets, etc., and a visit here really cannot take in everything there is. But we like it that way. Every time we visit we go off in a different direction - if we are not here to see a special exhibit - and always find something interesting and educational. Needless to say the Art Institute is a visual extravaganza. Â
