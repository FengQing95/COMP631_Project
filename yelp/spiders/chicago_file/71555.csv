Little Goat Diner////I used to go there all the time for lunch when I worked in the West Loop. There is usually a 20 minute wait and they can text you when the table is ready if you don't want to wait there.This connects to Little Goat Bread so you can get a cup of coffee and other Little Goat merchandise while you wait.
