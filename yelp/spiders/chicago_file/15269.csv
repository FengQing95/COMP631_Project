Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Finally we come to the best part: the cheese.  Before I went to this place, I would have sworn that you could NOT have TOO MUCH CHEESE!  It just wasn't possible.  I'm here in tearful remorse to confess that I was wrong.  Lou's kitchen cheeseheads put so much cheese into this pizza that it swamps, no, overwhelms, no, engulfs the negligible flavors that come from the sauce and dough.  This is death-by-a-thousand-curds and it has made me realize that a good pizza is a subtle blend of tastes and textures from the dough, the cheese, the sauce and the spices.  It is not a mortar-shell sized plop of Wisconsin over flavorless other ingredients.
