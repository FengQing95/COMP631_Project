Smoque BBQ////We arrived around 11:45 and the restaurant was pretty busy.  Luckily, our friends arrived a bit before us and secured a table.  To order at Smoque, you have to walk up to the counter, make your order,  and then your number will be called.  Considering how busy the restaurant was, we got our food pretty quick.  As we ate our meal, there was a good steady stream of customers moving in and out of the restaurant.  There is a staff that takes empty trays and moves customers along (I assume this is primarily for the lunch time crowd).
