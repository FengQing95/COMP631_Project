Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The service compared to other steakhouses leaves a lot to be desired. We were consistently out of drinks throughout the evening, whether it be our wine/cocktails or water. The waiter seemed to be trying to rush us to place our order. We placed the order for our steak the way we like it (nice sear on the outside with a little char and rare in the middle) but didn't receive I it that way. Not sure if the waiter got it wrong or the kitchen. Also, a nit picky item, I had told the waiter that it was my fianc√©'s birthday before he arrived. He never even mentioned it... but people around us were getting complimentary drinks or desert for there's.
