Art Institute of Chicago////my thoughts on the modern wing in no particular order: more rauschenberg for the public to compare to warhol, come on he was just as good! also more photography. thank you for not bombarding us with too much sexually laden art like the mca does. no thank you to the clowns it was a bit overwhelming in comparison to the other art. i think it deserves its own gallery for this reason. other than that not bad!
