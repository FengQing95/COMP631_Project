Smoque BBQ////I got a Full Rack of St Louis Ribs like they recomend. I loved the Mac and Cheese side (Too small). I loved thier side of Chili (too small). The Ribs were only okay. I am used to fall off the bone Gale St style ribs. And i will be going back to try the pulled pork sandwich and brisket. I will get large sides. I will amend the review if next experience is better.
