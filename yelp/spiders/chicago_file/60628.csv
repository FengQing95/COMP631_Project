Smoque BBQ////UPDATE: Are we seriously judging this place on the dining environment, the lighting, and the color of the walls?  Good grief.  IT IS A BBQ PLACE without table service... what do you expect?  Not that I care in ANY way, but for a BBQ place, it looks pretty damn good: clean walls, clean tables, clean floors, clean kitchen upon which anyone can look, and clean restrooms.  And because people seem to care, I think the walls are a non-harsh red with a slight brownish hue and I do not find the lighting to be harsh and I did not need a blanket wrapped around me while I sat near the door in January (in case wall-color and fluorescent lights matter to you when you buy a ton of meat at a BYOB cop haven in Avondale).  Judge cheap take-out places on food, not on friggin ambiance or your normative perception of a lack thereof.... ugh.
