Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////As for tapas, we had the short-ribs with manchego cheese mashed potatoes, spicy potatoes with tomato aioli, grilled squid in olive oil, and the seared scallops with couscous.  Even with such a diversity of proteins and carbs, they shared one thing: flavor.  Each dish had its own unique flavor that simply screamed for your salivary glands to make copious amounts of drool and your stomach to scream for more.  The short-ribs fell apart at the prodding of your fork.  The juice from it make you wanna pour it in your mouth from the plate.  The spicy potatoes were deep fried and super-spicy but perfectly paired with the mild aioli to create quite a party in your mouth.  The squid was simply exquisite.  Simple and delicious.  You taste the squid, you taste the garlic and lemon, and you can't believe that something so simple can be so delicious.  The seared scallops were equally perfect.  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and paired with a perfectly cooked couscous.  Really, it's not a coincidence that the word "perfect" was used so much in this review.
