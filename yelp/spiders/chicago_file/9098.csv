Art Institute of Chicago////The museum staff here sucks! Out of all the visitors who came here I was the only one stuck with having to take my water bottle out of my backpack when I was getting my coat and bag checked in with coat check. I was forced to walk around the museum with a plastic bag with my water bottle in it. There were no signs or messages in the coat check area about water bottles in bags NOT allowed for coat check. The coat check people made up their own faux rules. Perhaps racism might be a factor since they were all white and I was a minority. What a$$holes!!!
