Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I liked the deep dish pizza a lot, but it is not something I could eat every week like normal pizza.  It's too heavy.  I could see it being a great meal on Christmas though (instead of a traditional Lasagna).  I would go back to Lou's if I visit Chicago again.  It's sure is a lot better than the Pizzeria Uno chain.
