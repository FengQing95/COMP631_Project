Little Goat Diner////I figured I'd try the place anyway, so I inquired about the rooftop seating. The hostesses told me that was only for private events. Okay...so I asked what would be the estimated wait time for a table for one. She seemed a little annoyed that I'd even ask for a table for one during rush hour by the look on her face, but she took down my info and told me it would be about a 45 min wait.
