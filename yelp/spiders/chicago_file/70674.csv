Little Goat Diner////I am not a Top Chef viewer, but I understand the owner own a few restaurants/cafes and this is one of the winners.  If I was a Top Chef fan, I would have been very disappointed.  The food was mediocre at best.  I had a sandwich with a special sauce.  The sauce did not have a lot of flavor at all.  I will say the portions are a pretty good size
