Smoque BBQ////Three of us stopped here early last evening before a concert at Wriggly Field.  Parking was a little difficult, but we kept circling a couple blocks until we found a place.  The smell in the air told us we shouldn't give up on parking.  Inside the place is clean and basic.  The term BBQ Joint really fits. The type of place you can pick up your ribs and eat with your fingers.  This is a meat lovers restaurant, I think there was 1 salad on the menu.  You place your order at the counter and they call you up when it is ready.  Service was friendly and pretty quick considering they were very busy with dine in and carry out orders.  I had a chopped brisket platter with coleslaw, macaroni and cheese and corn bread.  They served it with a side of Memphis BBQ sauce and Carolina BBQ sauce.  Both sauces were excellent, with just the right amount of zing.    The brisket was exceptional, the coleslaw was delicious and the mac and corn bread were good.  Portions were large, and I was stuffed when I was finished.  One of my party had a brisket sandwich which she also rated as exceptional and coleslaw and fries which she rated as very good.  Our final person had a full rack of ribs which were so large he couldn't finish them.  He loved that they were very meaty with very little fat.  He had a side of chili, which was also meaty and he rated as excellent.  This was a great place to stop if you are traveling in to Wriggly for an event.  It's far enough away that you are not in all the chaos near the park, but close enough that you can get their quickly after your meal.  I highly recommend this place.
