Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Located near a corner with outdoor seating (too cold and windy for us to eat outside on a Saturday when we visited), my husband and I came here for a late lunch a little before 2:30 pm. There was a wait even this later in the day. We waited 22 minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad. While we waited, an employee told us that we could actually put in an order for our pizza so that it will be ready by the time we are seated (you can only put in your order for pizza only, which is great because it does take some time for it to be made).
