Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I swear to you though, I've never had sangria this weak.  The multiple times I've been there, we've gotten all different kinds of pitchers white, red, and I always find myself thinking that I may as well be drinking Mondo.  You remember Mondo - back in the lunch box days.  Yes, juice, food coloring, ice.  Still good fun, just don't waste your money on the sangria.
