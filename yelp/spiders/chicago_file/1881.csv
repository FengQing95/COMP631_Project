Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I think I got a hash of some sort. It was in a cast iron type bowl, and it was delicious! The coffee was good too! AND their signature pancake (the one with drizzles of sauce and has fruit on it)! I knew it'd be good when I asked the waiter what he recommend and with a big guilty grin, he pointed to this! My boyfriend opted for a another one (carrot cake maybe?) to "try something different," and he abandoned it and helped himself to mine!
