Smoque BBQ////Now, there's the matter of the sides.  They're all incredible.  I'd like it if the place had potato salad, but I would be forced to take another couple minutes to decide on my sides each time if it did.  The owner, who is constantly circulating, making sure everyone's doing well, stops to talk to customers constantly, and when he stopped by our table mentioned that they're working on a potato salad.  With as much work as they've clearly put into the other sides, I'm very much looking forward to it, since I'll be going back regularly.
