Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////With all the dishes we had and the sangria, I'm pretty sure we all got out of there for less than $40 a person which was incredible considering we all had our fill of drink, and were stuffed to the brim with food. It's probably not the first place you think of when you hear "authentic Spanish cuisine" but it's pretty damn good. Only my second brunch in Chicago but I'd say if you're looking for some great food and sangria, this is your place.
