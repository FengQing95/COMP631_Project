Little Goat Diner////Maybe I'm not a dinner guy, or maybe I just realize 100 items can't all be good, but Little Goat just doesn't do it for me. I've tried both dinner and brunch and both times I left missing something.  Items seem a bit too heavy, but not yet filling.  The bakery aspect is pretty spot on but this isn't a fill in for Girl if you can't get in.
