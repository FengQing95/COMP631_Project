Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////One caveat- be very careful about where you park especially if you are visiting during "rush hour" which is designated between 4pm-6pm weekdays. We parked in a metered spot near the Humane Society which is around the corner. We finished our dinner and had a very unwelcome surprise when we discovered that our car had been towed away because the metered spots become tow-away zones during rush hour. To add insult to injury, the phone numbers on the parking meters were non helpful in helping us to locate our car. I was able to get the information that I needed from a nearby business. They handed me a paper with a map to the impound lot and they told me that this happens all the time! It cost us $160 impound fee+$60 parking ticket to get our car on the road again. I guess this is a major revenue source for Chicago, but I'd prefer to see Chicago from Sear's tower with a drink or 2 NOT from an impound lot!
