Smoque BBQ////I am not here to bash Smoque but just give my opinion of what my taste buds like. I grew up on the south side of the city so I can assure you that there are quite a few BBQ joints that are really good.  The difference between Smoque and other BBQ joints is that the real BBQ joints have just a few tables and maybe some stools but most of the time you have to stand and eat.  Also Smoque has the power of advertising and yelp definitely helps. Real neighborhood joints don't advertise, you either know about them or you don't. Also lets face it, a lot of people will not go to the south side. Hyde Park is as far as some people go or have ever been. With that being said people are really missing good BBQ in the city.
