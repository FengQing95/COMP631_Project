Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For a side we got the corn. Best corn ever. It's orange corn and it has a bit of a kick to it with a lime after taste. You can't beat it, and you've probably never had anything like it. So make sure you order it! It's also pretty light so you will have plenty of room for your steak in your stomach.
