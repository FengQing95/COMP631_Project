Little Goat Diner////I absolutely love this place. I have been here twice for lunch. There is wait almost always so you might want to get a reservation. The food is amazing, ambience is great, vibrant, bright and lively and the service is great too, a bit slow but eh - its fine. I usually go here prepared to be there for aboutan hour and half from start to finish.
