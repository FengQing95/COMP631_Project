Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great place for tapas and the prices are extremely affordable. The food is super tasty. I recommend the lamb and the short rib they both were super tender and cocked to perfection. The stuffed mushrooms with spinach and manchego are crispy and they melt in your mouth. I also recommend the goat cheese in tomato sauce creamy and very tasty. Overall, the food was excellent and the service was great. If you want to try an affordable tapas place come check this place
