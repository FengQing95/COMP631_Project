Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I think a good pizza is about a good crust and sauce, toppings yeah they are important but without the crust and sauce the toppings don't matter.  Lou's has the best crust and sauce I've ever had on a pizza, the toppings are also excellent.  It's just fantastic substantive pizza that doesn't get overwhelmed by stuff toppings (If you want the obscenely thick stuffed pizza head to Giordano's, Lou's isn't that and they are better because of it).
