Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The exterior of the place is not very enticing but once you are inside it is a whole different story. The place was packed and the atmosphere was great. We did not wait long to be served, and the server made some really good recommendations. She was very nice andcattentive overall and answered all of our requests pretty quick. Me and my companion decided to drink sangria with the dinner. I would say it was ok.
