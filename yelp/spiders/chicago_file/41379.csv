Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Everything here was absolutely amazing (food/drink wise) - - but we made reservations and still didn't get seated forevvvvver and the service wasn't very good.  Don't go here if you're in a hurry.  BUt if you just want to sit and enjoy delicious sangria/tapas .... come check it out.  Sitting on the patio is highly recommended if you can swing it :)
