Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For my meal I got the Prime Bone In Dry Aged Ribeye. This thing was AMAZING! SO MUCH FLAVOR! I think it was dry aged about 32 days and wet aged about 28.. It was sooo good! The outside had this crust to it that tasted amazing, and the inside melted in my mouth like butter. The best steak I've ever had. I highly highly recommend this one.
