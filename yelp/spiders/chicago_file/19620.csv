Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Every time a friend visits me, I take him or her to this Lou's. Deep-dish is on the heavy side for me and I almost never eat it on my own, but tasting the impressive mix of tomato sauce, sausage and cheese is a perfect treat every once in a while. The pizza here is not as thick as at Giordano's, which I think is a positive since for the latter, I get the impression that I'm eating a block of cheese with various toppings interspersed. Not that I'm opposed to such a meal, but my stomach will hate me shortly after paying the bill.
