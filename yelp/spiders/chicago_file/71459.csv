Little Goat Diner////My friend and I both ordered the burrito and our other friend got the hash. All were great and satisfying. But in the end, for the amount we dropped on this meal I feel like it all should have been more amazing. It almost pains me to say this because I am a HUGE fan of The Girl and the Goat. I guess I will stick to other brunch places and keep Izards original as a top fav dinner spot.
