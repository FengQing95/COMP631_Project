Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Definitely worth checking out... Only reason I chose 3 stars instead of 4 was bc of disappointment in our wait: we were told 30 min and it was actually 50 minutes. Â The menu is extensive with a few unique/creative items... And the pumpkin spice pancakes were heavenly! Wait service was good and you definitely get your money's worth (as long as you don't go there with any time restraints).
