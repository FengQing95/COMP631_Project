Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Oh my goodness. New York Pizza will never be the same ever again. Hands down, the best Pizza I have EVER had in my life. So good that I asked the waitress how it can be shipped to me in LA. I was here for a conference in Chicago for the weekend & was told to come here. I ordered "The Lou," which is a medley of tomato, spinach & mushrooms. The cheese is amazing (they use a combo of mozzarella & cheddar) along w/the butter crust. The crust is what sold me. I have never tried anything like that. My party also ordered calamari which was battered very lightly but did not lack in flavor. The marinara dipping sauce had a kick & balanced out the squid. I would come again & again & again.
