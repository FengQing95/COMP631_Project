Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza aside: They also used to have a great and refreshing spinach salad on their menu that has recently been taken off. Not too heavy (especially right before pizza) and hits the spot with spinach, Lou's house dressing, cheddar cheese, fresh mushrooms, salami bits (better then they sound), and tomatoes. They are however still able to make this salad upon request and I highly recommend it.
