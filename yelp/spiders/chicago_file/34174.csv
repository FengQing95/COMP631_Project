Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It was pretty crowded so we got seating downstairs on the couches/small tables. We were doing a bit of a pub crawl, and wanted some bites to go with our drinks. It was a sad moment when the bartender told us we couldn't order food on the "carpeted area". Basically, if you're sitting over a rug downstairs, you can't order food.
