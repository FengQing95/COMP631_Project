Art Institute of Chicago////Has a lot of famous art but not all of the famous art.  I saw the one with the old farmer guy holding a pitchfork and that one where people are drinking coffee in a diner.  I didn't see the one with the dogs playing poker or that Mona Lisa one, so I had to deduct a star until they add those ones to the collection.
