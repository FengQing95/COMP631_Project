Little Goat Diner////Maybe I was a little star struck by Stephanie Izzard working in the kitchen. I had an impulse to run to the counter and snap a pic. There was a family there w one of their big DSLR cams snapping picks of EVERYTHING. from the baristas to the books on sale. Â But I didn't want to be like all the other Asians snapping pics of their food and posting it on Facebook.
