Smoque BBQ////Be warned that Smoque is ALWAYS busy (understandable... great food) and there is often a wait (sometimes a line out the door!).  Service is good and quick, but I always feel rushed because there are always people waiting for tables.  I've never been asked to move, but I always feel eyed by staff members who want to clear the table for the next guest.  Again, this is understandable since they have a constant flow of customers, (and I do want to be considerate!) but like I said, I always feel rushed. I don't think I've ever stayed seated there for more than 20 minutes.  Also, since it's group seating, it is always very LOUD and you may be seated literally elbow to elbow with someone.
