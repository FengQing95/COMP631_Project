Smoque BBQ////Their chicken is really good! If you don't eat red meat, but are still looking for a filling lunch option, definitely stop by. I opted for their house salad with chicken added, house vinaigrette, and a side of cornbread. I was a little worried that I was going to get a weak salad since it's a spot known for bbq, not salads, but I was totally surprised. I got a huge salad with fresh romaine lettuce pieces, smoked chicken pieces, and 2 small containers of their vinaigrette (so glad they gave them on the side so I could add as much or as little as I wanted). Vinaigrette was delicious. Cornbread was a bit on the small side, but still filling. Also, get the fries. I tried some of my boyfriend's and they were bombbbbbbb. Perfectly crispy and seasoned. The atmosphere is really chill too. Some families, couples, people on their lunch break. A place where you know everyone is really welcome. Just know that they prefer to seat groups once everyone is present. We were waiting for one more person to join before we got a table but the host let us put in our order and pay first. I guess they get really busy. All in all, even if there is a wait - definitely go!
