Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was a lot more than what I expected and took most of it home. However, leftovers are not as good. This pizza is meant to be enjoyed while its hot in it's cast iron dish. Also, pizza taste so much better with a nice cold beer! This place surpassed my expectations. Next time I find myself in chicago this will be my first stop!!
