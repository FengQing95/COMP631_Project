Art Institute of Chicago////The cafe at the far end of the museum (downstairs) serves a decent variety of dishes, at typically somewhat inflated museum-prices.  But it saves you exiting and re-entering, so it is likely worth it just from a time-perspective.  We went there around 11:30 a.m. and by noon it appeared to be getting fairly crowded, so plan accordingly.
