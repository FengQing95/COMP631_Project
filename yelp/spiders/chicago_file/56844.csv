Smoque BBQ////First suggestion. Toss the chicken and sausage off the menu. It has no place at a barbecue joint. I remember ordering my first hot dog with ketchup in Chicago. No one told me different. Down South, they would be even less polite. "Did you say chicken, sir?" "If so, you have about 3O seconds to leave before my angry uncle put a brick bat upside your head and makes your eyes crossed." As for the sausage, sell 'em out of a hot water, hot dog stand. Common trash. Do the O'Mally's Â live with the Vanderbilt's?
