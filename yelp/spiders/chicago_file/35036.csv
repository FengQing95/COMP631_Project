Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The only reason why this place has three stars is because the bar tenders were pulling that "too cool to bar tend" attitude. They were standoffish trying to order wine and gave no help on suggestions for dessert. We order the Chocolate Mousse Pie and it was divine; perfect texture and bitter sweetness.
