Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The number one place in Chicago area. My girlfriend and I went there for our anniversary and they treated us very well. The steaks were outstanding but I would like to point out their bone marrow. It was delicious. You must try the bone marrow. It was difficult to make an reservation unless you do it way ahead of time.
