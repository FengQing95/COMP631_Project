Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's my first time in Chicago and I was really excited to have an authentic Chicago deep dish pizza. The concierge at my hotel recommended Lou's to me so I gave it a shot... now I'm sadly very disappointed. With tax, tip and delivery fees my large pizza was $40, but the flavor/quality was not good. It's heavy, bland and the crust itself was not very good. I don't even want to eat the rest of it, I'm just going to throw it away. This was a wasted experience. Also, for $40 I could have had a much better outing somewhere else.
