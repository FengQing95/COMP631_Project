Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Malnati's was my first exposure to Chicago style "pizza" and I really wanted to love it, but if fell kind of short for me. The flavors were ok, but nothing special. The feel felt very much like a chain to me and not a long time city institution which was a bit disappointing. Price was pretty high for pizza, but the slices are really hefty, so a medium should feed 4 pretty easily.
