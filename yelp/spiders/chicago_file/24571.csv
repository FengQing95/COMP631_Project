Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went expecting greatness but got mediocre. Malnati's salad was great, but the deep dish did nothing special for me. I've had better in Iowa City believe it or not. Not busy when we went, but it took the server about 12 minutes to greet us, then another 12 for beer. Only six or so tables sat at the time. Seemed like they are living on reputation and not trying that hard.
