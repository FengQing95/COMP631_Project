Art Institute of Chicago////It was frustrating when I had to throw away my bottle of water and bag of mixed nuts (which was unopened and costed $16!) because they did not accept food items at bag check. The reason I'm checking in my bag including food items is to keep the art exhibits clean! But oh well, the art museum made me waste food, it was not my choice. And no I was not about to down a bag of nuts.
