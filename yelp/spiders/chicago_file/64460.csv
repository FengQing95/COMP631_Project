Smoque BBQ////Luckily what Smoque does get right is their meats. The brisket is phenomenal, maybe even the best sliced brisket I've ever had. It was incredibly tender, almost feeling unnaturally soft as I poked my fork into it. The ribs probably appeal most to those that don't eat their barbecue with a preference. I'm no barbecue connoisseur, but cooking the meat with a dry rub seems to make the meat a little tougher than what I'm used to down in Southern California. It still packs in a lot of flavor, but I prefer my ribs a little more tender.
