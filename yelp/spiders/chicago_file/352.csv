Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////New location. The food here is much better than their suburban counterparts. I had the Mexicana, which was surprisingly full of flavor from start to finish. The pancakes are very good, they were light and fluffy with rich flavor. The coffee they use is Intelligentsia, so do not expect anything but a sterile coffee experience. Overall good experience and ambiance! Our server, Dustin, was very professional, fun and friendly. The menu is enormous for a breakfast place so I'll be back to try other dishes. The only negative is the lack of convenient parking. $5 an hour for the meters!
