Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our party of 6 arrived here at about 6:30pm on a Monday evening. We were seated within 10 minutes and the service was great. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive; although she forgot an iced tea and we were still charged for it (no, we didn't think it was worth getting grumpy about because she was otherwise very sweet and accommodating).
