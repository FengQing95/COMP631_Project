Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I made reservations two days before and the restaurant was incredibly accommodating when we arrived early. No wait or hassle even though it was fairly crowded. We arrived early and were seated in what seemed like a party room, or just an extension of the main dining hall. As I walked through the restaurant, I loved the atmosphere and decor. It actually reminded me a bit of Disney World. Authentic, but in a playful way. I don't mean that as a bad thing! When seated we quickly ordered a pitcher of the Black Raspberry Sangria. It arrived quickly and I have to say, pretty tasty! A little too fruity and I didn't think it fairly strong, but I wasn't ready to get loaded.
