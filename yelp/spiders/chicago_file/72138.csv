Little Goat Diner////We got our text exactly an hour and 15 minutes later (kudos for punctuality) but the Hosts/Reception not organized at all and we still waited another 20 minutes on arrival to be seated, with several false alarms ("your table's ready- oh wait no, sorry..."). Furthermore we waited all that time only to be set up by restrooms and coffee kitchenette. Grrrrr.
