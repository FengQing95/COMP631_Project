Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place! I always try something new every time and I haven't tried anything I didn't like so far. The restaurant is really cool inside and provides a nice setting for a romantic dinner or a fun dinner with friends. I'm a big fan of tapas restaurants and they are probably one of the best. Don't forget to try their desserts! Very yummy and only $2! Next thing on the menu to try: Paella!
