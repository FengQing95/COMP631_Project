The Purple Pig////The drink menu options alone can make you dizzy (in a good way), and the menu is set up for sharing with everything from cheese and charcuterie selections to chicken kabobs over smashed potatoes. So. Many. Choices!  Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious and beautifully displayed.  I highly recommend this spot whether you are a Chi-town native or taking in the windy city over a whirlwind weekend visit.
