Little Goat Diner////My friend ordered the Los Drowned sandwich which he polished off completely, and I had the Brandade and Belly. I really loved how the flavors and textures of the dish played off each other. I never would've thought brandade + biscuit + pork belly + kimchi would taste good together, but they do. There is a lot of acidity as well, so I didn't finish my food (but I wrapped it up for a snack later!). The brandade was super unique and I really liked the sunny side up eggs. The biscuits were a little dense for my taste, but then again I'm from NC, so.
