Little Goat Diner////Wow! Stephanie Izard has done it again! This diner is about a year old & it is getting rave reviews. It is always packed & people are willing to wait 1+ hour... In the cold! The nice thing is that you can go somewhere else while you wait. They will text you when your table is ready or you can wait at her bakery next door. That is great service!
