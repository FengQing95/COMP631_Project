Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I love this place!!! The shrimp cocktail and short rib stroganoff are must haves, and you must order both of those items when you are here. I've been here many times and my favorite place is the basement, it is secluded and cozy, and I never have problem finding seats when I dine around 10pm....
