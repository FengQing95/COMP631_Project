Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For two, we shared the prime bone-in dry-aged ribeye, broccoli, and mashed potatoes. Definitely more than we needed, but worth it. The ribeye was on point - prepared medium rare, delivering an almost buttery taste and texture. I didn't care for the bearnaise much; for me, the tanginess contrasted too much with the steak for me to enjoy a more unadulterated flavor of the steak. Meanwhile, I would say the foie gras terrine was a perfect complement to the steak, maintaining the rich meatiness theme of the steak.
