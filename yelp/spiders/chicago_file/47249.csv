Smoque BBQ////If you haven't been here, get going. I could eat nothing but the fries and slaw and be happy. Terrific salad for the vegetarian/vegan in the group. But the meats are to die for. And everyone who works here makes sure you have a great dining experience. Don't worry about crowds. Carlos or Al will make sure you get a seat. And BYOB is the icing on the cake. Saves SO much money.
