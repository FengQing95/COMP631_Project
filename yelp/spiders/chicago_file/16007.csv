Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We browsed the menu, placed an order for the Original Lou's deep dish (red sauce, tomatoes, garlic, mozzarella, Italian sausage) and began the wait (as deep dish is made fresh by the pie, it would take 20-40 minutes, we were told). We were happy to wait, and even happier when the pizza arrived to our table, in all it's glory, 25 minutes later.
