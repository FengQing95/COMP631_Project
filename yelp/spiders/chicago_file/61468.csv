Smoque BBQ////I recommend the brisket (chopped of course!!!), the pulled pork, and the STL ribs. I inevitably over-order every time I come in, but it would be a moral sin to leave this place hungry. The sides are pretty tasty (had the fries and mac and cheese this last time), but their meat is where they really shine.
