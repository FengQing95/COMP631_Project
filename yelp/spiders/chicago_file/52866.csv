Smoque BBQ////Not exactly an expert on bbq being from the east coast.  I actually never wanted to have it because the few times I went to random places they were gross.  I went to Smoque w a friend who raved about it and he was correct.  The food was excellent.  I've been back numerous times and the brisket and pulled pork are my favorites.
