Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Brunch and dinner are both amazing! For dinner, I'd recommend a sangria pitcher (so good!) and getting lots of tapas. I usually go with a group so we can try a little of everything! Their paella is sooo good but it's huge so I'd only recommend that with a big group, because you def wanna have room for tapas too!
