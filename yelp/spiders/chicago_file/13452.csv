Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is hands down the best Chicago deep dish pizza place out there. It's the perfect amount of cheese - not an overwhelming amount like so many other deep dish pizzas - and the stewed tomatoes on top are not your average tomato sauce. The crust has a wonderfully buttery flavor and is always nice and crisp on the bottom. Service is always great, too. Since it takes 30 minutes to cook the pizza, I recommend calling ahead with your order to get a nice head start.
