Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The GF and I came here at a not so busy time; after lunch, but no quite time for dinner.  We were seated in the back room with two other parties, despite plenty of room in the front.  Our server greeted us and took our drink orders.  We looked at the menu and decided on the spinach stuffed bread and the small pepperoni and mushroom deep dish pizza.  Our server told us the pizza would take 45 minutes to bake.  At first, I thought he was joking, but soon realized he was serious.  45 minutes for a pizza to cook is a bit excessive.  It is a really good way to get customers to order more food though.  By the time they finish eating all the appetizers and salads, they will be too full for the pizza.
