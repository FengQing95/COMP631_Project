Art Institute of Chicago////There are indeed different fees for the museum but we decided to use our CityPASS. See your options and prioritize which works well for you. If goes without saying that headphones are offered to follow along for tours and there are lockers for you to keep your belongings aside when you are walking through the arena. Everything was very organized. We were there on a rainy afternoon on a weekday and it was packed! I can understand why. I'd also recommend putting on comfortable shoes as you'll be walking a lot.
