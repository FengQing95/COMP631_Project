The Purple Pig////My partner and I went to and were blown away by the food quality as well as the service. For the snacks, we had the Whipped Feta and Pork Liver Bacon Pate. Then for the meat, we had Pork Ribs and Milk Braised Berkshire Pork Shoulder. This is, without a doubt, one of, if not the finest, meals we've ever had. They have the nicest staff, they are very helpful and welcoming. The interior is superb too. I was amazed at first sight. I can't say enough good things about this place! Such a pleasant and inviting atmosphere! This resto truly deserves a five star. Even though the price is a little bit pricey, it's still worth the money and effort to drive here. And next time, I will bring my friends here. Like, maybe I'll suggest this resto for our reunion next month.Â  Because they will definitely love this place for sure
