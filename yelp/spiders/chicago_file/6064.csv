The Purple Pig////Came here with several friends and had a great time! We ordered a bunch of plates and shared everything. Their menu is pretty much set up in a way for you to order and share a variety of their dishes instead of each getting individual entrees. The waiter was extremely helpful in giving us recommendations as well. It's a little on the pricey side but it's definitely worth the experience!
