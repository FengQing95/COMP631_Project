Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Ordered the filet mignon petite dutchess cut- soooo tender and cooked just right. They give you a mix of spices on the side with a creamy sauce as well, but honestly the steak is so flavorful already that you don't need it. Sister ordered the classic ribeye chicago cut and I liked hers so much we traded half way. Steak was very juicy and again cooked perfectly with no other sauces or spices needed. My mother ordered the chicken (I know who orders chicken at a steakhouse??), but surprised the roasted chicken was very tender and juicy.
