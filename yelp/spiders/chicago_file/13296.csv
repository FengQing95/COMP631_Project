Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////In 1983 I had my first taste of Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza and have trumpeted its superiority over competitors Giordano's and Gino's ever since. After this visit, my opinion has changed. The pizza was down right mediocre to bad. Maybe the kitchen staff had a bad night, I don't know. What I do know is that I had built this pizza up for my youngest daughter and then had to take her to Giordano's two days later in the attempt of giving her a better experience. I cannot put my finger on it, but the pizza just did not taste good. We had the old standby -- sausage and mushroom -- and the sauce was not very good, the sausage was scarce and did not have the best flavor and the crust was pretty bad ... rather cardboard-like and not the butter crust I yearned for. I had been to this location in the past year and had a good experience, so maybe they are trying to milk more profit by cheapening ingredients or something. The service was slow, but it was a Friday night and they were busy so that is understandable.  Whatever it was, it was bad and I am not likely to return.  Since I felt like my daughter did not get a good impression of the heralded Chicago pizza, I took her to Giordano's two nights later and the pizza was outstanding.
