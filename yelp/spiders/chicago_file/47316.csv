Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////But let's get to some food! Right off the bat, the bread with the jam: highly addictive. You have no idea. Pintxos, we just tried a couple of the waffle-battered chicken sticks, more or less passable. Let's get to some of the real dishes. Brunch paella, great, though it was a somewhat unpaella-like dish, not in a pan or anything. Waffles, sweet, and a nice contrast to the savory dishes around the table. Patatas bravas were a good rendition. The braise short-rib was flavorful and tender. Croquettes were fantastic. One of the main highlights was also the plato de la casa, with cured meats and tomato jam crostini. That tomato jam was fantastic! Incredibly tomato-y and was a big hit around the table.
