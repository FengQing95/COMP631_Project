Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ok now that I've been here at least 10 times in the last several months, I am officially updating my review to 5 stars.  My favorite dish by far is the spicy potatoes! :)  The sauce they serve with them is simply delicious.  Also a fan of the scallops and the stuffed mushrooms.
