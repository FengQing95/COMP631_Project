Smoque BBQ////About 2 weeks ago, 2 friends and I went to a BBQ joint in Chicago called Smoque. We were craving some meat especially some really good brisket. Smoque was on the show Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives about 7 years ago and has built a reputation for good BBQ around the Chicago area. And it so happened to be that when we were there, the Food Network was filming at Smoque again! They wouldn't tell us what show it was for though, but it was cool to see the Food Network there.
