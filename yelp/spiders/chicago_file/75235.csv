Little Goat Diner////So, the food here is delicious. We found this place from Yelp reviews and word of mouth. We went on a Sunday at prime time and were told it was a 40 minute wait- long story short- 50 minutes later, they seated people that came after us, before us. When we brought this to their attention, they seated us immediately, sent us their cinnamon bun, and comped our entire meal. THAT is what I call customer service. When you make a mistake (which was understandable but frustrating, you make up for it. Because of that, we would go back. The food was delicious. GET THE HASH BROWNS with cheese. Best hash browns I've ever had. The coffee is delicious too. Everything we had was amazing- but those hash browns.....get them!
