Little Goat Diner////Why do I keep giving Chef Izard's restaurants a chance? Each time has been a huge disappointment. Let me start this review by saying that I did not enjoy Girl and the Goat. The service was excellent but the food was SO salty that I couldn't finish even one dish. It's been about a year since that experience and I finally decided to give Little Goat a try. Luckily, a girlfriend was visiting me in Chicago and we were able to score a table with no wait.
