Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As an out of towner, this was my favorite deep dish in Chicago. I visited Chicago from Boston with practically the soul purpose of eating deep dish pizza. I was in pizza heaven at Lou Malnati's. I ordered the vegetable pizza. The crust was incredible & the stood out because they added cheddar cheese. This is definitely a place worth visiting.
