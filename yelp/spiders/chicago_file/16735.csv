Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Please DO not go here and crowd up the lines/wait even more. They're already insane, and you, you little pretentious freak you, you will not, and I repeat, WILL not, appreciate the gloriousness that is Lou Malnati's pizza. It's cheesy, it's deep dish, it's freaking fantastic- this is pizza at its freaking Midwestern finest- it takes a man's man and a woman of willpower to eat one of these.
