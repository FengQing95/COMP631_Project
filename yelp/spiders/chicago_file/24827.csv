Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza was great again but the time to get served is ridiculous! We even put our order in when we had a 45 min wait and we put in our order while we waited and we sat down expecting our meal to be ready since we waited 45 min and the pizza took 40 min to make. Only to find out that they only Do a half bake until you are seated and then they put back into finish. Only to find out that it took another 40 minutes to get the pizza. Needless to say if you decide to eat here plan on spending all night.
