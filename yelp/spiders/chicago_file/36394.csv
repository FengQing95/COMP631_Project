Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place has been on my list for quite some time now..the wait was definitely worth it. The food was soooo good! I was a little worried at first because we didn't have reservations..but I called ahead and made sure if it would be ok and it was. We went on a Sunday around 5 (when they open) and they seated us right away even though they were already fully booked. The staff was great - very kind and helpful. Our waiter was awesome as well. He came and checked up on us often even though he had several other tables. The atmosphere is very quiet and romantic. The two of us shared the dry aged rib eye, elote, and spinach. So freaking good....I'm already craving more. Next time I go I'm definitely making reservations to sit more towards the middle so we can enjoy the setting along with the food.
