Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I can't complain about the pizza.  It was definitely really good.  The service was reasonably attentive-- especially given how busy they were-- and they seemed to have a lot of personnel (taking orders, directing guests, cleaning tables, etc) The mozzarella sticks were your usual faire but the marinara was very good.  I think what was troublesome/irksome was just how overrun they were.
