Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Anyways, I'll mention the reasons they did deserve 4 stars.. the food and ambiance.  For hor d'oeuvres, I loved the peppered duck and goat cheese terrine with apricot mustard, yum! Oysters were some of the best I've had in Chicago. Steak was perfectly done, with flavorful wild mushrooms. I was not crazy about the bone marrow, but I'm sure it was good for being what it was.  I wanted to try it, but it just tasted like chunky fat to me.
