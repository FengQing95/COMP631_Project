Smoque BBQ////Really good brisket, pulled pork, smoked sausage, and sides. The ribs were just OK but not great. Corn bread and baked mac and cheese are excellent. This place reminded me of a fast food franchise style BBQ spot, with everything pre-made like a KFC or Mcdonalds. Not my first choice when looking for great BBQ. A little pricey all things considered.
