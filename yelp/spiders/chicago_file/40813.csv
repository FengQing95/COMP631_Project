Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Very decent tapas (we ordered 8-10 and I can't remember for the life of me what we actually ordered), however it wasn't anything compared to what we had in Barcelona. Although we did not order paea, the smell from a neighboring table was overbearing with unfresh seafood and it sort of grossed us out. Our tapas filled us up, though, and were quite delicious. We sat outside on a perfect summer night, perfect!
