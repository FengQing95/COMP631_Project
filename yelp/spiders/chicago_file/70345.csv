Little Goat Diner////- MACHOS NACHOS (corn tortillas cooked to flippin' perfection, bbq pork, beans, pickled peppers, cheddar, sour cream, avocado): will RUIN all other nachos for you.  They're so, SO good... and HUGE!  Not sure why they're under the snack section b/c these have served as a meal and then some for me multiple times.
