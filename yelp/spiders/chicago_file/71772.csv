Little Goat Diner////Horrible house wine. The "spaghetti" breakfast contains literally four  spaghetti strings and a few runny eggs. The egg whites were raw. Some cheese, four clams and some shredded crab. The only flavor was eggs and cheese.  The seafood was completely overwhelmed by the cheese and egg flavor. If I didn't see the clam n crab I would have thought I'm eating a cheese omelet. $15.
