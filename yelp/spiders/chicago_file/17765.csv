Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When asking for recommendations of good deep dish in Chicago, this name came up more than a few times!  They were right!  We only had time for 2 places, so we tried the 2 big ones.  Lou's was the best.  The portions are perfect, the price is right, and everything tasted soooo good!!  Our server was a lot of fun too!  I just learned i can order them for shipping, because pizza hasn't been the same since!
