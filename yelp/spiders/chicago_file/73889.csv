Little Goat Diner////On the way out, I grabbed a loaf of bacon & gouda bread from the bakery side, to take back to Indy. Â It smelled delicious and made the MegaBus trip back home a little bit more enjoyable, as I opened the loaf bag for intermittent whiffs of bacon and fresh-baked bread all the way down I-65.
