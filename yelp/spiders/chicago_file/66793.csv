Little Goat Diner////Extremely popular, so get a reservation. We had a late reservation on a Thursday night, and the place was still packed. My husband loved his pork-belly scallion pancake and highly recommends it. I ordered the bahn mi goat burger, and it was disappointing. (Our waitress brought me a Korean burger by mistake first, but that was quickly corrected, so despite the mistake, I give the service high marks.) The burger itself was really bland, which is unlike bahn mi take offs I've had elsewhere. It might have just been the goat meat, but I also expected more kick from the cabbage slaw. The smoked fries were exceptional. Overall, considering the hype and the cost, I was disappointed.
