Smoque BBQ////Finally made it to Smoque today. BBQ joint on Pulaski 2 blocks south of Irving. It is touted as best BBQ in Chicago. Chicago, yes? Outside of Chicago? Passable. Ribs= very good. Not par boiled and slathered with sauce. Decent smoke and rub ONLY!!!! Thank goodness. Don't ruin good meat. Sauce on the side. Pulled pork= Above average. Brisket= Chicago has real problems smoking brisket. I bet they shortcut the time. No smoke ring (dead giveaway), tender, semi juicy but not the smoked flavor I like. I can tell it is a fraud when I got out of my car and had to go to the address for the place and didn't follow my nose. Even upon entering I did not experience olfactory heaven. It was more like limbo. Sorry. Stay with the Italian Beef, Vienna dogs, and Gibson's steaks. Smitty's and Salt Lick do not have to worry about competition from the Nawtheners..... JohnnyChitown needs to throw his hat into the ring.
