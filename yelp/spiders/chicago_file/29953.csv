Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is my second time in Chicago and Lou Malnati's is a must! It's always busy but they'll text you when your table is ready so you can go next door and have a few drinks to pass time. You also order your pizza once you get there so they'll start cooking it even before you're seated (deep dishes take 45 min).
