Smoque BBQ////Service was great and everyone working there was attentive. It seemed like they had so many employees there working at once, which is a good thing because it was impossible not to have someone helping you if you needed it. I thought that the prices were pretty high for the portions you get. Fair warning, I think that portions for the brisket and the mac and cheese are especially small.
