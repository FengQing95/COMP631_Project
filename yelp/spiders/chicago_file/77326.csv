Little Goat Diner////Fabulous breakfast/brunch spot. Unique offerings that shine a light on foreign flavors. I was able to try a variety of dishes on the menu. The crumpets were to die for, and the ooey gooey cinnamon bun is a must order. The parathas burrito was one of my favorite breakfast dishes. Great atmosphere, drinks, and service.
