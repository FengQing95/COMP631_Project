Smoque BBQ////My favorite places for BBQ in the city. Their brisket is my favorite! The owner is also very nice and generous. My first trip there, my mom and I got food to go. I forgot to order my tasting of their ribs and he over heard us talking and almost getting back in a line that was out the door and instead, told them to add one to our order and didn't charge us. My mom insisted and he simply replied "no, I know you'll be back another time and will get me back then. It's on the house today". Needless to say, I have been back. Multiple times. Great place to go in the summer with friends and sit outside to eat.
