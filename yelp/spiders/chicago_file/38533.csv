Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I took my husband here for his 40th bday. I had to make reservations about 6 weeks out to get a table on a Friday night. Our amazing server Ben took great care of us and we really enjoyed our experience! We enjoyed the salmon cake, Mac and cheese, dry aged steak, stuffed crab avocado and the Royal Sundae. With two drinks our bill came to around 200 dollars but the service was impeccable and top notch from everyone. We definitely will be back :)
