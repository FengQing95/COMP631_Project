Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was a busy Saturday night, but I was fortunate to be a solo party and was given a small booth immediately.  I tried the appetizer combo (great fried cheddar balls).  I ordered the "Lou" which had no meat and added Sausage.  The pizza was exactly what I was expecting...perfectly Chicago style (that is coming from a California guy of course).
