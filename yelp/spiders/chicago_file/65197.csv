Smoque BBQ////This is the best BBQ in the Chicagoland area! I am born and raised here and this is the real deal!! We first found out about Smoque on Diners Dive-ins and Dives! Thank you DDD! Keep in mind that everyone BBQ is subject to taste!  Is one kind better then another, you decide! I personally like the chopped brisket with the Carolina style sauce! Not a huge fan of the slaw.  I like the "taste" size option to try different things! Save room for the Pecan bread pudding! Yum!!  The ribs are dry rubbed and you add the sauce.  They are ok, in my opinion! Enjoy!
