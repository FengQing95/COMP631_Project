Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our favorite dishes (just about everything we ordered) included the shrimp with garlic (#1), spicy potatoes, bacon wrapped dates, beef tenderloin with blue cheese and goat cheese with marinara. We also had the chicken empanada which was pretty good, the sauce on the side was great. We had a small serving of the chicken/pork/artichoke paella and could have done without it, it basically acted as a filler dish. I would have loved to try a dessert but could barely move after everything else! Really fantastic dinner and dining experience in general.
