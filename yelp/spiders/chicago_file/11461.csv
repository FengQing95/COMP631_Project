Art Institute of Chicago////We love being members of the Art Institute, going multiple times a year to see special exhibits and just to explore art we haven't seen before. Â Not really possible to see it all in a day or even in a few days. Sadly, right now, it is closed due to the situation with Covid-19 in our state and city.
