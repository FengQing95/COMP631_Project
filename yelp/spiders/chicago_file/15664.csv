Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The ambience does nothing for me since I don't much care about sports and the TVs can be distracting to me but the pizza is fantastic. Â I grew up in the city but went to college in Boston and my mother used to send me Lou's pizza packed in dry ice (shipping their pizzas in the continental US is a service they offer) and it was great when I missed home.
