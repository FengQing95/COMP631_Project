Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was visiting Chicago this weekend and had never tried Chicago-style deep dish pizza. A lot of locals recommend Lou Malnati's to us. I, unfortunately, wasn't too impressed with the pizza. We ordered the The Malnati Chicago Classic. We thought the ingredients themselves were fresh and tasted good, but I'm not sure that I'm a fan of deep dish pizza itself.
