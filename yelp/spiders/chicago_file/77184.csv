Little Goat Diner////I love that making reservations here is super easy and doesn't require months notice in advance or hawking opentable. Breakfast is legit, prices are super affordable, staff is nice, outdoor seating is nice. I have historically always gotten the corned beef hash and invited more adventurous friends to join so I can pick off their plates. Never a mistake, everything that comes out of their kitchen is delish.
