Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Their cocktail menu is also quite impressive. A few dark & stormy cocktails for the bday boy and I loved my lillet rose martini. I followed up the martini with a lovely glass of white wine that unfortunately ended up all over my coat thanks to the busboy refilling my glass. It was a complete accident, but the manager still went out of his way to help me clean off my jacket and insisted that we send him our dry cleaning bill. And he even sent an extra dessert for the birthday boy. So we ended up "celebrating" with whiskey ice cream sundae and an extremely rich and chocolately surprise. It was so good that I didn't even think to ask for the name.
