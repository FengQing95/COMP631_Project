Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is A-MAZING! Had dinner here with my good friend Oscar last night, and we really went over-the-top. I let him do the ordering, and boy did he order some tasty dishes! I definitely rate it a notch better than Cafe Iberico and notches better than Emilio's, because of their variety of fusion dishes, cava sangria, and the ambiance was much nicer (better lighting too).
