Art Institute of Chicago////I love this museum, but it's grossly out of reach financially for the average person. $35+ for fast pass and they never even told me there were no lines + another $7 for the special exhibits. I could have paid $10 less as a result, but even in NYC most of the museums are a suggested donation.
