Little Goat Diner////We came in for Lunch on a beautiful Sunday afternoon and luckily the wait was short. The menu has lots of option and everything sounds amazing but I think we were all in the mood for burgers. Its your standard diner fares but taken to a couple of notches up. It combines flavors that you might not have thought would ever be together but they worked so well. We were in the mood for burgers. Our order was: Patty Melts, Goat Almighty, a special and an order of fried pickle and onions.
