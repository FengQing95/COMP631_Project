Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is a must if you are in downtown Chicago!  We got the bruschetta to start, which was fresh and delicious.  For the pizza we devoured the Malnati's Chicago Classic (best sausage pizza I have ever eaten).  To top it off we had the cookie dessert.  Between the five of us it was gone within minutes.  Awesome service (Matt) was just an added bonus!
