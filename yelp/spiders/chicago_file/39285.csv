Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For the main course I ordered a medium rare plus 22 oz 42 day dry aged bone in ribeye with a side of truffle mac n cheese and bacon on top. I want to preface by saying this was arguably the best steak I've ever had. The steak was absolutely perfect! From the edge of the steak, through the middle, and to the bone, there was not one part of the meat that looked or tasted any different than the other. Every slice had a beautiful pink color. The Â meat was very tender as my knife cut through the meat with ease. Each bite was juicy, buttery, and bursting with flavor. The marble to meat ratio was just right and the fat melted in my mouth. I really loved the nutty flavor brought about by the aging process. I ate the steak with such delight and satisfaction that I didn't even bother with the bearnaise sauce or leave 1 oz of meat on my plate.
