Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////GOOD. VERY GOOD. This place was everything everyone made it out to be. So many recommended us to try Lou Malnati's since we were in search of deep dish pizza and I'm so glad we listened. They give you indoor and outdoor seating options and even have frozen pizza for those looking to travel home with a Chicago pizza. I'd say everything about this place is what everyone talks it up to be. A must try!
