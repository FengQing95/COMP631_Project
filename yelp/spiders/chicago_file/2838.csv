The Purple Pig////For me, though, the reason to go is the remarkable wine list, with hundreds of selections, all from countries bordering the Mediterranean. Nearly every selection is available by the glass, demi, half or full bottle, and they'll even open a bottle of any of the wines priced under $50 (which is nearly all of them) and pour you just half. So it's a great place to explore varieties and appellations you've never heard of.
