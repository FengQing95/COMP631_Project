Little Goat Diner////Very good food, but expect to wait for a table, especially at peak times.  We had hoped for sitting on the rooftop, but it was closed for a private party.  We had fish tostadas (my husband loved the hot sauce they brought out on his request), and I had the Elvis bacon/peanut butter/banana waffles which were also very tasty.  We did sit outside on the street, which I think may have made the service a little slow (especially filling up waters and iced tea on a warm day, but the service was also pretty good.
