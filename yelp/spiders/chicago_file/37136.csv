Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The service was great until our waitress forgot about us.  We asked her twice for refills on our drinks, which never came.  BF went up to the bar to ask for refills and they were brought by someone else.  Otherwise, we had no complaints about the service.  Our water glasses were never empty and our food was served pretty quickly.
