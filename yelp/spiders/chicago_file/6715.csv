The Purple Pig////Oh my Lord, where do I EVEN START with this restaurant. If I could give it 6/5 stars I would. Ambience, service, variety, presentation, and TASTE above all - this place does it best across all categories. Haven't been to all restaurants in Chicago obviously, but this is the one to beat.
