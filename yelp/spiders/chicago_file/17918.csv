Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The deep dish pizza is great! There's not too much sauce or too much cheese. The crust is nice and buttery with a soft inside and crisp outer shell. The only downside, and this is definitely a first world problem, is that it takes 35 minutes to cook. I think I'd get the thin butter crust next time though if I had to decide. I only got the deep dish because I was in Chicago. The thin butter crust was awesome and toppings had so much flavor; recommend the crumbled sausage. Also, get the clam chowder, maybe this is because I am from the south.. but they clam chowder (called something else) was so freaking good I had to get another bowl.
