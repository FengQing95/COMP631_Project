Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I would go to try deep dish pizza each time I visit Chicago. But this time, unfortunately, I decided to try this one based on the recommendation of Yelp. After waiting for a long 40 minutes, my pizza is finally served. This is acceptable since I have been notified about this and I know that is how long baking a deep dish pizza should take. However, with the long waiting, I expect a hot and stringy pizza on the table, which is not the case at all when I visited this restaurant. I can't see why I spent this long time to get this COLD pizza. Anyway, since the bad experience in this restaurant, I will never visit it again.
