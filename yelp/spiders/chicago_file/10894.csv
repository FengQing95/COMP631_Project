Art Institute of Chicago////I took a road trip from Atlanta, GA to indulge in the actual Van Gogh pieces. It was exciting to see other works of well-known artists displayed here. Turns out, admission was required separate from the regular admission to access the Van Gogh exhibit. Thankfully, coat check-in was inexpensive (One thing that wasn't expensive in Chicago).
