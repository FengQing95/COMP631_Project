Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I chose to take my boyfriend here for a romantic evening. It also happened to be one of his milestone birthdays! They were so accommodating, allowed me to bring in my own cake and wine, can you believe it is BYOB! They also do this cool thing where you have to share one glass of the bottle you bring in with another table of your choosing. The food was delicious and the decor and ambiance was spot on for a long romantic evening. We dined in the lounge downstairs where it was quiet enough to vibe out to the music as well as to hear one another. He definitely enjoyed and we will be back!
