Smoque BBQ////In the midst of my hand-cleaning OCD, my order number was called!  Immediately, I was impressed by the portion size.  The sandwich is served on a thick wheat bun and there's a more-than-generous amount of pork and sauce awaiting your lips.  Add to that a BROWN PAPER BAG full of fries, container of extra sauce and tub of slaw (with vinegar, not mayo; I hate mayo) and I was ready to dig in.  Remembering my Southern upbringing, I took a bite of my sandwich without adding sauce.  Yum!  Tender, seasoned pork and just the right amount of sauce made for a flavor explosion in my mouth.  Remembering my gluttonous ways, I dumped the rest of the sauce on the sandwich and sopped up any extra that ran off with the bread.  That's how we get down in the dirty dirty.
