Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////8/20/06: went back last night, I think this was my fourth visit, and although the service was great and we had a wonderful time, the tapas don't come close to Emilio's in Hillside or Meson Sabilka in Naperville.  Last night I found them to be salty and greasy, and they don't have a plain-old, delicious, roasted vegetable tapas.  We landed here because we wanted a place that would accept a reservation, otherwise we would have gone for Iberico.  Also, I barely felt a thing after nearly a half-pitcher of sangria - if you met me at the Dine event, or have been on the receiving end of the Ellen M drunk-dial, you know what a lightweight I am.
