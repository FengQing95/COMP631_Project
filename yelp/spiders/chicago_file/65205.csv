Smoque BBQ////The baby back ribs were dry rubbed and I did not enjoy it as much as Pappy's in St. Louis or Phil's in San Diego, CA. But my friend, who is an expert in ribs and he loves dry rubbed, loved the ribs here. The meat is good but the meat didn't fall off as easily and not as tender. You do get to dip into different sauces that are available and each one has a subtle difference.
