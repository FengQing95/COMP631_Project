Little Goat Diner////Came here for brunch, and it was amazing. I had a spicy bloody mary, hash browns, the broccoli, and the breakfast burrito thing on naan. The hash browns weren't super special, but tasted good. The "not Chinese broccoli" was amazing. The burrito was SO GOOD too-- it wasn't like a breakfast burrito at all-- it was like a yummy salad on naan. I'll definitely come back. Good vegetarian options.
