Little Goat Diner////I had the Corned Beef Hash (ZOMG) and my wife had the special veg omelette of the day (ZOMG X TWO) and our friends tried the waffles with chicken (chicken for breakfast?? - hell yeah!) and some sort of benedict. I can't remember. Doesn't matter we sampled each other's plates and NOM NOM NOMMED it all. OH! The apple-spice pancakes. In the words of Rachel Ray, *raspy voice* YUMMO!
