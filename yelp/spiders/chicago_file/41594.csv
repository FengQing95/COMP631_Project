Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////i LOVE cafe babareba - especially the delicious paella! the sangria is great too, with seasonal flavors. the only thing i don't like is the immensely, ridiculously, long wait time! i sat there with my friend for two hours waiting for a table. reservation is definitely recommended, but there is still about a half hour wait with reservation.
