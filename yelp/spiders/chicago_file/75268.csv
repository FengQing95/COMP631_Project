Little Goat Diner////I wanted an iced coffee drink and the Thailander looked interesting on the menu. Sadly, I can only say it was ehh and probably a bit too experimental for my tastes. The chile flavor is quite prominent on the after taste and just didn't work for me. Overall though, the food is amazing and would love to come back sometime to try more of Little Goat's delicious offerings.
