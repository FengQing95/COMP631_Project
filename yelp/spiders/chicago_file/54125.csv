Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here on a Friday night. We sat at the bar and it took a bit for the bartender to notice us. We ordered the planxa apps which were delicious! The octopus was great. It was in a red sauce. My fianc√© thought it was a bit soggy but I enjoyed it! Since we both checked in we got the free dessert- chocolate fudge and cheesecake. It was the perfect size. They also have happy hour after 10pm which was awesome!
