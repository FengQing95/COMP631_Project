Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A group of friends and I went to brunch here and had a great experience. There were six of us and I think we ordered 12 to 14 tapas and each of us left very full. The food was amazing! I can't even specifically recommend anything because everything was fabulous. We ordered both types of waffles, French toast, potatoes, Mac n cheese, shrimp n grits, and some chicken n waffle skew like thing. So tasty. The service was awesome as well. For the amount of food we got, the price was right on point also.
