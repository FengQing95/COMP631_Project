Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The chorizo skewer had a very crispy texture, slightly sweet, and the cheese ended the whole bite very creamy and yummy! The piquillo pepper was very tasty--that shredded rib was like a mini-pot-roast-good. The padron pepper with cheese was also very good, nice and creamy with a shot of heat.
