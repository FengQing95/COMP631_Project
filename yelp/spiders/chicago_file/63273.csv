Smoque BBQ////We had lunch here on Saturday. I had the sliced brisket, it was delicious! Tender and juicy with an excellent flavor. My husband had the 1/2 chicken and told me it was fantastic!! Â I was deciding between the chopped or sliced brisket and Carlos, the host who sat us recommended the sliced. Boy am I glad I listened to him. The baked beans are soo good and so is the coleslaw. Can't wait to go back.
