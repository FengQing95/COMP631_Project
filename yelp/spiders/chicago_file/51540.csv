Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Perfect place to go the tapas are amazing and fun way to try some things you might not order normally.  Sangria pitcher is not only a good deal it is delicious.  Only thing is I wish they would bring back the old seafood paella with the monk fish and clams.  The new one with the fermented mussels has a weird after taste.
