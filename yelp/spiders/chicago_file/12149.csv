Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute should be ashamed of themselves for how they treated the volunteer docents  by firing them from giving tours and sharing their knowledge with visitors.  It is age discrimination plain and simple! Retired people have time to volunteer, while younger people have to work in hopes they can retire some day.  They will never see a dime from me again!  I've written to the Bank of America and Chase CEO's encouraging them not to give a dime to the Art Institute.   Anybody else we can complain too?
