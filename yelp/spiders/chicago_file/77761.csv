Little Goat Diner////got seated pretty quickly which i was very happy about since I made a reservation beforehand. We ordered the Kimchi Burger, Los Drowned, and Mac n cheese. First of all the Kimchi Burger.........there are no words to explain how good this burger was. It was definitely top 3. It was bursting with flavor so hats off to the chef! The los drowned was good and the meat is very tender but when i compared it to the burger i was looking for a little more flavor. The mac n cheese lacked flavor as well and we sent that back. Overall, would definitely come back for that bomb ass burger.
