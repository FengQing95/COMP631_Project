Little Goat Diner////Overall, Little Goat kind of confused me. Their food was pretty good and unique (see details below), but seemed a little overpriced for diner food. Servers were inattentive, as some others have said (waited about 10-15 minutes for coffee refills/drinks, eventually had to flag a random server aggressively). Would probably check this place out again, but not necessarily at the top of my list of recurring spots.
