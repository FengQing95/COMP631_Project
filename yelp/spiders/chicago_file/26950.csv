Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pie comes so steamy hot that it almost looks dangerous to eat.  The sauce is piled high on top of the multiplicity of cheeses underneath the mile high other toppings.  One piece is really a full meal.  My group ordered appetizers to start and I thought this might be a bad idea, as I remember how filling these Chicago pizzas can be.  But, alas...hungry people with BIG eyes.
