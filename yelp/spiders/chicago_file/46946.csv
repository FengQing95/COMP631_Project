Smoque BBQ////Wait: My husband and I arrived here at 7 pm on 7/2/10 and there was already a wait out the door. It was gorgeous out (yep, this was late summer when we went) so we didn't mind the wait. It took a 40 minute wait before we ordered! We were seated by the host after ordering and after a few minutes received our food.
