Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We split the apple and endive salad to start - light and very tasty.  My friend also 3 oysters (you can order as few as three and they still bring out the whole iced plate presentation like you were getting a dozen), which she loved.  We all ordered beef entrees - steak frites, duchess steak, and meatloaf.  Loved them all.  Steak came cooked perfectly and the meatloaf was a winner.  We were stuffed but still finished with the goldbrick dessert with whiskey ice cream (with a candle for our birthday girl) - simple but fantastic.
