Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place had really good pizza and wings. The thing that really turned me off was the wait we had for our pizza and the attitude of both the waiter and the manager when we complained. If the waiter had told us there would be a long wait, then it would have been fine. Instead he avoided our table and failed to inform us that our pizza would take 45+ min to make. We waited over an hour and saw other patrons come and go while we waited for our food without an update from our waiter. When I spoke to the manager and told them that we just got off of a long train ride (28hrs) and had been waiting over an hour for our food with no type of communication from our waiter, he didn't seem at all bothered. Besides the poor service, the food was really good. We ordered wings, and they were pretty large and tasty. We got chicken sausage on our pizza and that tasted pretty amazing as well. Good food but poor service.
