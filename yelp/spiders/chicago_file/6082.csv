The Purple Pig////Best meal I've had in Chicago. I've never been to a restaurant with over 7K reviews and felt accomplished snagging a reservation for lunch. As the main suggests, the focus is pork so maybe don't drag your husband there like I did if he doesn't eat pork... but there is still plenty on the menu for those individuals to choose from. We shared a mushroom stuffed pasta topped with truffle and it was scrumptious. I had the pork belly recommended to me by our waitress and it was the best I've ever had. Usually when I order pork belly it's the size of a bird dropping and crunchy. This was perfectly cooked sous vid and complemented by a side salad of carrots and green with a sweet pur√©e. For dessert, we shared a bread pudding and it was excellent. We were able to remove the orange peel from top as we're not fans. I can't wait to return to try more from the menu. Overall very reasonably priced for large portions and great service!
