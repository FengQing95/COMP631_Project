Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The food was absolutely delicious. I am not a huge fan of deep dish pizza but this one is fantastic. It isn't as heavy as other deep dish places so you can eat more than one piece without feeling engorged. We got the "Lou's" pizza and my daughter could not get enough of the sausage. It was fresh, tasty and unlike anything I had ever had on pizza before. Definitely skip the other pizza joints and come straight here. You won't be disappointed.
