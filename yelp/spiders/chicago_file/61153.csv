Smoque BBQ////I can't comment on the service or surroundings (thanks, hubby!) but their brisket was some of the best I've ever had, as was the pulled pork. Both were incredibly moist with just the right amount of smoke. Delicious. The sides were not anything too special (mac n cheese, corn bread), but not bad. Everything was packaged really well though, and I'd certainly return over and over for that brisket. Yum!
