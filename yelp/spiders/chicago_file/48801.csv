Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Anyways, I just went here for brunch with friends over the weekend and was pleasantly surprised! I had no idea what to expect for a tapas-styled brunch, but it was everything I could ask for and more. We were a large group of 8 so we got nearly every brunch tapa offered AND the breakfast paella.
