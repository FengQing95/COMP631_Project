Smoque BBQ////Brisket - nice bark, but even when I requested fatty PLEASEplease fatty, what we got was very much on the lean side.  So, sadly not marbled fatty - or fat layer fatty, and so not flavorful enough for me.  This brisket is the reason I tried their sauces - which is not a positive thing to say.  Pass.
