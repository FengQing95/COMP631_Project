Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place was okay for a large group for a bday party. Our server was very nice and accommodating. Should describe the portion size better though because we ended up ordering way too much based on the recommendations. The food wasn't to die for. quality wasn't that good. Shrimp seemed as if they were frozen not fresh, and very small. Known for their paella but was definitely not impressed with it. Not crispy and slightly soggy. Even the presentation at table side wasn't very entertaining. He just kind of dumped it into a plate and left it. Didn't describe which was which or anything. Sangria was the best thing there. Most likely won't come again.
