Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My favorite pie is the Lou - who knew - for as much as I like meat, the vegetarian pizza won my heart. However, I eat the Malnati's Chicago Classic just as often - the sausage, the extra cheese, the tomato sauce on the buttery crust is one of the best Chicago style pizza in town.
