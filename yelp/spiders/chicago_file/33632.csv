Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I made a reservation on OpenTable for 6 people on a Tuesday night. This is the first time one of those needed a credit card, which I provided. Fine. A couple of hours beforehand, we needed to add one more person - this was a business dinner. I called and, in a nutshell, they said no. I understand this is inconvenient for them, but in thousands of trips to restaurants worldwide, I have never had one deny such a request.
