Little Goat Diner////First the macho nachos looked tempting. One thing I was disappointed about was their beans aren't vegetarian. Miss... The nachos without beans were quite generously topped with all sorts of goodies. Really a huge portion and I think that ruined my appetite. Lastly, I wanted to mention that the chips they use aren't the types I like. They were like the oily thick types.
