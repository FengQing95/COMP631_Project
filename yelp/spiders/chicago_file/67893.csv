Little Goat Diner////Went there on a saturday afternoon. Waited a bit, not a big problem. Ordered a great mocha while waiting. Got Â sat, service was pretty good once he made it to our table. Based on everything I read/heard I expected something more. Yes, I know food, taste etc is subjective but the food I had (BBQ Pork Sammie) was barely good even by diner standards. And for the price and low quality food, I wouldnt go back. Lesson learned. Note as you go in, menu is all a-la-carte.
