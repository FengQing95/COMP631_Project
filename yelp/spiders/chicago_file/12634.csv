Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Soooo much cheese. I rate this place down because of the wait, we had to stand there for 2 hours! May be it was the mood I was in after all that waiting that made me think the pizza was just OK. I mean, I've had better and the crust was too doughy. I would come back though but probably after trying other "famous" spots for deep dish.
