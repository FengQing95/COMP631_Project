Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is not just the Best Deep Dish Pizza but the Best Pizza Period. And that is coming from a New Yorker. I had been to Chicago countless times and I had gone to Giordano's, Gino's East and the rest, but it wasn't until I walked into Lou's on North Wells that I had found my Pizza Mecca. Now I cannot go to Chicago without stopping by and enjoying a pie and I am obligated to bring home a half baked, dare I risk the wrath of my family.
