Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There was a lot of hype about this place and unfortunately, the restaurant didn't live up to it. The hostess said the wait for a table would be 45 minutes so we ordered take out instead. A table cleared up 15 minutes later and sat open for an hour while we waited for our takeout pizzas. AN HOUR. The crust on the pizza was greasy. The sauce had no flavor and the sausage was bland. We were disappointed but I'd be willing to give the place a second chance to see if we showed up on a bad day.
