The Purple Pig////The crispy pig ear was a little overly salty. I've eaten so much pig ear this past month....thai style and chinese style; it was interesting to see a mediterranean take on it. My favorite part of this dish was honestly the crispy kale underneath. The pickled banana peppers were TOO salty and took away from the balance of flavors. The milk braised berkshire shoulder was cooked well; I really have no complaints about it except I can probably make it at home. The chicken thigh kebab had a great tzatziki sauce that I couldn't get enough of, otherwise the kebab itself was quite uninspired.
