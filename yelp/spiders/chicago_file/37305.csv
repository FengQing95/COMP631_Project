Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our waiter was super friendly and helpful. My friend got a Cotes du Rhone, and I got a Kir Royale (my first ever and not my last!). After we ordered our entrees, they came out in almost a break-neck speed. I think it's because we were there on the early side. My medium filet was perfectly cooked and flavorful. My friend's short rib stroganoff was indulgent and comforting, as that dish should be. And the side of peppered, thick-cut bacon? It didn't hurt. ;)
