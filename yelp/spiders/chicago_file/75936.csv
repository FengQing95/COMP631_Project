Little Goat Diner////The two dishes we ordered: This Little Piggy Went to China and Bull's Eye French Toast - are both tantalizing and unique! The Little Piggy is an asian fusion dish with biscuits and asian style sauce; while the French toast is like a typical fresh toast dipped in syrup until we discovered running egg yolk in the 'eye' of the toast. This place is good for a brunch hangout, but I would recommend booking ahead to avoid the long wait!
