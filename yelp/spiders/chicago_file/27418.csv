Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were seated comfortably near the front of the restaurant and bar.  The three of us shared a medium deep dish, with pepperoni and jalapeño.  I think deep dish needs a sausage with some dimension to fill it out, so maybe we will try that next time.  We also had a salad, which to be honest, it didn't seem like Lou cared much for his salad.  It was out of a bag, with barely any dressing on it. Is it serviceable as a side? Barely.  We downed all this with a pitcher a Revolution Anti-Hero IPA.
