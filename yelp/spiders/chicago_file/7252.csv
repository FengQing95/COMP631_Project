Art Institute of Chicago////Before our trip we were interested in checking out the Oriental Institute but it was rather far away from where we were staying by the Magnificent Mile so we chose the Art Institute, and I'm so glad we did! The Impression, Fashion and Modernity exhibition was amazing and wonderfully done. The Institute is a beautiful building itself and the staircase entrance was breathtaking. I've been to the Louvre three years ago, but our visit then was rather rushed at the time and I don't think I fully got to appreciate some of the works there. Here I got a second chance to look at  works by the legendary Van Gogh, Monet, Manet, Cézanne, and Toulouse-Lautrec, among many others! I also enjoyed the Asian and Ancient exhibitions. It's kind of mind blowing when you see beautifully restored ceramic pots and teacups that look like they might belong in your grandmother's kitchen cupboard, only to realize they're hundreds of years old. Seeing works from Ancient Greece, Egypt and China is always amazing. I was less a fan of the contemporary art exhibits, sometimes you look at a piece and think to yourself "I could do that". but art is art I guess. Hole-poked pieces of paper and single solid colored painted canvases aren't really my thing though. It was also very cool seeing American Gothic and A Sunday Afternoon by Seurat in the flesh, as I had no idea they was housed at the Institute.
