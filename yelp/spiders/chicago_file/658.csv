Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Was in Chicago for 5 days; ate at Wildberry 4 of those days! The banana bread french toast is to die for! You can order a short stack of french toast and still be satisfied. Excellent hash benny; fig and walnut pancakes a little too sweet for me (dried figs and candied walnuts). Only waited on weekday mornings(!) - but infinitely worth the wait!
