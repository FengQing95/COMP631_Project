Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Impressive! My go to steak house. The service is the best around. Food is always so so good. Try the fried chicken it melts in your mouth! The filet is perfect everytime. Absolute best wedge salad. I can't say enough good things about this place. End the night perfect with salted Caramel ice cream. You won't be disappointed!
