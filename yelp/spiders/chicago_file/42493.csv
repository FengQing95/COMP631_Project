Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Yummm!! When you're ordering so many dishes as you do when at a tapas bar - you would think at least statistically 25% of the dishes mightn't meet your expectations. I must say Ba-Ba-Reeba just got everything as perfect as possible. All of their dips and sauces are just amazing and flavorful. We ordered stuffed mushrooms, skewers of chicken and Chorizo, shrimp in garlic sauce and many more. Everything was delightful! Don't miss the Sangria here!!
