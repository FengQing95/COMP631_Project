Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Nestled in the heart of Chicago, this place keeps themselves very busy even on weeknights. We visited this place and had a 40 minute wait on a Tuesday night. However, they let you place your pizza order right away because the pizza will take about 40 minutes to cook. Folks, well worth the wait. The pizza was amazing. We had the standard pepperoni and sausage deep dish with butter crust. The sausage was like a layer of sausage, like a pancake. Very flavorful through and through. We ordered some drinks to go with it. No I would not recommend them. They tasted fine, but had no strength in them. But we did not come here for the drinks so I don't take anything away from them for that.
