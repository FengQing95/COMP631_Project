Little Goat Diner////After lunch at Au Cheval, we stopped by here for a Double Espresso w/ Goat Milk; first time adding Goat Milk to coffee and man, it sure is tasty! It has a richer taste and a faint but lingering aftertaste, all Coffee Shops should have goat milk as an option in addition to soy and 2%. With the coffee, we also purchased a canister of the spice seasoning and coffee beans to bring home. There are jams too but we were not checking in luggage (we live in California) so next time. On the second time (next day) we purchased the double espresso again (less Goaty this time, but still good) and their beer bread (which was yeasty and springy in texture). Â The double espresso is a drink we can have every day.
