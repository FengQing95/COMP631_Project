Smoque BBQ////If only Yelp had half stars...I'd probably go 3.5. A couple years ago, this was a hands down 5 for me. And clearly about everyone in Chicago too. Upon revisiting this weekend and the expansion of other BBQ places in the Chicago burbs, I'm not as in love anymore. That said it's a solid BBQ joint and packed from open to close it seems so perhaps I'm the only one that feels this way.
