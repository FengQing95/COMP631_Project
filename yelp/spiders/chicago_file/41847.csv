Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First time I went here, my spanish friend took me here. I was very impressed really felt like spain in chicago. Everything we tried was excellent, service was great as well.   Decor very catchy and unique. The management even bought us dessert certainly 5/5 phenomenal. Second time I returned the "wow factor" was gone or maybe just not present. We were seated awkwardly, then too much food came out all at once, barely saw the server and food was just so so. I don't know whether it was a changed in management  or service but something seemed lacking from my previous visit. At any rate do recommend this place, however I have discovered some spanish restaurants in the suburbs thus won't be be coming to this restaurant soon because of the distance and similar selection to closer spanish restaurants in my vicinity. I heard they have made some changes though, so maybe if I'm in the area and feel tapas might try it once more.
