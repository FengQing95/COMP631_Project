Little Goat Diner////Very much admire the fact that this hipster diner has some unusual combinations and ingredients. Â Unfortunately, nothing (except for the pork toffee milkshake) was any good - the cocktails were poorly balanced; all fried elements to the food were soggy; the pork belly pancake had mediocre meat and a rancid taste to the pancake, and two of our party suffered gastric distress through the night.
