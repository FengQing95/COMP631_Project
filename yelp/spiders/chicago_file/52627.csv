Smoque BBQ////Well let me just start off by saying I am not a huge Barbque fan in any way in fact I rarley have it. If anyone is in the mood for BBQ though I don't hesitate to tell people about this place and how good their food is. I usually only get the pulled pork and beef brisket dish. That is the best dish here IMO. Plus get the side of real corn bread yum yum. I had their ribs before bother styles and they were OK. Tried the chicken but it was a little dry
