Smoque BBQ////Other foods that aren't ribs: after bringing the food home (1 St. Louis full slab with coleslaw, Mac n cheese, and beans) we were dying to dig in. The Mac n cheese was pretty standard but the crunchy top killed it. Don't even get me started on the coleslaw, completely reminded me of my UIUC days at Joes Burgers. The slaw was delicious and not overbearing. The beans were extraordinarily tasty (I wish I had more!!!) and now for the main course review.
