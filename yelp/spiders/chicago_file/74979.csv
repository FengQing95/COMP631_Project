Little Goat Diner////We had a reservation on a Saturday night, but we still had to wait about ten minutes once we arrived. We were seated in a giant booth, which I must say I loved because it's so nice to have enough space and not feel cramped when eating out. We ordered a couple beers and a glass of wine. I couldn't decide if I wanted to order breakfast or dinner and decided to go for dinner. We asked for some recommendations on the food and our server did not disappoint. We tried the Reuben, party melt with a goat patty and the Korean burger with a goat patty. We also ordered a side of mac and cheese. Â Everything tasted good, but I think the prices are a little high for what you get. I did like the atmosphere a lot. I think on my next visit I will definitely go for the breakfast portion of the menu.
