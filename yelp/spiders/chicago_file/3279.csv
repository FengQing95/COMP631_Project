The Purple Pig////5) I decided it was best to ask for my check. All three items were on the tab. I wasn't expecting anything for free, but typically restaurants don't charge when you let the waitstaff know you were not satisfied with it. I will concede and say that after I gave my credit card, the final tab only showed two items so it was very likely an oversight that he caught when closing my tab. HOWEVER... he also informed me that he "accidentally ran my card for another couples tab so I might see an additional $160.00 on my card which he will void out with his manager" ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!! So my Saturday night consisted of a meager glass of wine and a bowl of soup all for the bargain price of $200.00?? I left very frustrated and asked for the General Manager's card. I already sent an email but I feel it's important for the Yelp population to see this too. Not at all what I expected from a place with such high popularity ratings!
