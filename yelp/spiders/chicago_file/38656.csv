Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We grabbed cocktails in the intimate basement bar while we waited for our table. They have a lot of fancy cocktails on their menu and the bartender was very helpful in picking out just the right drinks for each of our palettes. The drinks were fabulous and she even served my second over ice because I'm not a fan of cocktails straight up. The wait flew by and we were ushered upstairs to our table.
