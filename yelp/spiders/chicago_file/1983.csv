Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Excellent! But the 2 times I was there on my trip, the wait was crazy, hour + 45. Lucky for me I was staying at a hotel a few blocks away. And my hotel is a timeshare, so I had a kitchen, and a view of the river. I enjoyed my Napa omlette, wildberry pancakes and hash browns (for a snack much later) with a view. And I was full all day!
