Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came here around 7PM for dinner. I read reviews ahead of time so I knew there would be a wait. If you are interested in getting a reservation I would suggestion doing so days or weeks in advance because when I tried a day in advance they were already booked for the weekend.
