Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////8:30pm on a Monday night and the line for a table was "30 to 40 minutes" worth of waiting. Knowing Chicago deep dish takes about 45 minutes to make, I quickly ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic and patiently waited for my friends to arrive. The Lou's on Wells is a popular tourist spot and there were some English folks enjoying their pizza and a large group of tourists with cameras more advanced than mine. Crowded and family-friendly, there were several strollers rolling around the place. TVs in the background televised the Dallas-Oklahoma City matchup while some tables around were slicing into their pies.
