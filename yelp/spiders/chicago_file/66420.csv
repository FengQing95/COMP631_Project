Little Goat Diner////I went with very high hopes as they have a "Marzocco" espresso machine (basically, it cannot get any better than that). Unfortunately, the cortado was served in cardboard cup although I was sitting at the bar. I asked for the coffee to be poured in proper cup and the staff accommodate this but the cup was cold and they used the previous shot instead of a new one. Some attention must be put as these are the basics for pouring a decent coffee (especially if you have such a great machine). On the bright side, the micro foam was nearly perfect and the place itself really cool.
