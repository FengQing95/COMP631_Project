Smoque BBQ////Yum!!  We have ate at Smoque twice and love it there!!!  The food is great.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was fabulous.  I had to share it because the portions are big.  I also liked the Mac and cheese.  My husband and sons favorite thing on the menu is Texas Sausage.  My other son had the ribs and recommends them also.
