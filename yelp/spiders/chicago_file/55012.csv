Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service was one of the lows of my experience here. Maybe it was because we were sitting near the back of the bar, but I'd still expect better service given that when we arrived, the place was relatively empty. We had to hail the bartender several times to get his attention to order more food, and often it felt like he was ignoring us. The wait times on our orders were decent, so no major complaints there. One of us checked in on yelp to claim the free dessert, and not the initial bill, but the bill that was handed to us to sign, had that dessert on the bill (charged to us). We noticed the bill discrepancy, and it was only after we asked our bartender that he changed this for us.
