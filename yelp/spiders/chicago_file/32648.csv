Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////this place is quickly becoming my favorite spot. even though i am not a huge meat person. their steak are something to die for. when we first discovered it awhile back, we went twice in the same week for their steak. it is heavy and not good for cholesterol so i reserve it only for special occasions.
