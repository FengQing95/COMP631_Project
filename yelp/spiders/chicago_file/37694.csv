Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We shared the wedge salad (the thick cut bacon is phenomenal). For our entrees I had the shortrib stroganoff (superb) and my husband chose the Classic Ribeye.  I've had dozens of ribeyes in my life, and I can honestly say this was the most tender and flavorful that I've ever experienced.  My husband felt the same.  We shared the corn elote as a side because they don't have such things in our hometown.  I really liked the flavor but my husband was not as impressed.
