Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As I've said time and time again I am not a "steakhouse" fan, it's just not my meal of choice, but I'd go back to Bavette's for a good dinner or just for drinks any time.  If you want a steakhouse that isn't the stereotypical décor and menu then you need to check out Bavette's.  You'll love it.
