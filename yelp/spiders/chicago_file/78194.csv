Little Goat Diner////I ordered This Little Piggy Went To China, the sunny side eggs were good but the pork sausage was a little on the salty side. I recommend adding hot sauce to dampen the saltiness. My boyfriend had Okonomiyaki, he said it was really good! I tried it and I agree, it was good! I would recommend that dish. Both of our food portions were good, it wasn't too big and it was just nice for us.
