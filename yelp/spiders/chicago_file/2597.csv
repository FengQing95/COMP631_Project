The Purple Pig////Before visiting Chicago, I asked 3 unacquainted Â friends for restaurant suggestions, and The Purple Pig was unanimously recommended. Despite the high expectations, the food totally blew me away. I visited at about 4pm on Saturday, and the place was already (still?) packed. We were lucky enough to get seats at a long table right by the entrance, but the location did lead to some awkward and uncomfortable bumping as people entered and exited the restaurant.
