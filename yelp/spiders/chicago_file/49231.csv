Smoque BBQ////Smoque BBQ DOES GLUTEN FREE!  I've had such a craving for BBQ and having Celiac makes it very difficult to find Gluten free places.  While looking on the internet i came across Smoque.  So of course the first thing to do was call and speak to a manager and ask about cross contamination issues! Al was great, he assured me all of their meats and sauce are gluten free and they have a gluten free dedicated fryer for the fries! WHOO HOO so hard to find gluten free fries!  We went in there Saturday afternoon, I spoke to Al again (the manager) and he assured me my meal would be prepared with special care....the fries were amazing and the ribs and sauce were really good too!  Give it a try my fellow Celicas....just be sure to let them know of your issue before you order! Thanks Smoque for the special care!
