Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Amazing place, took my boyfriend here for his birthday and is just a fun place my best friends and I go to grab sangria. The wait is always long but it's totally worth it, you can always usually catch a spot at the bar to drink or if you're comfortable you can even eat there. Spicy potatoes are a MUST!
