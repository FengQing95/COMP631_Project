Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What a waste of a Sunday....My wife and I came here because of all the hype on Yelp about this place, I'm not even gonna make this a long one. We walked in and the host asks us the usual and tells us we will receive a text to be seated and directs us to the bar to wait in the most aloof manner. The drinks were alright but nothing to write home about, at least I had the time to work up a light hunger buzz to heighten the experience to come. Finally I get the text and we are seated at the coldest table I've ever experienced in my entire life, they might as well have put our table in the meat cooler. I mentioned it to the waitress that sported a very well trained and rehearsed tone with which she assured us she would take care of it and "ask them to turn it down", yeah ok like each table has individual temperature settings, never mind changing tables, whatever. We ordered what we thought was appropriate coming from reviews and their most popular items, and let me tell you they are not my kind of popular. Out of everything we ordered the potatoes and the bread (house bread, which came 30 min into the meal) are what really stood out. The Paella Valenciana was bland, super al-dente, the meat had a very unpleasant spice to it and did not live up to the hype period. I left it almost intact and so did my wife. The rest: mushrooms, dates/bacon, calamari don't even deserve a description. The waitress never picked up on the most obvious of unsatisfactory cues like an untouched plate btw. Or maybe she knew what we were going through and didn't want to pour salt on the wound. Anyway we overpaid and left with that ugh! feeling that couldn't be satisfied with anything other than going back in time and finding another place. I WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE AGAIN! Not even if there were a zombie apocalypse and I knew the doors were open, I would rather be eaten alive.
