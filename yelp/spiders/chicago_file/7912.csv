Art Institute of Chicago////My point of references for Art Museums are the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim, and the Museum of Modern Art. So when I think about art, I think of those places first.  Let me tell you, the Art Institute of Chicago is pretty amazing, especially considering its location within its location.  The only drawback I can say is that its pretty spread out and difficult to navigate.  My favorite part though-- the food court.  It was surprisingly good.
