Little Goat Diner////My sister and I went to dinner here on Saturday 9/7. We thought there might be a wait, but when we got there around 7:00 we were seated right away, in a booth near the kitchen. I had looked at the menu previously, but wasn't sure what to order. We each ordered cocktails, mine had cucumber in it and it was slightly sweet and refreshing. The waitress told us about the specials and right away, I was sold on the blue plate special - pork tenderloin with a bacon tamarind sauce and vegetables. My sister ordered the chick pea salad. Both were fantastic. My pork was cooked perfectly, served over home fries, brussel sprouts, caramelized onions and apples, all mixed together, with the bacon tamarind sauce. I'm not that familiar with tamarind, but everything worked so well together. I had to make sure my sister was okay with me eating so much of her salad as well. The vinaigrette was so delicious, I couldn't stop reaching over the table to steal more. It was a huge salad, with kale, radicchio, and lots of other veggies, with several large chick pea fritters. And of course, we had to share the Cheez-it sundae for dessert. Strawberry ice cream plus peanut butter drizzle plus chocolate-covered Cheez-its sound very strange, but everything worked so well together. It was the perfect blend of salty and sweet and such an interesting and new dessert combination. I definitely will be back here!
