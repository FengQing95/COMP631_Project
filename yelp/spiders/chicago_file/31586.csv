Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It would be a crime to not consume deep dish pizza when one's in Chicago. Lou Malnati's was HIGHLY recommended to me, so I took my family there around Christmas holiday. It was an hour before their closing time, so I called ahead to place the order for pick up. It took ~45 minutes as the hostess instructed.
