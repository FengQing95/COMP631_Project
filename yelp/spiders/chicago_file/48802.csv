Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For one, the paella was amazing!! It was essentially everything you love about brunch meets fried rice. Does it get any better than that? Aside from the paella, I really enjoyed the brunch tapas we selected. Honestly I think I enjoyed this so much because every time I get brunch I go through the painstakingly hard decision between sweet and savory--and with tapas I got both.
