Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I absolutely loved the filet mignon. It was cooked to perfection - a nice savory crust with a tender juicy medium rare center. Wow I was just so amazed. I got the bone marrow to go with it and it was so rich and complemented the steak so well. Every bite was truly melt in your mouth.
