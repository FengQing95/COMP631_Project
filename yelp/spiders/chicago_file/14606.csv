Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The other family's pizza came out to us, of course, which we immediately alerted the server of. It was offered to us, but it looked disgusting and had extra cheese, which is just not necessary on a deep dish pie. Not surprisingly, based on the service that night, this server who brought our pizza was not the server who took our order. Had it been our original waitress, this whole situation could have easily been avoided. Once we called our original waitress over, she was very flustered at the situation and brought over her manager.
