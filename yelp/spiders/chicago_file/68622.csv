Little Goat Diner////Fantastic little joint in the West Loop. Obviously, when you're the diner of one of the best restaurants in Chicago (Girl and the Goat) everyone knows it will be amazing but I figured I'd put in my two cents. I've dined here for lunch and dinner and have also came for a late night drink and every time was phenomenal. The menu for lunch and dinner was 100 percent on point. Â You cannot go wrong with the Los Drowned and Sloppy Goat, but whatever you decide I recommend to split with someone you're with because you want to try as many things as possible. The side bar late night is awesome too. It's not too crowded on weekdays and the bartenders were real cool. Can't wait to go back!
