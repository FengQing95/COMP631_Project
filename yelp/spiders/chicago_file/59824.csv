Smoque BBQ////This place claimed to have "Southern-style bbq," and being a Southerner, I thought "I'll be the judge." Well, let me tell you....this is Smack-yo-mama bbq. It is wonderful! As soon as I walked in the door the first time, I thought to myself, "This smells like home." Usually, bbq is reserved for cookouts, and July 4th-like holidays. But this place makes it completely accessible all the time. The classic pulled pork sandwich is what I got, and my friend got the brisket. Both...UH-MA-ZING! And their slaw is SO good. I mean...SOOOOO good.
