Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The Cesar Salad was topped with flaked brown trout, which was a substitute for white fish, which they were out of.  Why you would want any fish other than anchovies in a Cesar is beyond me and the result was mushy fish in salad.  The entrée was another experience.  We had the petit filet and steak frites.  The steaks were good cuts, but mine came with what I think was supposed to be béarnaise because that would be obvious and it had tarragon or something else green in it, but it tasted like lemony, so maybe it was hollandaise, not sure. The frites with the steak were so salty and could not be eaten. We are not complainers, but we did tell Eric about the salt to tell the chef and he credited $7 to our tab. That wasn't necessary, but appreciated.
