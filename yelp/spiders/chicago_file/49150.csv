Smoque BBQ////I went here Sunday to grab food to go for a birthday party.  First the smoked chicken is amazing! And the peach cobbler...O.M.G.  Also the staff there was so friendly! I called like an hour and thirty minutes before I was going to pick up and from the lady on the phone to the staff at the counter and a man on staff even offered to carry my bag to my car! Such a nice guy.  The food was a hit and I will definitely be returning!! Thank you Smoque!
