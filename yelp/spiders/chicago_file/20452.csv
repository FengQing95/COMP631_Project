Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As first-time Chicago tourists, we had to try Lou Malnati's for some deep dish! We waited for more than 2 hours for a table for two on a Friday night but thanks to the good natured staff and other guests - we had a good time making friends and drinking at the bar while we waited.
