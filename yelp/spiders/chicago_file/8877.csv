Art Institute of Chicago////This is an incredible art museum and a must-see for Chicago visitors and residents alike. It's a huge museum with a large variety of exhibits. Due to the size and variety, most art lovers could be happy spending a whole day wandering through their favorite exhibits. Â They do rotate their exhibits, so an old favorite might not be on display, or might be somewhere else if you come back again and are looking for it. In fact, my husband really wanted to see Nighthawks, but it was on loan to another museum.
