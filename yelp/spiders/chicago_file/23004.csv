Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So if you ask me, I'm a ny style pizza fan or better yet a Detroit style pizza fan.  But sometimes a good deep dish is what you crave.  I'm a fan of the giordano's but I don't think it's fair to compare he two.  They are two distinct styles of deep dish.  I do like the buttery crust at Lou's.
