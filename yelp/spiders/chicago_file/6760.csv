Art Institute of Chicago////I love you so much AIC especially for having free days. I've yet to come back to visit the modern wing, since it was under construction last time I went. I hear it's fabulous. And I never get tired of your photography exhibits, or your impressionist, cubist, romantic, and realist wings, or the miniature rooms. Can't wait to get back!
