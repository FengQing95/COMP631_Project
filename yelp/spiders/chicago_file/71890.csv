Little Goat Diner////... but the food, I'm wavering between ok and good. The menu offers a certain familiarity with a bit of twist. I applaud the risk of mixing diner food with the unexpected. Whether it is slivered bits of pickled peppers and spicy kimchee, indian parantha and of course, integration of goat meat or cheese or milk in your coffee, there it is. Different.
