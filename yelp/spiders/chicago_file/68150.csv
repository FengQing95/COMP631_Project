Little Goat Diner////We asked the waitress if she could take a look, and that's when our dining experience started to take a turn.  She told us she wasn't sure if that's how it should look, but it was probably ok.  My sister decided to ask to have it cooked more, and after that, our service at Little Goat got pretty bad.  We saw our waitress one more time (when she brought our bill), and she would walk by our table and try to not look at us. For fifteen minutes.  Another waitress brought the reheated plate of food (it took 15 minutes), and put it down, sarcastically saying, "here's your WELL DONE French toast..."
