Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We arrived here on a Wednesday night around 7:30 pm and the place was buzzing. I really liked the vibe of the place. There's a small patio out front, a bar area, and a long dining area. There definitely were a lot of choices on the menu to choose from. Our waiter's recommendations were all on our list of what we wanted to order.
