Smoque BBQ////I ordered the brisket platter, which came with two sides.  The brisket is perfectly cooked with a little bit of charring.  It was melt in my mouth good.  The portion was huge and I though I would have left over, but nope all gone.  My first side was Mac n Cheese.  All I'm going to say is this is the BEST Mac n Cheese this man has ever had.  I would marry this stuff if it would have me.  The baked beans didn't stand a chance against the cheesy goodness.  The Mac was crusted on the top and once you broke through the top it was pure cheese bliss.  I bought a large to take home with me it's that good.   The beans had little bits of brisket in them and were tasty.
