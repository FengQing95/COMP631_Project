Little Goat Diner////Breakfast was delicious, host was super friendly, and our server was as well. I ordered the little piggy went to China and it was very unique and tasty. I hated the kimchi Bloody Mary, which is weird because I usually love both kimchi and Bloody Marys, but I'm gonna chock that up as it just wasn't my taste. One disappointment I had was that the mimosas came in a regular cup, as opposed to a wine glass, but overall great breakfast and I would go back. Prices were also a bit high but I suppose for Chicago this is the norm maybe (I was from out of town).
