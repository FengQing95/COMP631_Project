Art Institute of Chicago////$18 to get into the Art Institute. Good thing I'm a Chicago resident and can get that $3 discount! I've now been to the museum 3 times within the past month. Yes, visitors to Chicago it is that good. I just wish I had thought about becoming a member of the museum..oh say a month ago!
