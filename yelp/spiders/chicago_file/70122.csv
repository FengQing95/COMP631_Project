Little Goat Diner////Sloppy Goat: Essentially just ground goat with loads of salt, bun was dry and tasteless despite the fact that they have their own bakery in house. Also the bread to meat ratio was off. Lots of bread, not enough meat on each bite. Ultimately even when taken apart neither element was edible.
