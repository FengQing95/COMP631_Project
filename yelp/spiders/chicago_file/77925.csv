Little Goat Diner////One of my absolute favorite places to eat while in Chicago. This is my second time and I want to go back every time I visit. First time I had breakfast so this time I wanted to have lunch. I had the Fat Club sandwich...soooo yummy! I love the atmosphere and comfy seating-it's a large dinging area but definitely fills up on weekends. Everything I or my friends have tried has been delicious. I noticed they Â ask if there are any food restrictions or allergies and that they use organic sugar on the tables. Little details that I notice and appreciate. Love love love. Can't wait to go back!
