Little Goat Diner////If I had to describe my experience here with one word... it would be gluttony.  Between my boyfriend and I, we ordered four dishes and practically licked our plates clean.  We had the Los Drowned sandwich, the Parathas Burrito, tempura mashed potatoes and goat chili cheese fries. I had to practically roll myself out of here!
