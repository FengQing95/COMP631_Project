Little Goat Diner////Yo this place is THE SPOT. Little goat but it's a big deal. Let me start off by saying, from the retro seating, tabletop finishes to the stainless steel trim and the cognac booths; it highlights and serves as a model for the traditional diner experience. The kitchen, you'd think it's no shave November or Manuary but NO, these men are like lumberjacks, true specimens of chivalry and brawn, hell I'll take a meal from a guy that could wrestle a bear with his beard any day. The service is sweet, punctual, and phenomenal with recommendations. It's fire, quit wasting your time and come get this bread. They serve other things aside from bread. Catch me if you can. -A
