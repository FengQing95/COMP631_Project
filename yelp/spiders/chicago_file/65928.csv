Smoque BBQ////Wow. This place is by far the best bbq I've ever eaten. I have yet to try Texas bbq but coming from LA, this place is so heavenly. The line was short on a Tuesday during lunch so it moved pretty quickly. After ordering, they pretty much seat you at a table. My cousin&I shared the sliced brisket plate with 2 sides so we got bbq beans, mac n cheese&she tried their cornbread.
