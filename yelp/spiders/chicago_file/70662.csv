Little Goat Diner////Waiter: Ok, we can handle that. Make sure you stay away from the items that are starred on the menu. They either contain soy sauce or are fried in a shared frier. Also, we clean all the knives and utensils used for your food before we start cooking. Also, the fries are made in their own frier, but it is next to the regular frier so while we try to keep them separate, it is up to you if you are comfortable eating them.
