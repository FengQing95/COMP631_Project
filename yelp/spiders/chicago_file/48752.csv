Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is awesome! We over did it the first time,but we were able to try out a good amount of food. They have a nice wine selection, we also had the sangria. We ordered a variety of tapas and the paella as well. The paella is really delicious, the seafood is fresh and plentiful with bits of charred pieces of rice.
