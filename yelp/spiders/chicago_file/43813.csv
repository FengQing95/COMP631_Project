Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////After about 15-20 min of standing around 3 bar stools opened up and we acted like vultures and snatched those up right away. So now we had a place to sit while we waited for our table...only an hour and a half to go! While sitting there we realized we could order from the menu and just eat at the bar. We liked that idea since we were starving by this point.
