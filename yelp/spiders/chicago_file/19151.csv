Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My Chicago friends swear by Lou Malnati's as THE place for deep dish pizza in the Windy City. We ended up at the original Wells location for tradition's sake, but the quality of food is equally good at all the locations. Â Expect a wait... this place is not a hidden gem but a popular destination experience for locals and tourists alike. But there's a bar and a good local beer (Goose Island 312) so relax.
