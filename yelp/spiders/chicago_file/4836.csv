The Purple Pig////Oh my gosh sums it up pretty well. I traveled for work for years, so I've become a bit of a food snob over time. This place is amazing, and definitely one of the best meals I've ever had in Chicago. It is SO busy though, so come during an off time. We showed up around 4:00 p.m. on a Saturday and our wait was less than 5 minutes. By 5:00, the wait was somewhere between 30 - 60 minutes. If you're waiting, it's a bit awkward hanging out outside (weather permitting) or in the back hallway, but the food is so worth it.
