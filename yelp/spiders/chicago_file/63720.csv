Smoque BBQ////Not bad at all. We had the brisket & pulled pork. The brisket was super tender & juicy. The pork had a bit of crispy skin mixed in, which I love. You get both a Carolina sauce (thin & vinegar based) and a Memphis sauce (thick & bold) with your order. Memphis for the win, hands down. Our orders came with two sides. I had the mac & cheese and the brisket chili. The Mac & cheese was the star of the meal. Pass on the chili. Overall, it's worth the trip.
