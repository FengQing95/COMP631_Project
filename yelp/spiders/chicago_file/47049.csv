Smoque BBQ////My husband and went after seeing Smoque on Check Please twice.  The firs time was on a Sunday and the line outside was a block long.  So we went from 3800 North to 149th Pulaski to Hog Wild.  We decided to compare after one of my friends insisted I try because she had her party catered by Smoque.  Well, we were disappointed and decided we will stick with Hog Wild. I guess it is all a matter of taste.
