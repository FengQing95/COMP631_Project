Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was the first time I ever had Chicago style pizza. I'm in love. It was so good and there was so much food. We ordered the small which should serve 1-2 people. We also got the bruschetta because we were nervous that a small wouldn't be enough. The bruschetta was amazing and I'm so glad we got it, but we definitely didn't need too. We could only handle a half of the small after having the bruschetta. The pizza, we got the classic, was amazing.
