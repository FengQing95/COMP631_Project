Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here from a recommendation from a person I asked on the street because I was in search for some authentic Chicago deep dish pizza. I wanted to see what was so great about this pizza! The place was pretty packed for a Tuesday night. We had to wait about 35 mins for our table. We finally got seated and ordered our food.
