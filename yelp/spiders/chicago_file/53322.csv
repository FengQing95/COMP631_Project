Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Mom and I ordered tapas.  Bacon wrapped dates were delicious as always.  We had the ham hash with an egg, it was ok, just a little too sweet for me.  Now, the waffle with carmelized bananas was so good, my mom absolutely loved it.  The mac n' cheese w/ bacon was not very cheesy, we basically just ate the tasty bacon from it.  the last and also delicious item we had was spinach and artichoke crepe.  It was really flavorful and something I had never tried before.
