Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We have been to this restaurant a few times in the past. Of course, due to covid, things have changed. They require a $200 deposit prior to coming in. They charge a 4% "covid fee" which in our case was $22. $22 for what? For our waiter to wear a cloth mask and disposable gloves?
