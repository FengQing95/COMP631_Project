Smoque BBQ////I love this place. Its almost like being in the soup nazi  line the way you place your order then move quickly out of the way . The food is absolutely delicious. Pork smoked then smothered in wonderful sauce. It fulfills every excited taste bud . I enjoy the bun less meal, this makes tummy room to indulge in the sides. Each time I try something new. Amazing Great food plus  its fun to bring your own beer. Bringing your own beer just adds to the fun. Makes it seem like you're  a teen sneaking a drink. One of my favorite stops. If you go when the line is out the door don't despair it moves quickly. Well worth the wait.
