Smoque BBQ////I have eaten at and carried out from the N Pulaski location.  Delicious! Fast Service! Dine in or carry out!  We love the pulled pork and beef brisket; the ribs are also over the top, yummy.  We rarely eat dessert, and always enjoy Smoque's peach cobbler. The only thing I want is a small green dinner salad instead of the cole slaw.
