Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I ordered a filet mignon, juicy and perfectly cooked, and a glass of pinot noir. They have a BYOB policy with a cork fee. However, if you a share a glass of wine with another table, the cork fee is waived. Someone was kind enough to send one my way (which is how I found out about it)!
