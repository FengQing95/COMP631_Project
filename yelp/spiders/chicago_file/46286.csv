Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I wish I lived down the street from here.  I would eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner at this place.  This was my first visit here.  Place is huge, lot of people during the weekend, wait was about 30-45 minutes.  At first, I thought it was unusual for valet service to take money in the beginning and ask for $12 when the sign said $8?
