Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Hands down the best pizza I've ever had!  I saw the yelp reviews online and had to try it on my first night in Chicago.   We sat down and our server immediately let us know that the pizza takes at least 35 minutes to cook.  We ordered the malnati salad while we waited for our malnati chicago pizza.
