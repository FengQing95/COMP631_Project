Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is by far one of the best tapas places in Chicago! Located in the vibrant Lincoln Park area, it is only a short walk from the CTA brown line. Although parking can be hard to come by depending on how busy the time of the day is, you might get lucky scoring street parking on one of the side streets.
