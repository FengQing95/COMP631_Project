Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My past experience with deep dish pizza has been a ton of crust topped with a little meat and cheese.  Lou Malnati's squashed that notion.  I ordered the classic pizza with light sauce.  The crust was thin and crispy topped with a thick layer of cheese (1/4 to 1/2 inch), a solid layer of sausage, and great tasting sauce.  Only downside was the hour and 15 minute wait.
