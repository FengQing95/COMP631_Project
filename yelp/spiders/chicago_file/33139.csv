Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had been told by many people that the$56 Dry aged bone in ribeye was the best steak they ever had, so my party of 3 went to Bavette's. We started with the crab cake (a little spicy, I've had better), then Crab Stuffed Avocado salad (very good), $56 steak (it was good, but expected it to melt in my mouth and it did not. A little chewy. I've had better @ David Burke's), baked sweet potato (very good), and mashed potatoes (no thanks). Next dessert...Chicago style Cheesecake (absolutely awful) and whiskey ice cream (very good). We each only had one alcoholic drink and 2 cokes. Loved the decor/atmosphere. But for $370, I expected a whole lot better :( Especially because we've been to 2 of the owners other restaurants that were really great. So tonight I was very disappointed :(
