Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Another good visit to Lou's! The lunch special is a great deal. 6 inch personal pizza, salad and drink for under $10. Lunch was super busy. We got seated at a table that was basically in the waiting room. Not very private. The server was new too. But once again the food was wonderful! My pizza came out before the salads because we pre-ordered so that is a warning.
