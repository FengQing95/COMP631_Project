Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For something so basic, the meatloaf was absolutely delicious. If you're thinking about ordering the filet mignon, I recommend going for the bone-in. We ordered it medium rare, and it was perfect. My boyfriend, being quite the steak snob, was very impressed. As always the pommes frites at Hogsalt establishments never disappoint. The mac and cheese was very rich, but delicious. I would pass on the baked potato simply because it's... a baked potato. We were just curious what a $10 baked potato was like. It was more huge than anything. I would also recommend getting the brussell sprouts to get in your veggies!
