Little Goat Diner////I hosted a work event at the bar area of LGD and the process was fairly painless from booking to the event execution. I worked with a party coordinator and all of the contracts and details were available to sign online. (easy) There was sufficient communication leading up to the event and also prompt responses from my liaison.
