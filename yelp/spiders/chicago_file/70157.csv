Little Goat Diner////Since I was overwhelmed with the selection, I asked my server to bring me what he thought I should have. I tried this at the sister restaurant to phenomenal results. And I was smart to do so. The server brought me something I would not have ordered: Pork shoulder, in a broth. It was amazing. I complimented that with a glass of wine from the limited by the glass wine menu. My companion ordered the goat burger, which was well seasoned and perfectly cooked. Our sampling experience was limited to those items, plus the smoked house fries, that sounded more special than they actually were.
