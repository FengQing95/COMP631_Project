Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We also witnessed an expertly handled customer situation that could have gone quite wrong! The table behind us had two people, one of which had passed out in the booth (a little too much St. Paddy's celebrating). The staff expertly dealt with this and got the person up and home to safety. Good job
