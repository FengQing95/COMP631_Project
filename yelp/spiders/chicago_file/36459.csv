Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I almost have no words. My boyfriend surprised me earlier this summer for my birthday with a dinner at Bavette's and it was truthfully the perfect evening. We started with drinks in the basement on the couch and I selected what would be my drink for the night- whiskey sours. Yum! They were perfectly frothy. We headed to our table when it was ready and ordered the steak tartare, oysters, filet mignon and some sides that I can't remember. All I know is that- it was truly wonderful!
