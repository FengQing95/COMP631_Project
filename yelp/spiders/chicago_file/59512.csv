Smoque BBQ////The sauce is really where I wish this place exceeded itself. The thin and vinegary sauce is ok, but it's not great or grand. I had high hopes for the thicker sauce but it tastes like BBQ ketchup. And so I suffer, destroyed by my unfulfilled BBQ-cravings. It's good on french fries, though. I'll give 'em that.
