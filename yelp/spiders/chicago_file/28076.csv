Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I sat at the bar and not only did I enjoy a couple of local Chicago brews, but I took the bartender's suggestion and ordered some garlic bread to tide me over until my pizza was cooked. It does take a bit to cook deep dish, I think I waited about 40 minutes, but it was worth it.
