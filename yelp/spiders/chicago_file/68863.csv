Little Goat Diner////Really great first experience. Favorites from dinner: Sloppy Goat sandwich, Broccoli and Cheese Puff, Los Drowned sandwich (braised beef, avocado, pickled red onions, pickles, spicy mayo, hoagie). The sandwiches were much larger than I had anticipated (a great thing!). The Mac & Cheese was good but not transcendent. I'd skip this in favor of trying something else. The Fried Pickles and Onions served with ranch and curry mayo had a great batter and were perfectly fried. Tasty. The Kimchee, Bacon, Egg, Pancake 'Tasty Thingy' was also great. I'm not a beer drinker, but I really liked the Girl and the Goatee beer which our server said was made with cider and apple peels. No reservations. The menu is really diverse and should please anyone. Can't wait to try other dishes and buy some of Chef Izard's breads from the bakery. Highly recommend!
