Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////And here the fabulous treatment continued.  Our server, Brendon, was also great- quick with suggestions and helping my picky friend find something that she would eat.  But then he cinched the deal for me by bringing a basket of bread.  Not just any kind of bread but freshly made bread (made on premise) with thick crust and warm, chewy centers, the way all bread should be.  And when you slather it with the soft butter, it was a comfort fest for my mouth!
