Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm not really into the tapas.  I never seem to get full and the restaurant's usually seem to be overpriced.  I had been to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba a few years ago and was not a huge fan.  This last trip a couple of weeks ago was better.  I really enjoyed the steak and blue cheese, the spicy potatoes, some of the seafood dishes and definitely the sangria.  I would say this is one of the top tapas restaurant's along with twist.
