Little Goat Diner////My friend and I had a 30 minute wait which wasn't that bad for a weekday in the summer. We sat outside on a bench talking and before we knew it we were getting called to come be seated. Since it was such a nice night we elected to sit outside. Our server was awesome (I wish I could recall his name). He was funny, personable, gave me a detail rundown of the menu and even gave me a milkshake on him as a treat for this being my first time there. I love milkshakes and I love them more when they are FREE.
