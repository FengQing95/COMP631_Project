Little Goat Diner////You could put a leash on a stick and walk it around the block at a brisk pace and I would more likely believe it was a dog than this dish was mole.  What arrived was Chocolate Fish with Pico.  Ingredients:. Fish with skin on it, a milk chocolate flood, diced tomatoes, a nice coating of onions and mushrooms. There was so much milk chocolate on this poor fish. I don't understand why someone would put that much chocolate on a fish. That's not how mole happens.  Price tag: $23
