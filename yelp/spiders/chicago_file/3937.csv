The Purple Pig////We celebrated 4th of July in Chicago. Tried this restaurant recommended by my chef son. Their menu are very interesting. We ordered couple from the menu to try. It was a nice experience. The staff and manager are very accommodating. They welcomed us knowing that we are from Las Vegas and came to try their food.
