Little Goat Diner////Joseph, this review is amazing! It's wonderful to see such thorough tasting notes and to hear just how much you enjoyed each dish you ordered. We're smiling from ear to ear hearing that you would return just for the hash browns! We will share all of your detailed feedback with our kitchen staff and they'll be glad to hear just how much you enjoyed the flavors. We're so happy to hear that you'd bring a date to Little Goat and family as well! Thank you for brunching with us and we hope we'll have the chance to serve you again soon!
