Smoque BBQ////The sausage was good also not dry. Had a kick to it at the end. The beans we're good. They I believe we're cooked in the Carolina Bbq sauce or something that resembles it? It had a kick to it as well but had big chunks of pork or beef in the beans. I believe pork but I couldn't tell because i was almost finished already with my food lol!!
