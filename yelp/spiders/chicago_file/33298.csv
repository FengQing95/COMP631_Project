Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's had a great atmosphere and vibe coupled with fantastic food. This is really a tucked away gem. I would recommend hanging out at the bars where you still get full food service. Make sure you check out the awesome cave below as well. And don't skip out on getting a side of corn.
