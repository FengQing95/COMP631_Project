Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The love I have for Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is so real. I am all about trying new places, but for me it's not a trip to Chicago without a visit to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! I love meeting friends here because there is nothing quite as magical as sharing delicious tapas and pitchers of sangria with your pals. Their red sangria is my favorite that I've had in the US, and every tapa I've tried, I loved!
