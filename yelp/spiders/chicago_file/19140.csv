Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They tell us we have an hour to hour half wait on Friday night for a party of 8? Expected. Waiting longer than 2 hours and then having them tell us that they're just busy is fantastic customer service. Oh but wait we can sit SEPARATELY after waiting that long? Wow what a wonderful idea.
