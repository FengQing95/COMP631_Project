The Purple Pig////Went here for my birthday and it made for a delicious meal! Not too expensive for the quality, service and presentation (about $33) but definitely a splurge for a student like myself. We got the calamari, the beets, the meatballs and the pork shoulder. The calamari was unconventional and fresh - a variety of textures and flavors! The beets were BEAUTIFUL. I loved the contrast between the smooth pistachio butter and the chopped nuts. The meatballs were alright. A bit small, bland and dry in my opinion. The pork shoulder was so soft and tender. It pulled apart with a fork and was delicious with the creamy potato mixture. For dessert we got some sort of chocolate pear dessert. It had ice cream that tasted EXACTLY like fresh pear and a hard chocolate shell, on top of a spongy and strange textured cake slice.
