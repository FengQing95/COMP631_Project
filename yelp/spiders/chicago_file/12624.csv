Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Happy with my first LM experience.  Well priced delivery at 11pm for arrival around midnight on a weekday, good times.  Ordered the "Lou", added sausage.  The sausage isn't crumbled, it's more like slabs of large pieces which I found too much.  It overwhelms each bite.  However the veggies were excellent, the tomatoes were very sweet and fresh.  Need to mention the "small" is VERY small, it's 4 normal pieces but underwhelms the eye.  No leftovers for two on that size so next time I'd get the medium for two.  Happy but need to tweak the order for next time.
