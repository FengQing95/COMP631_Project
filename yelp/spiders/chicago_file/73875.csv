Little Goat Diner////We ate a late breakfast here on a Friday around 11am. There was a significant wait since we didn't have a reservation but there were seats open on the bar side and a full menu is available there. My husband and I both ordered a breakfast - me, traditional eggs and bacon and him, biscuits and gravy. We also ordered the hash browns, which we shared...and still did not eat all of what was served! Nothing spectacular about our meals, but we were being conservative in our choices. Service was very good. Now, let's talk about the cinnamon rolls! Literally, the best I've ever had. Warm, gooey center with plenty of icing but it was not overwhelmingly sweet. It was just right! SO GOOD! Even my hubby agreed and he's not a big sweets person at all. The prices were reasonable for a big city joint. We spent less than $50, including the tip.
