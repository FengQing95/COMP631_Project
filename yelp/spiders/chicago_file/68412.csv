Little Goat Diner////We were seated promptly even though half of our party was still not there yet and our waiter was excellent and patient. The service is fantastic! We were lucky and got there at a lull on a Sunday morning so no wait for a table! It was a great experience, I ordered the omelet of the day which was barbecue pulled pork with an onion cream cheese which was excellent and huge. The coffee is great although I do wish they offered a dark roast as their house coffee is a light roast but that's just a detail. Our food was gotten out to us quickly even though the place was filled to the rafters by the time we ordered.
