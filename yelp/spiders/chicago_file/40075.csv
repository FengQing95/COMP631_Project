Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We all got a 6-10 oz. filet - and they were very good. Cooked to perfection (medium is the only way, grow up if you order your steak any more cooked), and while they say a good steak shouldn't need any sauce, I did find the creamy sauce they provided very tasty. It didn't ruin the integrity of my steak.
