Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I understand how I could be perceived, but this guy was just an ass with a bad attitude.  We love the pizza so much I stopped the next day to pickup a frozen one to take back to Michigan.  I was hoping to see my greeter friend, but my wife was glad he was not there.  OK, I feel better now...
