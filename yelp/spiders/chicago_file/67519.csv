Little Goat Diner////The parathas burrito had a lovely texture. Each layer had a distinct flavor that aligned with each other layer. I preferred to add the hot sauces, and these homemade hot sauces made it bombastic. By the way, these aren't sauces with lingering painful spiciness. They were made with carefully-chosen combinations of fruits and peppers.
