Little Goat Diner////Have been here several times and it never disappoints.  I particularly love the goat chili with pizza puffs polished off by a cheeze-it sundae.  But really, I've had several things and sampled off the plates of my dining companions (sometimes without asking when they were distracted).  There's not a bad choice to be had.
