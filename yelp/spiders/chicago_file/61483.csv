Smoque BBQ////The rib meat, combined with fresh french fries, rich baked beans, and that incredible cool crunchy vinegary fresh coleslaw is one of my favorite food experiences. If anyone requests a Chicago restaurant recommendation, usually Smoque ends up being one of my top recommendations. Prices are fair, maybe a little high. You may want to consider that after dining in the restaurant you can sometimes end up leaving with your clothes smelling a bit like the smoque restaurant...
