The Purple Pig////Fantastic flavors! Every single dish was mouth watering. We lucked out and did not have to wait- we were sat right away. Service was good, our waiter made some great recommendations. We started with a cheese board, which was delicious. We were able to custom choose various cheeses. Of course wine selection was wonderful too. We licked our plates clean.
