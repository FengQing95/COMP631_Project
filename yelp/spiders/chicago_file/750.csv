Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////WOW. This place is amazing. While visiting in Chi Town I made it a point to come here. We arrived around 10 a.m. for a party of 2 and the wait was an hour. Tons of people waiting outside. We decided to do takeout since we had to checkout of our hotel in a couple hours. They were extremely quick with takeout orders (15 min wait) and everything was still hot after we got back to our hotel! (About a 20 min walk) I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was SO full of flavor. The breakfast potatoes were also really really good. My bf got eggs, bacon, sausage, and a side of pancakes and he ate every last bite, saying that it was really good and full of flavor. The only negative thing I would say is the revolving door in the front. It takes up so much room and leaves very little room for standing/waiting in the front and makes it very crowded around the hostess stand. Awesome service though, I would definitely go back!
