Smoque BBQ////Got in around 11:45am and was lucky enough to only have to wait in line for about 2 minutes.  The brother ordered the brisket and I ordered the brisket sandwich.  Love the fact that you're able to choose your own side, too!  The brisket itself is possibly the BEST brisket I've tried.  It's ridiculously tender and has a nice enough amount of fat to add amazing flavor.  The BBQ sauce itself is tangy with the perfect touch of sweetness.  The cole slaw is great--it's crunchy and is a nice break from the BBQ...and I don't even LIKE cole slaw!
