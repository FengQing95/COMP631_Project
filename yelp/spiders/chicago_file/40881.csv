Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We love Cafe Ba Ba Reeba!  Probably no better tapas place, especially for the money, in all of Chicago.  We went for brunch this time and as usual everything was top notch.  The stars of the day were the buttermilk waffles with sweet cream and maple syrup, the brick egg crispy crepe and the BACON MAC N' CHEESE.  You really can't go wrong here and the atmosphere is great.
