Smoque BBQ////I can't believe how many times I have been to Smoque but I haven't yet written a review.  Normally this is the type of place I would write-up.  I think this is the best pulled pork in the city.  It's the best I've had so far.  My favorite order is the pulled pork meal with sides of corn bread and peach cobbler.   The price is as good as the taste.  For the same price, you get more food with this meal than with Smoque's competitors.  The only downside to Smoque is the wait.  The line is almost always to the door.  Because of this, I call in my order and pick it up.  You can go to the front of the line to pick up and pay for carry out.  It's much easier that way.  If you want some good pulled pork, Smoque should definitely be on your list.
