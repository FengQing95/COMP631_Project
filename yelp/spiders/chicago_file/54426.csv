Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Perhaps this place is a bit hyped up. Was super excited to go here on date night, once we found out the wait for too long we ended up going to a different Tapas restaurant. But one lazy Sunday afternoon we decided to swing by to see if they have any outdoor seating. We got lucky (they only have 2 tables outside btw). After being challenged with awful attitude on the phone, and in person by a rude hostess we gave it a shot.
