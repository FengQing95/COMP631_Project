Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Do not carry out from here! They have a single line for ordering AND picking up. We ordered and prepaid so we could pick up and bring to hungry out of town guests. Instead, we arrive to see a single line with about 14 people and most ordering! Terrible. We didn't have it delivered so we could run in and pick up.
