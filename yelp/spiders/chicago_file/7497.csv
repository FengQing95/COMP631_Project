Art Institute of Chicago////Last time I checked, the entrance fee was about $10 per, plus coat check fees (no carrying bags in!).  Tuesdays are free days though, so definitely try to hit it then.  The first time I entered the museum for an art history class I ended up spending 3 or 4 hours, partially because I had to write things down, but also partially because it's easy to get lost in.  It's not uncommon to find students sitting around and drawing what they see, and security is pretty lenient about that sort of thing.  It depends on your artistic tastes how much you will enjoy this, but it's one of the big "things" to see when you're in the city so at least visit once.
