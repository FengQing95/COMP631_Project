Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Overall the steak here is easily one of the best in the city, no doubt about that. But I do prefer the environment of Mastros and RPM better. This place is kinda like a speakeasy for steakhouses. One negative is its a one in, one out bathroom, which for place where you are dropping a whole lotta cash I would expect better. But strictly food wise Bavettes its close to the top for sure.
