Smoque BBQ////Yeah, this is the place that was featured on one of Guy Fieri's shows, however, that is not the only reason to try this place out! I flew into ORD and was scooped and schlept to this fantastic place, as it is a great stop on the way back into the city. Super friendly staff, rub vs. a sauce (take it from a Texan, it is solid!) and served i a very stylish and "separate" way! I went with the brisket platter with 2 sides. I look forward to returning on my next trip back to this taste bud tantalizing town!
