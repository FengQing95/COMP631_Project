Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This place is well worth the 1.5 hour wait! Make sure you get the app or be prepared to wait a LONG time for a table. With that said, brunch was delicious!! We got the sizzling skillets and pancakes. Mine was corn beef hash which was not as flavorful as the butcher block skillet, but my pancakes with caramel apples on top were delicious! I deducted one star only because of the crazy wait, but the food and experience were good.
