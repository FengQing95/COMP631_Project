Smoque BBQ////Smoque is as good as it gets.  We just moved to Portage Park from Wicker Park and this will certainly become one of our usual dining spots.  Anything that I've ever had here (been there 2x) has been delectable!  Love the peach cobbler.  I highly recommend it.  Its certainly unique, you order at the front then pick a table and they bring you the food.  One time that we went we decided to forgo dining in because the line was so long, that we phone ordered from the car and picked it up and ate in the car.  Yes, that is how delicious it is.  Highly recommend!
