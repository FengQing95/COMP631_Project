Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Probably the best brunch place in Chicago (that is not somewhat high-end)! The food was amazing. Eggs Benedict, especially the florence one, was wonderful. Their skillets also look tasty, and they come with berry bliss pancakes! Their signature berry bliss waffle was not too sweet and not too soggy, just on point!
