Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Boom! I've seen this place on those tv food shows so many time I felt like I already ate here before I even came to Chicago. Loved the pie - there's the big debate about East Coast thin crust and midWest deep dish, but as far as I'm concerned, why debate? It's like the debate between fresh pasta and dry pasta. They're both awesome when done right! We have Unos in Boston, but please. No comparison. Malnati's crust is so rich and almost buttery, the sauce not too sweet. More sausage than I've ever had on pizza in my life.
