Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My sister, who's a local, got me into Lou Malnati's so when we recently traveled with some friends who were new to Chicago, we had to bring them here.  I heard this location was popular so we ended up coming after 8PM on a Thursday.  Wait time was about 40 minutes so it wasn't too bad.  At least you can put in your pizza order while you wait.
