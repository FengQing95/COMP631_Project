Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Delicious and authentic tapas restaurant in Lincoln Park. The selection was what you'd expect at a tapas restaurant and each dish did not disappoint. The stuffed mushrooms and scallops were a favourite. The short rib was the least favourite. Sangria was delicious. The restaurant is loud and crowded so definitely not a date night spot. Reservations are tough but was able to reserve a spot through Open Table! It can be a bit pricey but not any different from the average tapas dinner. All in all, was very impressed and would recommend to others in the Chicago/Lincoln Park area!
