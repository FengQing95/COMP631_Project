Smoque BBQ////Out of all the barbecue places that I've ate at in Chicago I would say that Smoque has the most consistent quality of smoked meats. And they have the best balance of delicious sauce and delicious meat. The only time they've let me down with the very tough St. Louis ribs. But that only happened once, so it's not a huge concern.
