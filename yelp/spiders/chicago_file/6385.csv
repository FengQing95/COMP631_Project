The Purple Pig////Wanted to try here due to the popularity and reviews. Made reservations two weeks in advance. The service was good and the food was good as well. Tapas style plates that can be shared. The portions are huge! We only had three items and one drink each. We were too full for dessert. My favorite was the roasted beets with whipped goat cheese, and pistachio nuts with a peanut butter smear! What a combination of flavors! Next was the octopus it was grilled to perfection, the salsa verde accompaniment was ok with the potatoes, asparagus, and green beans. The crispy pig ears was my least favorite. It was ok.. the fried ear pieces were like onion ring pieces and I did not enjoy it as much as I was hoping. I really wanted to try some other items but was stuffed! Would definitely return here to try some of the other items if I'm in town.
