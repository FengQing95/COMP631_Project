Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////funny lil diddy about ba-ba...it was one of the only places i could drink at when i was 18 and went to columbia college (for only a semester). my friend was a fellow spaniard and wanted to treat me to some tapas (circa 2000). we sat in the bar area, ordered some sangria first (drinks first when you're 18, of course) and then some tapas to wash the sangria down with. i remember it being pretty good...but i more so remember the sangria...
