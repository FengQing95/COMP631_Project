Smoque BBQ////Love this place! Have tried the pulled pork, baby back ribs and the chopped brisket.  They are all delicious, my personal favorite probably the pulled pork.  The sauces also fit well with each dish.  The french fries as a side are crispy and delicious.  The peach cobbler also very tasty.  If you are going with a few people best to each get something different and share with each other to get a little bit of everything!!!
