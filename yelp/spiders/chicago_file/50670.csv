Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The paella came out last of the food. It was warm and a flavor explosion. The rice was divine, and it had chicken pieces and green pepper in it. At this point I was pretty full, so I ate the chicken and green peppers out of it with some of the rice. I had a lot left over, but whatever! Still glad I ordered it.
