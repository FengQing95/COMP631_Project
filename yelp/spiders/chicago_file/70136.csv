Little Goat Diner////the price is almost comparable to diners. entree is about the same price with way Â better quality ingredients! the difference is their entree didn't come with sides. Their sides are $7 -$12 but there are a lot interesting side options e.g. crab dip and a lot more. we had fried pickle and they were great.
