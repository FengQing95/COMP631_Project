Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////My husband and I were in Chicago for about a week, and thankfully the hotel front desk advised us that Wildberry was within walking distance on the second day when we asked for a place that could serve us better than the hotel's disappointing breakfast fare. We went back basically every morning after that. It's a bit busy, sure, but that's because the food is so amazing! Everything is so fresh and delicious, it really can't be beat. If I ever go back to Chicago, half of the reason will be to eat at Wildberry again.
