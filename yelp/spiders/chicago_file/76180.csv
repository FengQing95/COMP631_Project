Little Goat Diner////Absolutely love LG! I am a big fan of their brunch menu! Everything is fantastic! Service is always great. One think I love is their separate Gluten Free Menu which really helps me feel less awkward about bringing up my allergy. I'm all about their sandwiches on the Masa chips! Â And what is brunch without a cocktail... or three!
