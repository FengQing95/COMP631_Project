Smoque BBQ////The smoke flavor in the meat was fantastic, strong yet subtle, flavorful yet not overpowering.  The ribs had a real nice rub on them that stood up alone and the bbq sauce was just a nice accent to the meat.  They were not fall of the bone tender yet they were very tender.  I actually prefer my q to have a little chew to it so I enjoyed the ribs that way.  The brisket once again had great smoke flavor and was fall apart tender and super flavorful.  My only complaint about the brisket which is just matter of taste is I thought it was a little too fall apart tender, I do prefer to have a little more texture to my meat.  But nonetheless it was great.  The sausages were good but nothing to write home about.
