Smoque BBQ////I take the El to Irving Park station.  I exit the train and realize I'm in the mIddle of an expressway.  This a long way from my centrally located Miracle Mile hotel, and it better be good.  And, after figuring out how to get off the major arterial road, lo and behold, I find this place.  It smells good.  I enter and annoy the hell out of the greeter, asking him way too many questions about what type of BBQ'd meats and sides I should order.  He graciously answers all of my questions, rather than giving in to his natural impulses to request that I leave and never ever return again.   I go up to counter, and order everything he advised.   The counter girl looks at me in admiration, unaware that I had mined all my knowledge from the greeter.  That admiration fades as I request every type of BBQ sauce available.  Her and the greeter exchange knowing glances, but continue to smile and pretend I am not annoying them greatly.  It's that impeccable midwestern charm.
