Little Goat Diner////I highly recommend the Bulls Eye French Toast during brunch. I was starving on a Saturday morning and obviously not everywhere is open in the west loop, but this one was! The waitress recommend this to me and it turned out to be the most creative French Toast I have ever had: imagine crispy fried chicken bites on top of soft maple-soaked french toast! I can't wait to going there a second time.
