Little Goat Diner////Stephanie done did it again!  You go girl!!!  This place is A to the M to the A to the Z....to the ING!!!!  It's well worth the wait - because yeah, you're going to have to wait an average of 1 hour.  The menu is soooo delicious - it's not the healthiest since it's more of a diner place.  Their meats and produce are all locally produced by nearby farms - Slagel Farms is their big supplier - which is AWESOME!  Happy cows = happy me.  Their coffee is some Portland roasters - also very sustainable/organic, etc. but not too tasty (very dark roast, like sbux, but some might like that) - I'm a diehard fan of Intelligentsia, sigh.
