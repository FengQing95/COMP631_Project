Smoque BBQ////Regardless of what some Chicago food critics may say about the brisket here, it's nothing like Texas brisket. The main problem as I see it is that they are using an electric smoker and it just doesn't impart the fragrance or texture of a smoker that gets it's heat from a wood source. I honestly feel like they should create another category called electricue to describe what those things produce. The brisket is juicy but frankly I find it to be a little bland and not quite crusty enough on the outside. I like mine fattier too but I realize that may be more subjective. The ribs were good, very good. The beans were sweet, tangy and delicious. The mac and cheese was kind of clotted but the taste was OK.
