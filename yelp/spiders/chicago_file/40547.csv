Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The drinks are meh, the food is so-so, the service is pretty decent, and there is a great dive bar called The Shamrock Club (which I recommend drinking at before and after you waste time and money at Bav's). The absolute worse thing about the experience is having to pay $10 for the right to spend $673.44 there. You are only allowed to make reservations on Resy, and they charge $2.50 per person, and it isn't a deposit that goes toward your meal either. This is a load of mukarkey.
