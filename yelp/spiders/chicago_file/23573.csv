Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The meal was actually the perfect amount of food, so I'm glad we got the lunch special.  Plus, this restaurant had a sports theme with memorabilia decorating the walls, and our booth had Magic Johnson's jersey framed above us.  It's like that spot was meant just for me--L.A. girl!  Go Lakers!  Haha.  The perfect setting for some yummy food.  :)
