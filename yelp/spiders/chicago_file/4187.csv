The Purple Pig////Definitely worth every penny! Came here with another foodie friend couple of ours and ordered practically everything (and every drink) on the menu! The Aragon Sour and the Pisco Stu were my favorites...ruch classics with a twist. You've gotta get a charcuterie and cheese board here, as the selection is amazing. The wine list was INSANE...you need to make sure like, 50% of your budget is allocated towards drinks. Ricotta gnocchi and smoked pork tongue were to die for. We gorged ourselves and luckily still had room for dessert and it didn't disappoint.
