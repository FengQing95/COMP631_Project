Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went for brunch a few weekends back and totally fell in love. We order a ton of tapas plates but I was totally obsessed with the Nutella and banana waffle. I've dreamt about it ever sense. We called ahead and got seated right when we sat down so I definitely advise that. When we told our waitress that it was our first time she gave us the most delightful truffle dessert on the house. Overall I left full and happy. You should for sure stop by.
