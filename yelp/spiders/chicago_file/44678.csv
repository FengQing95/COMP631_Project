Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tapas were amazing. Filling, interesting and very tasty. We both loved them! We also ordered a Paella and it too was real good. Just as good as the ones I had in Valencia and Alicante when I holidayed in Spain 3 years ago! On top of it it was served real fast, even under the 30 mins expected time (per the menu), and that was with a full restaurant!
