Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Been here a few times. My favorite would be the classic chicago deep dish pizza. Plain awesome. If you are cheese lovers, they have plenty of cheese in this pizza. The caesar salad and calamari are also good, should order it for appetizer. Warning, the size is large (at least for me).
