Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We ordered the Chicago Cut Classic Ribeye and the Lamb Chops, both ordered at 'medium-rare-plus' as suggested by some other reviewers, for them to be cooked a little more than medium-rare but not quite medium. They were cooked perfectly. However, my fianc√© thought his steak was choice beef instead of prime because it was rather lean.
