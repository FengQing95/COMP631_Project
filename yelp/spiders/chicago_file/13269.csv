Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chicago Style or NY Style? 100% NY Style. I felt Original Classic was too big and cheesy. Pizza got Cold fast. It was hard to cut with forks and knives. Service was good. You need to call ahead to order or you will be waiting for an hour to get food. Best part of the dining was Stuffed Spinach Bread. Tasty! Nice decor and very upbeat place. Not fond of deep dish pizza.
