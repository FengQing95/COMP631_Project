The Purple Pig////While its been well over a year that I visited I still remember fondly the focused and delicious food coming out of this kitchen.  The service was on point despite the fact that they were super busy (as is often the case I have been told) - this shows great attention to customers.  The food was so incredibly satisfying and even over a year out I can remember enjoying the sardines on toast (I believe its still on the menu...I sure hope so).
