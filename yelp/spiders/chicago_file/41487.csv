Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Babareeba is probably one of the most talked up taparias in the chicago area. The food here is really good, but like any other tapas joint you'll want to get about 2-3 plates a person. I recommend the escargot, braised shortrib, and the scallops with couscous. The only issue I had was the wait which was a bit longer than I had anticipated. Everything else on the menu is pretty standard, you cannot go wrong with the queso de cabra and the tortilla espanola. The desserts however were sub par in my opinion. I've a lot of flan before and theirs wasn't as great as I had expected it to be. The chocolate cake wasn't a favorite either. All in all, I would do ba-ba again. It's definitely a safe one.
