Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The BEST part of Babareeba was the bill. For a table of seven that ordered two pitchers of sangria and three rounds of tapas, our Subtotal was $19 per person!!!! One of our part even had a $10 off coupon. Â Its definitely worth the wait to be promised such a fun, festive, and filling evening. I just love this place!
