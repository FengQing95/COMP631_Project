Art Institute of Chicago////Beautiful on the inside and outside - Â I especially enjoyed the impressionist exhibit with the various Van Goghs and Monets. Also highly encourage the use of the audio guide - very informative and hits on the key pieces within the exhibits that are displayed. Loved the Medieval section as well with the distinct furniture and armor. Very pro-American in the Folk section. There is so much stuff in here I could spend several days looking at everything. Alas tourists only have so much time.
