Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////i love this place!  this is the first place i have ever had tapas and it was such a fun and tasty experience.  i love the whole sharing thing...maybe it is because i'm from a large italian family, and we share everything, but who knows?  also, the sangria....so delicious!  i love the fruit bits that they put in there, and how it tastes more like a good sangria drink rather than red wine with a splash of fruitiness
