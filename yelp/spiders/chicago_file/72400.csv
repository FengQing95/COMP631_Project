Little Goat Diner////The service is impeccable. It's quick, the servers know the menus and make recommendations based on feedback from the customers. The team helps one another so if, for instance, you drop your fork on the floor, whoever is passing by will get you a clean fork. In other words, it's a well-managed restaurant.
