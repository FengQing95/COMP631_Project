Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The best restaurant that Lettuce Entertain You has to offer.  They have the best tapas in the city (especially their potato salad) and their sangria is to die for.  This place is great for small birthday parties and such.  If you have a group of people coming, make sure to call ahead and have all of your guests arrive on time!  Get there early as I have been there many, many times and there is always a wait.
