Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The only con to this whole trip was that the service was pretty slow, expect to spend about 2-3 hours at the restaurant for a few courses. Â Also the issue with the butter, but I have a feeling this was a fluke. Once the food arrived, everything was great. I will definitely be back, and recommend avoiding the stress and booking a reservation 2-3 weeks in advance!
