Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We walked by on both a Saturday and a Sunday morning after 9am both days and the wait was 90 minutes.  When we saw the crowds ready to wait an hour and a half for a breakfast, we knew we just HAD to go.  So, on Monday we finally made our move, and found success.  On weekends, we learned, you need to arrive around 8am if you don't want to wait.  We really enjoyed it, our waitress was lovely, and the food was really good.  The menu is overwhelming, so I'd recommend getting a savory dish and upgrading pancakes to one of the very decadent offerings.  This is what I did.  I got two scrambled eggs with toast and fruit, and my upgrade was to also include the Wildberry Bliss pancakes.  This plan was best for me.  The Wildberry Bliss was two decent sized but not huge pancakes, with marscapone cheese between them and all covered with berries and some kind of vanilla creme drizzle.  Sooo good.  People are commenting on the Intellegensia coffee, but I found the coffee to be a little "meh".  We'd definitely go back here next time we're in Chicago.
