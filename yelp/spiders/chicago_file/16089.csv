Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due are both close contenders of Lou Malnati's, but the light authenticity of this pizza extends Italian cuisine a little farther than all the other parlors in Chicago. Lou's crust can challenge Italy's creme de la creme any day. However, the appetizers, including the garlic bread, are just satisfactory, and the desserts could just be removed from the menu.
