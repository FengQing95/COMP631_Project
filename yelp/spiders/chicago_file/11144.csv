Art Institute of Chicago////My favorite parts were seeing all the famous paintings that I had seen in books and on TV in person. They had a ton of Warhols and Picasso's but also some by Rembrant, Van Gogh, O'Keefe, Mondrian, Matisse, Dali, Magritte, Lichtenstein, Jasper Johns, Cezanne, Monet, Renior, etc. SO many famous paintings are here that I have grown up looking at in books my entire life that I was STOKED to finally see them in person.
