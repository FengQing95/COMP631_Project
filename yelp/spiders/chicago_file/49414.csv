Smoque BBQ////The place is an in and out kind of place. There are places to sit and they have a parking area in the back but the environment is a rushed and do what you got to do environment. The food comes out on lunch tray looking trays. It has a authentic bbq place feel. They give free water which is more than I can say about other Chicago places.
