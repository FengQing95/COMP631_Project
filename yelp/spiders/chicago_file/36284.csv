Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It was crowded on that Friday night, and perhaps that played a role. Bavette's may want to adopt the approach its next-door-neighbor has and have the host escort people downstairs ONLY IF THERE IS SEATING AVAILABLE, as well put less tables down there. It was crowded that night, which may have contributed to the "I wish I was elsewhere or even perhaps dead" vibe the bar staff was giving off and the rushed nature of the kitchen staff.
