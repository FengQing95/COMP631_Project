Art Institute of Chicago////I had a wonderful time visiting the Art Institute yesterday! It's always so much fun seeing my favorite paintings on display there, in addition to appreciating some classic Hollywood history there. It's a delight to have so many beautiful pieces exhibited in the same lovely building. Moreover, I enjoy being moved by different works of art. Seeing prints and pictures of these pieces online just isn't the same.
