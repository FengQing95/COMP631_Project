Smoque BBQ////The place does get pretty crowded, but their ordering/seating method works and is very organized. There was someone always walking around clearing tables of trays and then cleaning the table for the next guests. They also provide ample wet-naps to wipe away the sticky mess that is all over your fingers...and possibly face?
