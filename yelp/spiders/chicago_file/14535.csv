Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is no joke. Sometimes all the hyped up places do not pan out. First and foremost I got the house salad with house dressing. Dressing was so good I ate the red onions I usually cannot stand. I waited 35 minutes for the personal pan butter crust pizza. I got the Maloney special that comes with the house sausage. Amazing pizza!
