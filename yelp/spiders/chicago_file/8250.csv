Art Institute of Chicago////The endless hallways, rooms, etc...of various types of art is always welcomed with open arms.  The only problem?!?  It would take me three days to enjoy the entire museuem.  There is so much stimulation, I have a difficult time deciding on what I want to see when I arrive.
