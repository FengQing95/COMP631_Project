Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered a handful of tapas and shared them family-style (fittingly). I'm not sure I remember everything we got, but I'll comment on what I remember. Braised lamb was okay, kind of bland. Spicy potatoes were flavorful and aioli was light and complementary. Beef empanada... I've had better. The crust was kinda light and the beef wasn't that amazing. Ham and chicken croquetas were perfectly fried and pretty delicious. I know we ordered more, but that's all I really remember eating, but in all it was pretty good overall. Service was really quick, maybe 5-10 minutes after we ordered.
