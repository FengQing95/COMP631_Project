Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is getting a lot of press but frankly, the place is overpriced with a 'wannabe' atmosphere so dark that most tables pull out their smartphone to read the menu.  The Duck and Goat cheese Terrine appetizer was very tasty and enough to share.  The Steak Fritte ($28) was the best of the meals we ordered and it came with a generous portion of frittes.  The disappointment was the $65 bone-in dry aged prime NY strip.  It was fairly tender with a mild beef taste but short of the capability of this cut; a half order of Roasted Bone Marrow ($8) was slightly underdone but very tasty.  The steak came 'naked' with no fries, veggies or salad to at least justify the price.  Service was pleasant, unobtrusive and attentive.  All and all, there are better prime houses to consider.
