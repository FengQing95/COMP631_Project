Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was ok, but not fabulous. The paella was marginal. The variety of tapas we ordered were fine. If I were in my home town, this would have been fine. But with all the choices in Chicago, I don't see any reason to go. If you do, be sure to download the app Lettuce Eats. You can earn points from your meal. They also own Joes. We used the app, the night before at Joes. The first time you visit one of the restaurants you get to "spin" to win on the app and we had our points tripled from Joes. This gave us $100 odd at Ba Ba Reba.
