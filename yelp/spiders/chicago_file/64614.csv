Smoque BBQ////We sat and proceeded to devour our meal like rabid hyenas. I couldn't finish my platter so my husband took over. He had a hard time finishing as well. The brisket was so tender, so juicy, so succulent, so sexy! We sat there drinking the last of our beer while he stood, raised his beer and declared Smoque, the best brisket in Chicago. I stood and concurred. Everyone cheered and clapped. In one swift movement, he swooped me up into his arms and Â we exited and walked down Pulaski with BBQ sauce on our faces.
