The Purple Pig////I had the "Our Purple Pig" Pilsner on draft. They seem to be mostly wine focused, and their list is huge. I tried the roasted bone marrow, which came with some really good toast and a mostly parsley salad and coarse salt. Rich and decadent just like bone marrow should be. Then I told Ryan I wanted to finish off with something light and refreshing, and he immediately recommended the Caprese salad. This salad is awesome, and I liked all three main ingredients equally. The fresh buffalo mozzarella was perfect, the heirloom cherry tomatoes flavorful, and the charred onion vinaigrette zingy and great.
