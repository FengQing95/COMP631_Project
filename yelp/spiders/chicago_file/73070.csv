Little Goat Diner////The host was super nice and seated us in a booth which we were very thankful for. Our server was also super nice throughout the entire experience. Her outfit was super cute - diner chic purple with a little goat on the top. Loved it! I was obsessed with the music playing which was all 90s music and a lot of good 90s rap - I Get Around from Tupac played which had me boppin' in my seat!
