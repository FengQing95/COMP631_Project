Art Institute of Chicago////Even 2nd tier museums in San Francisco such as the De Young and Legion of Honor are better than this lousy place. All of the notable museums in NYC (Metropolitan, MOMA, Whitney, Guggenheim, etc.) have the depth and quality to easily make this "Art Institute" look whimpy like the character in Popeye.
