Little Goat Diner////For our meals we decided to share an entree and a salad between the two of us. My husband picked the Shrimp and Pork Belly entree and I tried the GoatoGoato salad. The salad was big and ingredients nice and crunchy fresh. I tasted mint and fennel although the server described the dressing as being an Asian flavor. I couldn't find any cheese but had hoped with the name there may be some goat cheese (?) or cream.
