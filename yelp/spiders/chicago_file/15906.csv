Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Soooo, onto the 5-star part of the review.  The deep-dish pizza?  Nothing short of the best pizza I've have had.  At first bite, I thought it was too much tomato sauce, but after I took a few more bites, the crust came into play and complimented the sauce perfectly.  Seriously, I know Chicago deep-dish pizza is popular and all, but damn, THIS IS SOME GOOD A** PIZZA!  Too keep this review from running too long, just do yourself a favor and put this restaurant in your itinerary if you ever are in Chicago!
