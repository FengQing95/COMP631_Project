Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Incredible, top 10 meal I've had in my life.  The lyonnaise salad has a great, almost smokey dressing.  Filet was super tender and meltly in your mouthy, served with a decadent bernaise sauce.  I tried four sides - Mac, mashed, mushrooms and creamed spinach - all amazing, all super rich, each bite so flavorful.  Really loved everything about it, can't wait to go again.
