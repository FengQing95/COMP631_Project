Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a Chicago native, Lou's is by far my favorite deep dish around. The Lou deep dish pizza is made with fresh veggies and packed with flavor. We also always order the Malnati salad which is a blend of salty and savory like no other! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but if you haven't tried either of these- they are a MUST!
