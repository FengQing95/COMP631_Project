Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We decided on Bavette's at the last minute while scrolling through yelp at a bar a few blocks away & decided to give it a shot. We arrived at about 6:30 on a Saturday. There was an hour and a half wait, but we're told the bar was first come first served. We checked the downstairs bar & main bar and they were packed! An employee told us there were 2 high top tables at the back of the restaurant that were self seating. We saw one table was on coffee and decided to try to wait it out. In about 10 minutes the table was ours! It was the perfect spot! Nice & quiet away from the busy bar. We shared the wedge, a steak & the truffle Mac. The thick cut bacon on the wedge was amazing! The steak was cooked perfectly & the Mac was rich & flavorful. The bread was also hot & fresh. We will definitely return on our next trip to Chicago!
