Little Goat Diner////We were out late in the West Loop, hungry, and in need of food.  Went to Au Cheval and they couldn't accomodate our group of 7 so we walked on over to Little Goat!  Place is opened late.  This is a plus.  The service was excellent and the place is set like a 50's dinner, at least that's what I get.  The food options were numerous, so a couple of us decided to split some breakfast and dessert.  I was very impressed!  Wished I was even hungrier.
