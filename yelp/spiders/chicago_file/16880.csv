Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The wait was long but it was worth it , we sat at the bar and we ordered the calamari , stuffed bread , mushrooms and spinach deep dish pizza and it was delicious , the bartenders are very attentive and 5 stars to the service . The only reason why I gave 4 stars was that we found a piece of hair on the plate underneath the Lettuce of the calamari after we almost finished . The bartender told us he will take it off but I guess he forgot about it when he gave us the check, it really didn't matter because We did almost finished the calamari and we were very happy to be there .
