Smoque BBQ////The Beans were fair and the Mac and Cheese was standard that you find at more popular restaurants. Everywhere I go the waitstaff usually comments on and highly recommends the mac. Everywhere I go it typically all comes out the same. I mean really folks... its noodles and cheese and only so many combinations of the two.
