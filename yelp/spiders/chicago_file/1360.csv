Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////THE BEST WAFFLES EVER!!!! Food was great, we got the Denver skillets which consists of eggs of your choice, mixed with hash browns, peppers and cheese and got the espa√±ola omelette, everything taste fresh and organic. The strawberries on the waffles are amazingand their homemade berry mix taste great with the toast. Cost effective with the amount of food, overall good ratings and good customer service.
