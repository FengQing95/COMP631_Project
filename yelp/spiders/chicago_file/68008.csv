Little Goat Diner////I actually worked with Stephanie a few times with my job at Le Cordon Bleu. Ironically I never ate at her establishments, but understanding her passion for food I figured it would transfer to her place. I was right, I really love this place the vibe the menu it is very now. If you are a true foodie you won't be disappointed. Expect a wait on the weekends at least 30-45 mins. They have a cool area with a bar, and cafe while you wait that helps. Oh and the text to alert you of your table is a good touch. Highly recommend trying it out.
