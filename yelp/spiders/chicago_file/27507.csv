Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Tough review and rating here. This was a highly suggested place from multiple locals. First thing to know, book ahead! we tried to eat here twice for dinner and it was over 1.5 hour wait, for two people. We finally said screw it and let's go for lunch as soon as they opened. It worked out that way because I believe they opened at 10:30, and with the wait for the pizza, it takes roughly 40-45 mins for the pizza to be prepped and cooked. We ordered the suggested type of pizza that the waitress and I assume most, get. We got it with pepperoni and onions. Probably not the best combo but at home it's normally a good combo. I was not a fan of either topping as the onions were high chunks and the pepperoni was very thick slices. Maybe I'm used to NY style pizza but the pizza just wasn't my style. I don't want to give a poor review for a style of pizza that I know isn't what I enjoy. The sauce was good and the crust was okay. We also ordered the calamari and honestly it was one of the best I've had. The one twist was the sauce. I was not a fan. I was expecting marinara type sauce, and it was cocktail. It wasn't expecting it and would have definitely asked for different sauce had I known. All in all the place was nice, it's big and obviously super busy most of the time they're open. The staff was alert and friendly.
