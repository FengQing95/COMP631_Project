Art Institute of Chicago////I have a bias. The Philadelphia Museum of Art is not only my favorite art museum, it's also my favorite place on the entire planet. That said, I knew going to the Art Institute of Chicago that I was going to be judging harshly since it's arguably one of Philly's primary national rivals for best art museum. And I will say, Chicago has got it going on.
