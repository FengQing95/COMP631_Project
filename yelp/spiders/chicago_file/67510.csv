Little Goat Diner////I was super excited to try this because I like comfort food with a little creativity. The menu is a little overwhelming, but i settled on the fat elvis waffles and wasn't wowed. All of the components were good, but all together it was a little much. the peanut butter butter was way too rich to enjoy, and combined with the waffles just didn't do it for me. I'm definitely not someone who doesn't love sugar, either. I have quite the sweet tooth. I just kind of felt it was over-hyped. Maybe I should've gotten a burger or something? Â I probably wont go back. Also, my soda was flat.
