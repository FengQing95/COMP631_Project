Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Had my first taste last night.  Not a local and still a Chicago deep dish neophyte, I had only had the "other" big name (starts with G) so I was hoping to be impressed.  I was not disappointed.  Service was 10/10.  Wait was long (place is always busy) but with the pie ordered before you were seated, it all worked out.
