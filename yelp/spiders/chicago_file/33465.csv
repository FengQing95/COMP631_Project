Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Nothing could outdo that steak, but the sides were also done with extreme care. The cream spinach was especially rich and delicious. Studded with copious amounts of blue cheese, I thought that it might be too overpowering but it was actually a stroke of genious as the flavors were terrific together. The elote corn was spicy and the squeeze of lime added a nice citrus acidic bite.
