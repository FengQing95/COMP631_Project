Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The crust on this pizza was amazing, deep dish style but light and airy, not heavy like a lot of restaurants do when they are attempting deep dish zas.  The sauce was delectable, and tasted like it was fresh out of the garden.  Most times I have had a deep dish pizza the balance of cheese and sauce is somehow messed up; a hundred quarts of cheese to an ounce of sauce, or overkill on the sauce cause there is already so much cheese.  This was perfection, and truly the best pizza I have ever had, and I have consumed some pizza in my lifetime!
