Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Getting lost in the city of Chicago trying to find this place was definitely worth effort! Rutherford omelette was so good and the cinnamon pancakes - I downed that less than 5 minutes! Yes, that GOOD. If I'm back in Chicago, this will be my breakfast/lunch spot for sure! I'm biased though when I say everything is better in Chicago!
