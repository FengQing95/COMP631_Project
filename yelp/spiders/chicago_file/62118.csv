Smoque BBQ////This is probably one of the best BBQ joints you will find in Chicago, they are located right at the highway I90/I94 exit of N Pulaski Rd. Based on my experience, this place is always packed and a long line of people waiting to order. However, the waiters here work pretty fast and efficiently that you would not have to worry about where to seat.
