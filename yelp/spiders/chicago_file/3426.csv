The Purple Pig////Foodies: Welcome to Chicago. One of everyone's favorite places, so it gets very crowded. With many great menu items, it's easy to understand why people go back again and again. While it skews toward the heavier side, we've found a lot of dishes to help keep it light (the charred octopus is outstanding). At the same time, we enviously gawk at all the delicious-looking bone marrow being served at many of the tables (perhaps go on a temperate day so you can work it off with a walk along the River).
