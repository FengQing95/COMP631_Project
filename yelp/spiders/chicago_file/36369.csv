Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Luckily, I did convince someone to share with me and they were nice enough to cut the steak in half and put them on separate plates. We ordered the mixed green and apple salad which was enough for two to three people to share. It was light and was very yummy. I got the bone marrow as an add-on to the steak. It was flavorful but we would've been better off ordering the appetizer for $16 which comes with three pieces rather than adding one for $8. We finished off dinner with the whiskey ice cream and all smiles.
