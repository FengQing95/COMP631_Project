Little Goat Diner////Lemme get the bad shit outta the way first...the hostess was just not reflective of the rest of the vibe! (was there last Saturday bout 1030pmish) She was the worse ever! Not pleasant, dry, slow...but anyway...the food was amazeballs! I had a burger that was just delicious and a milkshake that rocked my socks off! My dinner date got the mac & cheese...tasty just a bit dry for my liking (no one makes better mac & cheese than me...ijs) Wish they had better deserts options but they change Im guessing but the milkshake was more than enough! Â But I really enjoyed the vibe...great service, the music was the BOMB...just a great late night joint that serves breakfast all day! Most def will be returning....actually this Friday! lol
