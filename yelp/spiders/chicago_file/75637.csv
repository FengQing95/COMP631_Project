Little Goat Diner////I hosted an event at LG this weekend for a baby shower and from the events team, food, service, drinks they killed it on all fronts. The guest of honor had some dietary restrictions which they were incredibly accommodating to as well as some picky eaters which they were able to accommodate as well. Our bartender for the event was proactive to ensure that all guests were comfortable, topped off and I have to say he makes a killer ginger-something-or-other mock-tail. He also was a big help with helping us set up some of the decorations as were the point of contact/day of event manager and the server/cook who did a little magic on our cake topper. This team was amazing and we were a bit of a pain in the ass so I can't thank them enough.
