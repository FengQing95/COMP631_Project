Art Institute of Chicago////What can I add to many perceptive reviews?  Well, we visited Monday morning at opening time and had a minimal wait at the Modern Wing entrance.  We never felt crowded or rushed on any way.  2.5 hours was just enough time to see everything but a true art lover could spend much longer.
