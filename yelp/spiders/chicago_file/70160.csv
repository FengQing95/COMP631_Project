Little Goat Diner////This place is fantastic. Excellent addition to our neighborhood.  I have been here at least 5 times.  My favorite items are the eggs benedict with korean twist, the korean turkey burger and biscuit and gravy.  Everything I have eaten here is fantastic.  Cant wait to continue to explore the extensive menu!
