Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////To start the Sangria was great must have.  Glad I had : chicken empanadas, goat cheese and tomato spread, crochets, the Brussels sprouts slaw, beef and horseradish skewer tasty but they could be more generous  then one skewer . The shrimp with garlic oil is a must too, make sure you use the bread they give you to start to soak up garlic oil for that, make it your first order first and don't let them take it away till it's dry .
