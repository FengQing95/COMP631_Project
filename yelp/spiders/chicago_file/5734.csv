The Purple Pig////O man, this place is delicious. It's tucked away inside of a office or residential building, which is kind of weird. But whatever. A lot of people have docked stars for bad service, rather than issues with the food. But I just wanted to start by saying we had a great server and the wait staff that brought out the food were all super friendly and informative.
