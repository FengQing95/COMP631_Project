Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We chose this restaurant to host our wedding. It was AMAZING. I highly, highly recommend people consider this if they want to throw a great wedding at a reasonable price in the city. Here are just some of the things that made it such a great experience. First, their prices/minimums are sooo much more reasonable than other wedding sites - including no room rental fee (such a waste!). Second, the food is amazing - I was proud that my guests got to have such great food and drinks at my wedding. It was actually the food that first made us choose this place as I've been coming here for many years. Third, the service was exceptional. We had our contact Katie before the wedding who always replied back to us very quickly whenever we had questions or requests. She is so friendly and helpful and the venue was so accommodating - everything I wanted was met (not to say I had anything super crazy - but we brought in our own decorations and cake, they cut the cake for us, we got to choose how/when the food would be served, we were able to adjust their event menu options, etc); they even upgraded our beer options at no additional cost which was a super nice perk. Not only was Katie great but so were all our servers that night. Many people, including myself, noticed how attentive and friendly they were. I was so unbelievably pleased - they made me and my guests feel really special. Last extra bonus - I have a loyalty card with Lettuce Entertain You and I was able to add points from all the food/drink we bought for the event. It's a great extra - the program has lots of rewards but we went simple and got Lettuce Entertain "reward dollars" - we'll be having tons of free meals now!
