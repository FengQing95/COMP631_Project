Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Everything was so amazing. They have 3 types of sangria on tap and I am picky about my sangria (almost always too sweet) but the red sangria was amazing. The service was phenomenal. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive.. I am allergic to dairy and he was very thorough with the kitchen to make sure What I ordered was dairy free or able to be made dairy free. We ordered off the happy hour menu and actual menu and everything we got was delicious. I highly suggest the empanadas, shrimp, calamari and stuffed olives. So disappointed that they are in Chicago and not in Boston so I could eat there all the time!
