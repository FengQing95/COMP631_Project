Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Pretty overrated in my opinion - I'll start with the ambiance, It is a cool restaurant but its HUGE! way bigger than I expected it to be.. The food was very sub-par. I ordered the Brussel sprout salad and it was very boring and dry. I also ordered the salmon which was very plain and the 'roasted veggies' it came with were almost non-existent and drenched in oil. I will say the olive oil they have at the table for the bread is really tasty - probably the highlight of my meal to be honest.
