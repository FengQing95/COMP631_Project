Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the large deep dish deluxe pizza for the 5 of us, and another coworker ordered a sandwich with fries. We also ordered a salad which came pretty quickly. However the pizza and the sandwich took over and hour and 15 mins to come. I know that usually the pizza takes about 30 mins to cook - but over an hour was ridiculous! I was trying to find our waitress to ask about our food, but she was no where to be found. I finally asked another waitress about our food, and about 10 mins later our food finally came. The pizza was unimpressive. It tasted a little undercooked, and it was just basically a big slab of dough, piled with lots of toppings. On top of that - my coworkers fries came out cold. I had to ask another waitress to get hot fries - which the manager actually brought us a new basket of hot fries.
