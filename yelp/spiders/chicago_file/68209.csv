Little Goat Diner////Ate here as my last meal after living in Chicago for 3 years.  I was not disappointed by the food one bit.  I had the goat chili, fried onion rings / pickles, and the fish tostadas.  My wife had the American burger.  All were delicious.  My only qualm -- which is also why I didn't give 5 stars -- is that my "From Peru With Love" (essentially a Pisco Sour) was a bit bland and weak.  It wasn't something I expected for $12.
