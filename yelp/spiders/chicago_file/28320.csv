Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This time wasn't as memorable as the first that left me a bit disappointed. Taste was still good but texture wasn't so great. I'm not sure if it's because we ordered a medium so the baking is uneven.  The crust was almost too crunchy,  there was no cheese pull in the middle because the center wasn't heated up entirely... and I love melty cheese... and was disappointed when there was no pull at all. Pizza wasn't very hot either, hence, no melted cheese. There were some bites near the crust that had the right texture but center was definitely not.
